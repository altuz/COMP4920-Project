,Not Recommended,584400,34595602,Posted: 29 August,all,Sauce Cakeboss,"Thank you Taxman, Headcannon, Pagodawest, Tee Lopes, and everyone involved to make one of the best games to come out this year.♥♥♥♥ you SEGA, for lying about the delay being for ""bug fixes"", not actually telling anybody that the game has Denuvo until they figured it out themselves, and trying to throw your developers under the bus for your decision to put DRM in the game."
,Not Recommended,584400,34583719,Posted: 29 August,all,Miraglyth,"Preface:As has been pointed out in comments for this review, the developers - Christian Whitehead, Headcannon and PagodaWest - are probably not responsible for the game's plaguing issue. From the little I've played and everything I've heard from the console releases, they have done some stellar work which is tragically undermined by some abrasive DRM they seemingly had no say about.---Immediately upon release the game has been found to contain a restrictive anti-consumer measure known as Denuvo. Worse, the End User License Agreement that is required to install the game does NOT mention this. The closest it comes to it is the following section:16. TECHNICAL PROTECTION MEASURESThe technical protection measures of the Product may require you to download certain data to your device in order to authenticate the Product. If you disable or otherwise tamper with the technical protection measures, the Product may not operate properly and you are in material breach of this Agreement.This seems innocent enough, but consider that the predecessor of Denuvo - SecuROM, made by the same group - once managed to permanently break both a new DVD drive and a reasonably new SSD drive of one of my past machines.I am beyond disgusted that this was installed without any warning.Update:Fortunately I pre-ordered the game after the PC version was delayed, avoiding the Sonic 1 ""gift"" that was tied to Mania and broke the refund process. This meant I could wait two weeks to give Sega a chance to remove Denuvo, and refunded the game when they did not.This game should be avoided at all costs until a Denuvo-free installation is offered and independent analysis confirms that it is completely removed. Sega should unreservedly apologise for any distress and all damage this astonishing mistake may cause their most enthusiastic paying customers.Update:Sega have responded to suggest the lack of DRM warning on the store page or EULA was an innocent mistake, which has been strongly questioned. At best it was careless, at worst it was purposefully duplicitous by leaving out a notice that would have prevented many users pre-ordering. Some have even suggested that the two week delay and the Sonic 1 compensation were measures to block refund attempts, but that seems a little too hard to believe for me. Predictably they offered no apologies.One other thing worth mentioning; though it is not responsible for the always-online requirement, Denuvo DOES regularly ""phone home"" an authentication server to allow the game to be played. If that server disappears, the PC version of the game will expire for everyone. Users are rightly complaining that this game is presently not a purchase but a rental of unknown duration.Update 2:Just under 7 days after release, Denuvo has been defeated. This means it confers no benefit to Sega anymore, and its continued use accomplishes absolutely nothing but to punish legitimate customers by occasionally preventing them from being able to use their valid purchase and eventually permanently taking it away from them.Update 3:Steam Spy figures for the game after release week show that the game's total sales FELL for consecutive days once most offended customers were able to process their refunds. Though they have since recovered the total sales by day 9 were still below those of day 3 which is incredible for such a positively-rated game.With the critical launch window over my estimation based on extrapolated sales figures is that using Denuvo has COST this game 15% to 20% of the sales it would have made, which is surely more damaging than first-day piracy would have been."

But if someone tries to force DRM in a place or a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, that's no good!  It's your copy, no one has the right to force you to be online to play if you don't want them to.  So what do you do?  First, you say no.  Then, you get out of it!Seriously, SEGA?  We finally get a good Sonic game in 20+ years and you still manage to screw it up."

Really?I wish i could give this game positive review, it deserves that. But as long as you treat your paying customers like that i won't.Regarding the game itself, it's the best sonic in a decade. It feels like Sonic 3 and heavily relies on reused content from Sonic 2 3 and Knuckles. Some of the remixes are good, other are worse than Genesis originals. I wish this game had more original content, but at the same time that content is mostly a bit worse than remixes."

The game its-self is great, however I cannot reccomend a product that utilises the malware that is Denuvo.Denuvo tanks game performance, ♥♥♥♥s up solid state drives with constant encryption and the worst offense is that it won't allow you to play the game at all if you are offline. SEGA stated that the 2 week delay was for ""performance fixes"", but it's obvious now that they were busy adding DRM to the title.So for potential buyers, now that SEGA is treating its actual customers like theives, I reccomend that you do exactly what the DRM was designed to stop and try and pirate the game. You'll enjoy it just as much and meanwhile you won't be supporting awful business practices."

,Not Recommended,584400,34736328,Posted: 4 September,all,Vox,"Why do companies insist on continuing with this DRM nonsense? It's completely illogical, DRM can be hacked out of the game anyway so it doesn't serve its stated purpose. All it does is bring a backlash of negative reviews from paying customers."
,Not Recommended,584400,34585493,Posted: 29 August,all,TheVividYershi,"Alright. I'm going to give this game a review, but the rating will still be negative, because the game contains Denuvo, an ancient DRM system that causes longer loading times and periodically phones home. It also prevents people like me from running the game we just bought on Linux and Mac, and SEGA even threw their developers under the bus for it.Alright, now on to the positive review. Sonic Mania is quite a breath of fresh air for the Sonic series. Instead of being a direct replica of old zones, it takes the general ideas behind the levels, and expands upon it to create vast zones that alternate between speed and platforming. The levels are filled with paths, and there is lots to explore. The new drop dash is incredibly useful in recovering any lost speed. With lots of paths, especially character-specific ones, this game has an incredible amount of replayability.The bonus and special stages are quite challenging, but that's a good thing. There are plenty of chances to complete the stages, and be rewarded with medals and the Chaos emeralds.Just a note: Fast reflexes help. When I first played the game on the PS4, I couldn't beat the bonus or special stages. They just seemed too fast for me. As soon as I got on the PC, things were much easier, as there was no delay from my wireless controller, capture card, or any number of other things. For this reason, I won't be refunding the game for having previously-unannounced DRM. That said, I wouldn't buy this game on the PC, as Denuvo is said to have caused damage to computers, and many AVs flag the game for containing Denuvo, leaving people (kids especially) with either a $20 label in their games library with no way to play it, or a potentially really expensive paperweight."
,Not Recommended,584400,34706746,Posted: 3 September,all,Ty Browntail,"It's a great game, but play it on any other platform than steam; you get Denuvo from this version, which is a big downside without much of any bonuses to counteract it.EDIT: I'd like to clear up any confusion from earlier; I purchased this copy on launch day largely because of the fact I had enjoyed it greatly on another platform two weeks ago, but used gift cards toward that purchase, largely making it free.  I purchased the steam version for two reasons; portability on my laptop, and for steam community workshop support.  I wasn't aware of denuvo's inclusion for my first two steam playthroughs as I blew through achievements.  I wrote this review after discovering both that there is no plan to add workshop support, and its inclusion of denuvo and the terrible PR surrounding it.  For me, regardless of your opinion on denuvo, if I'd known of it's inclusion or of the lack of mod support I would have preferably picked up the switch version, as it is also portable."

Hopefully Sega learns their lesson with Denuvo after reading through the reviews and once Baldman gets to it in about 12 hours.For now, I'd recommend getting the game on any platform except PC. My original unedited review is below.--As one of the first people to review this masterpiece, I'd love to say what an absolutely fantastic job Taxman, Stealth, and PagodaWest did on Mania. I've already played this game to absolute death on the Switch, but I pre-ordered the PC version months ago, and I'm ready to revisit the game already.Sonic Mania is a true callback to the original quadrilogy of Sonic games on the Genesis, and in my opinion far surpassing them in both quality and gameplay itself. The game feels like it picks up where Sonic and Knuckles left off, with nothing but quality of life improvements everywhere as far as gameplay goes. The level design is a true work of beauty, as is the soundtrack. Both of these things are so great I can't even find the words to describe them, and I won't spoil anything in my review; I'll leave that to you to find out for yourselves.Sonic Mania is one of the only games in the past decade that has lived up to its hype, and thank god it did. This game is a masterpiece, and the only game I think I would ever give a perfect 10/10 to. If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and buy it immediately.And Sega, if you're reading, please collaborate with Christian Whitehead again in the future. You would be wasting his talent if you let him go after this game."

The thing is that it's a bit short, there are only 12 zones (+ the final boss zone), each in 2 acts that can be completed in a few minutes.The graphics are really good, it's designed to look like updated Genesis/Megadrive graphics, with more colors, details and some techniques unavailable on the original hardware like sprite rotation and scaling, all used very well.Some have complained about the presence of 3d graphics in the game, but the thing is that it's really rare and well used, mostly in the chaos emerald stages, which are full 3d.And it's also the king of 3d that a sega 32x could produce and the game was designed to look like a game that could have been released on a console between the Genesis/Megadrive and Saturn.The difficulty curve seems f*cked up, I remeber Flying Battery Zone (zone 4) being much harder than Mirage Saloon Zone (Zone 8) for exemple, it's not consistent at all. Same for the bosses, most of them are really easy but, overall, most of them are really well designed, I can't go into some details because of spoilers but you will have quite some good surprises.The best part of this game, for me, is it's sound track, there is no misuc in the game that I don't like !

,Not Recommended,584400,34587209,Posted: 29 August,all,[TUXEDO] Watson690,"18 days ago we were told the game was being delayed for ""optimisation"". Today we discover that SEGA (the publisher, not the developer) delayed Mania for the implementaion of DRM which prevents offline play (remember that Sonic Mania has no online features besides the time attack leaderboards) and only serves to delay pirates, rather than prevent piracy altogether. Once the DRM is removed I'll be able to recommend you buy this.-EDIT- The offline play issue has been patched as of 2017/08/30. The DRM remains though.-EDIT 2- Denuvo DRM is now being cracked faster and faster, proving that it has absolutely no use whatsoever and is a waste of money for the developers....and yet it remains in Sonic Mania.==========Actual review==========Not a bad game. Easily the best Sonic game since Sonic & Knuckles was released over 20 years ago. The blue sphere game from Sonic 3 makes a return, it now rewards you with silver medals that unlock rewards in a set progression....however once you have collected all 32 medals you no longer have any reason to play these bonus stages any more (unless you really want to of course, they just have no further reward).Stages are mostly well laid out, however I found far too many times that I was just holding ""down"" on my controller and waiting to see when Sonic would stop moving. It was an interesting experience to NOT be playing a game despite the main character moving around so much.5 out of the 13 stages are new, with the other 8 stages being edited versions of their former selves with several throwbacks to Sonic 1, 2, 3, K and CD including level layouts, hazards and badniks. Of the 5 new stages only 4 are full stages, and those stages are each unique in their own special way with even more throwbacks to the original 5 Mega Drive Sonics.Special stages! They take the best part of the Sonic CD special stages and actually make them good. I can't say more without providing spoilers really.& Knuckles. 'nuff said.Bosses: Gone are the days of ""Boss is here, jump at it's center of mass"". The majority of bosses in Mania have gimmicks intended to increase their difficulty such as one boss you fight in an elevator, when the elevator moves up your gravity is increased and vice versa.Overall I'd say this game has too much happening all the time. Either you're magically flying around a stage on a set path just holding ""down"" to maintain ball-form or you're maneuvering through a needlessly complicated maze that requires incredible precision. Many times you are introduced to new game mechanics that last for only one zone before they are forgotten about forever, further reinforcing the feeling of too much happening.Tl;dr - It's not bad, but it's not Sonic 3 & Knuckles. It's seriously overdesigned and strays from the simplicity of the original Mega Drive/Genesis series. It's still fun, but don't expect too much."

Simply install the update and launch the game at least once while on an active internet connection. Tested by setting my laptop into Airplane Mode after installing the patch. However, the Denuvo DRM still is present in this game, and I probably won't change my review until this is fully addressed. I have however revoked my statement on the game being impossible to play offline. I also have no clue if the update would require you to re-verify with Denuvo's servers if you haven't played the game in over a month. Be warned.Absolutely amazing game. Some of the best pixel art I've ever seen in a video game, killer funky soundtrack, physics on par with the original Genesis games, and great varied level design with tons of potential routes and secrets. Even the re-used Zones are an absolute joy since there are a lot of nice surprise picks here and there with really interesting gimmicks that all feel unique. Tons of replay value too with Time Attack Mode and several secrets to unlock, plus two other playable characters to run through the game as. It seriously feels like a rejected 2D Sonic game for the Saturn, complete with some low-poly 3D used in just the right areas.Unfortunately, I do feel as if I'll have to leave a negative review for the Denuvo DRM. It hasn't affected my playthrough, but I don't believe a single player game should come shipped with this since it renders the game unplayable on certain machines. At this point, I very highly doubt the 2 week delay for the PC release was because Sega was actually interested in optimizing the game, but rather to shoehorn this in at the last possible moment. Sega claims they intended for the game to be playable offline, but I also feel that was an oversight on their part with using the Denuvo DRM that they're now trying to backpedal with. I can at least say that the rumors of Denuvo killing your HDD/SDD are absolutely false, thankfully.Some accurate information on why Denuvo shouldn't be supported can be located here:https://whyisdenuvobad.github.io/Overall, the game is absolutely incredible. I'd recommend playing the console releases over the PC release in it's current state since there's no incredibly intrusive DRM in those releases. However, if you're dying to play it, or simply lack a console to play it on, go ahead and give it a shot. I'd highly recommend at least letting Sega of Europe know including this was a bizarre move, however. Hats off to the rest of the team, though!

Your best bet now as damage control would be to just remove Denuvo, because absolutely no one likes Denuvo, SEGA. No one does. It's a scam, basically. Denuvo is a scam that plays on corporate paranoia, and you got scammed, SEGA. I honestly do see some publishers/devs as victims in this, really.I mean, you have to be a pretty successful group of cut-throat sociopaths to market something so useless, so toxic, and so harmful without even a shred of guilt. That's what they've always done. Before Denuvo was Denuvo, it was Starforce, and it absolutely wrecked hardware (just do a web search for 'Starforce pio mode' and you'll see for yourself).Now Starforce has a shiny new name, with a shiny new con. It's a con game. A confidence plot. The kind of game that these people play by building up the mythical boogie man of games piracy in order to sell this digital cancer.

A vain attempt of course as I've been spoiled returning levels and other things that I obviously won't mention here.The game is finally released and guess what ?

Sonic ManiaLemme preface by saying I’ve been playing Sonic games since almost day one.Sonic The Hedgehogon the good ‘ol Mega Drive was the first game lil’ Chimp owned (threw faeces at anyone trying to get close). Played at all the 16-bit classics back in the day, includingSonic CD.Back toSonic Mania, aka The Best of 16-bit Sonic, now with all-new bonus tracks and remixes! Eh, story? Fat pillock Eggman is up to shenanigans. Yadda yadda, Chaos Emeralds, bla bla, Sonikku stop him, and so on. Don’t bloody care, how is it as a game? Well,Maniawas made by Christian Whitehead, PagodaWest Games and Headcannon, big fans known in the community for making romhacks and enhanced ports. Promising, but on to the pros and cons, cuz that’s how we roll.ProsIt absolutely nails the feel and look of 16-bit Sonic like no other since the OGs. The physics are spot on. Same for the colorful sprite work and snappy animation. It’s above the Mega Drive’s capabilities, but not Saturn level either.No bloody gimmicks! No clumsy motion controls, God of War style combat or 50.000 (give or take) gameplay types in 1. Just Sonic, Tails and Knuckles running through loops, jumping and grabbing rings. Pure and simple.A mix of classic Zones and all-new ones. The old ones got expanded and have new tricks up their sleeves. Familiar, yet different, like a good remix. The new blend in almost seamlessly and actually have some series-original themes.Even crummy Sonic usually has good music andManiadelivers. Old tracks are lovingly remastered and got 2nd Act remixes, S3&K style. Likewise, the newcomers bounce with Mega Drive funk.Bosses get their fun twists too. Some are veterans with fresh tricks, others are entirely new. One even has you change genre. It’s not all good tho (more in the negatives)ConsIt’s a short game. Around 2-4 hours for a first playthrough. Multiple routes, time attack and 3 characters add replayability, but a social life-destroying epic it ain’t. Shortness is pretty inherent to 2D Sonic, but still something to consider before deciding to purchase.Maybe a little overly reliant on nostalgia. The level ratio leans heavily towards the old. A more even split between classics and newcomers would’ve been nice.While most bosses are novel and fun, some can be obtuse the first time. It can be stressy figuring them out while the time limit nags you because you went exploring earlier. Some are annoying even if you do know the trick.It has Denuvo DRM. Sega shoved it in, then failed to mention it’s there. Oopsie. Please don’t blame the devs. They’re not happy with it either.Where’s friggin Ice Cap Zone? Such a fan favorite. I’d happily trade in Flying Battery and Metallic Madness. Yes, I know it’s petty and nitpicky, but the music is just so BOSS!.I lovedSonic Mania. It’s the throwback to classic 16-bit Sonic fans have been clamoring for. The Advance series made a valiant attempt, but wasn’t quite on the mark. Sonic 4? Yeah, sorry, make room for the true successor. If it was all-new content, it would’ve earned an easy 5 bananas. Mania seems to be selling well tho, so next time? Still, not bad at all for a game made by a bunch of ascended fans. Turns out all you need for good Sonic is people who care. Who knew?I rateSonic Mania4 out of 5 bananas.Welcome back Blue Blur. What took you?What my ratings mean:1 bananas - Crap. Turn around & don’t look back.2 bananas - Bad. Not really worth it.3 bananas - Average. For fans of the genre or a sale.4 bananas - Good. Won't waste your time.5 bananas - Superb. A definite must-play."

Many years of trying Sonic games on console and I never could get deeply into any of them. But this game turns that around.Pros:-All of the levels have fun and creative level design that makes every replay different and enjoyable.-Great soundtrack. Just amazing to listen to.-Awesome art. Fits incredibly well with old school graphics and looks great in HD.-Very fun boss battles.-Lots of content that add to a great amount of replay value.Cons:-Can be a very uneven experience for first time Sonic players. Sometimes too hard and sometimes too easy.-Denuvo (because of course Sega had to add it).-It can get very exhausting. It has a lot of content to unlock, but to some people it can be TOO much content.Overall it's a great experience with more ups than downs, and some loops (bad Sonic joke I apologize).Most fun that I've had in a while tbh."

Playing it reminds me of those heady days when I pre-ordered a then-brand-new Sonic 2.

However! After learning of the true reasons for the delay, I can safely say I won't be buying another Sega product any time soon.This was my very first Sonic The Hedgehog game. I paid for it, I pre-ordered it, and yet I'm treated as a lowly pirate. This is a VERY bad first impression, Sega. Unless the DRM is removed entirely in a timely manner, I shall not be purchasing any of your games in the future. To Christian Whitehead and the Mania team -- I apologize. I very much doubt you folks had anything to do with this. Mania seems like a swell game that was painstakingly crafted by those passionate about the series, but it was ruined by corporate greed and paranoia.I shall be seeking a refund for this product, and I urge others to do the same.

Unbeliveable that Sega would tarninsh an otherwise near flawless game just because they are afraid of so called pirates taking a little off of the bottom line of a game that has sold thousands of copies across all platforms..((will change my review if Sega removes Denuvo and gives us an honest to God Explanation to why they felt they needed to do this at last moment))"
,Not Recommended,584400,34959647,Posted: 14 September,all,HuffingtonPants,"Unlike almost all other negative reviews here, I don't dislike this game because of Denuvo.I love Sonic, probably played every single one, but this game makes dozens of poor design decisions for the sake of nostalgia. I wanted to love this game, but I can't give it a thumbs up.The levels are huge with loads to explore but you'll want to find the giant rings to get the emeralds. The 9:59 time limit still remains. There is no reason for this. I get it, Sonic is meant to be a fast game... but why punish the player for taking the time to explore as Knuckles or Tails? Because that's how the older games did it and Sega are like Pavlovs dog by this point. If they deviate from the Sonic 2/3/&K formula, they get hate, so they stuck rigid, even to things that don't work and never did.Also, they chose to include the worst bonus levels from the franchise, specifically the one you need to do to get the Chaos Emeralds. If you never played Sonic CD they will feel even worse. Even if you did, it feels clunky and poorly designed. Some gaps in this mode can be jumped over, others have invisible walls which will bounce you backwards. They are nearly impossible to distinguish from one another because everything is rendered onto a flat plane. These levels feel like a chore every time and drag the whole game down with it. (Fail the bonus game and want to try again without having to spend minutes looking for another giant ring and risking a time over? Too bad, it autosaved that you used that giant ring even if you didn't finish the level so you can't soft/hard reset and try again). If this was to stop people spamming attempts then that is at odds with being able to use the level select and just repeat Emerald Hill over and over until that save file has all the Emeralds.Finally... gimmicks. Every level seems to be loaded with a gimmick. Some feel fine and make sense like bouncy goo on Chemical Plant, others are downright annoying like getting frozen solid every few seconds so the game can railroad you into sliding along a set path. You can unfreeze yourself to try and take a better path, but only after hammering the jump button for several seconds. When this happens five times in a minute, you just give up trying. I can only imagine this was their effort to make Sonic feel fresh... It doesn't work.What I'm not mentioning is all the good this game has in it. Music as usual is great, levels are very pretty, animation is solid. Level design, when not lifted wholesale from previous games, is so-so. But you know this already. It's like a Final Fantasy game. You don't have to mention the music is great to justify why you think story is batshit crazy or how linear it is. Some things are a given.In summary, this feels like a very well built fan game. Appropriate given who made it. Maybe my standards were too high.I will gradually keep trying to work my way through this game, but I can't get through more than one level without finding something irritating enough to make me stop. (Most recently a bug that caused the music to stop playing). Hopefully one day I will remove this review or change it to a thumbs up... or better yet, Steam will add a 'meh' option.(Edit: I used this game as the subject of a critical analysis in game design and discovered that my student had never played any Sonic games before. Therefore he did not know about pressing down while running or spindashing. He reached a point where there as a destructible wall and had no way to get passed it. The game assumes you should have knowledge of it's mechanics before you play it. Either this is sloppy design or yet another example of prioritising nostalgia over good design)."

Great music, rock-solid gameplay, and good amount of content and secrets makes this game really fun and enjoyable, especially when you try to beat the game with all the characters and unlock all content and achievements. This was expected, since the game was developed by Christain Whitehead, which has worked on the Sonic CD, Sonic 1, and Sonic 2 Mobile ports.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game since SEGA decided to implement the Denuvo DRM system into the game, which has been rumored to mess with system files and damage computer hardware. I personally believe that said DRM system is the cause of the game randomly crashing when I attempt to open it, and the cause of my cursor shadow being disabled. The inclusion of the Denuvo DRM system also means that the game will become permanently unplayable if the Denuvo Authentication servers for this game go down, like what happened with other games that used Denuvo DRM system.I know that the store page clearly states the game includes the Denuvo DRM system, but this message was not present when the game was made available on the PC a few days ago. SEGA has also not stated anything about DRM being present until a day AFTER the PC version was released, and that was when the bug that prevented you from playing offline was fixed. The developers of the game are also unhappy about the DRM system that was implemented into the game, as they had no say in the decision at all.If it was announced that DRM was going to be implemented in the PC version before it became available, then I would not have pre-ordered my copy of the game, and would have waited for it to come to consoles instead, which do not have the DRM system implemented.I understand that SEGA needs to protect its games from being pirated, but they could have used another, less intrusive DRM system or at least told the public that Denuvo DRM was going to be implemented before the game actually launched."

,Not Recommended,584400,34625313,Posted: 30 August,all,Marcus101RR,"Sonic Mania is a basic comparison to Sonic Generations, but in Classic 2D Style. The engine is reformed to Version 5, and makes up for cool new features/gimmicks for the classic sonic games to take a-hold of. The problem with this game is not just DENUVO, as many players are hating. We are just gonna leave it alone and not argue about whether it affects performance or not.Sonic Mania is a title that could have been more, based on the trailer and it's hype. I expected to be able to recap through all of Sonic 1, 2, 3 & K, and CD Levels revamped/remixed. But it was the ladder, it follows the same pattern as Sonic Generations. Only a select few levels from each game was taken and mixed into this one, redone, reworked, near 4 times the original size (roughly some levels take 3-4 minutes to complete).  What this game should have done is allowed us to revisit all levels from all the previous 2D sonic games, that would have totaled out to (6, 10, 13, 7) 36 Total Levels from all the previous games in that same lengthy remixed style. We only got 13 selected few!Game also needed more of an expansion on how each level would be accessed, something similair to what Chaotix game did.My only hope is that the modders will please the fans further, as I don't expect Sega or the Developers to release a DLC that would fix this gap.Maybe the famous Sonic Classic Heroes modder may do something to this game to allow that, in the mean time you should check out that game instead.5/10, Good Game, if you wish to fill your classic collector's edition of sonic games."

But SEGA and Sonic Team just can't let it outshine their beloved edgy ""Sonic Forces"", can they? They just have to sabotage Mania somehow. First forcing the dev team to make more reimagined zones than original zones, then delaying it on it's native platform and then frigging it up with Denuvo (which actually renders the game unrunnable on my W7 PC, I can only play it on my W10 notebook).Simply pathetic. All my love to Taxman and PWG, you guys rock and your game is pure Sonic gold.

When I can actually play it.Sonic Mania Has:+ Great Graphics.+ Great Music, With a different track on every stage.+ Lots of vivid stages with a ton of Life and movement in the background.+ Vast stages with secrets sprinkled across the map.+ Classic Sonic 1-3 Game play and features.+ A crap ton of bonus stagesand a New bonus stage for chaos Emralds.+ Wonderful controls.+ Interesting bosses for a sonic game.Probably the best sonic game to come out in a long time, and I'm thankful to the developers for creating a great game out of a franchise that was not doing itself any justice.But, there are some cons:- Knuckles has movement frames that halt movement all together(hes clunky).- Knuckles eventually runs faster than sonic (or is it just me?)- To many bonus stages at times.- Some pathways can lead you to instant death.- The DRM everyone is complaining about.Personally, this game worked fine for me up until 4 hours directly after release. Then, I try to play the game on my laptop... Didn't work It said I needed to be online. Now all of a sudden I can not play the game at all, Since it is coliding with my networks security when I try playing it online. Turn off my networks security and still having issues.They done screwed it up!!I can not reccomend Sonic Mania (PC) until this issue is fixed.

The 0.3 hour playtime was literally only so I could leave this review. I've played this game on PS4 and it is fantastic, but this is enough of a travesty that it needed to be addressed. Like I said, unless the DRM is removed, buy this on a different platform. Not PC.)"

Once it is fixed, I can, but unfortunately, it is shoddy.Even 32 minutes into the game, I already encountered glaring issues.Collision Detection straight up broken. InChemical Plant, the game registered that Sonic got crushed, despite that not being the case at all. It was a one of the moving stair blocks, and I approached one that formed a nearly flat wall.Framerate hiccups that cause unavoidable losses, such as taking damage due to delayed button reaction caused by said dips, as well as losing the super precise Special Stages for something beyond your control. My hardware is decent and even then, the game has no reason to just framedrop that badly. Currently unknown what causes this, but...For those that care, the game has Denuvo. I personally wouldn't care, but I suspect the frame dips might be caused by this, since there is no other thing in the game that could possibly be intense enough to just cause those randomly.My specs:Geforce GTX 960Intel i5-4470 @ 3.20GHz8GB RAMIf I can, I'll update the review if anything changes, but right now, I can't recommend it.I have to ask what that delay was for, because optimization clearly wasn't the reason.Issues I haven't encountered but others are reporting as well:Resolution problems.Inability to play the game offline...

Game's basically perfect. Except...Well, for one thing, for the developers not to delay it for two weeks just to add Denuvo's DRM when Steam's own DRM would have done just fine, and then not tell their customers about it until after the game was finally released. I wonder how many people would have canceled their preorders for this ?Not gonna stop me personally from buying and playing the game on Steam seeing as this is the only platform I can play it on, but I cannot recommend getting it on Steam to anyone. If you can, get Sonic Mania for a console.Surprise Denuvo aside, the game's settings leave a few things to be desired. Namely additional windowed resolution options (capping out at ~720p just because I'm running it in a window ? Really ?), and an option for borderless fullscreen.Granted I can work around this by simply editing settings.ini, but I don't think I should have to.I can also force borderless fullscreen by using an external application, but again I don't think I should have to. The game does offer a borderless windowed setting, but that's all it does: Removes the borders from the window. It doesn't scale the game to fit my monitor, and it doesn't apply the fullscreen resolution that was chosen in the settings menu. It just removes the window borders and that's that.Both of these are just minor inconveniences, but inconveniences nonetheless.Of all the reasons to delay a game, just adding in Denuvo has got to be the saddest I've heard as of yet. Not that I can't understand why a developer would choose it; It *is* the hardest DRM on the market to crack these days, after all. But it has been cracked before, and it will be cracked again. It'll just take a little longer than it might have with a type of DRM that is better for the users. If Denuvo goes away I can recommend buying this game on Steam, but until then let's add to the pool of negative reviews."

,Recommended,584400,34721007,Posted: 3 September,all,(Edgy) Asriel Dreemurr,"The GoodSonic Mania is a fun callback to the classic Genesis games we know and love. It copies the feel of the old games near-flawlessly and even improves upon them. The game is filled to the brim with references and bits of nostalgia that will be sure to treat any long time fan of the series while at the same time creating an experience that doesn't just come off as a rehash. In terms of zones you've got old favorites along with some new ones that are just as great if not better than their predecessors.If you're not a long time fan of Sonic and want to try out the game and judge it by its own merits, this along with Sonic 2 are probably the best places to start. Keep in mind though that Sonic games like this encourage multiple playthroughs, learning different and faster paths in each level, getting better and faster as you become more experienced with the game. So if you're not rolling around at the speed of sound on your first playthrough, don't worry it's to be expected. You'll get the hang of it pretty quickly.Also props to Hyper Potions and Tee Lopes for this amazing soundtrack!The BadThe one thing I don't like in this game is the amount of old levels compared to new. There are 12 zones in total and only 4 of those are new. Don't get me wrong, they do still add and change up gimmicks in the old levels to make them feel more original, and none of the levels are exactly the same as their original counterparts.As you may have heard or read in the abundance of negative reviews, this game has Denuvo DRM. Now, no matter what people might say, Denuvo does not ruin your hard drive,  it does not cause latency or dropped frames, and it is not malware. On release there was an issue where the game could only be played online but this was patched out after the first day.The only concerns with Denuvo are if you plan to go somewhere for an extended amount of time with no internet, or if you make a hardware change to your PC and won't have internet access for some time. The other thing is if you have Norton or McAfee antivirus software, it will prevent the game from launching. There is a relatively easy way to fix this and it does not happen for most other AV softwares.The game was delayed by 2 weeks on PC for what SEGA claimed to be bug fixes. Before the release there was no mention of DRM being linked to the game, and it was not even listed on the store page until a few days after it released on PC. Among other things that made it difficult for users to rightfully refund the game, the publishers did some shady business with the PC release.If you wish to not support SEGA's actions or the implimentation of game specific DRM, these are legitimate reasons to consider not getting the game. If none of this bothers you and you want the game, you should not let it stop you."

Why are you doing this to us Sega? What about the people with limited internet access? What about the biggest reasons to even buy the game on steam, modding? Without modding this game wouldn't even exist in the first place so why make it nearly impossible to do?

In short that's what this game is. Now for the full review.Oh boy there's a lot to say so let's start with the gameplay and move on from there. The game plays great, the control is smooth and each character has their past abilities at their disposal. You get the sense of speed as well as platforming you got from the classic games as well.Time for level design. For the most part I love the level design in this game (except Titanic Monarch). Now yes it's true there's more returning levels then new ones but every act 2 in a stage is a completely new take on that zone (Hydrocity Zone flips that though [act 1 is new and act 2 is the original]) with new gimmicks and set pieces.Special and Bonus Stages are present as well, and both are so well done. The Special Stages are a combo of the Special Stages from Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic CD, Sonic 3 and Knuckles, Knuckles Chaotix, and Sonic R. Your goal is to chase down a UFO while collecting blue spheres to fill your mach meter to gain speed and rings to give you more time. The Bonus Stages are the Blue Sphere stages from Sonic 3 and Knuckles, there's 32 in total and 16 are returning from S3&K while the other 16 are new. Your goal in these is to collect every ring then every blue sphere, but the longer you take the faster you go. The reward from the Bonus Stages is a medal, silver if you only got all spheres and gold if you got all rings and spheres. The medals are used to unlock a bunch of secrets and such.The soundtrack is amazing! I love every single track in this soundtrack! And there's a new Super theme which is also fantastic.Story is lacking but this is a trip back to the 90's so it's fitting, you can learn everything about the game in the included manual too.The sprite work oh yes the sprite work, there's so much attention to detail and it's so good. You can feel the love put into every single frame and I just can't get enough of it.This game is also full of replayability giving you a reason to go back to it again and again.Overall I can recommend this game to veterans of the franchise but newer fans can still have a blast in this trip to the past."

,Recommended,584400,34580904,Posted: 29 August,all,Kraxie,"ReviewSo, after playing it for about 4 hours and completing it (not 100%), I can finally write a proper review of it.Quick note, I have not played any of the console versions of this.GameplayWhat you see is what you get basically. It feels like the older Mega Drive games, both in feel and look. All levels are very well made and really fun to play. I enjoyed every single stage I played, except Flying Battery. Not sure what happened when making those, but those levels felt really bad with cheap deaths and overall bad level design. The boss for Flying Battery is also very questionable, as the hitbox for it almost feels bugged. The rest of the stages felt amazing though.There were also a few minor things, like I felt like the Tails AI was really off and not at all like in the older games. Not sure if that's just me. Other than that though, it's great.The special stages as well are really fun and challenging. There were a few times where I was unsure if a wall was something I could jump over or if I would just bump into it, but other than that it was fine. I don't really like the Sonic 3 bonus stages, but those are completely optional at least and doesn't really add anything, so that's nice at least.ControlsNo controller support? Wait, what? Really?Yea, almost thought something was wrong with my computer until I read that it's an actual issue.Other than that odd issue, the controls are fine, but that's it. There were a lot of times where I felt like I didn't do anything wrong, but the controls were just against me. It's fairly minor though and might be because there's no proper controller support.SoundtrackTake my money and give me a soundtrack already.The soundtrack is just really awesome and fits the game really nicely. The remixes are great and the new tracks are awesome. The boss themes are also just perfect.The delayed PC releaseThis is what really bothers me honestly. The 2 weeks the game was delayed was obviously not for optimization of the PC port, but the implementation of the DRM everyone seems to love to complain about. If it really was for optimization, then there would at least be proper controller support or an unlocked framerate...SummarySo, overall, other than a few minor issues, this game is awesome. What you see is what you get, classic Sonic gameplay with awesome music, just like back in the day.I'll try to update the if the issues gets fixed.I'll give the game a 8/10 currently and higher it if they fix the issues with it."

,Recommended,584400,34591392,Posted: 29 August,all,m9m,"Do you like Sonic? Then you'll absolutely love this game, no doubt.Are you not that familiar with Sonic? Well, here's my perspective, as someone who isn't too big into Sonic. I hope this helps somebody make their choice.This is a great title. It has some iffy spots that I think could use improvement, but those are few and far in between. Admittedly, I didn't like that a lot of zones themings were reused, but I do think they do have enough different gimmicks and layouts to set them apart from their original counterparts.The music is pure eargasm, on the other hand. Every single track is great, and I'm not kidding one bit (I did take the liberty to listen to it before this was out on Steam). I'd love to see some sort of ""DLC"" which is just digital copies of the OST (although, IIRC you can request digital versions if you buy the vinyl).The graphics are really nice to look at too. Sonic and company received much smoother animations, along with everything else receiving either the animation treat, the detail treat, or even both. It just looks really good to look at, in almost every instance.While the blue spheres was taken from S3K, it's better simply because of the widescreen. It's also no longer where you get chaos emeralds from, as this is now a way to get collectibles. I did notice some input lag, though.The real special stages, with the chaos emeralds and such, is much better. It's a very simple premise that takes skill to master, and that's honestly a great feeling.The controls are pretty good. They're responsive for the most part, although if you're playing as Sonic & Tails and you want to fly with tails, I think it could've been managed better. Maybe it's just me not really experimenting with this, or it's just that I haven't spent a lot of time with other titles, but I feel like it could've used one of the joysticks to control Tails, and the other (or dpad) to control Sonic.One thing I felt it lacked is more cutscenes, in the style of S3K. This is especially apparent in mid-end game, where you just jump from zone to zone with no real explaination as to how. I really liked it in S3K when I saw why I ended up in whichever zone, as they're short, they serve to link the game even better together, and I think they're nice touches. Granted, there are some cutscenes like this, but in some instances you just jump from zone to zone without real explaination.Another thing I don't know how to feel about is level length. Especially in Flying Battery. I think they could've done away with the time limit, I've actually ran out of time in FBZ. It's nice that the game resets it to 0 when it happens, though. To give credit where it's due, I've only had problems with it once or twice through my playthrough so far, and I can definitely see Sonic fans enjoying those levels, they are much more familiar with layouts and tropes than I am, and they can beat a level in like 3 minutes while I run out of time on the same level.All in all, I'd recommend you get this if you're interested in giving Sonic a try in general. I think this is the definitive title for both newcomers and veterans of the series, it has enough to give both parties a good time, and that's not something easy to pull off at all."

Denuvo can negatively impact day-one sales. Many people will refuse to purchase a game simply because it uses Denuvo. The inclusion of Denuvo was hidden, even from the developers prior to release. I believe that this was in order to prevent the inclusion of Denuvo from influencing sales right away. This still raises the issue of refunds. This is where the continued secrecy and the two-week delay come in. The delay is just enough time to prevent anyone who pre-purchased the game right away from refunding, and the delay between the release and the discovery of it's included Denuvo was enough time for the rest of the conusmers to gain enough playtime to prevent a refund.If this was planned as I theorize it was, this is professional misconduct of an absolutely heinous nature.

It's full of references to many Sega things, such as parks, a bad livestream, past games (some of which were very obscure). Although the game recreates a few maps from past Sonic 2D games, they are recreated, not copied. Act 1 of each recreated stage hassome differences from what the originals were, but doesn't go too far. The Act 2's of the recreations expand on the zones, adding new mechanics, such as the bounce jell in Chemical Plant. Along with this, almost all of the maps incorperated mechanics from other past 2D Sonic games. Oil Ocean Act 2, adds the handle pull things from Sandopolis Act 2 (which was in Sonic 3).Also controller support is bugged at the time of this review.Under most other circumstances, I'd say this game is a 10/10 for old Sonic 2D fans and 8/10 for people who never played an old Sonic game.But this Denuvo is such utter crap. For all us PC players, we waited 2 more weeks than the console users to get this game for ""bug fixes and tweaking"" but in reality they added a DRM that was not advertised as being there, and was not in the EULA agreement. Sega claims that it was a simple mistake, but due to the PC delay, all pre-orders recieved a free copy of Sonic 1, which prevents all people who pre-ordered before Aug 15th from refunding the game. So people who don't want to support Denuvo have just been bent over and f**ked.And it certainly doesn't help that Denuvo has been cracked 7-8 days after this was released. Denuvo is utterly useless.

While the retro artstyle in itself gives off vibes of the classic Sonic games, it also has wonderful animations, colorful level design and backgrounds; seperating itself from the old 2D Sonic games and reminding us that this wasn't made in the 90s, but this year in 2017.Sonic Mania is absolutely fantastic and kudos to the developers for making such an incredible game.With that being said...

IN s3&k you had to do them for the emeralds, and that gave you gameplay advantage once you beat all 7 or 14. But they're just detrimental to the game flow of mania.I never liked the sonic cd special stages, and I didn't really like these ones. Especially 4,5, and 6.

Especially Press Garden, that and Stardust Speedway are the worst gameplay-wise in the whole game.I felt more of the classic's lifeforce in before/after the sequel then in Mania.That all said. I do hope Mania gets a sequel, but only if they don't rehash stages again.

Not only are you getting a blend of levels new and old, but both have interesting new mechanics to them. Remember Oil Ocean? It's no longer just oil running off of platforms, you can set it aflame with a flame shield. Remember Metallic Madness? You can shift from a background and foreground plane and explore the level deeper. But of course the newer levels made specifically for Mania I won't spoil for any of you, as the level mechanics in those take an even more interesting twist.But while the speedy blue hedgehog has finally made the comeback many have been waiting for, it does seem to have a few drawbacks that I'm sure a few will understand, and they involve the Special Stages. While finding large rings in Sonic 3 & Knuckles seemed common, first time players will really be left searching every nook and cranny of the level as time closely runs out. Of course they could use a video on Youtube to get a better idea where the locations are, but you feel like you really have to go out of your way to actually find them this time around.The second problem I have is controlling Sonic in the Special Stages themselves, chasing down the U.F.O. with time ticking through rings is one thing, but when Sonic hits mach speed he suffers from Mario Kart 64 turning syndrome, in which he slides around like he's on ice when you try to get him to turn. I can accept that you already have a few obstacles to deal with, but in a frustrating attempt to get Sonicto move where you want him to just made me feel like I didn't want to replay them all that much again.Overall, going through the main levels with or without going through the Special Stages is still a worthwhile time when playing through it. If you didn't mind the Special Stages, more power to ya. But in my opinion they're just not as memorable as in previous Sonic entries."

I haven't fully played through it yet but from what I have it's so much fun, what 2D Sonic game isn't?Great updated looking graphics but still keeping in perspective to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive era sprites.  No 2.5D like in Sonic Generations & Sonic 4 (which felt off to me, not saying they were bad games in any way)Music is great of course, reminds me of Sonic CD's songs.Controls are just as great as the Genesis Sonic Games, not off like on Sonic Generations & Sonic 4.Boss Battles are unique, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine/Puyo Puyo boss battle on Chemical Plant.  Other battles so far reminded me of the Sonic Advance games in that the screen scrolls as you battle.  The Flying Battery Act 2 Boss is a pain to deal with but is not too difficult.Special Stages remind me of Sonic CD's which I don't like much.  There are also the Blue Sphere stages which the ones I played seem just like the ones taken from Sonic 3.Haven't played multiplayer yetI had no issues so far.More to come when I complete more of the game."

76561198068143057,Not Recommended,584400,34673411,Posted: 1 September,all,[FoL] Star Sapphire,"This game is fantastic. I played the original 3 games(especially S3&K) religiously when I was little. Honestly, playing this game when it finally came out made me feel like a kid again, coming home after a long day of school and popping the cartridge into my Genesis. I got to feel that all over again. And it's a great game in its own right aside from the nostalgic elements. The original zones are vibrant and interesting. The remade zones feel familiar, yet new and exciting. The gameplay feels like a perfect evolution of where S3&K left off; playing through zones is fast and smooth with a lot of interest but not tons of clutter. The special stages are very fun as well. Blue Sphere also has some neat new layouts that are challenging. The music, the pixelwork, the zone layouts, the callbacks and references(SegaSonic Popcorn maker is really digging deep). They even took the multiplayer from Sonic 2 and gave you more zones for it. They did just about everything I could have wanted. It's all fantastic and the team behind it deserves every bit of praise.But like many, many others, the thing that I have a hard time getting past for thisversionof the game is the two week delay that they said was for polishing when, come to find out, it was really to add in DRM. As much as I enjoy this game, and I love it to death, the fact that it has Denuvo puts some thorns in what would otherwise be a flawless experience for me. Because of that, I have to throw another thumbs down onto the mountain. I'm sure that Sega proper, and not Christian Whitehead and co., is at fault. On the one hand, Sega is trying to get it and so they put their flagship IP in the hands of fans that could, and did, do best by it. It was a bold move that paid off tremendously with a great game. But, on the other hand, it shows how disconnected they still are from fans when this is how they try to combat piracy. Denuvo doesn't have a good reputation in the slightest. At best, little of it is true and it's enough to raise an eyebrow at but still enjoy the game. At worst, it is true and your hard drive has problems, meaning the simple act of playing the game is a risk. I can't have confidence in a company or fully enjoy the game when I know that they'll make a game like Sonic Mania yet turn around and put something like Denuvo in it. Even when Sega finally shows some good sense, makes a smart move, and an excellent game comes out of it, they still find a way to mess it up.If anything, get a console version and stay away from the PC version. It's still a great game that I highly recommend for anyone who loved the original 3 games like I do or to anyone who is interested in this type of platformer."

,Recommended,584400,34872824,Posted: 10 September,all,Hattori,"Never in my wildest dreams would I think that I would ever get to play a deserving sequel to Sonic 3 Knuckles in 2017, but here we are.There really is no point in saying if the game is good or not, you already know it. If you grew up playing those Sega Genesis games, then you owe it to yourself to play this.It's astounding that a group of Sonic fans managed to recreate something that Sega has been struggling for decades.The amount of love and care poured into this project seeps out of the screen and leaves you with inevitable dumb smiles and teary eyes, in what is one of the best fan pandering, nostalgia baiting and soul cleansing games ever made.As you can tell, the amount of bias here is pretty gigantic. The first game I ever played was Sonic 1, and alot of my love for the medium is closely tied to the memories I have of playing that game at the age of 4. I have been dissatisfied with the state of the franchise ever since those glory days of the blue blur, and it is with immense joy that I say that this game brought me back to those times.The level design is better than it ever was, with an amazing amount of intertwining sections and paths that reward exploration and player creativity, and every single act provides new gimmicks and options for the player to exploit and interact with.The old ""i go too fast therefore i cant see the stuff that hurts me ahead"" criticism is the most obsolete it has ever been. The amazing work put into the level design makes it so that there are never instances where you are thrown into a rollercoaster ride only to hit something at the end of it and lose all of your rings.The recreated levels manage to justify their presence by twisting and subverting your memories and coming up with new ideas that fundamentally change the levels you remember from the past games. The second act of a zone is always the more radically changed, maintaining only the aestethic and theme of the old game's counterpart, but even the first act contain surprises and changes of their own.Then you have the new levels, which are so good and perfectly match the aestethic of those old sonic games, that you just cant avoid thinking how great would it be if the whole game was new stuff.Sonic, Tails and Knuckles play just as the old games, providing just enough differentiation  to make you wanna beat the game 3 times with each character. Sonic comes with a new very useful move, the drop spindash, which lets you spin dash immediately as you hit the ground without having to charge it.For better or for worse, these characters still move exactly like they did in the 90s (which for me is perfect), so if you are someone who always had trouble with these games, its not gonna change here.The game is actually much more forgiving than the old ones. If you lose all your lives, you get sent to the first act of the level you died at, where as in the old games you would go all the way back to level 1.However, considering that there are still people complaining online about being sent to act 1 if they lose all their lives like they have never played a game from the 16-bit era before, its up to you if this is bad or not.Personally, I never lost all my lives and i think if you complain about being set back a few minutes because you died, you shouldnt even be playing games, but to each their own.What else can I say? Music? Absolutely fantastic. Pixel art? Perfect and Beautiful. Bosses? Creative, challenging and surprising.As for nitpicks, because i do have them, I would say that the story is very bland and lazy, and surprisingly convoluted and unecessarily redundant.Also, there are instances in this game where you can feel the limited budget rear its head.The game uses transitions between levels to create a sense of progression like S3&K, but at some point in the game they just stop using them. Finished levels will fade to black and put you in another level without any explanation of how you got there, when in the first levels in the game you always had transitions. Was it lack of time or resources? I dunno, all I know is that its very noticeable.Then you have the true ending which SPOILERS ends up as a cliffhanger to set up events in Sonic Forces. Not only i the true final boss disappointing, but to have the game end on an anti climatic note because its in service of another game? Thats just awful, especially when the old games had a sense of finality and closure when you would reach the end. Look up Sonic 2 ending on youtube if you want a better understanding of what im saying.But whatever, those are all just nitpicks. All in all, this is a project of love from the fans to the fans. Ican only hope Sega realizes whats here and builds upon that. But then again,Sonic Forces is coming out so who knows?..."
,Recommended,584400,35186624,Posted: 24 September,all,(YouTube)Dragnix,"Target Audience:Sonic Fans, or platforming fans with a need for momentumNote, the majority of my gameplay was on the Switch, but the game was bought for coverage purposes to give the audience info about the PC port.Summary:A solid return to the 2D form that the series has been known for. While the Sonic series has gotten a somewhat unfair reputation over the last several years (except for Sonic Boom, which is horrible), Sonic Mania understood a lot of the reasons on why the franchise got that reputation, and decided to focus on going back to its roots: momentum based platforming. And it works rather well. The two stageper level design lets the game play off feelings of nostalgia of playing levels such as Green Hill Zone, while allowing the developers to play around in the second stage with new mechanics. Sure, sometimes the game goes too far with these mechanics and stretches out levels a little too much (those gravity orbs in the last levels), the game for the most part keeps a good pace. Frustration can be a factor, but stepping away and just taking a moment, and it's gone.Really, this is a game for Sonic fans. Does it bring anything new to the table? Not really. Does it have that KO punch that other games in the series has? No, it doesn't. It's a great game all around, just not fantastic in any one area. There's some great levels both new and old (Chemical Plant Zone), there's some good design and some bad.  The sound design is still fantastic in its simplicity. The character sprite work is great.But what you need to know: it's fun. That's what this game is designed to be: fun. And it succeeds it what it planned on doing.Video Review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvoliWosQoLists:Positives:Gets the physics right. I can't stress this enough: the momentum gameplay is back to its roots and it really works rather well. You can't just change direction on a whim, and you'll run into a wall or two in your first runs. But as you learn the levels, there's not stopping you from easily jumping from platform to platform with the greatest of ease.The controls are spot on to for that momentum based gameplay.The sign of a great game: all elements of the game work in harmony with each other.Lots of alternate paths help the games re-playability over the long haul, and are actually fun to explore. Brilliant level design for the most part, as it's able to allow players who stopped to get the momentum that they need to get back up to speed, but not screwing with players who are still keeping up their speed in the level.Fun to pick up and play for a couple of levels to relax with. A great game just to let you escape from the city from. SEE. I CAN MAKE TOPICAL PUNS.Series music is once again a shining star here, with the classics being great, and a good set of remixed/reworked ones that help keep the energy up.Sound design is simple yet fantastic. The iconic ring sound just makes me giddity after all these years, and the lack of sound with enemies (in terms of focus as its muted a tiny bit) makes sense given the gameplay in question.60 + FPS and barely any hitches.The bonus levels serve a nice change of pace.The presentation of Sonic has always been one of the most underrated elements of the series, and it shines once again here. It gives you a lot of world building WITHOUT taking away from the gameplay experience.Negatives:It doesn't have that KO punch. That City Escape level. That unique level that makes the game stand out over other games in the series. It's good, great even.Knuckles Wall grasp gave me a bit of problems and feels like it needs work. The same action wouldn't work 100% of the time.The bosses don't work too well for me in the big picture. Too easy to exploit most of them.Once in a while, there's a presentation element that doesn't make logical sense, and goes against the conventions of game design you'd expect. Like blue slime being poison, instead of green.There's a couple of levels that just don't do the job, and work with a gimmick that's used a little bit too much. The gravity orbs in the last levels are the prime examples.Denuvo DRM will be a negative for some. The biggest problem with the always online was taken care of, but if you don't like DRM, this game is an avoid. 09o8"

Sorry, Sonic.I bought the game specifically because it would be a fun game I could play in short bursts while on the go. I'm always moving around and I like to take my gaming with me, I bought an overly expensive laptop for specifically that reason.What does this have to do with DRM? Simple, Denuvo is online DRM. That means it needs to periodically check online to authenticate my game. I'm not always near WiFi, and I might not be for long periods of time. Essentially what this means is any Denuvo game, single player or not, is unplayable.Furthermore, the game and any other with this software is on an artificial expiration timer. If Denuvo servers go down one day, permanently or not, or the company itself dies off, and given their past they probably will, my games, which I paid good money for, will be unusable.It's a shame it has to come to this because it's such a good game but I can't support this awful software or the shady way SEGA hid this from everyone and avoided refunds with roundabout exploits.https://whyisdenuvobad.github.io/"

I would call this game Sonic the Hedgehog 4 but I’m bothered by the reused levels this game has. To me, it feels like another Sonic Generations game but without Modern Sonic and it has it’s original sprite art style. I would love this game way more if the game had new levels only. I’m not a fan of nostalgia, unlike most fans. Which is why I want something new from Sonic Mania. And yes, the game does have new levels like Studiopolis and Mirage Saloon. But they're only 4 new levels and the rest are reused levels. I am aware of the reused levels having changed zone layouts and having amazing music remixes but it still feels like another Sonic Generations game. Aside from the levels, the game is generally great. The controls are decent, the sprite art is beautiful and the MUSIC!! Tee Lopes was a fan of Sonic who made amazing Sonic music remixes and he was hired to make the OST for Mania. I cannot stop listening to most of the music in the game. Tee is proof of why Sonic music is a gift from the heavens. The bosses in Sonic Mania have some of the best boss battles I’ve seen in a Sonic game. They are some really quirky ones, like the Mean Bean Machine/Puyo Puyo Tetris boss for example. They are creative bosses like Eggman’s weather machine and they’re entertaining bosses like the Heavy Magician of how she can turn into the Team Hooligan members(Nack, Bean and Bark). Sonic Mania does have a lot of content aside from the main game. There’s a race mode which you can challenge your friends. There’s a time attack mode where you can beat a zone as fast as possible. And there’s tons more like debug mode, the special stages and a whole lots of easter eggs in the whole game for Sonic fans to be pleased. Sonic Mania is up there with the decent Sonic games. Not all Sonic games have to be good or bad. It all matters on having fun and having great memories with the games. I loved Sonic Mania and I did only played as Sonic in the main game. There’s Tails which he can fly and Knuckles where he can glide and climb. I guess Tails and Knuckles are meant for new players who would mess up with their platforming and they can fly or climb back up to undo their mistake. Sonic on the other hand, had no special abilities back then until he was given the drop dash ability where he can perform an instant dash when he lands from a jump. Amy would’ve been a great addition to Sonic Mania as a hidden playable character but instead, she was referenced as a creepy small doll in one of the boss fights. The game does have chaos emeralds to collect but I won’t spoil the rest about it. For a conclusion, I loved Mania and I’m really pumped for Sonic Forces releasing on November 7th 2017. Sonic Mania and Sonic Forces together will bring Sonic back from the flaming hate he has been through."

,Recommended,584400,34644306,Posted: 31 August,all,ａmy,"Denuvo aside...Let's see, this game is one of the best Sonic games ever, maybe is the fact that I couldn't play the new games because of my potato PC (Like Generations), or because I really missed 2D Sonic. But anything of that aside, I felt and i feel really happy playing with the old physics, updated graphics, recycled and completely new ideas. I can not describe how much fun i have with this game, it's almost perfect, a bit short for experienced players, not THAT easy, but regular difficulty, excelent for starters on the franchise in my opinion.Gameplay is almost exactly the same than the old days, rolling around at the speed of sound, got places to go, GOTTA FOLLOW MY RAI- I mean, exploring, abusing the dropdash to get really fast to the goal, looking for giant rings, trying to complete special stages with an absolute good concept, reaching faster ways to complete every level, enjoying easter eggs and references... needless to say, it's just a masterpiece. My only complain is that are not allowed to chose which Sonic Ability i would rather use, but i think that is because the developers wanted us to get use to the new one, we are already familiarized with Insta-shield and Super peel-out.Level design is gorgeous, going up, and down, and up and down, and staying in the center are completely different stories, it makes the re-playability a great deal. Along with it's soundtrack, this game makes you want to wish for a sequel. Tee Lopes made a great job adapting every track, accomplishing what the old composers did back in the old days.Not to mention the smoothness and amazing sprite quality, looks like if you were watching a cartoon or something.Personally I love Angel Island and Oil Ocean Act 2 theme and Press Garden 2 as a level.I just can speak for myself, since the nostalgia this game creates was so big that i was playing every sonic in my disposition  since it was announced. Worth the wait, worth the buy, worth every single penny.Hopefully we can get a sequel or at least a workshop option, there are a lot of modders doing a very good job with this game too.Excellent work from Christian Whitehead, Pagoda West and Headcanon!"

With regards to the old levels, they have ""remixed"" around 70% of the levels, so they don't play the same but feel similar. The new levels fit in very well with the old levels as well.If you want Sega to make more Sonic games in this style, support them and buy the game. It's one of the best 2D platformers in recent memory, and certainly the best Sonic game since the golden Sonic age. Buy it!!"

You can do a jump, roll, spin dash, and do the new drop dash (to do a drop dash press the jump button and let go of it then hold the jump button).Special Stages: You jump into a giant ring in hidden places, the special stages are good (not the Best) but they DO get a little harder. You chase a UFO and need to collect blue spheres and rings,the blue spheres fill up the Mach meter, fill up the mach meter and you get faster. mach 1 is the slowest speed, mach 2 is fast, and mach 3 is the fastest. the rings are your timer, so collect as many as you can, if you run out of rings, then you exit out of the special stage. if you catch the UFO you get a chaos emerald.Bonus Stages: to go into the bonus stages, make sure you have 20 rings and go to a sign post then jump into the glowing ring. the bonus stages are the blue spheres special stages from sonic 3 & knuckles. if you beat them you get a token, i THINK you unlock mode(s) and abilities (sonic cd & sonic 3 & knuckles abilities, i'm not gonna mention mode(s) because i think it's a spoiler.)Character Abilities: Sonic is the only one who can drop dash, tails can fly (but i'd recommend playing as sonic or knuckles, but if you want to, go ahead.) & knuckles can glide and climb walls. (which is good for searching for the giant rings).Zones: Some of them are from the classic games (but the level design is different.) and some are original zones. there are also some alternate paths.Bosses: Original.Sonic Mania is ALMOST Flawless 8/10"

,Recommended,584400,34596105,Posted: 29 August,all,cstrife89,"First, a warning: as many other users have complained, this game includes Denuvo DRM code, which I do not like. I have already submitted a request for removal to SEGA, and I have truthfully warned them that I will not be buying additional games from them unless Denuvo is removed.That said, I'm going to go against the grain and give a ""Recommended"" now, because attached to this awful DRM is one truly amazing, enjoyable game; and to top that off, it runs almost flawlessly on my potato of a laptop. (If you absolutely refuse to buy the game with the DRM, that's understandable; but I urge you to buy one of the console versions in that case, if you have a console that the game is available for.)Anyway, I'm not going to go into a full examination of the game - loads of reviewers beat me to that - but I will say that I've had loads of fun so far and I'm around halfway through my first playthrough at this writing. (I'm also grateful that I installed this on an older machine first, because if I DO get fed up enough with Denuvo I can just beat the game, let Steam sync my save, and then wipe the system with nary a second thought. I've also been lucky with my Internet connection thus far; at some point I'm not going to be able to play because my DSL goes down in fits and starts, and when that happens I may well put my fist through a monitor.)Please Sega, don't let the best Sonic title in years have its reputation marred forever by some stupid antipiracy code that won't pan out in the long run.EDIT: For those who want to send feedback to Sega about the DRM (or anything else, really), go here:https://support.sega.co.uk/hc/en-us/requests/newAnd just in case there are skeptics wondering why we're all making a big fuss:https://whyisdenuvobad.github.io/.

It's a bit longer than S3&K to finish and a big replay value and stuff to unlock.- Each zone feel unique, for exemple Press Garden Zone doesn't play like Hydrocity Zone which doesn't play like Flying Battery Zone... Even the acts in the same zone can be very different! Ocean Oil act 2 for exemple is set in a heavily poluted oil refinery in which you have to release the toxic smoke from time to time to not lose your rings and to see better. Because of that the game always surprise you with new interesting things.- Again talking about level design, it's more like Sonic CD than regular Sonic. What I mean by that is it's less ""run to the right"" and more like a regular plateformer but with sonic speed.- That game can is hard at times, some boss will kick your butt (Stardust Speedway act 2 boss almost made me game over).- The music, oh my god the music! It's doesn't sound like it's running on a YM2612 chip but man Tee Lopes is very talented at making and remaking music:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW6TtXKVLYghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqD4zftv99Mhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6VSG7rZe0Q- Some reference to old Sonic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ friends and old sonic boss are included, welcome back Fang, nobody know who you are but welcome back.- You can play with Sonic and Knuckles ,Tails and Knuckles...

Stable and solid game from start to end, not a single fps drop or crash, or graphics glitch, or physics glitch. About Denuvo - calm your♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's supposed to be removed after while. It never stays in games forever.Actual review.Being a fan of the series and having played most of the titles (didn't play 3D Sonics much), I am here to say: Sonic is back. While preserving close to original sonic graphics, game utilizes features unavailable to 16bit platform. More vibrant palettes, more frames in animations, alpha transparency, better background parallax. The game is simply an artwork marvel. That's only technical and visual parts. Game utilizes tons of gameplay mechanics, featured in previous games, sometimes it's a remixed map, sometimes it's something familiar in different place. However there are lots of new mechanics. With each new level comes something new, just to disappear in past when the zone is over. With pace like that, none of the mechanics gets stale or boring.Another point is a nostalgie. It's such a pleasant feeling of recognizing something and reliving it in slightly different form.You are going to revisit some old locations from games 1, CD, 2, 3, S&K. Recognizable foes and bosses, not without new twists. What is just a pure joy - the bosses are multi-phased now, so one should bend his tactic to adapt to boss behaviors.And sound. With all sincerity, this sound is 10/10. BGM is crisp and clear, the old tracks sound just great, their remixes even better, and new and original tracks make a suitable addition to the soundtrack pool. I just lovedHydropolis, Flying Fortress, Lava Reef and Sphere Special Stagetracks.In the end: I loved the game as an old-school player, as the one who finished Sonic 1, 3 and S&K multiple times and enjoyed each and every playthrough. This is what Sonic game should be. Fast, beautiful, hilarious and - to some extent - challenging. If you ever played any of the classic Sonics, this is ""must play""."

I say this loosely because this port is the most buggy of the ones I've played. Slower load times compared to the Xbox One version that I own. One example is the awkward pause when using the time attack restart. It's smooth on its console counterpart, way better there than here. My biggest problem is the most noticeable one, is the DRM. This should never be a thing, and it's more obvious now that this was the reason for the delay more than anything. With that on top of the longer load and minor patches, I highly recommend this game, but not this version on its current state."

There are lots of challenges and while I haven't completed all of them as of yet, it continues to make the game a lot of fun. I couldn't recommend this game enough. It's one of the best sonic games I've ever seen for sure."

Great stages, music, characters, and even extra modes ,the old multiplayer is back too! Though as much as I adore Sonic Mania, there is an issue, Denuvo. I'm in no way supporting getting games for free on sketchy websites, but Denuvo does not help the issue, not to mention Sonic Mania is already been broken into. But I'm not going to bash the developers or Sonic Mania as a whole for this, the game is wonderful, Denuvo is not. As of right now I do have the game uninstalled and I have no interest in picking it back up until Denuvo is removed, and like I said this by no means makes Sonic Mania a game bad! Though I despise Denuvo, I simply can't give this game a bad review."

As a 2D Sonic fan from the Genesis days, this game is amazing.It's obvious that every detail, from the level design to the sound effects, was crafted with care by passionate devs.  At its core, Sonic gameplay has always been about two things -- Going fast and doing cool♥♥♥♥♥♥  The devs really seem to have grasped this concept as the levels alternate high-speed areas with interesting mechanics and special stages.  It's this variation that keeps the game fresh and flowing -- One second you're going 5,000 mph through some loops, then you're in a special stage chasing an emerald, then you're shooting out of a giant revolver and pinballing around a saloon.  There is no downtime, which is exactly how a Sonic game should play.I would recommend this game not only to Sonic fans, but also to platforming fans in general.  Playing as Sonic is incredibly satisfying and even therapeutic (sometimes you just want to have a beer and go fast).(Minor spoilers below)Pros:1.  Captures the spirit of playing as Sonic (tight controls, everything ""feels"" right)2.  Great level design w/ multiple paths through each, adding replayability3.  Amazing soundtrack4.  Good price point at $205.  Fun new special stage (less intimidating than the old ""Blue Spheres"" stages)6.  13 distinct zones (Sonic 3 only had 6!)7.  Achievements (Having goals in a Sonic game turns out to be fun)8.  Refreshing/challenging boss design (some legitimate laugh out loud moments here)9.  Cool extras (Blue Sphere mode, ""& Knuckles"" mode, etc.)Cons:1.  No online multiplayer2.  Some zones/boss fights have awkward/unintuitive mechanics3.  Denuvo DRM (honestly has not affected me at all, though I understand/support the backlash)"

Controllers work intermittently, cannot play offline even though the game has no online component and now AV alerts because they can't properly sign their own code.

But after playing the game, I'm really glad they got in. You can see a few of the best stages from the old games get a new take and direction, and it's worth the effort. The new stages are great too. Well, just about everything's great about this game. I love it. Made it to the last level but didn't beat the game yet.The only negatives with this game are the following: Denuvo DRM (it's a waste of processing power and money), and the bonus stages possibly ruining the pace/flow of the game, but the bonus stages are optional.Highly recommended."
,Recommended,584400,34610583,Posted: 30 August,all,Dominator Bob,"Easily one of the best games in the entire series.I grew up with 2D Sonic and 3D Sonic simultaneously. During my childhood I could be seen playing the Sonic Advance trilogy as well as Sonic Heroes and Sonic Adventure DX on the GameCube. And you know what? I loved both the 2D and the 3D Sonic games as a kid and growing up and played most of the past entries, which is why I was equally hyped for both Mania and Forces. I can say with high confidence that Mania delivers in every aspect and deserves all the hype and praise it's been getting; the 2-week wait on PC was worth it.This game is love letter to Sonic fans. It's filled with references to many Sonic games throughout the years, including a reference or two to the Advance trilogy much to my surprise. The level design does a great job at encouraging exploration while maintaining a sense of speed and the boss fights are some of the most creative in the series. Levels use stage gimmicks from zones throughout the series as well as some new innovative gimmicks. This game does not feel like a best-of compliation despite the heavy usage of traditional zone themes; the remixed level design that incorporates old and new gimmicks makes the experience feel fresh throughout. The soundtrack is superb as well, with some of the remixes of classic songs even beating out their originals. The new chaos emerald special stages are fun as well, although they are very tricky to find.The only criticism I have with this game is the color palette. Most reviews seem to be praising it, but I actually dislike it and think they should have kept it more like the original games' palette. The colors used in this game are extremely bright and there are a lot of things moving fast in the background. As a result of eyestrain I needed to take many breaks during my first playthrough of the game.Also, I didn't let DRM affect my enjoyment of this masterpiece of a game (shrug)"

Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 & Knuckles have always been my favorite games when it comes to the 2D Sonics. This game will take you on nostalgia joy ride just like Generations did but with fresh mechanics and reimagined levels from the oringinal games.  And if your worried that this game won't run on you low end PC; trust me you have nothing to worry about. I tested this on both my low end and high end PC's and they run perfectly fine. Do you remember Blue Spheres? Those are back too. I'd spend hours mastering all of the Blue Sphere levels on Sonic 3K and now I can do that again with puzzling new Blue Sphere levels to conquer. You can even play with a friend in Co-op mode or competivitely. They really brought the nostalgia with this game and according to the backstory; this is the ""True"" sequel to Sonic 3K. It did take a long time for PC users to get the game nevertheless, it arrived for PC users! I recommend this game to anyone who loves old platformers or Sonic in general. This blue hedgehog continues to go fast and here's to Sonic as we press forward to the future. Also the only thing I don't like is the DRM Sega implemented and now we know why it was delayed. So for anyone plans play this offline, think again. There's no need for me to refund, because the quality is still there. They just need to fix this immediately.

It apes the old, good Sonic games of yore to be easy to get into, and yet does just enough new things with those tools to feel fresh and original.

To me, the Sonic Mania experience was one that really hit home. It's no secret that the game plays heavily on nostalgia and fan service, but oh boy does it do so wonderfully.It's really the subtlety of the references that get you; Like the mashup of zone elements and enermies from the original trilogy & Knuckles as well as Sonic CD. The music is absolutely to die for (God bless you Tee Lopes) with swingin' original tracks in Studiopolis, Mirage Saloon, Press Garden, and Titanic Monarch zone, along with timeless pieces from the well rebooted zones we all love like Green Hill and Chemical Plant. I was really hoping they would include an alternative soundtrack (perhaps a 16-bit Genesis styled one) like they did in CD, but I guess they decided not to.While the zone choices originally left me a bit dissapointed (I didn't really want to see Oil Ocean since both Lost World and Sonic 4 ep 2 had elements from it, or green hill for the bajillionth time), Mania has been able to 'remix' the zones in a way that really breathes new life into them. With fun new elements like the syringes in Chemical Plant and the smog and submarines in Oil Ocean, it's like playing the zones for the very first time.Despite all my high praise for the game, I do have some gripes with the save system. It just doesn't seem fair to me to make the player repeat Act 1 stages if they 'game over' in Act 2 or the boss stage, especially when they will have to face the mini-boss again. Mania is an easier title than the classic ones, but that is no excuse to make 'game overs' a living hell for players, especially those who are starting their Sonic journey with Mania.And for those whining about the DRM issues, it's really not that bad. I can understand people fussing over it if it were an issue on the Switch where portability is key, but this is PC we're talking about! An internet connection can't be that hard to find. It's not fair to give the game a bad review just because you need to be logged in the play it. They're getting it fixed soon anyway. What did leave me confused were the controller support issues as the game is obviously meant to be played with them. A fix for this is to disable all theck check boxes under Steam > Settings > Controller >  General Controller Settings. A restart of steam is needed for the changes to take effect.For anyone considering buying the game, just buy it! It's unlikely we'll see another masterpiece like this in the franchise for a good number of years. Also, play it with a controller! The special and bonus stages are significantly harder without one.With such a great game as the Sonic Franchise's 'Summer' release (I'd say the delay was worth it), here's hoping that the Holiday season's Sonic Forces is able to maintain the standard.Delaina K, signing off!"

I still need to do a run as Knuckles as I hear he has alternate paths and levels to Sonic and Tails sometimes. There have only been 2-3 parts of the game that I haven't enjoyed too much, but that is very little overall.That DRM needs to go if it stops offline play though. Needs to go in general to be honest, but I can't not recommend the game because of it, it's a fantastic game."
,Recommended,584400,34698328,Posted: 2 September,all,icarus,"The most fun I've had with a Sonic game since S3&K.Capturing the nostalgic vibes like no official Sonic game before it, Mania has set the bar at an all-time high for any future Sonic titles. The best part? This game was made, not by Sonic Team, but by the community, and quite literally. Christian Whitehead, the genius behind the Retro Engine that Mania and many of the Genesis ports for iOS (and the CD port for both iOS and Steam) run on, started out as a ROM hacker. ""Stealth"", AKA Headcannon, was also a ROM hacker, and knew the ins-and-outs of the Genesis games; these two would make quite the pairing for developing this title, not to mention the Pagoda West team, which were famous for their work on the Sonic 2 HD Remake before it being taken down.The aesthetic design is extraordinary. With colors as vibrant as ever thanks to the advancement of technology, the environments are extravagant and very pleasing to the eye. This is also true of the Genesis levels which were remade into Mania; the high-definition pixel art and the ability for endless color give this game a style like no other 16-bit-esque titles. (Some even claim that this game would be more along the lines of 32-bit thanks to the colors and polys.) Another eye-catchingly amazing feature of this game are the animations. Sonic himself, along with his friends, have more frames of animation than their Genesis counterparts, along with their environment; rings spin at a more detailed rate, enemies look more alive, and even Dr. Robotnik himself is beautifully animated in the cutscene at the end of Green Hill Zone. And the music! Tee Lopes did a fantastic job with the music.I especially LOVE the Hydrocity Zone music, which was my favorite stage in Sonic 3 and Knuckles. Overall, it's very pleasing to both look at and hear.Gameplay-wise, the game performs exactly like the Genesis games -- with a ton of added polish. Sonic is fast, and the developers wanted you to have fun with the game, so they based everything -- and I mean EVERYTHING -- around Sonic's blazing-fast speeds. The Drop Dash ability gives a whole new method of earning momentum, making the game a speedy blast. The levels, including those old Genesis remakes, have new gimmicks in them that breathe life into what they once were, making them more fun than even their Genesis counterparts. The Special Stages are also fun, taking inspiration from older Sonic titles while also keeping itself unique. I myself can't remember the last time I found grinding for Chaos Emeralds fun and entertaining until playing this title.The amount of attention to detail added in by the developers just shows the player how much they actually cared about the game they were designing. That's something more developers, including those at Sonic Team and SEGA in general, need to take notes on.I can recommend this game again and again a thousand times over.Play this game."

I'm looking forward to play through the game again as Knuckles or tails to see how different their experiences are, I already know Knuckles has slightly different levels due to where he ends up storywise.Only negative in my opinion is the ""checkpoint pole"" bonus levels (stars that appear above checkpoint poles if you have enough rings when you hit them) which has been made into the Chaos Emerald Blue Sphere mode from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, which are fine in theory, but not when you get them 4-5 times per act since they take a lot of time and breaks the gameplay a bit. When I was streaming the game I had to start actively avoiding them as it made the stream boring.Having been officially said to take place after the events of Sonic 3 & Knuckles this is technically the Sonic 4 everyone wanted but didn't get. I recommend buying the game, it's worth it's full price even due to the replay value.If I were to give the game an arbitrary score I'd say it's a 9/10."

It's not even subtle, they knew what they were doing. The Blue Spheres special stages have the same problem about halfway through getting them all, and they throw in a lot of leaps of faith on top of that. That's not fun, at all. The UFO special stages are far too easy to fail with no room for error and bad control. By the time you get enough speed to get to the UFO, you have to struggle with ridiculous speed, bad traction, lots of instant-fail pits, and obstacles that drop your already-dwindling timer faster while you play catch-up on the UFO. There aren’t enough special stage rings to give you a decent number of chances to try these stages.Unlockable features such as the peel-out are not explained at all. You don’t get to use them in the file you unlock them with, and you don’t get to use them in new files. I had to look up how they even exist in the game, and it’s just dumb. Standing next to a wall crouching, waiting for a gust of wind to take you to the next area levels of dumb. I just wanted to enjoy a Sonic game, not follow along with a bunch of nods to bad game development and secret codes. I shouldn't have to activate debug mode to just enjoy a game.Bringing back old levels was nice, but the new levels just weren’t any fun.Get this game if you’re one of the people that made it and already know how to activate the features and know all the Kaizo traps beforehand. If you didn’t have a hand in developing the game, don’t get it. Go to Sonic Retro and get any of the modded games they have there and you'll get better quality. I didn't even bother completing the game, it was just unenjoyable.I was a fan that grew up with sparkling eyes for Sonic. I watched all the shows and played all the games I could get my hands on. I was hoping this game would be where Sonic got his shine back, and this isn't it. Next time, study Sonic 3 closely and understand the stage design and what made it so good."

The perfect blend of retro Sonic gameplay with new mechanics thrown in the mix and some unexpected throwbacks that I won't spoil. This game certainly brings a smile to the face of the long time Sonic fans despite all the abuse the series has suffered through (I'm looking at you Sonic '06 and Boom...) and makes me genuinely excited to be a Sonic fan again.There are a few niggles here and there in the gameplay but nothing that detracts from the fun of playing it. As of writing this the game is currently locked with a ""online only"" DRM, which is a shame as it's probably the biggest issue with the game. If you have an always-on connection this won't affect you however, so I highly recommend it! It's a shame to see so many negative reviews of an almost perfect Sonic game.. but hopefully SEGA hear the masses and fix the only glaring problem with this release, the over-the-top DRM.** Sadly apparently you're not allowed to give this game a positive review without the steam community downvoting it to hell because they dislike the DRM situation.

But this is my personal opinion. To be fair I wasn't real all that hype for it when I say the trailers and details leading to the release, pretty much when Sonic Forces news came out. I almost stop play attention to this game completely, but I preorder this and still was waiting to play this. I grew up playing 3D Sonic Games, I first played 2D Sonic back when Sonic Generations was out and it had the game with it. I couldn't get passed Marble Zone and pretty much hated my first time, but playing more and more of the classics with a calmer soul and I found it more enjoyable. But with Sonic Mania, it's something any Sonic fan or any gamer to enjoy. Modern Sonic fans can enjoy it as much as the Classic Sonic fans, and there's one of it's highlights. Sonic Mania's Engine is an improvement of the original genesis engine the players controls the same, and added an Drop Dash to Sonic, but however it's something I feel more comfortable using in speed runs rather than regular play. The stages are outstanding, but most of them are original stages.. Out of 15 stages, 11 of them are original, and 4 are new, and pretty much the highlight of the game. I really like how the stages were redone, especially in Act 2. But the new stages are the ones that hold my interest, even Sonic Mania even have a sequel, it needs to have new original stages. Sonic Mania is something I love to play on my free time even tho the PC version has DRM; meaning that you need to be online and have wifi. This isn't a big deal for me, but there're times when my wifi is out, or I just don't want to log in to steam. Overall Sonic Mania is has alot of replay value and is a amazing game. I give it a 9/10. I recommend the PC version. despite the DRM. I still have lots of fun."

,Recommended,584400,34587684,Posted: 29 August,all,L14,"Sonic Mania is a game created by fans of the series that were employed by SEGA to produce this new 2D Sonic game.With plenty of throwbacks to classic games, fresh new levels, bosses, themes, special stages and much more, Sonic Mania gives fans the 2D classic style game the community has asked for.As you can probably tell by my play time, I really really enjoy this game... Like a lot.This game does everything that was good in the classic titles and makes it even better. The adventure takes Sonic through levels from the past games and 4 entirely new zones, all of them providing a fun and enjoyable experience.The past zones have had major updates and feel like entirely new levels on their own, with the act 2 of the classic zones usually having a major overhaul and have unique and interesting new mechanics to accompany them, there are a few exceptions where the Act 1 has the overhaul though such as Stardust Speedway Zone having a nice mix of slower paced gameplay from Sonic 3's Marble Garden with the fast paced action of the original.The level design on all the zones have made huge improvements over the classic games as well, making the older levels feel better to play through. The new zones have also got some insanely fun level ideas and overall design, there are several new mechanics introduced and each act ends with a really great boss fight.That's another thing I should mention, which is that the bosses are insanely good, each provide a fair challenge while keeping the pace of the game fast and enjoyable. I have to say a few bosses aren't quite as good as others but some are just so creative and fun.Special Stages in this game are also brand new and mesh together ideas from previous games but in a 3D space, with tight controls, fun levels and great visuals. The special stage serves the purpose of collecting the Chaos Emeralds, which again make a return from the previous titles. The special stages along with the Chaos Emeralds within them, can be found by seeking out a giant gold ring, hidden within the Zones you play through, with each act having around 3 to find.The addition of Super Sonic is also a nice touch, this being available once all the Chaos Emeralds have been attained.The music, pixel art and overall theme of this game is bright, colourful and polished. The soundtrack is one of this games key strengths I feel. Composer Tee Lopes has done such an incredible job with the music of everything in this game, not a single track feels out of place or unfinished/unpolished. The pixel art done by a few talented artists is also sublime and brings the whole game together, giving a fresh new look to Sonic and the whole experience.Everything in this amazing title hits the right notes, but for sure it's not the perfect game by any means, it has its flaws like any game, but for what this game offers I don't see them worth fretting over. All I can say is some level design needed smoothing out, some transitions between levels could've been worked on (or actually implemented), the story could've been a lot better and of course more new zones would've been appreciated. Also I feel it's worth mentioning the fan service in this game could put some people off, and there is A LOT of it, maybe too much.Overall though, the positives majorly outweigh the negatives, obviously the whole DRM situation has been covered a million times already so I won't go in to that, but I feel with Sonic Mania, you can look past it.Easily I would say this game is a solid experience that should be enjoyed by Sonic fans and many other people who may just want to experience a fun, fast paced, action platformer.If you want a number score then I'd give it a 8.5/10"

,Recommended,584400,34607091,Posted: 30 August,all,Gabriel,"random reviewspoilers bewareHi everyone, welcome to the review, I'm Mr. Review and on today's game I'm gonna list top things about Sonic ManiaThings:The game is a true Sonic Classic that no Sonic fan should exclude, recommended buy.The game plays just like the original, and you can even unlock all the abilities from other Classic Sonic games.The mini games are actually fun, but both are hard.Like the rest of the game as well, it is hard, the learning curve is somewhere in between easy and medium, leans a lot to the medium side.This game plays great on a controller.The graphics look vibrant, when you look at the sprites, you can see that they put effort into them, all the frames, and even level chunks, background, everything is drawn with passionEven on the technical side, the game still uses paletts to color stuff,herein the Sprites section there are some info about it using paletts.There is music for every act, and good music at that, my favorite tracks are 11, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 37, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 49. If you don't count the sound effects, that's about half the OST.It's nice to see that the things from the RDK S3K got used here, like thehardBlue Sphere mini game, there are also some other stuff, technically,the Mania Blue Sphere Mode, Sonic's abilities from S3K for example, those balls on the Titanic Monarch, the rotating things in PGZ, just masked things from Sky Sanctuary, or the things you grab in Stardust Speedway.Knuckles get a new stage and a new boss to fight, Tails also gets some love, but only by special routes only for him.Debug Mode is back, the joys of crashing the game.There is an easter egg todunkey, Sonic's 25th Buzzing incident & Knuckles.EDIT: THEY REMOVED THE DUNKEY EASTER EGG :(((((((This game runs on my dying laptop. :DThe bad Things:This game was mostly made by fans, not the Sonic Team. No the gameplay isn't bad but it is scary because, if the fans can make this, but the Sonic Team can't (same to Valve, when I made this review, the community constructed what the HL2:E3 was (based on leaks), meanwhile Valve... $$$), I really hope the future will be bright for Sonic Team.Out of all 12 stages, only 3 are new (counting that Mirage Saloon was made before the Mania project even began, when it was made just for the Sonic CD mobile ports under the name Desert Dazzle, even if it was unused), it's a ratio of 4:1 (for every 4 stages, a new act), my expectations were to be just 2:1, or even 1.5:1 (now if we count Desert Daz- I mean Mirage Saloon, we have a ratio of 3:1, which is closer to what I expected).The ending felt rushed.The voice of the Time Attack guy has to be a placeholder or an inside joke, I get that they are trying to do everything retro, but there would be better fitting voices for that, hope they would re-record those voice lines.Got a lot of soft locks on my playthoughs. Only 1 with Sonic & Tails, one with Tails and 4 with Knuckles.More of a minor one, but I really wish they released a digital copy of the soundtrack here on steam, I don't have a big box that reads circles, there is a fancy Sound Test in the Extra menu indeed but... cmonSEGA, Tee Lopes milk my wallet please.A XBOX controller works, but any other controller that doesn't use what driver XBOX is using, well those people are out of luck.DissapointmentWhat a disappointing release. Shame on you SEGA, Shady af buisnesses practices, real shame on you. If it wasn't for those nostalgia googles I would have not bought this game, I thought you were way past cool.SEGA of Europe (not the wonderful fans-now-devs) delayed the game for 2 weeks to add DRM. Initially you weren't able to play the game offline, but SEGA has released an update that lets you play offline, but you have to login on Steam at least once.UPDATE 22/09: aaaand the game has been already cracked and moded, the crack (by an italian group) momentarely only disables Denuvo, dosen't remove it, mods have appeared 5 hours after realase so I don't need to comment on it.If you plan on cracking it, that's fine for me, if you really liked it, please at least buy it on Steam so a small fee of money (whatever they have in their contracts at SEGA) goes to the developers, they trully deserve every money from this game.If you cracked the game and didn't like it, don't buy the game lol.Deleted parts of the old reviewEverything here is striked so you know that you don't need to read this, but Sega needs to learn from hereSEGA of Europe (not the wonderful fans-now-devs) delayed the game for 2 weeks to add DRM, in this case, a DRM that requires you to always be online, for a singleplayer game. I am not affected by this problem, but imagine people with bad connections, or people that want to play the game when Internet is out. The EULA doesn't mention this at all, but it mentions online features for a... singeplayer game.Tails gets no love at all in this game."

,Recommended,584400,34598700,Posted: 29 August,all,Rastule,"I played through Sonic 3 and Knuckles just prior to playing this game. I have to say, It definitely feels like the natural progression of the Sonic series, one that it deserved by people who loved the originals. I liked this game, but I feel like it would be unfair to skip over any faults it had in favor of a glowing review.Sonic Mania is quite clearly dedicated to people who love the series and just wanted to see it get back to its roots, and it shows. The levels are lovingly crafted so that they bring up nostalgia, while throwing new gimmicks into each remixed stage, and making the new ones feel like they belong in a long forgotten Sonic game. That, I would say is it weakest part.I want to stress again that I like this game quite a bit, I sank almost 11 hours into it on its release day, and even told friends I was busy to play it. That said, it does feel just like the old games. It doesn't do much in the way of innovation, it just plays on nostalgia in a loving manner. In trying to express this, my girlfriend told me what I was trying to say. Sonic Mania is like like going to a new sushi place, sure it's new, but not everything is fresh.If you were a fan of the old games, or a new comer to the series, you will likely enjoy this quite a bit. If you never liked sonic, this game isn't going to change your opinion. It's okay to be wrong. Also apparently there was some DRM issue as of launch, but I have not actually experienced any issues yet... Though it is Denuvo so it could be a time bomb."

I especially like that the elemental shields now have special effects in certain stages, and this adds a new dimension of strategies to the game.The only problem I had with the game is that the reward of the bonus stage does not instantly affect the gameplay. I prefer to have short bonus stages which gives you rings, extra lives and shields. Perhaps extra contents can be unlocked by collecting hidden items spread throughout the stages.The team proves that they have to ability to create nice original levels. The new zones and the new gimmicks to old zones are all beautifully designed. The soundtrack lives up the reputation throughout the sonic franchise. I look forward to any new games from this ""Sonic Team B"" in the future."

Sonic mania is simply astounding. From the number of zones to the two special zones and all the mixnmatch of enemies that are spread out in this worlds. Having 4 old school sonic game zones revamped, updated, and nostalgic made me so happy to see many of them. Now I was still missing some stages i had hoped to see, BUT the package that was given still made up for it. The soundtrack of Sonic mania.....Mindblowingly Amaze. Their was some difficulty, especially with blue spheres though some of the bosses are way easy though it's okay since games are not as hard as they were back in the day.Took me approximately 20hrs to fully achieve this game so it is possible for anyone to do it if I could do it too. Yet, even after fully completing it with achievements and even with all four character variations, (not including those in  not save mode). I know some people had hopes of playing as Amy, but it'll be okay. This game is worth the time and money to play if you set into it.In My OpinionTop three musical tracks -> 1) Metallic Madness Zone Act 1, 2) Press Garden Zone Act 2, 3) Hard-Boiled Heavies ThemeTop 2 Returning Zones -> Flying Battery Zone & Stardust Speedway ZoneTop 2 New Stages -> Titanic Monarch & StudiopolisFavorite Bosses -> Mean Bean Machine Eggman & Hard Boiled Heavy NinjaLeast Favorite music rendition -> Lava Reef Zone Act 2Least Favorite Returning Zone -> Lava ReefLeast Favorite New Zone -> Mirage SaloonLeast Favorite Boss Fight -> Wrench Throwing RobotWith all that said, I completely recommend this game to be bought now or whenever it gets put up in holiday/seasonal sales. Great time, music, all-around great experience and IS WORTH YOUR MONIES. Easter Eggs are all over the place too and THAT is something I really love and appreciate the time that was put into this game. Even the Studiopolis act 2 boss finish easter egg.

This was hindered when I learned that there was an additional DRM (on top of Steam) being added to the game called Denuvo. I think it is quite redundant to apply a second layer of DRM to a game that is already locked behind Steam.As for the game itself, the new levels really shine through. It is nice playing the classic levels from my childhood, but playing the new levels leave me wishing that there were more included.Until the DRM issues are cleared up though, I cannot recommend the game and advise anyone to purchase it on console if possible instead."

The game looks amazing but the first boss was unreasonably hard only because the boss moved at the speed I SHOULD be able to move at. Moving that slow gives you zero time to react to anything.

The levels are creative I loved the new and old levels and they fit together so well I had to look up which levels were new. The sound is amazing and if I had the option to buy the soundtrack to listen to I definatly would. Finally the visuals look just like the 16bit era of video games you know and love.However this game uses Denuvo and ""That's no good!"". Denuvo stops modders from modding the game, stops you from playing in steam offline mode, and affects performance but this game runs on a potato so that isn't a big deal in this case. Hopefully Sega will remove Denuvo but until then I am not recomending this amazing game on Steam.

Denuvo currently presents no limitations on performance, storage requirements, or launch times. It is invisible and unintrusive.While I certainly agree it was incredibly disingenuous of SEGA to sneak in DRM and delay the game for 2 weeks to do so, I'm still amazed people are willing to downvote this incredible game based on a one-time online copyright check.I grew up with Sonic 3 & Knuckles on a PC Sonic classics collection, and the elegant return to form presented in Sonic Mania is astounding. Every background object, every animation is lovingly crafted to harkon back to the 90s while infusing said classics with new life.The most impressive part of this game is that it truly manages to carve out its rightful place beside the classic 4 Genesis titles. The new Zones in Mania, as well as the OST are original, iconic, and definitely unforgettable. While I enjoyed the unpopular Sonic 4 games, they admittedly do really fall short of the wonderful work Sonic Mania does.Denuvo is a worthless DRM. It took mere days for pirates to crack it.

For example in the chemical plant level, I touched the side of a moving block and got crushed.- Last but not least, the DRM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tOverall, this is one of the best nostalgia throwback sequels, up there with MegaMan 9 and New Super Mario Bros.

If someone had told me this was a lost Sonic Genesis, I would completely believe it (with the exception of some nice little graphical touches). Imagine taking the gameplay of Sonic 2/3/K, the soundtrack quality of Sonic CD, a set of brand new, spectacular zones that match anything the series has to offer, and wrap it all up into a beautiful modern package- that's Sonic Mania.I don't want to spoil anything as the game is best experienced for oneself, but suffice it to say there are endless touches showing the immense love and care that the developers have for Sonic and the glory days of the Genesis. One of the early boss fights is absolutely brilliant and you'll see immediately what I mean.I dislike intrusive DRM as much as the next person, but I'm reviewing the game here, not the DRM. More than enough people have done that here. As far as the game itself goes, this is as good as any Sonic game ever, if not better, and I know; I've played them all (OK, I'm sure there's some obscure title that only came out for refurbished Wonderswans or something, but I've certainly played the vast majority of them).There were some moments that nearly brought me to tears for how perfectly they evoked the nostalgia of Sonic's heyday, and this is mixed in with some truly excellent gameplay and level design that rival anything to be found in the entirety of the Sonic franchise.Turns out, you CAN go home again.

Sure, I was slightly disappointed about not playing offline, it was patched almost immediatly fixed to the point of it almost to the point of it just not mattering. So long story short, I wasn't mad.

Based on these two games, I never really got a good impression of Sonic.. But before picking up Mania, I tried a bit of Sonic 3 and it was a lot of fun. It gave me a taste of the ""good sonic"" games that everyone always talked about. And now that I've finished Mania and I completely understand what the hype is about. Going to try the original 3 games now.The music is amazing and perfectly fits the fast-paced action of the game. The sprites are incredibly detailed and impressed me on many occasions. Gameplay uses momentum perfectly and doesn't get you caught up on cheap deaths (which I had to deal with in colors and advance 3). Bonus stages are fun and there are plenty to unlock. Environments are all pretty and creative.Honestly I hope this game represents more than ""a good Sonic game"", and that other devs take notes from it on how to impress fans in modern day.

Sega has finally given the sonic franchise to someone who understands what makes a good Sonic game. The graphics are done in the 2D style of the original 90's games. That isn't to say that the graphics look dated at all. There are so many small additions and little flourishes in the spritework that it simultaniously looks old and new. The music is great with many familliar tunes slightly modernized as well as some fantastic original songs also. The gameplay is everything I could have hoped for. I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as I remember from my childhood, either because the formula is too dated a concept or perhaps the team could have made it just feel wrong like was done with Sonic 4. This is not the case. The gameplay is just as fast and fun as I remember. It honestly feels exactly how I want it to. Well... with one caveat. The game doesn't seem to support many controlers outside of a few modern XInput controllers. I had high hopes of using my 8Bitdo SFC30 replica bluetooth Super Famicom controller. As it stands i dont own a controller that works with this game yet and must use the keyboard to play. It's certainly not ideal but is perfectly funtional with the simple control scheme sonic is known for anyway. To speak on the simple control there have been a few additions not previously seen in a sonic game. They got rid of the lock on attack used in the 3D world and in Sonic 4. Instead, sonic moves just like he did in sonic 3 with few exceptions. The shields from sonic 3 are back with their powers intact, and the spin dash is still in as well. The new moves are an instant spindash when you can use when you hit the ground after a jump, and the ability to trigger Tails to carry Sonic with his flying power in single player mode without using the player 2 controller like we had to do on the Genesis. Aside from not being able to use a controller from the era that made Sonic what it is I couldn't be happier with this game and i hope they do more things like this in the future."

This game is great, the small little nitpicks about the original Genesis/Mega Drive Sonic games have been fixed, the controls are tight and responsive, the little details are amazing, the music is impeccable, and the stages are all designed with different play styles in mind, as you can take different routes to the goal.

The newer mechanics are also great, such as the Drop Dash, which is brilliant for newer players as it helps to regain momentum. The boss fights are also inventive, and offer new sparks of life into older stages. And to top it all off, the game is pretty much accessible to anyone, seeing as it doesn't require high-end specs, and can be played at 60fps, like Sonic was meant to be played.10/10, the wave of mediocraty that plauged Sonic is now cleared up to reveal the game we were all waiting for.

,Recommended,584400,34676917,Posted: 1 September,all,Jorge Catala,"Sonic Mania, the game that proves to fans and skeptics alike that new sonic games can be good as long as they're old.Just so you know, this review is coming from a person who owns sonic on multiple platforms from gba to ipad. To say that I'm a sad fan is an understatement. I've played many different fan-made games and have played the official games to near-death. I am familiar with the way of the 'hog. Unfortunately, that may have hindered me in the long run becuase Sonic Mania is everything but new to me.The game looks fantastic and the music is on point. The animations from idol to movement are smooth and nice to look at. There is even some squash and stretch aspects to the animations that give it a fun, cartoony look. The blue sphere mini-game is back and there is a new emerald catching game that is a cross between sonic cd and sonic heroes. There are various modes of play and plenty of collectables that can provide replay value which is essential as I was able to complete the game in about 4 hours. Now let's talk about the stages.I'm trying to be as spoiler-free as possible but the first two stages are green hill and chemical plant and I was immediately annoyed. The first actual new stage doesn't start until the third stage and then you are immediately thrown back to an old stage. In fact, out of the 12 stages that are included in the game, only four are actually new. When I consider the time and effort taken for so many other aspects of the game, it just boggles my mind that this decision was made in regards to the stages. Now this would'nt be such an issue except this was done already in Sonic Generations. Even if you look at the videos and picture advertisements there is more emphasis on the new stages with little advertisements of the many old stages that you will be frequently playing. I feel like at best this was a play it safe decision in an attempt to prevent a sonic game from bombing by playing with your nostalgia and at worst just plain lazy. The new stages are so much fun and there are some changes that were made to the classic stages that KIND OF make them different. However, when 66% of your game is slighlty tweaked exsisting stages, I feel like I'm not playing a new game and instead I'm playing a passionately made fan rom hack. Is that a problem? Well, that depends on you personal point of view. What is the difference between this passionately made fan rom hack and other passionately made fan rom hacks? Answer: Apporoximately $20, other fan made hacks are free and can be just as fun.So where do we go from here? Well obviously I'm recommending the game because I can see it satisfying the sonic hunger. If you are a sonic fan, play sonic super casual, or if you just want to support the developer then by all means support your passion. If you've played sonic to near-death or if you are hesitating for any reason then you may want to hold off for a price drop. I'm thinking somewhere along the lines of $10-$13. I guess I'm just going to have to wait a little longer for the new sonic game I was promised. I'm not mad at the overall finished product, I'm just a little disappointed at the missed potential."

Nothing more. The devs are great and they did a fantastic job.Hate Sega, not this game. This game is a little lovely marshmallow. Hug it. Kiss it. Go to prom with it.This is less a review, and more like a bunch of impressions and opinions putted together. I'll mumble about things and suddenly change topic. So that being said, ahem, lets begin:The whole game was produced by FANS. And you can clearly see that. And I don't mean the clear references to other games or old characters. You can feel how they genuinely played and love the old Sonic games. Not wanting to spoil here, but they even took note of regular ""knowledge"" within the Sonic fandom and applied it to the game. For example, there's one boss in Sonic 2 which has an EXTREMELY obvious weak spot. You can hide in an specific part of the level and the boss won't be able to hurt you at all. Now, a similar boss appears in this game. My first thought was ""Heh, should I try the good old strategy?"". And guess what? They changed that so it makes you feel that they made the same mistake, then BAM, there's an specific attack to that area.But okey, you are not a Sonic fan. You have never played a sonic game, or maybe you have played a few but don't really care, I don't know. This game is still an awesome retro and a platformer. The art is beautiful. And I mean it. I sometimes simply stop in the middle of a level to appreciate the view, or to check the colors they used in certain parts, etc etc etc. The animations are lovely. Not only are they fluid as heck, but also they are overflowing with personality. You see Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and even the enemies and they feel alive! I remember the first time at the ""Ice"" zone, Sonic got frozen and I simply stopped playing because the sprite they used for 'Frozen' Sonic was fantastic! And then I let Tails get frozen too, just to watch his sprite. You know they have made a good job when you consciously stop playing the game just to check this little things. And there are dozen and dozen of other examples. From the first zone to the last one, there's always something worth checking out.Okay, but you are here to play, not to see, right??? The level desing is glorious. Once again, like in old Sonic games, there isn't just one path. No more ""Press forward and you win"". There are tons of alternative routes. I guarantee that if we both play one zone, we will use different paths. And that's great because now you aren't just running throw the level. You are also exploring it. If you miss a jump or accidentally take a different route, then you must better be paying attention because its a completely different world.And of course, if you are a hardcore Sonic fan and have played the classic games tons of times, you will probably notice that some parts are similar to old levels. For example, there are parts in Stardust Speedway Act I that resembles Marbel Garden from Sonic 3. Or some parts in Titanic Monarch that resembles Scrap Brain Zone from Sonic 1, and so on and so forth.Something I like about Mania is that it presents a challenge. Sure, its no Dark Souls or the likes, but as a Sonic veteran, I found myself almost running out of lifes by the endgame. That's something cool. The game won't just sit down and expect you to beat every level in two minutes with over two hundred rings. Sure, you can do that once you get the hand of it. But until then the game will fight back. Power ups are harder to find, so once you get a shield, you better make it count.The new boss fights are cool. I mean, I like the fact that they tried doing new stuff, rather than just making an enemy and making you jump-and-hit. For example, there's a boss which you can't damage by yourself, you have to throw it against some spikes. And if you miss the attack, chances are you will be the one taking damage from those spikes. Believe it or not, it took me some time to realize this. They aren't hard bosses, but they force you to retreat and think a bit about how to adapt your strategy.So yeah, I don't know. The game's great. I love it. The only reason why I've only played 10 hours since yesterday its because I have stupid social and academic obligations. The art is great, the music rocks, the gameplay is cool. There are a bunch of unlockables and the likes. Mini games to get the Chaos Emeralds or Medals (they unlock stuff) are funny and they don't feel repetitive. This game deserves love!10/10, Game of the Year, Game of the Decade, Goat of All Time."

I didn't like Sonic Adventure even when it was new so I kind of blocked off Sonic from my mind from then on, but still went back to replay the originals all the time. Still to this day some of them are my favorite games with so much personality, color and zany 90-isms, and wacky aesthetics. Well here we are 20 some years later and I still can't believe this exists. Christian Whitehead and this team have outdone themselves! Mania is like the Greatest Hits of Sonic mixing in elements of Sonic CD's visual detail and verticality, musical capabilities, mixed in with Sonic 3 & Knuckles' intricately complex level designs. I'm glad they went with the hidden ring warps for the special stages, since that makes hunting emeralds a little more fun and rewards exploration. While Mania has a lot of remixed levels, it ultimately still has its own personality mixing up elements in the second acts of those zones and then the new zones are amazing. All in all this seriously feels like an authentic Sonic release that could have come out on the Saturn. If you didn't like Sonic back then this isn't really any different so don't expect it to change anything, but if you're a long time fan of the old and have been craving for a follow up, this is it! I hope we get more. That said, this game is huge for a classic Sonic! Even longer than Sonic 3 & Knuckles. And there's tons of unlockables and extras.

Especially if your favourite Sonic games are those released in the early 1990s.Ever since I first played Sonic Mania, I've really enjoyed it. Even during my first try.Sonic is a brighter blue, and his appearance is probably similar to what he was supposed to look like in Sonic the Hedgehog (1991, 16 bit version). I also noted increased framerate. Sonic Mania runs a lot smoother than the Sonic games released in the 1990s. The characters have greatly enhanced animations.Blue Spheres is significantly improved in Sonic Mania - The Purple and Green spheres are cool. Every time I play that mini-game, I almost always use the new version.The soundtrack is fantastic (except for Lava Reef 2, I don't like the music used in that stage very much) and it gives me a lot of nostalgia, it revives memories when I first played Sonic the Hedgehog (1991, 16-bit version) back in 2009. The music in reused zones (Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Flying Battery, Stardust Speedway, Hydrocity, Oil Ocean and Lava Reef respectively), and the Bonus Stage (Get Blue Spheres) music is modernised in Sonic Mania and much better than what the music is in the games they appear in that were released in the 1990s.I actually could NOT believe that the Chemical Plant 2 boss is almost the same as Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine when I first reached it. The sound effects in the Mean Bean minigame are good, but they are better in the original versions of Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.Something else easily recognisable is when you are playing as any character (except Knuckles) on Mirage Saloon 1. Sonic and Tails are flying in the Tornado (the red plane), and whoever is piloting it wears flight goggles. I don't know why that wasn't possible back in Sonic 2 (16-bit) and why Sonic fans had to wait for 25 years before the characters were more like an aviation pilot.I just don't know why Sonic Mania also had to have Denuvo with it. No-one told ANY Sonic fan about it until the PC edition was released. That is most likely why Sonic Mania was delayed close to the last second. (The PC (except Windows 10) edition of Minecraft also had 1.12 delayed close to the last moment.) Seriously, is adding Denuvo to the game ""optimisation?"" That is literally absolute nonsense. If your computer fails the system requirements, and if it takes you 4 attempts in one day, and your computer still doesn't pass the system requirements, you WILL be behind to your first-time experience on Sonic Mania. And the compensation? Only Sonic 1, even for free? ONLY Sonic 1? The compensation was NOT good enough. It should have been Sonic 1 AND Sonic 2 AND Sonic 3 & Knuckles, each free of charge. I also don't know why I was also given an extra game. It was SEGA Mega Drive & Genesis Classics. The delay of the PC edition of Sonic Mania also must have made lured some Sonic fans who did NOT have an Xbox One, PlayStation 4 or Nintendo Switch buy one of these consoles. That means 500-600 AUD down the drain, and all because of a game delayed only 4 DAYS before it was supposed to be released. The PC edition of Sonic Mania should have been released on Wednesday, August 16, 2017 AND THEN recieved a bugfix update a fortnight later. Due to everything I mentioned in this paragraph, Denuvo better be removed from Sonic Mania as soon as possible, because the method that SEGA and PagodaWest Games used to handle the Denuvo situation was INCREDIBLY DISGUSTING. Both companies need to realise their mistake, and fast, because, Denuvo is actually dangerous and is sometimes treated as malware. Believe it or not, Denuvo can actually SHORTEN the life of a Solid-state drive. (WARNING: Sonic Forces will be protected by Denuvo. It better be banished from all Sonic games that are playable on PC, and removed from Sonic Forces, or Sonic fans could have their computer unbootable.) Sonic Mania therefore really MUST have Denuvo removed from it, before one's computer's SSD damaged. (Currently, Denuvo on Sonic Mania has been cracked, but better be removed altogether, or else, SEGA and PagodaWest Games (and possibly the authors of Denuvo) will face the consequences.)Either way, I strongly recommend Sonic Mania, and, personally, it is a ""must have"" if you are a Sonic fan, whether you're new to Sonic, or if you are a veteran Sonic fan like me. (I've known Sonic for at least the past 7 years and 9 months.) The game has over 10 hours of nostalgiac fun.Two questions I have been trying to find the answer of for several months:Will the PC edition of Sonic Forces be on the Steam Store? (Answer: Yes) And will it be compatible with Windows 7? (Will most likely be determined in October 2017)"

I have suffered no technical problems with the game. However I feel genuinely hurt, angry, annoyed, and confused as a direct result of SEGA making the decision to add Denuvo Anti-tampering technology to this game. Not only is this intrusive DRM known to negatively impact performance by using valuable RAM and CPU resources that could be better put to use actually running the game, but SEGA also made the shocking and unbelievable mistake of removing all offline functionality. The game will not launch without an internet connection. SEGA claims they are looking into a veriety of launch issues including the lack of offline functionality. Unsurprisingly, this has been resolved as of the morning after launch. The game will now play without an online connection.However even with offline functionality I can not in good conscience recommend you purchase this game. Sonic Mania is a project of passion (by the Mania for the Mania) and the culmination of a lifetimes work and experiance by each of the game's developers. This is legally SEGA's game but its really Christian Whitehead, Headcannon, and PagodaWest's game and judging by Christian Whitehead and Aaron Webber (of Headcannon)'s tweets I believe it is safe to assume they didn't wish for Sonic Mania to be saddled with Denuvo on PC. this negative review comes with a request from a satisfied paying customer who isn't asking you to do this for him but instead to do it for Christian Whitehead, PagodaWest, and Headcannon.

I'm happy that a proper 2D sidescroll Sonic game has been made that does justice to the classics.  Now having said that I will point out a criticism that I do have.  I feel that so far the levels are a little on the bigger/more complex side and a lot of times the player is taken out of control and is put through a lot of speed loops such as in Chemical Plant.  I feel too much of the level gets ignored/bypassed when it's too big and there's too many of those tube/loop things.  Not a major complaint but something I think could have been better.Apparently this was done by the same people who made the 1st and 2nd Sonic games available on mobile and I feel they did a good job with that so when I saw this was a new game with them involved I figured this would be a solid game and it is.  Good job!  I always figured a small 2D Sonic game like this would be fairly easy and cheap to make but also quite popular.  Would like to see this title sell really well and show Sega that this is still a viable/profitable avenue for Sonic in addition to the other 3D games.  Hope to see more like this in the future- but remember smaller, more memorable levels with less speed loops :)"

Sonic Mania is just about everything an old 16-bit fan will remember about ""the good-old days"" of video games in our youth.You'd better shake off that rust however, as this game does get a little harshe at times that even old Sonic pros will find themselves dying and getting caught in traps. This game was made by Sonic fans that knew the franchise in and out and Sega has allowed them to produce the greatest Sonic game in over 20 years, even so far as to say they've ""shown up"" Sonic Team themselves and displayed how to make their own game properly. Mind you, some of the Zones are revised Zones from previous games, but they are updated and altered so much it's like it's given new life. Like you're in parts of the levels from the past you didn't know existed. The new original zones are very well done as well.The Special Stages are a little bit of a learning curve. You have to get used to the layout of the Chaos Emerald Special Stages and the minor Special Stage that you complete to unlock things, is literally the old Sonic 3/Knuckles Sphere Special Stage. The only problem is, I've found a little bit of an input delay with the Sphere Special Stage. (Maybe it's just me? Who knows.)Currently there are some controller issues on the technical side of things like not being able to play a two player game with two controllers and there has been some ""always online DRM"" controversy that may or may not have been fixed already. So take that for what you will and hopefully all will be solved.Otherwise, this is a great game for an old biased Sonic fan that finally got what they were waiting for, for all these years. Especially in a sea of disappointment that is ""other Sonic games""."

Christian Whitehead's versions of Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2 for Android are the best versions of the games available--if only they were available on decent gaming platforms, like PC/Steam (excluding DRM, Sega!)

The achievements seem to be pretty bugged up, as well. If not for all that, I couldn't recommend thismoreto anyone that was in love with the original Sonic games, or if you liked something like Freedom Planet which was a high speed platformer of its own variety. If you can get this on another platform, it may be the better option, sopleaseconsider it if you can and would.Anyway, I've been waiting for a game like this for over 20 years. The sheer unfiltered joy this game brought me was worth every second of that waiting period. These developers don't just know Sonic, theyrespectSonic, and they go to great lengths to make that clear. I cannot stress enough how happy this game has made me, with just a couple of exceptions. Some spoilers lay below, so in spoiler tags they will go.First and foremost, visuals and music. Great stuff. Not much I know how to say on that front.I felt that level design was generally a very strong point. It's mostly a lot like in Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles: They often branch off at many points, giving you plenty of options and rewarding exploration and general player skill. On the note of exploration, the best thing of all returning from those games is that if you stray off the path at just the right time, try jumping into this wall, try pushing that set of spikes or rock, you are often rewarded with some mighty fine goodies - one-up monitors, power-up monitors, or even the best reward of all - big rings. That's my favorite part of this game's level design, and something I was hoping they would do. And boy, did they do it well. The second act of the final zone felt kind of long, though.I absolutely LOVE the special stages. They are hard as heck starting off, but once you know what to do, they all become very very simple.They felt very Saturn-esque with that whole 3D models thing they have going on. Plop that on the list of things that made me very happy.My biggest gripe is this: (in regards to this game'sstar post bonus stages)The Blue Sphere bonus stagesmassivelyoverstayed their welcome. I was happy to see them at first, and they look so nice and smooth, but that particular joy faded away pretty quickly and turned to irritation after a while. It truly sucked that instead of the rewarding bonus stages in Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles that generally left you pretty well off and packing serious heat, you instead do these tedious stages and get absolutely nothing worthwhile in the end for it. Seriously,screw this. I don't think I'll ever purposely grab a star post in this game again now that I have all gold medals, and next to nothing is motivating me to play the cool extra kind you get when you're done with all the starpost ones.I had no trouble with most of the bosses, and I don't quite feel like they're a weak point, but at the same time many of them simply weren't my cup of tea.Some of these bosses involved a lot of long waiting until you got the chance to attack. At least one or two of them are frustrating until you realize there's a very easy and specific thing you can do to nearly cheese them. With that said, I don't hate any of these bosses or anything.On a more positive note, there was a specific Act 2 one that came out of nowhere and hooooly crap. My mind was utterly shattered, and I mean this in the best possible way. I can't even describe what I felt at that moment, and I feel an incredible pity for anyone that winds up spoiled on it. Same sentiment for an Act 1 boss later on: it took me by total surprise and left me in a heck of a happy mood. In general, these bosses were very creative and done well, but I think a few of them were not necessarily that fun to fight, at least from my perspective. Your mileage may vary quite drastically.I absolutely loved the selection of stages. I'm looking at this game purely from a ""this is a celebration of Sonic"" standpoint, and from that I can very much enjoy the classic stages with no hindrance. In fact I think I did generally enjoy the classic stages more than the new ones, though I do imagine that's a fairly unpopular opinion. Without being specific, but giving some numbers:There were three stages that I didn't really want to see, but after I played the Mania-ization of them here, I was very glad they were included. There were four that I was really hoping to see and it did my happiness level some serious good to see them, let me tell you.I very much enjoy the fact that AI Tails can airlift Sonic like in the Android/IOS Sonic 1/2 remakes, which is pretty nice to have, especially for easier higher-up exploration. This is probably also unpopular, but I honestly love having Tails as a buddy friend partner when playing as Sonic. Kind of wish you could have him following you around as Knuckles, but oh well.If you pick this up, be sure to complete a save for every character -  you will see some differences, and I certainly enjoyed a few things related to one character.I had one stage's gimmick randomly kill me and encountered a weird bug in the bonus stages, and have seen a fair few general bugs circulating around when checking out other folks' experiences with this game. That's mighty unfortunate.My final verdict is ""I all kinds of love it but it's got some annoying issues here and there - would still certainly recommend it 100% if you were ever a fan of the Genesis / Mega Drive Sonic games"". Honestly I feel rather saddened that I may never get to feel another surge of unrestricted joy like that which this game has brought me ever again. Once in a lifetime experience, this was. Awesome game, made me happy and I see myself playing a LOT of it again and again and again, but again - it's not without its share of issues."

NOT PC.I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone buy a port of a game that has no online functionality (leaderboards don't count), yet packs in a particularly nasty sort of DRM that requires that you are online at all times, while also posing a damage risk to anyone who has their operating system installed on a Solid State Drive.I don't know who responsible for what seems like a last-minute inclusion of this DRM, though I very highly doubt it was the developers themselves. To you who decided that Sonic Mania for PC should have Denuvo stapled onto it, shame on you.I have uninstalled this game from my PC, and will never reinstall it until a patch drops that removes this DRM outright. The Steam client should be the only form of DRM you need, if even that.When I first get the chance, I will buy Sonic Mania for PS4 and give it a positive review for that platform.Pray for the Sonic Mania development team. I very much worry for them now."

This is as important for Time Attack as it is for emerald-seeking; both of these activities will challenge the player's creativity and encourage exploration.Exploration is a real pleasure, too. The levels are rich - like, Knuckles Chaotix +1 tiles & colors - with regular adjustments to color palettes between Acts of the same Zone. Unlike Chaotix, each section of a level is unique from the other sections. The music accentuates exploration with its own jazz influences: sprawling solos unraveling in parallel with the stage's twists & turns. While repising Zones maintain their traditional themes (remixed with care by Tee Lopes), the new compositions - and their respective stages! - are some of my favorite from a Sonic game so far.""The Sonic game for the Saturn we never got."" Pretty much sums it up.If you pick this up for Steam, be advised that there is not currently native joypad support. As such, a joypad to keyboard mapper (such as Joy2Key with a high sample rate) is highly recommended."

The production values are high despite being mostly indie developers and fans working on it and the soundtrack is impressive. Revisiting levels from the past (again) is always fun in a game that rewards mastery, as you'd already know most of the route and come up to the subtle changes with intrigue.But it sucks that it was delayed for the sole purpose of incorporating Denuvo, unannounced. It has caused many technical issues for many people and does not allow you to play this offline game without an internet connection. Also, despite this, people have still found a way to cheat in the online leaderboards (the top times for Green Hill Zone Act 1 is 0'00""00 flat).I would not recommend the PC version, get it on console and enjoy the input lag."

Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric. My god those games were bad. There were a few decent gems like Sonic Generations and the Sonic Rivals games on PSP (yes I liked those games, okay?), the Mario and Sonic Olympic games weren't all that bad either, come to think of it. The rest of the games in that period were serviceable but nothing compared to the golden age of Sonic, I mean how many people talk about Shadow the Hedgehog nowadays? It wasn't that bad of a game but its not particularly remembered fondly in regards to the place it holds in the series.Honestly, those games are just a mere dip into the swamp of Sonic games released since the original, I admit I had to google for a list of the games. I had no idea there was this many games. Sonic somehow got worse over time, with the various ways the game industry changed, which in turn affected how games are made and played.The fans of old games grew up to become developers of the newer games.Which is how we end up with Sonic Mania, a faithul recreation, update, and tribute to how great Sonic used to be, redesigning classic levels like the iconic Green Hill Zone as well as introducing us to new levels like Studiopolis. The new levels fit perfectly with the classic ones, almost as if they had been there all along. Thats just how great Mania is.A true love letter from fans of the series, Mania nails the very essence of old school Sonic, back when he was chubbier and was all about speed, not the slimmer, edgier version we have now. Still, no one is as edgy as Shadow, but thats a whole other story. The devs behind this gem definitely poured their heart and soul into this game and it shows.Admittedly, it took me some time to grow accustomed to how Sonic handles, after all it has been a while since I played a Sonic game. I forgot that you can't climb in this, there are no guns, no swords, just running, jumping and slamming. The traditional platforming events, if you will.For the most part I took my time through the majority of the zones, looking for secrets and hidden areas, my score suffered for this though. After scouring every nook and cranny, I would either finally make it to a boss and die or simply restart and rush through, in true Sonic style.The bosses were a mixed bag for me, not in terms of how they act etc, but how much I died to them. It made me realise that damn, I am dreadful at platformers at times, that boss fights are all about finding a weakness and exploiting it, I can't run around hoping to accidentally beat them. But hey, at least the bosses are varied and force you to come up with a different tactic for each one, the first one was a simple dodge and hit them when they stop moving, for example, with a later one forcing you to dodge missiles and throw a certain one at them until they are defeated.Its about damn time that Sega have finally provided us with an amazing Sonic game, even if they forced DRM onto the steam version, which caused it to be delayed by two weeks and rightfully♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off many fans, as the devs themselves requested they complain about it.Despite this though, Sonic Mania has cemented itself as one of the greats.Review originally posted on:https://gamefold.co.uk/sonic-mania-review/"

No, not at all.Does it have some kind of DRM? Yes.Does it deserve the hate just for the DRM, and does it deserve no purchase? No, again.Sonic Mania is everything you could love in a game for what it is, an amazingly detailed and robust platformer, with plenty of difficulty. $20 dollars and you're setting sail on the nostalgic trip to the 90's,  Sonic Mania has a wonderful quark about combining the old levels you knew as kids where you and your friends are taking turns beating levels and getting stuck on certain bosses for a few tries, and adds new and refreshing content to boot.If you think a simple DRM on this game is worth ignoring this wonderful game, you are sadly denying yourself a truly entertaining experience.You have the option of playing as either Sonic and Tails (Duo), Knuckles, or simply Tails alone, which gives you a total of (3) multiple play styles, each catered to fit certain players and playstyles. This means everyone should explore there options with characters, I played through with Sonic and Tails my first try, but found Knuckles with his Glide and Wall Climb to be much more fun!In addition, the levels themselves offer multiple routes for players to take, promoting exploration and replayability for the longevity of the game. (It's only $20 bucks, c'mon!)As for bosses, they are extremely versatile and different in regards that you never know what to expect, so certain players may find some bosses really easy, and others oddly challenging due to their unique nature.I would shamelessly give this game a 10, delete it, then give it a 10 again just because it's that damn good. Sonic Mania so good it makes you want it again. So what are you waiting for, stop reading this stupid, long-winded and over exaggerated review? Buy the damn game already and play it!"

This game throws in new levels, new mechanics, new characters, in the midst of recalling what was best about those games, and drops like a hot potato what irritated us about them (When's the last time you played an honest-to-goodness FUN water level in a 2-d platformer? And yet Sonic Mania brings back 3's Hydrocity Zone and makes it FUN, rather than a hunt-for-the-oxygen-bubbles panic-fest.)I don't know what the modern gamer expects from the rebirth of retro Sonic gaming, but as a young man who grew up loving and raging at the old games in equal measure, and has since grown very accustomed to the conventions of modern gaming, this game is exactly what it's supposed to be, and it SHINES.

This game exceeded all of my expectations and nearly made me feel like a kid again. I've already beaten it multiple times with every character getting all of the chaos emeralds each time, and I still plan to go back for more.If you're a classic Sonic fan and want a beautiful love letter to every thing that made those games what they were, with plenty of references to give you a laugh or two, this is the perfect game for you. Even if you're not knee deep in nostalgia like I am there's so much to enjoy about this game:1. Amazing physics, where every movement you make has so much weight and momentum behind it, mastering the controls is a joy2. Fantastic level design, where the ability to absolutely blaze through the level is easily atainable and loads of fun, but slowing down and exploring is encouraged and you're rewarded handsomely for doing so3. An outstanding soundtrack, where not one song is forgettable and if you're like me you'll be humming and whistling them all day long4. Bonus stages, which are often cited as a negative in classic Sonic games this time around are loads of fun and just the right amount of challengingI can't recommend this game enough. The negative reviews you're seeing are pretty much all because of a third party anti-piracy program that was included in the PC version called Denuvo, which is widely hated and SEGA included it into this game in a scummy way where they didn't properly inform us. If you're wary of this, read up on Denuvo and decide for yourself if buying this game on this platform is worth it for you. If not, I highly, HIGHLY recommend buying it and playing it somewhere; if you have a console this was released on, buy it there. Just buy and play this absolute masterpiece of a game and see Sonic how he was meant to be seen; not as some joke whose name is synonymous with bad games, but as a legend who starred in some of the best games ever made, Sonic Mania no exception."
,Recommended,584400,34955616,Posted: 14 September,all,Stjames221,"Sonic Mania Embodies Pure HappinessSonic Mania was a game i was pretty excited for when it was announced. I played all mobile ports of the classic sonic games and my attention was grabbed when they announced a new classic Sonic game. It was a setup for a fantastic game, Taxman and Stealth were working on the game, the music is composed by Tee Lopes, and it is finally a true return to form for Sonic the Hedgehog. It was by the Mania, for the Mania. And oh did it deliver. This game is my new favorite Sonic the Hedgehog game of all time.Classic Sonic Gameplay ElementsIf you didn't know, the Classic Sonic Gameplay style is made of three parts:Speed, Momentum, and Exploration. Speed is self explanitory, momentum is what you need to get speed and exploration is looking for stuff like lives and special stages. And the developers knocked all 3 out of the park but I have a issue with is how speed and exploration is handled. You see speed can hinder exploration. One time, I think the developers intentionally placed a freaking booster right by an extra life and a 10 ring monitor. I ended up losing the opportunity to get that life because of a terribly placed trolling booster.  When you have something that is so trolly it discourages players from exploring because they'll assume every secret will pass the by.The Game Over ProblemWHO THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE IT RESTART TO ACT FREAKING ONE WHEN YOU GET A GAME OVER. It should reset to the beginning of the act if you had a game over. I know it's easy to get back to where u were but on your first playthrough it can be a huge pace breaker. Especially in Titanic Monarch Zone where you go through the whole stage just to have a boss rush while also fighting Dr. Eggman(which can remove a lot of your lives btw). In this instance it would have been good to have this particular boss fight be it's own Act(assuming they change it to reset the act instead of the whole freaking entire zone on game over.The Edgy AF Drop-DashEnough of the Negative lets introduce a huge positive, the freaking edgy afDrop Dash. The drop dash is a move that allows you to do an instant spindash when you hit the ground. It's a bit slower than a quick spindash but it can be really fun to use. You can turn on a dime, go up a slope without gathering momentum and just feel like a speed demon. It's inclusion addresses a need of more options when trying to access speed and momentum.The Special StagesAND OH THE SPECIAL STAGES! The chaos emerald special stages are actually FUN!! The goal  of the special stages is to catch a UFO by collecting blue orbs and rings to increase speed and time. It is well designed because in my opinion anything that feels like it has the potential to be a great stand alone game is probably super well designed. I feel that it could be a good and addictive mobile game.MusicTee lopes, you are a freaking genius.

It has everything that makes Sonic good, and also adds new things that mix it up and make it even better. The Chaos Emerald Mini-Game is great fun, and I always look forward to those, and this game actually makes me want to explore the stage instead of rushing to the end, which both options are quite fun indeed in this game. It's way better than the crappy level design in Sonic CD, in which I just wanted the game to be over as soon as possible.This is the perfect balance between speed, platforming, and exploration, and I only wish there were more original stages, but what was there was great. Not to mention there's a ton of possibilities for playthroughs, such as playing as Sonic, Sonic + Tails, Tails, Knuckles, and a very cool mode that you can have even MORE Knuckles.This game is filled with everything a Sonic fan wants, and the Chemical Plant boss and the Desert Boss are simply awesome. I loved all the fan service as it didn't feel like it was right in your face or anything. It was all really cool.The only thing I don't like is how they delayed the game for two weeks to input Denuvo. You can't even play the game offline, which is really, really crappy.Over-all, the game itself is good, but the Denuvo inclusion is such a shame."

This game is amazing and you should be playing it if you love the classic Sonic games, or if you just love Sonic in general.

First, because I genuinely think it's a great game and definitely the best Sonic platformer since Sonic 3/Sonic & Knuckles. I mean seriously, this game is awesome, if you like 2D Sonic games there is nothing not to like about this game. The graphics, the music, the gameplay and feel of the controls, it's all there and it's awesome.I also have to write this positive review because of all the anti-DRM shouting nonsense going on. I am by no means at all in support of DRM in any games, but good grief. That's jus tthe way PC games are, espeicially good ones. Steam itself is DRM. I've seen much worse forms of DRM control (ahem,Battle.net, Uplay, Origin..) than this in other games.People are making a mountain out of an ant hill about this and even making downright false accusations (such as how it will prevent modding, cause performance issues and even damage hardware or cause corruption.. seriously?).

It has felt like forever since we got a sonic game like this. The level design is amazing as well as the art design on many of them. The Soundtrack are awesome and make you bounce around in your chair from the catchy tunes of the level. The game responds well and each act has a mini boss at the end. Normally you would only encounter a boss at the third act of each stage but not here. It's great to have a boss battle at the end of each act. They took everything that made sonic great over the decades and put them all in here as a full package.Don't let all the downvotes about DRM push you away from this great title

And i'll try not to spoil it.So the controls work pretty good for this game, and the new drop-dash mechanic is hard to use, and not ALWAYS useful, But it's still nice either way. The levels balance between Sonic 2's short speedy levels, and Sonic 3 (&Knuckles) Vast, Gimmick-filled labyrinths. The beautiful graphics can definetly keep your eyes open, but the pixelated graphics, while very true to Sonic 2's and Knuckles' Chaotix graphics, do limit the games sprites, and backrounds.A problem I had with the original games is that they were too difficult to newer generations, like myself. (though I have beat Sonic 2 and 3)But For the first half of this game, I always felt like it was my fault if I made a mistake, and even though I don't really like hard games, atleast It was my fault, but some deaths due to being crushed do eventually get a little unfair, but it's nothing that really stands out. This ""Denuvo"" DRM had me kind of worried, but didn't harm my computer in any way (but I recommend doing a Virus scan first to be safe anyway)Overall this is one of the most highly rated Sonic games in years, (possibly ever) and for good reason. It stays true to the original Sega Genesis games, but fixes almost everything they did wrong, and in my opinion,is a very fun and high quality game.

76561198092138103,Recommended,584400,34626251,Posted: 30 August,all,Sword of Flames,"Boy oh boy, where to start...I'll try not to reveal any spoilers, but there probably will be some later in this review. Sonic Mania, in short, is an amazing game. Not only does it perfectly recapture the feel and charm of the old classics, but it improves upon them in every way. Smoother animations, better framerate, updated graphics, widescreen, enhanced musical tracks, you name it. Christian Whitehead and his team really gave this game their all, and it payed off tremendously. This is honestly one of the best games I've played in a while, let alone Sonic games. All of the levels do a great job of making you feel like your going fast without the game helping you along. Every zone brings something new to the table, and each act's gimmick works flawlessly. The game has 12 zones in it, 8 of them being recreated zones from older Sonic games (Sonic 1, 2, 3&K, and CD), and the other 4 being entirely new concepts. The old zones have been given a shiny new coat of paint, and each one has it's own new mechanic that it didn't have before. Some are callbacks to other zones that don't appear in the game, some of them are entirely new. These levels feel great, and I love them, but the game truly shines when they try something new with the brand new zones they created for this game. They all feel so unique and special, and they're definitely the best parts of the game. None of the boss battles are particularly frustrating (although some of them are rather long), and they all fit so well. As this is a Sonic game, there are, of course, 7 Chaos Emeralds that are collected via finding a giant ring hidden somewhere in each level, and completing a Special Stage. These Special Stages are by far the most enjoyable Special Stages I've ever played in a 2D Sonic game. They're fast, fun, and reward you for taking risks. The only thing I'd like to see is an extra that allows us to play multiple randomly generated Special Stages at our leisure, as done with the Blue Sphere stages (which do make a return from S3&K). Since the game is based off the Sonic from the 90's, there are tons of references to Sega's past, Sonic's past, and 90's pop culture in general. Sounds from other Sega titles being used, references to old Sonic advertisements, etc. The game also features various unlockable extras, including new abilities that Sonic can use, and the ever meme-tastic ""& Knuckles"" mode, which basically has Knuckles follow the player around like Tails would with Sonic, regardless of which character you play as (Yes, Knuckles himself included).Then we get on to my complaints.First of all, the PC version of the game was delayed for 2 weeks after the game's initial launch, due to last minute optimization. I was fine with this. What I was not fine with, was downloading the game and playing it to find that it is extremely buggy, and far easier to break than other versions of the game. I'm not sure if this was just me, but I had numerous problems when I played the game, and I still do. One of the most notable was when I got to a particularly long boss battle, where the music stops and comes back in once the boss appears. However, the music did not restart, so I was left fighting this boss in complete silence for a good 3 minutes, besidses the occasional jump or spin-dash sound effect.This is where I start to get spoilery, so if you don't like that, skip down to the TL;DRThe worst problem I had with the game was attempting to complete the ""Knuckles & Knuckles"" mode with the true ending. I've heard that it has a special ending for if you beat it with all the Chaos Emeralds. So, naturally, being the meme-enthusiast I am, I went through the entire game in one sitting, collected all the emeralds, and got to the (first) final boss. After beating in in about 40 seconds because I was Super Knuckles (& Knuckles), The transition played where the Phantom Ruby (this gemstone that you and Robotnik are fighting over the whole game) causes everything to go negative, then flash white, and fade to black. As this was the same thing that happened when I played the Sonic true ending, I expected it to cut back to the true final boss. However, nothing happened. The screen stayed black. Eventually, I closed out, restarted the game (with debug mode enabled), and beat it again. The same thing happened. So that was my whole afternoon entirely wasted, and I refuse to look up a YouTube video to find the ending until I do it myself.TL;DRSonic Mania is a wonderful game that you should definitely pick up. It's fast, fun, and just a good time. However, at the moment, the PC version appears to be the most broken version of the game, and needs a lot of work before it can compete with it's console counterparts, and I say that as a very anti-console gamer. Not to mention the whole ""Denuvo DRM"" thing, which I refuse to go into now (this review's long enough already).So overall, do I recommend you get this game? Yes. Absolutely. 100%. This is a must-have game. Do I recommend you get it on PC? No. Absolutely not. 0%. Until the PC version has all of it's kinks worked out, you're better off getting the game on a PS4, Xbox, or Switch.The game itself: 10/10, an instant classic.This specific version: 6/10, needs a lot of work."

,Recommended,584400,34624148,Posted: 30 August,all,Bloodenguts,"Been with Sonic since the beginning and was getting quite used to terrible new entries that popped up every so often. I've played them all, with the exception of the racing titles, including all of the classics and this basically resembles a bunch of those mashed together in a way that feels both new and nostalgic. With the exception of Generations, I have not played a worthy game featuring the blue hedgehog in quite some time... possibly not since Sonic Advance on GBA.This is absolutely worth the money if, like me, you grew up with a Megadrive/Genesis and your parents could not understand how you didn't have seizures when you raced through the levels with all of those vivid colors spinning around everywhere. This captures all of that thrill while enhancing and tweaking a few little things without compromising the core feel of what the Sonic games are supposed to be."
,Recommended,584400,34624349,Posted: 30 August,all,1IanMario,"Putting all that DRM stuff aside, I've seen people complain about how the 2 weeks weren't used at all for the ""optimizations"" and bug fixes that SEGA promised it would be used for.The truth is, they were used correctly. The DRM was one thing. The PC release was much better day one than console releases as it does fix many of the bugs that were found in those two weeks, helping the game stabilize, and issues that other people experience are just because of the fact that there's so many types and varations of computers that it's hard to make a product work for everyone on PC. But that's besides the point. Here's my actual review.Sonic Mania is an AMAZING game which references the old Genesis Sonic games, while adding SO MUCH more to the mix. Of course, it starts off normal, but it throws a curveball and remixes the old zones in ways that most people wouldn't expect, adding brand new elements and many brand new branching paths within levels that they'll feel so different in new runs.On top of that, the new zones are amazingly unique and original, and the art style and such assets of these levels manages to match the old Genesis/Saturn feel perfectly in an already amazing Classic game.This is still a Classic Sonic game. A FULL Classic Sonic game with perfect controls, amazing replayability, amazing cleverness and level design, and it's just an all around masterpiece.A must have if you're a Sonic fan. 10/10"

76561198061432657,Recommended,584400,34645699,Posted: 31 August,all,RicketyCricket,"This is awkwardINTROSo you know how things go with review bombing. People have a huge problem with a game, they downvote it in droves, and if they see any reviews with a blue thumb up, they downvote that too, regardless of the content of the review. So I can only hope that there are some people that see this review and get something out of it before it is downvoted into the abyss.This game containsDenuvo DRM. A huge boogeyman for the PC gaming community, and a justified one. This will not be the first review you read that lets you know about the existence of Denuvo in this game, as every single one is doing so. So long story short, Denuvo sucks, and always online DRM shouldn't exist in a game you purchased. Fighting piracy shouldn’t mean inconveniencing your paying customers. If you have a hardline stance against Denuvo and its mere existence is enough to ruin a game for you, don't buy this game and if you already have, you not recommending it is a completely justifiable viewpoint.ITHE GAMEI am obviously a hater of Denuvo as much as anyone, but there is one single thing that is preventing me from slapping a ""Do Not Recommend"" on the game, and it's this: throughout my entire time playing this game so far, I have had a gigantic smile across my face. It's just too beautiful.As a gamer who grew up in the 90s, I am a huge fan of the classic 2d Sonic games and became immediately disenfranchised with the series when it had a bumpy ride converting to 3d and added a cavalcade of uninteresting characters and over the top voice acting. For years I have yearned for Sega to give the 2d sonics a real second chance, with Sonic Generations being the only thing coming close to scratching that itch. But even that required enduring bits of the era of Sonic I do not like and was unremarkable in the art design department, in my opinion. Then there was Sonic 4, which I truly believe tried, but overall was a swing and a miss in capturing the charm of the classics.But this… this is perfect.From the level design, to the art design, to the speed, to the gorgeous sprite work, to the CRT filter, to the kickass music, THIS game feels like exactly what a Sonic game would be if they kept making 2d games, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, and mostly failing. It plays just like the classic sonics, it looks like classic sonic and the new additions are brilliant and right at home in the 2d sonic universe. I am not the first person to say this by a long shot, but THIS is the game that should have been named Sonic 4.My only complaint is like many others’ only complaint: the new levels are absolutely breathtaking and I would have loved to see more. I hope beyond hope that this game does well enough to warrant a sequel, because I want to see what the devs could do without the need to remake classic levels, although the classic levels remixed here are brilliant as well.In the end, it may be a strangely controversial opinion, but it’s a simple one: this game made me happy. I’m happy it exists, I’m happy that I get to play it, I’m happy that it proves that the Sonic games I grew up with can be right at home in this current generation. And since the DRM, as crappy as it is, did not diminish my happiness while I was playing it, I must personally recommend it. This is a great game for fans of classic Sonics and general platformer fans alike. I love it."

Each character has differing abilities (as in Sonic 3&K), allowing you to find various alternate pathways to get to the end of each level.  While many zones are from Sonic 1, 2, CD, and 3&K, the developers have managed to add new spins on them (especially in the 2nd Acts of each)  The brand new zones are also superb, fitting in right at home with the many nostalgic stages.This is a GREAT game.

I've waited years for this and I will continue to enjoy playing it for years to come but most of the remixed Zones are not the Zones I would have chosen to include in the game. Hydocity is the only exception being my favorite classic Sonic Zone but where the hell is Marble Garden and Hill Top? Can't understand having a Sonic CD Zone over either of those when Sonic CD has already had the whitehead touch. I would have perferred a full conversion of Sonic 3 and Knuckles first and then a truly original game to follow at a later date. This is a great start, I hope this means SEGA are finally listening to us old school fans but will there be more or is this all we get?"

That's not to say the new stages aren't amazing as well!

76561198069734989,Not Recommended,584400,34589828,Posted: 29 August,all,iRaged,"The Good:Its a fun Sonic Game.  If you played Sonic in the 90s then you should pick this up for the feels regardless of the cons that I will discuss below.  The music is amazing and the stages run around 5-7 mins a pop and are well designed.  If you aren't a Sonic fan then this is a purchase that you may or may not regret.  $25 CAD is a bit expensive imo for this game when you can grab something like DOOM for the same price.The Bad:There are a few bugs in the game.  In my playthrough, I died two times to two very different bugs, one being a soft lock and another where a piranha fish would latch onto me and I couldn't jump so I'd just drown with no chance to survive.  Hopefully these bugs get patched.  There were many documented on the console release via youtube and they are still present on the PC release after this two weak hiatus of waiting (not to patch the game, but to add DRM).  Bosses feel awkward in a sense that some are extremely easy and some are quite frustrating, the difficulty doesn't progress properly as some of the latter bosses are a joke meanwhile mid game bosses pose a challenge.  Aparently there is no controller support .... I have no idea how that happened but it's mind baffling!The Ugly:DENUVO has been found in the game.  I dont know if this effects performance or not since I do not own a console version however I have noticed at times some button presses are not responsive, however that may be intended or may be just me not use to playing Sonic on a Mechanical KB.  Overall, DENUVO is pi$$ing off the community (Lots of negative reviews) since we waited two weeks for SEGA to implement a DRM that will probably be cracked within 5 days.  It feels like SEGA took a giant $hit on the community and left a pi$$ stain for good measure.Overall Verdict:If bugs are fixed and DENUVO is removed like it should be (other game publlishers have removed it before), I'll give the game 9/10 and I will recommend it.If bugs are not fixed and DENUVO remains, I would only recommend this game to Sonic Fans, otherwise, I do not recommend atm.Lastly, if you are wondering:  Sonic&Knuckles w/ Sonic 3 attached > Sonic Mania.  I think the biggest gripe i have is that the latter part of the game kinda falls apart with regards to progression into a tangible story line.  The last stage doesn't feel right to me.  If some DLC is added to fix up some storyline then I can see SM=S&K3."

The sprites are lively, very well animated, and expressive. The Music is top notch and really gets that 90's Pop vibe accross thanks to Tee Lopes' excellent composition skills! The controls are just as you remember from S3&K, and Christian Whitehead and Headcanon deserve every bit of praise for making such a great Sonic game!HOWEVERThe one thing that brings the PC version down is the Denuvo DRM. Sonic Mania was made to be played offline, yet Denuvo prevents offline play so you always have to be online. Denuvo can also shorten the lifespan of HDDs and SSDs due to the DRM constantly scanning your computer for any changes in internal hardware.

My first Sonic game ever played was Sonic Adventure 2 Battle; and I didn't get a taste of the classic Genesis titles until Mega Collection on the GameCube. That being said, Classic Sonic still feels new to me, and not like something I grew up with, therefore, it feels fresh.And Mania is the best damn thing since Sonic Sliced Bread and truly a love letter to Classic Sonic fans and even just Sonic fans in general. This game is so full of love for its fanbase. It's functional, flows well, looks stunning, and while being a retro throwback to the glory days of 25 years ago, it feels fresh and new.

,Recommended,584400,34603997,Posted: 30 August,all,Saph,"Don't let the title fool you, this is Sonic the Hedgehog 4...& Knuckles./funnymemeI grew up on classic Sonic, I played my first one when I was still in diapers. Of course the cogniscience and hand-eye co-ordination didn't kick in until a few years later so I never really beat any of them in my younger years.Then came the PS1 and I eventually decided to go back and retry the series when I grew tired of it. I beat them all and grew to simply adore the Sonic & Knuckles cart and how it worked with Sonic 3 and 2. Then when I eventually got an Xbox one Christmas I got Mega Collection Plus and beat them all over again, only this time I was able to do all 3 with every chaos emerald.Then the bombshell of Doomsday Zone in 3 & Knuckles dropped in front of me and I was just completely awe-struck by how awesome it was. I was a young teenager at this point and had played through most of the 3D games as well, but after that magical experience I convince myself to do the same in any of the 3D games that had them.Over the years I started to appreciate the games more on a design viewpoint and started to distance myself from the 3D games. The nail in that coffin came when I got a PS3 with 06 and Unleashed. I LOVED the day Stages on Unleashed but the night ones just curbed that enthusiasm. Then I delved into 06...Boy of boys was 06 a fun journey. It was a buggy, broken unfinished mess of a game and succeeded in killing any hope of me seeing another good Sonic game. Then came Sonic 4 Episode 1. The way the momentum just stopped whenever I would jump and land made me turn it off before the fourth zone. I was actually a little depressed to think that even the classic line of games had finally been tainted.Fast forward to 2016 and I happen upon the hilariously bad ""that's the sound of 25 years of Sonic"" stream. Then out of the blue comes a trailer for, well for something that just screamed ""FRESH"". Of course I'm talking about Mania's reveal. It blew my mind to see Sega contract their treasured franchise to fans that made several well known projects that had garnered a lot of praise from the community.I waited and waited, Mania and Bloodstained Ritual of the Night being the only two games I was seriously looking forward to for over a year. Finally, it dropped... On consoles that I do not currently own. Another two weeks of waiting and a copy of Sonic 1 that managed to eat up one of those 14 days and I finally get to install and launch the game.I sit there for over four straight hours, blast processing my way through zones old, new and remixed. Fighting bosses that challenged everything I knew about the classic games' bosses and then some. Checkpoint special zones that took me to again, old and new levels of my favourite special stage format in the franchise.I was blown away. I was playing the game in tandem with my friend who I bought a copy for and we were just loving the time the game was eating. I still get goosebumps from some of the new mechanics and a lot of returning enemies that were used in clever and inventive ways to provide a fresh yet familiar experience.I knew a year ago and I know now, Sonic Mania was a passion project through and through. You can make as many games as you want in a franchise, but there is no substitute for passion. That first playthrough felt nothing short of magical, it was an experience that felt long overdue and I enjoyed and am still enjoying every minute of it.Sure the always online startup issue was bad, sure there are a few minor bugs, sure the game won't be everyone's cup of tea. But it's enough for me to just know that I honestly and truly got a fulfilling experience from the game.And I still don't have all the emeralds on any of my files, so I know I still haven't seen everything yet and that very fact is why I'm so incentivised to replay the game many times over. Heck I'll be doing so for years to come most likely. Very few games can make me want to come back time and again years after they're released, but I already know Mania is one for the list.Christian Whitehead and his team did a phenomenal job and surpassed all my expectations, I honestly will always recommend their works to my friends and anyone who asks for my opinion of them.TL:DRI really like this game and recommend at least trying it. Though it might be better for newcomers to play through Sonic 1, 2, 3 & Knuckles and CD to get the same sort of experience I had. Not mandatory of course, a good game is a good game to me."

Act 2 is always a completely new experience unlike any of the past level designs, but staying true to the genesis era of mechanics.No new annoying gimmicks, no new annoying voice audio... just clean, well tuned Genesis era Sonic.The return of the Collect the Blue Orbs bonus stages had me wary at first, but the levels are designed great and fair. The new ""Catch the UFO"" is interesting, and almost reminds me of an old school Mario Kart (though not rly).Lastly, and what prompted me to immediately tab out and write this review is.... Dr Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine has returned... Maybe its a one off throwback, but it had me in tears (happy crying?).This game is a true return to form for anybody who grew up playing the Genesis era of Sonic games, and is finally an achieved version of what I feel they tried to go for several times in the past decade of 2d Sonic games."

I was told that the Denuvo DRM would preventing me from enjoying the game, that it would ruin my SSD, that the game would lag every 20 minutes as at phones home, as one review attests, written by a user on a state-of-the-art Tandy 1000 computer. And so far, it's done NONE of those things.I mean, I thought we might be on our way to a bad time when the game wouldn't recognize my Dualshock 4, but it turns out my 3rd party drivers weren't configured correctly. I want to blame it on Denuvo so bad, because I have no awareness of my own confirmation bias, but I'm afraid I can't do that. The controller worked fine with no configuration required within the game itself, so the promise of broken controller support is... broken.The game runs at a smooth and consistent framerate (probably 60 frames per second, though I didn't count them), so the promise of poor performance was not kept. The game did not attempt to access the internet once it started, so doesn't even phone home constantly like I was promised.But here's the worst part. After quitting the game, exiting Steam, disabling my network adapter, loading Steam in Offline mode, and attempting to run the game... IT STARTED UP JUST FINE! Holy f**king s**tcakes are you s**ting me?! That was the biggest promise the community made, broken like my dreams of moving out of dad's basement. I was promised a terrible time, and I didn't get what I was promised.What's that? How's the game itself? Oh, it's absolutely fantastic, are you kidding? I haven't had such a nostalgia rush since... well yesterday when I bought Starcraft: Remastered, but I digress.Realtalk: The DRM concerns are overblown. I won't blame you if you want to avoid this one for philosophical reasons, but as a practical matter, I wouldn't have known the DRM was there if you hadn't told me, and you'd be missing out on the best Sonic game since S3&K.

Sonic Mania was created by Christian Whitehead, known for his Sonic fangames in the past, and contribution towards remastering Sonic 1, CD, and 2. If you're a classic Sonic fan you'll be extremely satisfied, the gameplay perfectly emulates the feeling of the originals, with incredibly fun momentum and speed based platforming. One playthrough simply isn't sufficient, like every classic Sonic game you're encouraged to visit multiple times, discover new paths, etc. Mania brings this back in full scale, as these are some of the biggest levels in any Sonic game comparable to Sonic 3 & Knuckles. The game takes the best elements from the classic era to bring something completely new yet also familiar. The music done by Tee Lopes is an absolute godsend, you'll see familiar classics remixed and new original tunes. There are a whopping 12 zones with 2 acts so you have a game on par with Sonic 3 & Knuckles in terms of length, very suiting for the $20 pricetag. The only downsides I could really list are the lack of new original zones as majority of the zones are just classic stages remixed, and also the denuvo drm which is incredibly anti-consumer. Because of denuvo I'd want to leave this review neutral, but otherwise this is the best Sonic game we've had in years, go out and get it, you would definitely find enjoyment out of this even if you don't have any prior experience with the older Sonic games."

76561198413626819,Recommended,584400,34609015,Posted: 30 August,all,FyreNexus32,"Sonic Mania was billed as a complete nostalgic trip from its very inception, but many fans wondered just how much of the game is a rehash of the original games, and how much of it, if at all, breathes fresh air into the long-running franchise. I’m a longtime Sonic the Hedgehog fan and a die-hard SEGA fanboy, so I had some high expectations going into this title. Sonic Mania comes off as an honest-to-goodness entry within the classic Sonic the Hedgehog titles. The games visuals are directly linked to classic sprite work, environments, and character models, however everything comes off with a crisp, high-definition veneer.Coming from this, there are lots of little tweaks, new additions, and stylistic changes that basically make this game feel like the definitive, classic-styled Sonic game. Everything comes off as wholly fresh and yet so nostalgic, and my favorite: the character sprite animations.There’s an insane attention to detail within Sonic Mania, it almost feels like there is no space within the levels themselves that feels reused, unplanned, or just boring. I felt like I wanted to explore more of the levels, simply because I wanted to see more of what’s to come.The game even offers different styles of CRT scanlines, further deepening the level of nostalgia you’ll feel playing this game. Naturally, the game looks better on a proper television and not the Switch itself (Disclaimer: I mostly played on the Switch, and with soft CRT scanlines). One thing I was concerned over was how I would feel seeing classic Sonic the Hedgehog levels effectively remixed in Sonic Mania. After playing through the entire game a few times, I can’t adequately describe how much I love the level design in this game. It’s fantastic.This game was designed by some of the most die-hard Sonic the Hedgehog fans, so it makes sense the level design, enemy placements, and so on would all be top notch.I found myself experimenting more, exploring more, and simply enjoying the levels more than I have before in the series. The game has a mostly underwater zone, the re-imagined Hydrocity Zone, which, for an underwater level, is fantastic.There was a perfect blend of player-driven exploration and platforming to those Sonic-goes-super-fast-autopilot sections. Even when those super-speed sections came, they felt natural and connected nicely with traditional Sonic platforming. It all connects brilliantly and feels smooth. Yet the inclusion of DRM is uncalled for, the game still holds up."

But I'm not recommending because, of course, some people at SEGA just HAD to go and ruin it with some monumentally stupid ideas. DRM has not excuse being in a singleplayer  game. The pirates will find a way around it and it just causes problems for people that pay money for it. If SEGA ever wises up and patches it out I will change my review but for now, buyer beware"

,Recommended,584400,34635586,Posted: 31 August,all,callamp,"This game is excellent.It's a faithful follow-up to some of the best 2D platformers from the 1990s. It doesn't reinvent the wheel - the game is very much a love-letter to those earlier titles - but it includes enough original content that it is well worth your time.Level design is excellent - a genuine rollercoaster at times - which is comparable to earlier titles in the series. Lots of replay value via collecting chaos emeralds, collecting gold and silver medals, a time attack mode and three different characters.Anyone who played Sonic 1 - 3&K will absolutely love this game. And anyone who never had a chance to play those earlier titles, I'd still recommend they give Sonic Mania a chance. I don't think you'll be disappointed."

Saying otherwise would be an understatement.A Must have for any sonic fan, and a great fast paced platformer all round for anybody looking into it.Sonic Mania improves on all aspects of Sonic's games of the 90's and adds new mechanics, improves levels design, and adds AMAZING music that legitimately made me cry, its that good.Sonic has been in hiatus for quite some while, some even doubting his greatness in the 90's, but Sonic Mania is here to prove that Sonic is alive and well, and he is back with full force. Sonic Mania is the revival of Sonic, and I couldn't be happier."

,Recommended,584400,34599393,Posted: 29 August,all,telekinesticman,"Played this four times already on the Switch version, and haven't noticed any issues in this PC version. Addressing the core game specifically, Sonic Mania is already going to be one of my favourite games this year, perhaps my favourite overall. Sonic 3 & Knuckles still holds the spot as ""best Sonic game"" for me, but Mania is a close second.Amazing level design, beautiful sprites and music, incredibly replayable, additonal extra modes and unlockables, all for 20 bucks. Please buy this game as soon as you can, because Classic Sonic is finally back in a big way, The only thing that makes this game not ""10/10 perfect"" for me is the reliance on older levels and gimmicks. While the returning stages are super well designed, and are often very different to their respective levels from the 90s Mega Drive titles, I still would have preferred to see an entirely brand new Classic Sonic experience. Who knows? If this game sells well enough (which I'm pretty sure it already has), I imagine an eventual ""Mania 2"" will emerge in a few years, boasting nothing but new content, and that would be just the best.Again, buy this game. Skip out on Sonic Forces later this year and just buy Mania. Or at least, sure whatever, go buy Forces, but at least buy Mania first, because I think we can all agree that it's the best Sonic game in a very long time. For me, the best Sonic game in over 20 years."

,Recommended,584400,34697280,Posted: 2 September,all,JoeMD,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THE HATERS!So many people on here are posting negative reviews simply because of the DRM, these reviews have nothing to do with the quality of the game itself. The actual game, the actual content, is simply amazing! While I quite enjoy some of the more recent Sonic titles (Generations, Colours, Heroes, and even Unleashed) there really is nothing like the jyo of a 2D Sonic title. While the DS has filled this hole somewhat, even Rush and Rush Adventure pale in comparison to Sonic Mania.Mania is very much a love letter to the Mega Drive-era Sonic titles. There is SO much fan service here and such love put into every little detail. The gameplay is spot on with the speed and physics feeling just like they did one Sega's classic system. It's grea to be able to play as all three characters and while I've not played as solo Tails yet, I can say Knuckles and Sonic are individual enough to make it worth playing through the game with each. The return of Blue Sphere as the Bonus Stages is wonderful, and I'm loving trying to earn all those medals. The boss fights are inspired and all the secrets throughout the game will have you coming back over and over.My only real criticism of Main is the Special Stages. Why they are cool to play, Sonic feel a little floaty in his controling. Maybe I'm just rubbish at it, but I found getting the hang of controlling Sonic rather tricky. Also, the draw distance in these levels is rather short - I assume to greater emualte the feeling of a 16-bit game  - but this does cause issue as sometimes you might not have enough time to reeact to corners or, most importantly, ring placement. While I do appreciate the devs wanting to capture that 16-bit era feel and it works wonderfully for the majority of the game I feel the Special Stages would have benifited from a little more modernising.Still, if you're an Sonic and or even just a fan of clasic 16-bit gaming you simply could not do better than Sonic Mania. It's pros FAR outweigh is few and farbetween cons. This is a must-have game!"
,Recommended,584400,34718979,Posted: 3 September,all,[GX]My Life For Aiur,Probably the 2nd best sonic game I've played only being beaten out by Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The music is great the gameplay feels just like the first three games and the boss battles for the most part are great.

,Recommended,584400,34745413,Posted: 4 September,all,Y4nni X3nobia,"There's a lot of people talking smack about Sonic Mania due to it using Denuvo DRM.  Using it, especially originally non-disclosed, is a pretty shady move, especially after claiming that the game's two week release delay on PC (the lead development platform for anyone familliar with Retro Engine) was due to ""optimisation"".  Anyone with half a brain knows that is complete and utter BS, and that the release delay was most likely to delay piracy and their first-week takings slumping because of it.  Also, a lot of people blamed Denuvo on them not being able to play the game off-line originally, however this was actually a problem with Steam's own DRM, which has since been fixed at the time of writing.However, unlike most reviews which mention Denuvo, this is an actual review of the game, and you know what?  It is pretty darned good.  It is for all intents and purposes the ultimate 2D Sonic sequel the fans have been clamouring for.  Developed by fans for the fans.  An interesting tidbit is that this same engine uses previous parts from previous games made using the engine, some of these games having never been released to the public.There are a few places where the difficulty spikes pretty hard out of nowhere, and there should be an in-game accessible manual via the Options menu (as having to exit the game and look up the manual on-line is jarring).This (along with Sonic Generations in my humble opinion) is a true love letter to the fans, giving them everything they ever wanted from a 2D Sonic game, and more.  So yeah, I recommend Sonic Mania, because even with the Denuvo dodginess, you can still play the game, and it is pretty darned fun!"
