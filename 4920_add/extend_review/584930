Very simple, but fun. I'm a mega surprised ... The game cost only a few Euros - and is on the same level as Rick and Morty. Probably even better, less claustrophobic.If someone, like me, is already tired of shooters - this is a very interesting alternative."
76561198028244339,Recommended,584930,31518462,Posted: 2 May,all,Billy Bo Baggins,"First off this game is great. The puzzles are short and fun to figure out, the world that you play in is mysterious, and the steam powered train is a really cool way to progress in a VR game. (Also, the music is really good and makes the atmosphere much better)This game does have its flaws though. It is short. I beat the game in ninty minutes. I play alot of puzzle games so I can fly through some puzzles. So, realistically the game would be an hour and a half to two hours tops. I did run into some frame rate issues where it would drop during some puzzle sequences, but not bad enough to make me sick. (Graphics card is GTX 970)Pros:+ Visuals (works very well in VR)+ Puzzles (short but fun)+ Music (increases the mystery in the world)+ World (interesting take on the apocalypse)+++ Progession system (train, would ride for 90 more minutes)Cons:- Frame rate (dips a little GTX 970)- Little story (interesting but not really there)- A little clunky (gravity gun does not always turn on)Pros and/or Cons:+/- Length (around 2 hours)+/- Light combat (helps keep the tensity up, but clunky)+/- Voice acting (nice that it is there, but not great performances)+/- mobility (only way to move is teleporting)Overall, I am happy I spent the ten dollars and would recommend this game for people who enjoy puzzle games. (glad it is not another escape room)"

Conducting the train listening to the tuned-in radio was really fun.  A bit short and not much replayability, but easily worth the asking price."
76561198142819669,Recommended,584930,31622727,Posted: 8 May,all,plano,"Conductor is a puzzle game made by the same studio as Abode, one of the best VR 'Escape the Room' games currently available on Steam. This time there are more story elements (while still very minor) and instead of being confined to two rooms, you traverse several locations alongside a train track and you have a handy tool at your disposal: a gravity gun.(TL;DR conclusion at the bottom; review intentionally omits specifics about puzzles to avoid spoiling the game)------------------------------------------------------------------VisualsConductor follows Abode art style as it presents itself in a texture-less environment, but nevertheless, in VR it is actually more immersive than those poorly put together games that use realistic textures but no coherent art direction. Here most areas feel very well put together and have more detail in terms of geometry than other similarly, small VR games. The darkness surrounding you makes the game feel atmospheric and leads to nice gameplay interactions between using spot lights to illuminate certain areas, though, I wish the dark atmosphere would have been used in more puzzles.One negative point I have to mention here is that even on a GTX 1080 there have been some areas that suffer from some frame drops when shadows get activated. There has been a patch since I've played the game that says it brings some performance improvements, however, I've already finished the more cluttered areas that show those problems when writing this review.SoundThere are 3 music tracks in the game that run in a radio which sound great, otherwise the game seems to lack ambient sounds. There are nice sound FX when throwing around items, generators buzz, but I do miss more ambient sounds to sell the environment.There is some voice over which is of mediocre quality, but it isn't detracting. Generally from a sound perspective this game neither excels nor fails dramatically, it is just mediocre.GameplayLike in their previous game, Abode, here you are confronted with obstacles to overcome. Some are easier, some had me stumped, but generally they felt fair and unique. Often the environment itself was the key which forced you to explore the area to find a solution. The puzzles generally are of higher quality than other contemporary 'Escape the room' VR games out there. The developers have struck a good balance between challenging and not too frustrating, creating a good 'flow' of the game.Movement is done via teleportation and traveling by train and both work fine in this game.As in other VR games you can grab stuff with your hands, here you can also grab and throw items via a gravity gun. The item interaction can be a bit buggy at times when there is seemingly a conflict in collision which should be looked into (same problem was present in 'Abode'; speculation time: maybe using the VRTK's interaction and grab mechanism don't work that well here and maybe NewtonVR may be more appropiate for their next game)There are some light combat elements with the gravity gun as well, but they do not feel very meaningful. The puzzle element is the focus of this game.Comparison to similar gamesThere are quite a lot of puzzle games or 'escape the room' games coming out for VR and in my opinion Conductor can easily be ranked among the best ones. While it does not have the same amount of polish as 'I Expect You To Die', it is also sold at a lower price point. Compared to 'Abode' the game has a bigger scope, more story elements and a more atmospheric world. However, some puzzles felt overly simplistic compared to some in Abode and could have be done differently.Still compared to many other VR puzzle games like 'The Cabin', 'The Ruins' etc., here the puzzles actually feel satisfying and aren't a simple hunt for a key.------------------------------------------------------------------ConclusionIf you liked 'Abode' or 'I Expect you To Die', then this is a no-brainer at its current price. This is a game studio that knows how to make puzzles and create a satisfying feeling of progression. While there are some bugs and some parts of the games could have benefited from more polish, overall this is still one of the most enjoyable VR games I've played.My wishlist for their next game would include:- More intricate puzzles- More puzzles involving the environment- More work on ambient sounds- A more robust item interaction-physics/collision system"
,Recommended,584930,34050350,Posted: 5 August,all,Dazirius,"Sooooooo, Conductor!The second VR game by Overflow (after Abode) is a cracking little puzzler. Without spoiling too much, the plot is roughly this:""You're on the run from a group of people who refer to you by your ""subject"" number. Before you is a steam locomotive. Go!""Driving the train is an absolute joy, from tossing coal into the furnace and lighting it, to the iconic whistle (Toot toot!).Conductor is *fairly* light on story, but there are written passages kicking around for you to find which hint at what's going on.Your primary objective though is to keep on running down the track, stopping at each station to solve puzzles in order to clear the way ahead.The minimalist art style works really well in that after a minute or two, you don't even notice. The models are really well made so the lack of surface texture feels intended rather than a lack of effort.The puzzles themselves aren't *fiendishly* difficult, but I did have to stop and think a few times. When stuck, I found it was just that I hadn't quite explored enough. When you do solve the puzzles it's incredibly satisfying. I recall one which at first elicited a ""No way..."" followed by belly laughs as the solution unfolded. It's a great experience.Motion controllers are a must for this one, so if you're on a mobile, you'll need to dig out the PS-Eyes and Moves. I can't guarantee it'll work, but there's only trigger, grab and forward/back/left/right needed so nothing particularly exotic.Steam have a sale on at the moment (06/08/17) with a great price for both Conductor and Abode (which is also great fun, but with fewer trains unfortunately), so if you've got a Rift or a Vive, and you like the idea of driving a steam train in the dark, get it immediately.If you're on mobile with PS-Move, it *might* be worth a shot, but I can't say for sure. You can get away with forward only tracking because there's snap turning, but 360 tracking would be ideal.It's not the longest title in the world (I completed it in an hour and a half according to Steam), but it's a lot of fun!"

The narrow cone of light from the trains headlamp artificially reduces the FOV - making this one of the few games to feature locomotion and not trigger my mates ridiculously high levels of nausea :P  So dont be put off if you're worried about how it might affect you if you're prone to VR sickness, ya should be fine :)"
,Recommended,584930,31554635,Posted: 5 May,all,Keeks,"I had a great time with this game. Not a strong story, but enough to create an interesting atmosphere. The graphics style is great for VR. The puzzles were easy to moderately challenging, but never too difficult that they became frustrating. Play time for me was two hours, which for the quality of the gameplay I found to be reasonable for this price.I think anyone who owns a VR headset and enjoys puzzle games should give this one a shot."
76561198067596490,Recommended,584930,31695388,Posted: 11 May,all,swiftillusion,"These developers took their last game Abode, my previous favorite escape room, and created an awesome puzzling adventure that refined everything they had learn't there to create one of my favorite games in general, regardless of it not being a replayable experience. I already want a new game from them and hope they keep their strengths.If you appreciate engaging puzzles with some adventuring/locked room experiences, etc, grab this game immediately, and if possible at full price because I almost feel guilty for not paying more-though I appreciate the price when considering the graphics and repeated use of basic objects (however that doesn't reduce the quality of gameplay at all for me).+ Didn't rely on the classic/basic black light/glowing text puzzle almost iconic to VR escape rooms already.+ Stylish graphics that kept a strong consistency of feel and easy to understand visual language.+ Consistently engaging in a mechanical and exploratory way that drew you in to the experience so much (Playing this with 3 people, at one point I tried to take my conductors cap off before swapping the VR headset, my friend tried to blow out the lit match and many more hilarious events happened as a result of how real the world felt).+ Objects intelligently snapped into place in an easy manner that complemented the experience of solving each puzzle.+ The transition between each area via the train was both engaging and enjoyable-there was just enough requirements to keep it going that it felt fun each time without becoming a drag, and it made reaching the completion of each puzzle even more satisfying knowing you'd now get to continue your journey.+ The headset intelligently pushed you back if you would try to push into a wall/the teleportation method made moving around the environment an easy experience.+ The gravity gun and its control method was well designed.+ The light narrative and arrangement of objects gave each location its own little story (e.g. why is this camp fire here?)+ Even the interface was simple but engaging.+ A great length that gives you time to become comfortable and attached to the world even if we didn't want it to end. We got stuck a few times for silly reasons that weren't the games fault so most people would be done in 2 hours, but because of how enjoyable it was overall being stuck and casually navigating about the place didn't bother us at all.~ Depending on what you're looking for there weren't any 'hard'/mind numbing puzzles but the balance of medium/light puzzles that focused on engaging physical interactivity made for a great accessible VR experience that still needed you to think things through often or discover new elements to a puzzle you'd thought you'd solved in a fun way.- The end could have been a bit more impactful but didn't take too much away from the light narrative as it wasn't the focus and it was a nice end goal regardless.- Ambient sounds could have been better.- Some locations felt too short pace-wise even if they were still engagingly interactive."
76561197993564008,Recommended,584930,31709201,Posted: 12 May,all,Chia-Head,"Conductor is a fun little VR puzzle game, similar to ""Escape the Room"" type games, except that you're outside most of the time, and just trying to move your train down the tracks. The game is played from a first-person point of view, and everything is life-sized. You move by teleporting - aim your controller, and a circle appears on the ground where you will teleport to. I did not feel dizzy or nauseous at any time.The plot is minimal: you're on the run from people who want to kill or capture you. It's never explained why, as far as I could tell. You escape from what looks like a hospital room, and find a small train - just a locomotive with a coal bin. Your first task is to figure out how to start the train and get it moving. Every once in a while, you come upon some kind of obstruction on the tracks. You exit the train, and figure out how to remove the obstruction. Usually this involves a number of steps: find item, use item, which opens up another item, use new item, which opens up another item...and eventually you can remove whatever is obstructing the train tracks. Then you get back on the train, and move to the next obstruction. The puzzles range from obvious to hard in difficulty.At your first stop, you pick up a gravity gun. You use this gun to pick up objects. You can either draw the objects to you, or fling them away from you. A cool idea, and implemented very well. It is essential to some of the puzzles.The game takes place at night. It is pitch black outside of the pools of light given off by the train lights and lanterns, which limits what you can see. This adds to the ""creepy"" factor.At one point, I tried to wander too far away from the train, and a message came up saying that if I went any further, I would die. An inelegant way to limit movement, but effective.Steam shows that I spent about 2 hours playing the game before finishing it. The end was a bit abrupt, and I was left saying, ""That's all?"" I guess the ultimate compliment for a game is that I wished that there was more of it.Overall, this was a fun, if short game. I recommend it if you're into puzzle type games.I also wanted to compliment the developer. At one point, I had an issue with the game, and asked about it on the Steam forums. The developer answered back the very next day, which solved my issue. In the very next patch, a few days later, a fix was made to the game which ensured that no one else would encounter my problem. Great service!Bugs: There was a problem with sound. After loading a saved game, I would be able to play normally, except that all sound stopped after about 10 - 20 seconds. I would have to exit the game completely, and then reload before sound would start again.*** mild spoiler ***There are no jump scares. The creepiest part of the game is the continual sound of wolves howling in the night, but you never see one. Little flying drones shoot darts at you, but are pretty easy to avoid and destroy. This game does not require good reflexes, or involve hurting anything but mechanical drones."
,Recommended,584930,32784429,Posted: 25 June,all,Iseeicy,"Conductor is a great but short puzzle game. It took me two VR sessions of about 70 minutes each to finish. The train mechanic is what pulled me in, and it definitely delivered on that front. Puzzles had a pretty decent difficulty ramp. The controls left a bit to be desired, as tossing things in between hands is pretty buggy.If you're looking for a VR puzzle game with some fresh mechanics, look no further!"

,Recommended,584930,33511040,Posted: 13 July,all,FR33 BOBBY,"My favorite VR puzzle game hands downFirst off - if you want to play with the music from the trailer, turn the radio on attached to the trainAND THEN fidget with the radio's antenna to get the right signal.I didn't realize this until the end, and would've been nice to play with that music throughout the game (nobody's fault but my own there).Overall a very fun and puzzling game with the puzzles being just difficult to challenge you but not get you stuck in a fit of rage. The environment and game design is beautifully done and the low poly is very enjoyable to explore. The puzzles do force you to explore the environment which I appreciated. Likewise, the environment contained subtle clues in explaining the storyline which you can miss if you don't explore the environment enough (won't change the gameplay, but will make the game more immersive).It might be my setup or my room, but I found the controllers at times to be out of sync and glitchy where in the game my hands wouldn't by synced with my controllers. This was especially true when gathering coal and putting it into the fire on the train. Could just be my setup but that's uncommon for me in other games.Only thing is that I wish the game was longer because I enjoyed it so much!"

This literally happens when no button is pressed, it just randomly occurs. Very disappointing experience and annoyed that I feel me and my friend's time has been wasted trying to play this game. Also as a side note, the visuals do not synergise with the audio in the way that it is cartoonised but has creepy and annoying sounds that don't set the scene."

Haven't had this much fun in a single player VR game since Vanishing RealmsThis is the perfect example of how great VR can be with a simple story and satisfying interactions with the environment!  I'd call it an exploration puzzle adventure- You are a patient in a shady hospital and you must escape on a train made for one!  You pilot a small train with an open roof so the feeling of starting your train then ploughing across land as you shoot robots is exhilerating.  There isn't much of a tutorial which I preferred as it immerses you immediately in figuring out your train and escaping.I'd play anything you guys make after trying this- keep up the great work and thanks for the experience!
76561198044465976,Not Recommended,584930,35262785,Posted: 28 September,all,Martain,"An interesting and atmospheric adventure game that involves driving a train between various puzzles.My overall experince with this game is fairly good, but I came out of it sour because there are bugs, obnoxious physics andannoying mechanics that add nothing to the game.I honestly think the train travel is completely pointless, it's a gimmick that only serves to annoy the player. It certainly gives you a goal; clear the path for your train. This is a good objective except for the fact that it's so easily interchangable between other things (unlock the door, turn on the light, play the game, Etc.). Actually driving the train isn't fun, it's a lot of swinging your head around to grab coal and then throwing your headset off your face. It's basically a minigame that involves managing your fuel and heat, all while fighting drones. The drones are not well designed enemies. They're loud, attack with slow projectiles that must be dodged, and can only be killed by slowly moving them into the environment with a gravity gun rip off. There are bugs that completely break the game, puzzle element fall out of existence and from what I can tell, only some of them are set to respawn when leaving the map.It's too short for too much money. The game ends abruptly with you learning your name is Harper before the credits just end. This game should be free, The Red Stare is free and it looks better, plays better, and actually has interesting puzzles in it! This should be a demo AT MOST.tl;drPros: looks sort of nice in it's own way, puzzles suitable for kids, kind of scary in some bitsCons: gimmicky train mechanic, buggy and broken, just feels bad in the way it plays, obnoxious enemies with no variations, too short, 10 DOLLARS."

The game is entertaining but there were too many things I disliked about it. I made a list of them:* The graphics style.It's true I saw the quality of the graphics before buying the game, but usually if the gameplay is fun enough you don't pay attention to the graphics. That didn't happen this time.Maybe it was the lack of textures, some visual glitches, having remote controls instead of hands or the fact that the objects were repeated too much on every level.* The storyExtremely linear and simple.The way you find the Half-Life tractor beam didn't make any sense to me.The end was so abrupt it left a bitter taste in my mouth.* The priceIn order for this game to have gotten a hands-up from me should have costed less than $5.IMHO It's not good enough for $10.I.E., I paid less for another puzzle game that took me 4.5 hours to complete, had better graphics and story.The impression I got at the end of the game is the developers were lazy because they could have made a much better game if they had put a little more work.I didn't return it because I want to support the developers. At the same time, I want the buyers to know what they will be getting for their money.You should only buy it if you are a fanatic of the genre, you don't care about graphics and you want to support the development of more of this kind of games. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends for this price though."

I certainly think the experience was worth every penny, but I would have paid 3 times as much for more stations, more music, more story, more secrets... Completed in 1.6 hrs, but wish there were another 3 hrs to go.The visuals are simplistic but very polished, everything is clean and readable and lighting looks great.  The atmosphere is surreal and melancholy, and makes the world feel ten times bigger and emptier than what is actually shown.  The puzzles all make sense and don't require any guessing.  Frantically defending your train from drones while keeping your boiler stoked and avoiding collisions is a lot of fun too.Definitely recommend this to all fans of puzzle/adventure games, or anyone looking for something that feels unique.  One caveat is that there are long and unskippable train sequences that would make people sensitive to motion sickness very ill."

There are several obstacles along the way where you are forced to stop, and you have to solve puzzles to remove them. These puzzles are of the right difficulty for me, which is rather good as I don't find them too frustrating,yet challenging enough. Along the way while you ride the train, drones will appear to kill you, so you have to throw item to smash it down. They often appear while you are riding, so its most likely you have to toss the coal at them using the grav gun. Unfortunately doing so is a rather clumsy affair and I have died a couple of times from them.As of this review, the game has got several minor bugs that needs fixing,including the audio (the game was mute in some of my playthrough).The whole game took me about 1 and half hour to complete and if I were to give out a review score, I will give it a 7/10. Unfortunately due to the bugs here and there, I can only suggest buying it at least a few days after this review is up (to give the dev some time to fix them).

Very immersive, the player even encounters enemies early in the game. it is by the makers of abode, they adapted the graphics style but this one is a bit darker which also applies to the story. the game is very immersive even tho it has a simple graphics style. I haven't made it to the end yet so I can't say if it's satisfying and has a cool solution to all the mystery. you find notes and traces of other humans.DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER AS IT CONTAINS A MAJOR SPOILER ;)"

The game is setup so that you have your little train that you ride and have to stop at the various trainstops to clear some roadblocks. Each roadblock is pretty well crafted and overall very enjoyable. I did have one bug along the way (at the stop with the rotating platform) that actually prevented me from advancing. I ended up restarting the game and playing it all the way through though and had no issues the second time.Definitely a fun experience with great atmosphere. It is kind of spooky, but not scary (no jump scares)."

But still only 3h of game play with twice through.Fun if escape room puzzles are you thing.  Get on sale if possible."
,Recommended,584930,33508875,Posted: 13 July,all,alpha4005,This was a cool little game to play through. The puzzles were decently interesting and mostly worked on the first run through for me. I played through using a vive and had a little trouble with it. For some reason when I started the game my playable area in room scale would be rotated by 90 degrees. I ended up punching my desk a few times while trying to handle the fuel from place to place. Aside from that it was a smooth experience and I would reccomend it. Not a lot of replay value.

Some problems were only solved after I took a brake and came back the day after with a fresh mind. Good! Some problems was a bit easy but particularly one I liked because it seemed solvable in one way and half in you realize that no, it has to be made differently :)A bit creepy becase it is played in the middle of the night and where there is no ligt - it is pitch black. There were no jump-scares so keep calm."

I wished there was more story in the game, but probably the devs wanted to let it open for interpretation. All in all nice atmosphere and good gameplay."

I was surprised at the creative solutions that some of the puzzles required.  Overall play time for me was just about two hours, but for $10, I think this was a very enjoyable game and well worth the price."

,Recommended,584930,34949454,Posted: 14 September,all,Cavetastic,"I came to Conducter after a positive experience with Abode and a need for more. This is  a really nice twist on escape rooms. My family play together taking turns with the headset and solving puzzles together with an external monitor and mirrored sound. This is a great game for that. I am surprised the train didnt make me puke, but it didnt and was huge fun to drive. I did have sound issues at times when reloading saves. A few seconds of sound and it a little flicker and then no sound. I had to play from earlier saves to fix it. That happened twice. Anyway I will be looking out for more from Overflow."
