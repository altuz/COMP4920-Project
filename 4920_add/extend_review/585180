,Recommended,585180,32701082,Posted: 23 June,all,Venceremos,"Judging by the title and those Clarke's laws the game throws at you at the very beginning you can easily expect what the premises are about. The protagonist is a living fire-element spirit firewall, and the malware equivalents are evil spirits and the like. But the idea is quickly cast away so it's basically more like an inspiration thing.If compared to other interactive fictions Open Sorcery plays more like an RPG, providing more active engagement and effective decisions. Unlike many other IFs attempting the similar approach, they are handled nicely in this one.It falls short of its branching endings, by which I don't mean it does not offer multiple endings, but which ending you are going to reach is basically determined by a choice you make in the finale, but I concede to that at its length it's reasonable.The story is intriguing and fun and replaying is more accessible since you are able to fast forward chunks of text."

If you did enjoy it, though, please do not be a cheapskate and keep this little gem in your library."
,Recommended,585180,30412300,Posted: 9 March,all,Fail Tank,"I don't read (play?) a lot of IF, so my review will probably not be overly helpful if you're a conniseur of the genre.Based on little more than the blatent projection of my own wants, I was hoping there would be more game elements. There are some game elements present, and they are nice changes from the reading flow, but they won't excite you beyond your first (or second, if you meet an untimely end) runs.As far as the writing goes, it's good. If you're into direct, solid writing that leans heavily on archetypes, then you'll love it. If you're hoping for a lot more shades of grey, introspection, or ambiguous characterization, then you'll not be so thrilled. What I mean by archetypes is there's a lot of ""I AM THE DOOR. I AM THE WALL. YOU SHALL NOT PASS"" kind of stuff. If that sends tingles up your spine (after an appropriate amount of buildup), you're in for a good time.The setting is great: it's the real world, but with magic, and with advanced science that allows people to harness that magic. You play a fire elemental bound into service as a magic firewall, tasked with stopping spirits, ghosts, fairies and other magic beings from negatively influencing your community.There's in-game achievements (not steam achievements, though) along with hints about how to accomplish them. There's a fair amount of replayability, because you can't see everything the first time through (or in any one playthrough, really).If you like interactive fiction, you'll like this, it's good interactive fiction. If you don't like IF, you won't like this, because it's IF."

I wasn't expecting that from a game like this, at all.But now I have my own little fire inside me, and the ideas this game invokes are fun to toy with. I'm sure elements will end up in the games I GM for friends."
,Recommended,585180,30172657,Posted: 25 February,all,SidAlpha,"https://youtu.be/MoWpCgYOYkwI showcased this game during a discussion video that I had posted where the topic of conversation was subjectivity in video games. I also discussed this video as an example of a minimalistic approach done exceptionally well, so I thought I would give the Developers their due here as well.Open Sorcery is a minimalistic text-based game that focuses heavily on character development. As an intelligent computerized spiritual Firewall (Go with it they make it work) you battle spirits attempting to mess with 4 different locations. I don't want to give too much away here, but I have to say that for a Text-based Adventure it was phenomenal. It may have only been an hour long and I would have wished for more content, but somehow I still feel the $4 I spent was well worth it. If you are a fan of story and narrative experiences, you won't be disappointed with Open Sorcery.9/10"
,Recommended,585180,30463294,Posted: 11 March,all,Lanate,"I got introduced to this game at PAX East 2017, and I have to say that it's one of the fastest turnarounds from seeing it to purchasing it that I've ever done. It combines two things I really like: magic and programming, and combines them into a fun little text adventure that I greatly enjoyed. I'll admit to getting the giggles as I read on and look forward to any sequels."
,Recommended,585180,30132545,Posted: 23 February,all,SolipsisticFox,"So this is a bit of interactive fiction that takes about 90 minutes to do a playthrough of, about... oh hell, you can read the page.And, well, I'm a sucker for anything AI-related, and anything magitech-y, so I knew I'd like this if the writing wasn't crap. Which it isn't. It's very good. There are some very charming and cute moments and some moments that make you really invested in these characters, even though you never see much of them. They're just really good concepts in an interesting setting.I wish there were more of it, not for value for money reasons - I got my $4 worth in thirty minutes with all the great ideas in this - but just because I want more. I want more of the characters and the setting, and I hope a sequel of some sort is made.My one problem with it is this: the climax is timed. I hate being timed. Hatehatehate it. It stresses me out. But, after the first time through, you unlock the option to turn on/off the real-time counter. If you turn it off, every click now takes 3 seconds (it was originally 10, which I hated, but the developer has since tweaked that). This makes it still tense, but a more enjoyable kind of tense, and gives you the ability to appreciate the writing and consider what's going on, rather than just spam and stress. I might include that option from the start personally, but it's not too big a deal and if you have to have one bad ending that could actually be a good motivator to go back and do it again (though in my case, it wasn't an issue of getting a worse ending necessarily [at least not for that reason, just suboptimal choices earlier on, which is fine], but of not appreciating it due to not having time to read it).But that now-minor issue with the climax aside, this game is a very well-written piece of interactive fiction, with a variety of choices I'm still trying to get to the bottom of. It's well worth your time if the sentence, ""BEL/S is an Elemental Firewall: a fire elemental bound with C++ code to protect a network of people and places"" sounds interesting to you. Which, it sounded awesome to me.I also found myself writing like a computer after playing this, which is always a sign a story/character's good: if it affects you that much."

I really enjoyed the beauty of the whole experience.  I'm recommending it to all my friends.  I am thoroughly thrilled with Open Sorcery, and hope to see more games from this creator.  I don't want to say too much and give anything away.  Enjoy the plot.Note: I played this game in offline mode, so the mere 0.5 hour logged at the time of the review does not reflect the many hours and multiple run throughs that I have done.  I'm not an ""achievement hunter"" or ""completionist replayer"" type, yet I was drawn in by hints of different endings, and found the prose so enjoyable that I wanted to see as many options as possible.There was a slight spot of frustration in one area that might have been from a small glitch - game side or user error unknown!

The DOS interface, use of color, and occasional graphics gives the game much more of a visual novel feel than a text-based choose-your-own-adventure.  The characters are well designed and their dialogue enhances and rounds them out as people.  The interactive text is not only a clever use of game mechanics, but gives perspective and clarity into your situations.  With the amount of story and plot hooks available, I was eager to replay after my first run.  This is worth your time."

,Recommended,585180,30459726,Posted: 11 March,all,Liam Ferohn-Gay,"This is a really interesting and addicting game. The concept of the game itself - an elemental firewall protecting her network, with the possibility to destroy or save the world - is utterly thrilling, and as my first step into this genre, I have to admit, it's got me hooked. Scouring the game for every option, every possiblity, makes it wonderfully replayable, and I have no shame in admitting that I've played this game almost all day doing just that. The puzzles within the game are simple when you understand them, but have a note of complexity to them that makes them brilliant and charming in their own way, and despite being such a short game, each character is personalised and developed in such a way that they've stuck with me and are quickly becoming some of my favourite characters going.The features you get after the first completion of the game are fantastic - they definitely make replaying the game a lot easier - yet don't detract the joy of playing the game itself. And that's another thing, actually; the game is still wonderful and still charming to me, despite having played it over and over.The achievements are likely part of this. I'm not an overly avid perfectionist or completionist, but for some reason, this game has me totally hooked on getting everything - to the point that I now only have to get Hellfire, Janet's Final Log, and Perfect Ending. I think my only criticism would be that I'm actually struggling more with understanding Hellfire's hint and what needs to be done than Extreme Nightmare Hunter Toby - yet Toby's is the one that had the extended hint/walkthrough attached. I wouldn't have thought Toby's achivement was complicated enough to warrant this, considering Hellfire requires you to be ""spiteful"" - and honestly I have no idea what of BEL/S responses sound spiteful enough to get this achivement - in contrast to Toby's achievement explicitly stating that you need to make Pyreworm and Toby meet. It seems like odd prioritising to me, but I think perhaps that's because I struggle with tone, especially through text, so this achievement had me bested before I even attempted it.Edit: almost right after posting this, I got the achievement. I still stand by the original point, since I actually stumbled on it by accident. I only realised what I'd chosen was spiteful as the very last option on the branch came up. I think the struggle made getting the achievement much more satisfying, though, so I have little negativity on that!Even with this struggle, I'm absolutely enjoying the game, and I most definitely would (and have) recommend it to people. I'm even considering buying the mobile version, considering it supposedly has more to it!"

First up, there is no music, no voice acting, few images, few sound effects. This is a text based choice game. This doesn't detract from its appeal, but buyers should know what they're getting. The strengths this game has are:- An excellent and engaging story: The people feel real, their problems feel real, and you will care enough about them to really want to help them. And you'll feel it if you can't. I cried at least once.- Cerebral game play: Though the game play is limited to pressing the right words you'll need to read carefully and use your head to solve your problems, sometimes while you're under pressure. Getting it right feels relieving.- Consequential choices:  This game doesn't hold your hand. You'll want to make the right choices, and if you don't people's health, sanity or even lives may be at stake. You might not be able to help everyone.- Great presentation: Though text is the major medium the game uses, it uses all the tricks possible to convey the story really convincingly and effectively.This isn't a big budget story, it's a low budget, relatively short (~4 hours), brilliantly executed, minimalist, story of something trying to understand humans, protect humans and become human.I don't usually make reviews, this is my second steam review after over 200 games (Gunpoint being the other one).

Your goal is to protect a high school, a home for the elderly and the houses of your two creators. To do this you have to scan for spirits consisting of 2 main components: matter and motive.  There are 6 of them each and you have to guess them based on the descripiton you get of the environment. For example warmth would imply the matter fire or organised patterns imply the motive order. After you guess correctly and find a spirit you can choose how to interact with it, usually you have three options: Burn it and become a little more powerful, ask your creators to deal with it or talk to the spirit. Based on your decisions you may grow as an AI or change your relationship with thee people you know.The games is a couple of hours long, the right amount of time in my opinion for a ""bitesize"" game. The story is well written, you can lead it a multiple different ways. There is no music, but I felt it suited the atmosphere well.There isn't much else to say without spoilers.

I do not regret buying it in the slightest, and I loved everything in it. The dialogue and story made me care for each character, and I tried several times to get different results from events happening in the game. I really liked how the game crossed science fiction with magic. I really want more of this."

If you havenotexperienced certain of life's darker aspects, then mostly this game will strike you as reallyneat; a unique, thought provoking, and well executed addition to your library. Cool! But if you have, then odds are it will hit you quite a bit harder.I recommend disabling Real Time mode in the options, at least for your first play-through. I did not do this, and consequently missed a bunch of text in my hurry -- which is a shame, because the writing is good."

The magitech setting is compellingly modern, and the available story choices range the entire morality spectrum. There is potential for dispensing overwhelming kindess and love or horrific fear and cruelty.I highly enjoyed myself and I hope to see some more from this creator in the future!"
