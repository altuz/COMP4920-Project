The mini-games are hit-and-miss in terms of whether they work. In one you get more points just standing there doing nothing than actually attempting to play the game. Another allows you to pile up items in the game on the floor which I reaaaally don't think was the dev's intent.Other issues I've encountered is the character model getting stuck (i.e, in the gym), achievements not unlocking, and the editor breaking if you exit without saving and then attempt to re-enter the screen.Finally, and this more of a note to anyone reading this : Do *not* hit ESC in an attempt to pause the game as a normal person would, this just kicks you back to the main menu and resets your score to zero. There are areas in the game itself that simulate a ""paused"" game. Very odd system, IMO.Overall, not really worth the $0.99 (or $0.88 sale price).inb4 ur just triggered"

,Not Recommended,585550,31618111,Posted: 7 May,all,Garb 🌽,"While the game does do a good job of parodying SJW culture, the game itself is not good. While the concept of an arcade game set in an open world with minigames sounds good, it was not executed well here. Points could easily be racked up by simply grinding for them in minigames, which had no limits or penalties for losing. Outside of the minigames, the gameplay just consisted of walking around, with no changes in difficulty to keep the player invested.The game is also not polished. Duringmy initial 2 hours with the game, I encountered several glitches. The drawing tools did not work properly, clicks wouldn't be registered in minigames, and the game straight up didn't recognize my controller.Ultimately, this game is a broken mess intended to make money off of those who want the opportunity to laugh at a satire of SJW culture. I do not recommend it, even at the low price point."

If you took away the minigames, you just have stereotypes you’ve seen from every antifeminist that can’t be bothered to make an substantive argument. It’s lazy, flashing offensive content just to get a rise out of the people who the developers disagree with.

It took me long enough to get my head around the standard ones, for running about outdoors, but once you trigger a mini-game inside a building all bets are off. One even asked me to use the arrow keys to move whilst firing a gun with the mouse! Ooookay...When all is said and done, even the most rampant anti-SJW isn't liable to get more than thirty minutes of enjoyment out of this one. Which obviously isn't insulting for the price, but...there's no story, no ultimate goal...it's just a points-scoring, how-long-can-you-last scenario in which the game almost invariably ends due to you running out of refugees to show Tolerance to (I think I only lost one match due to a lack of Triggering, as white male privilege is EVERYWHERE apparently)!An amusing idea, done okay, but definitely not worth a cent over the one buck asking price. That said, I guess it's a nice antidote to the recent rampage of anti-Trump games which flooded Steam. As a professional fence-sitter, I like to see both sides get a serve, so at least this game has provided a bit of much-needed balance to digital la-la land which the real world can only aspire to.Verdict: 6.5/10."

This games purpose is not hate speech but I can see someone hating this kind of people (feminazis, etc) a bit more after playing it.ie. I think people will judge feminazi sjws on memes and this game instead of actual... people. Sorry if I haven't expressed myself well.Right now the user reviews are very positive. It apsolutely does not deserve that rating, or need be on steam. I don't care if it's ironic, memes, satire or depiction of modern society. It's just bad."
,Not Recommended,585550,30610591,Posted: 19 March,all,Quas the Avali,"Feminazi: The Triggering is a simplistic little game that doesn't belong on steam. As much as I would love to praise this game for the goofy little humor of overly sensitive fools I really don't want the steam store to have quickly strung together games such as this. I will now quickly explain my experience on the game. The gameplay is not well explained and is awfully repetitive set in a tiny map, The soundtrack and sound assets are decent and get the job done, The story is what you want to make it out to be, the interface is straight to the point, the art is good, The humor is... Well memes... Nothing special Just a little 5 minute laugh or so. The game loses its punch after a few minutes and doesn't offer much in replayability.Don't buy this game. Well... Unless your just going to play within the refund period and boundries. There is plenty of reason to play this for a little goof but other than that keeping the purchase is not worth it."
,Not Recommended,585550,33350172,Posted: 7 July,all,Gnome Rambo,"The game itself is more or less a timer based game where you try and rack up as much points before your meters run out. There are some minigames like eating food while avoiding scales and shooting people that aren't minorities and sending white knights to attack some white guy whose sending white guys to attack you. Beyond the minigames, there's just collecting objects like food to increase weight and hammers to smash car windows. There's also npcs you interact with though it's nothing more than positive words you say to minorities and angry SJW words you say to the white male NPCs. You can edit the appearance of your character so you can have your own SJW to go around and spray graffiti while yelling at mothers with their strollers.Overall, the game is rather meh. If you want a time waster, this can act as one but there are other games out there besides this. Personally, I can't really recommend the game but if you do want to play a game where you're an SJW who goes around yelling at people, then give it a try, the game isn't expensive (and at the time of this review, it's only 49 cents."
,Recommended,585550,33475180,Posted: 12 July,all,zAv,"Few video games in history have garnered as much critical praise and effusive adoration as Feminazi: The Triggering. When it came out in 2017 for the PC, Feminazi: The Triggering set a new standard for three-dimensional action and introduced gameplay mechanics that are still copied today. Though it has since appeared on the GameCube and the Wii Virtual Console, the new version for the PC marks the first time this classic has received a significant update. The completely overhauled visuals are the most striking improvement, and they infuse this 1-year-old game with a vibrant modern feel. The sharp motion controls and the video hint system are new additions that fit in well, but the real star is the original adventure. Though it shows its age, The quest is indeed a timeless one that is full of invigorating exploration, tricky puzzles, satisfying combat, memorable characters, and stirring music. Feminazi: The Triggering is a great way to experience this seminal adventure, and it's a shining example of how old can be made new again."

I spent my 77 cents (best price they could set for a game like this), the change from my monthly male privilege check, which is also a totally real and not made up thing, and away I went.Now I know what it's like to portray a mentally unstable, aka typical, Tumblrina, going out to fight those who are able to get decent jobs (any job is better than being one of the professionally offended, even running a hot dog stand) because their hair isn't 47 different colors to go with their 47 genders they identify as at that particular second. The game's protagonist spews more meaningless buzzwords than BuzzFeed, making sure she ends up with a large group of ""refugees"" ready to run a train on her, but remember it's ok because they're muslim. Also, just like the SJW scum in the real world, the only combat the protagonist isn't too much of a coward to engage in (at least tomy knowledge so far) is against trash cans and walls ripe for vandalism.Literally Shaking/10 would get triggered again."

,Recommended,585550,30705118,Posted: 24 March,all,TrueWOPR,"Note: I got this game for $0.24 so I'm valuing it on if it's fun for a quarter.The game is a parody of what society is coming with a very South Park feeling sense of humor and graphics (while pixelated, still looks the same.)Don't expect much depth though, much like real feminists the game is played by yelling one of three things at any passers by.  If they're white, get triggered and have them check their privilege, if they're a minority (or even better, an immigrant) be tolerant and accepting.  If they're a woman who isn't a feminist, shame them for being a traitor to their kind.Or in simple game terms, press ""Z"" when near browns, press ""X"" when near whites, press ""C"" when near women.And yes, by the way, use keyboard controls.  While the game supports gamepad, it uses some shoddy built in joy-to-key that isn't configured correctly, rendering half the minigames unplayable on pad.Speaking of minigames, this is where the actual gameplay comes in, sadly there are only five and they're not that good.1: you need to drag and drop babies from a conveyor belt to the intended families.  (baby girls go to single mothers, baby boys go in the trash can [wait, I thought gender was a 'social construct'?])2: just a DDR clone you play at a disco tech, there is no joke here.3: is a tug of war 'strategy' game where you send your white knights and cucks down a lane to 'argue' (throw ♥♥♥♥♥♥) for you, and your objective is to push your minions to the enemy base and knock over their activist.4: You are a cop, shoot the white people because 'terrorists are always white', lose points for shooting blacks, mexicans, or muslims.5: and the last one, eat as much food as possible while people throw scales at you.Now, do I recommend the game?  Eh...  I mean, it's not good, but it's not bad either, if you don't like it you can easily refund it given how short it is (half the achievements and tried ever aspect of gameplay in under an hour here) but I personally am going to have to go with ""Yes"".  While I'm sure anti-feminists are the intended audience, I do feel everyone should at least give it a shot, if you're a feminist going into this game, know that this is how the rest of the world sees you.  This is how silly a lot of your arguments can become (I say this knowing feminists who unironically argue that 'all mass shooters are whites') if you're an anti-feminist going into this game, expect to feel smug through the conformation bias.  And lastly: if you're neither of those groups and just indifferent, expect to be really confused and have a slight urge to google search what a lot of these in-game terms mean....Oh right, and you can make up your own genders, that's pretty funny, the ability to identify as an attack helicopter really got me. xD"

The game is easy, fun and laidback to play and has a lot of hidden easter eggs which make the entire experience worthwile! Definitely reccomend it."

Controls are OK, not good neither bad, but it's boring AF. So repetitive aswell, you don't have to play that much to realize it yourself.So, from the technical aspect, I would give it a 4/10 (based on my opinion, of course).Now, let's continue with a more content-like opinion.Starting off, the term ""Feminazi"" is quite controversial, I get it's a ""meme"" making fun of stereotypical radicalist feminists, wich don't make sense a lot of times, and the ideas they talk about are kinda dumb sometimes, but you're supposed to respect them anyways, at the end of the day, they're defending their ideas and you shouldn't interfere in them as long as it doesn't respect your privacy, or whatever.But it's still dumb using the term Feminazi, there is no such thing as feminists who are nazi, and I'm sure there is a lot of people who have better ideas or reasons about why this term shouldn't exist than me. Let's get back to the game itself.I get they are making fun of this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but there are a lot of things that don't make a lot of sense, and they're making fun of ideas about respect, and more ""conventional feminism"", and that's not good.I give it a 1/10 in this regard. Sorry if the language is wrong, or anything, English is not my main language and I make mistakes. Also this is not as quite as deep or analytical as I would've liked to, but it's just I can't play this game, it...

If you take this game seriously or easily offended by it, then you are one of the people being made fun of.Got this as a gift from a friend. Did show interest in this as well.(Nearly 40 people found my review offensive.)Below the surface, unless you're a comedian and bought this for entertainment for your LP channel, or are easily amused and can have a lot of fun with it, there's not much to do after a few hours. You can make your very own gender, out of 20+ genders (including Mayo, Toaster, and Apache) with description and symbol too.It's still worth the price of $1, given how very low budget it is on, well, everything. There are a few minigames that are challenging, but may be more frustrating than fun.There might be a bit more potential to this game after launch, but wouldn't expect much.This is primary for people that are fed up and done with today's feminists and SJW's crying wolf when there is no wolf to cry about but their own reflection who they believe is someone else.So, understand what it means to be a feminist/sjw, get triggered just by anyone's apperance, welcome all middle eastern refugees and all black people, and fatten up to the point that you can't open your own eyes anymore!

Any similarity to actual events or people, living or dead, is purely coincidental.I had dismissed this game as not worth of my money, or of a place in my library, initially.Then, I bought it because a certain sophia feminazi got triggered, and gave it a negative review. (her name with a lowercase S is intented to remark the low opinion I have of this person)The game is short and satirical,where the SJW feminist stereotype is mocked through scenes and minigames; the joke is stretched as long as it can last, which is not too long. In a couple of hours or less you will have seen pretty much all that there is to see in the game, and probably achieved every achievement.Considering the price it's a fair deal, it could have been a flash game but none can't complain about the price/quality ratio; if anything it has a catchy soundtrack.One might argue that this is ""Greenlight trash"" but, while I agree, there are still thousands of other worse games on steam, so you can't really complain about this.If you need ratings:Grapich: 3/10Sound: 7/10Gameplay: 6/10Longevity: 6/10Overall: Game was gr8 I r8 8/8 m8.I hope this review will get many upvotes and will be seen by this feminazi, as I've been blocked and can't comment ""triggered"" on her review; I bought the game and the DLC at full price for the sole purpose of yelling her ""TRIGGERED!"", as I was blocked long ago for having a donger.work it ᕙ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕗ hardermake it (ง •̀_•́)ง betterdo it ᕦ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕤ fasterraise ur ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ dongerɳ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ɲ more than ever hour after ɳ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ɲヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ our work is always dongers ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ“The fundamental defect of the female character is a lack of a sense of justice. This originates first and foremost in their want of rationality and capacity for reflexion but it is strengthened by the fact that, as the weaker sex, they are driven to rely not on force but on cunning: hence their instinctive subtlety and their ineradicable tendency to tell lies: for, as nature has equipped the lion with claws and teeth, the elephant with tusks, the wild boar with fangs, the bull with horns and the cuttlefish with ink, so it has equipped woman with the power of dissimulation as her means of attack and defence, and has transformed into this gift all the strength it has bestowed on man in the form of physical strength and the power of reasoning. Dissimulation is thus inborn in her and consequently to be found in the stupid woman almost as often as in the clever one. To make use of it at every opportunity is as natural to her as it is for an animal to employ its means of defence whenever it is attacked, and when she does so she feels that to some extent she is only exercising her rights. A completely truthful woman who does not practice dissimulation is perhaps an impossibility, which is why women see through the dissimulation of others so easily it is inadvisable to attempt it with them. – But this fundamental defect which I have said they possess, together with all that is associated with it, gives rise to falsity, unfaithfulness, treachery, ingratitude, etc. Women are guilty of perjury far more often than men. It is questionable whether they ought to be allowed to take an oath at all.”Arthur Schopenhauer, Über die Weiber"

I got so bitter and angry about it that I decided to spend days and weeks creating a video game just to spite her, all these hours and hours, in the hopes that she would hear about it and shed a single tear, so much effort and money just out of pent-up rage over being friendzoned. Just kidding, but could you imagine?For one, I couldn't. I have better things to do with my life, you know, developing a successful career, pursuing a hobby, getting an education, spending time with friends and family, having meaningful relationships with amazing people (real life not 2D), hitting 1k hours in Left 4 Dead 2 on a smurf account, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing and triggering gentlesirs on Steam, watching paint dry, watering the garden while it's raining, building a sand castle in a hurricane, etc.So for starters, I paid 88 cents for this game. This was a huge waste of money. For only 12 cents more I could have bought a can of Sprite at the Chinese restaurant, and that would have gone down better and lasted longer. I could have just thrown the 88 cents into a fountain and seen more memorable effects come up, like a tiny ripple of water. This was maybe 5 minutes tops of... idk... doing nothing? I kind of forgot already. Or maybe I wrote this ahead of time and haven't even played it.I kind of knew what was coming but I picked this up anyways. These guys like the authors all all their edgy supporters are a dime a dozen on Steam (and unfortunately IRL) - you know the type. I see them a lot in these total randoms who come on to women's Steam profiles and try insulting them, just out of pathetic hopes for a response.he leans back in his chair, eying her profile carefully, reading and re-reading and re-re-re-re-reading over every last word, and shaking with rage for the seventh time at her profile pic, a small sized selfie where this shameless hore and dumb harlot is daring to smile. After a 20 minute crying break, they spend another hour or two trying to come up with the perfect retort, the most stunning insult, the flawlessly devastating comeback possible, sure to tear down and crumble her character and life.""hey ur fat"" they type, their 3rd chin glistening as they giggle the Cheeto crumbs off the scraggly hairs adorning it, and then they sit back and wait for her to respond. Hopefully she does respond, as they shift restlessly in their recliner and flip between MLP hentai and their Steam notifications, waiting until 4 am for that little green box to show up, praying that it's not an invite from CSGO Trade Bot 12 but instead it's... it's... her... finally noticing my existence. Of course she is not going to be happy, but there's no possibility of that. Being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off or the slightest tinge of irritation is fine, since negative attention is better than absolutely no attention, which is currently what they're getting from women, and their general track record since Mother Dearest got mad that they failed 5th grade for the 5th time.Oh yeah, this definitely should have been titled ""Mommy Issues: the Video Game"". Or maybe ""I Hate Women: Not Really But Please Pay Attention To Me"". You could even go for ""She Went Out For Cigarettes And Never Came Back: Stories That Should Be Kept Secret Between A Therapist And Myself"".Actual content is cringey as ♥♥♥♥. You can just feel the vicarious embarrassment washing over your body, as you step through this guy's bitter fantasy about women, and you can feel the unhidden anger all these neckbeards who play it radiate over you. Is this real life? Is this actually a video game? Did someone really attach their name to it? Do people seriously play this without irony? Does nobody have self-respect anymore?""You can play as more than 2 gendars!!! ROLF I TROLED U"" did a lesbian friendzone him? Is his masculinity still in tatters from the last time he waddled outside 5 years ago and saw a transguy who was under 500 lbs? ""what baout the wypipo!1 bigoted against straight menz ??"" something tells me that he's the type of guy who brings up affirmative action when nobody asked him to prove that white people are discriminated against, or who points out to nobody in general how guys don't always get custody of children, as if he stands the slightest chance of meeting someone with low enough self-esteem to reproduce with him.Beyond the cringey content? Like, actual gameplay? There's not much at all. And, well... looks like the achievements are bugged... not a great loss I guess. I haven't bothered to check but they're probably more whiney edgelord old memes, more sad attempts at getting women to notice them, as if having this god-awful game in one's library wasn't attention whoring enough. The game crashes frequently... but can you expect quality from a game that was♥♥♥♥♥♥out through cascades of tears over women being oppressive? Controls glitch out the game occasionally... but this wasn't meant to be played as much as be a way to publicly announce your issues with women, so whatever.Even if you do have a humiliation fetish (ha ha who would have that? lol ridiculous) playing this game (er, ""game"") might be a bit too much for you. After launching this monstrosity and trudging through as much as I could I feel like calling up my mom today and saying hi, just to remind myself that at least I'm not at the point where I masturbate to stepmom/son porn while claiming hot grills have daddy issues (side note: please never trust these guys around daughters). In fact, I think I'll go give her a call now, and wait for this painfully obvious bait review to generate some salt from angry gentlesirs, desperate to defend their fragile masculinity from claims that it's fragile.Keywords: SJW, Social Justice, Feminism, Feminazi, Edgelord, I Use Cuck Unironically When Nobody's Getting Laid, Badass, Alt-Right, Milo Yanipopopopololos, Triggering, Misogyny Is Ok When It's Done By Cool Guys, Women, Le Wimmenz, Women Who Don't Care About You, Women Who Laugh At You, Mother, Mom, Mommy, Maternal Figure, Sigmund Freud, Oedipus Complex, Οἰδίπους Τύραννος, Atheist, Atheism, Mountain Dew, My Little Pony, Waifu, 3D Women Are Inferior, Pls Respond M'Lady"

,Recommended,585550,30690028,Posted: 23 March,all,BombShell,"This heartwarming tale of courage and triumph will warm even the most frigid lady-parts. Guide the titular scrappy heroine as she shames the hetero-cisnormatives, welcomes immigrants, sorts aborted fetuses, and fights the patriarchy. A lovely gift for MRMs and feminazi's alike.This game was surprisingly enjoyable, though the gameplay was a bit confusing at first. Definitely worth buying."

I’ll have you know, I’ve been playing Minecraft for 4 years and have over 7,000+ hours on ONE server. So you go and call someone a meanie, while at this moment I’m currently at your base with 8 stacks of TNT. Your house will be gone, and all your valuables will be mine. And how do I know the server? I hacked your Minecraft account and stole the server IP with my mad hacker skills. You don’t know what’s coming, for the storm has just started to rise. I got here on a pig, without a carrot on a stick. How? Hours of experience. I trained with Notch for months. He taught me all the Minecraft secrets and how to code java, so if you DARE to challenge me, I will 1v1 u and destroy you. How can u dare challenge Im a god when you are a mere man. It’s like jesus fighting a coakroach. He will always win. So, don’t bully, scrub."
