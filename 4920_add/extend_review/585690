,Recommended,585690,31706346,Posted: 12 May,all,S0YxSauCe,Very easy game and awesome simple platformer with simplistic design. The best part of all you get to collect all the letters and characters.
,Recommended,585690,34590303,Posted: 29 August,all,Twistor,"Briefly:Minimalismis a semi-hardcore platformer with abstract visuals and clumsy controls.This is a hard one to review. While I thinkMinimalismwas altogether a good game, it does have its quirks and qualms.Square McSquarefaceIn visuals,Minimalismgoes all the way to abstract: even the main character is just a big square. The rest of the cast is rather typical: avoid spikes, sawblades and bullets (i.e. arrows).Gameplay is also usual: grab everything that's not locked in place and escape to the next level. You have to grab at least the keys, but all levels host a whole bunch of Japanese and Roman letters to find, each of which doubles as an achievement.Controls, on the other hand, range from unconfortable to unique.Full controller support: yes but...Initially, I playedMinimalismwith an Xbox controller. You jump with 'A' but as for other movement controls, the game recognizes only the stick: D-pad doesn't work.This would be fine, but McSquareface has only one mode of movement: full speed.Precision platformers commonly are played with gamepads because one can use the stick to control their speed precisely to time their jumps and avoid traps gracefully. You lose all that control if you can't control the movement speed. Early platformers did this with a specific run- (or more rarely walk-) button but that's non-existent here.Combined with some really tight corridors filled with spikes and pixel-wide platforms, frustration is guaranteed.Consequently, as you could only move if you pushed the stick all the way, playing with keyboard was actually easier and more natural. You can't change the keys though, so you are stuck with Space for jump.Unique wall-jumpsMinimalismhandles its wall-jumps in a quirky fashion. If you touch a wall, you'll slide down slowly, even if not moving towards the wall.Pressing jump button and keeping it down will jump you full speed towards the opposite direction like a regular jump. Releasing the jump button while in air will then stop the square in place and allow for air control. This works surprisingly well, though sudden slowing at the wall can be startling and mess up your trajectory.Strong level designSince death respawns you at the start of the level, it's good that the levels are not that big.Generally, the levels are well designed, challenging, and fair: it's usually your own fault if you mess up and die.However, at times the controls make this frustrating and rage-inducing. Also, the game introduces falling spike traps: these totally lack the visual cue that once you step near them, they will fall and kill you. This either stops your fast pace, as you either have toa)stop to check each spike lest they fall or not, orb)dieto the falling spike and feel a need to berserk the controller to the wall as you respawn at the start of the level.Why they had to put such an unfair device into the game?ConclusionsAs for technical side, I experienced screen-tearing and twitching, while retaining 60fps at those times. This graphics bug would haunt most of the levels at seemingly random intervals.Music is pleasant, soothing the upcoming frustration.After numerous attempts and annoyance at the controls, I managed to beat the game after 2 hours and 45 minutes. For $1 game (and I bought it with -75% coupon) the length was decent.The achievements, while nice, are a bit on the spammy side, as there are over 100 characters to collect. I suppose they will at least make nice profile decorations.I would recommendMinimalismfor gamers who love tough platformers. But only them: the rest of you should beware of the lousy control scheme."

,Recommended,585690,30180970,Posted: 25 February,all,ClovenSafe,This game would be great if the ground wasn't made out of lube. It's infuriating to do a whole area perfectly just to slide into a dull side of a spike and explode into bits.
,Not Recommended,585690,34031483,Posted: 4 August,all,A.,"You are a cube trying to find your way out by finding some keys and open the locked doors to proceed to the next level.- Minimalistic- Decent soundtrack- Cheap game- Letters and Japanese characters achievement that can be used to decorate your steam profile.

,Recommended,585690,34479377,Posted: 25 August,all,Helevorn,"As the title says, this is really a minimalistic platformer.Controls are quite a bit lousy but overall, I didn't expect the platformer of the year..It's still quite playable but somehow hard, mainly due to the controls and to the lack of checkpoints."

,Recommended,585690,31691683,Posted: 11 May,all,Kovic,"For a $1 title, it delivers more than enough.The controls can be a bit annoying at times, but that is mostly because of the difficulty/precision required on certain levels and the sometimes sluggish wall jumps.As usual with most platformer games, I recommend using a controller, but the K/M worked well enough.Also, it has a large amount of achievements, but be warned... getting to 100% won't be easy.  You will need to bring your ""A"" game and have some luck in order to complete this one."
,Not Recommended,585690,31617485,Posted: 7 May,all,Dracokon,"This is a game that is visually pretty nice and has a beautiful soundtrack, but past the first 10 ro so stages it is rendered virtually unplayable due to absolutely abysmal controls. Wall jumping seems random whether or not your directional inputs have any bearing, and often times the amount of distance you get from a jump is incongruent with how hard/long you press the jump button. Additionally, controlling your character while in the air is extremely hard to do and being able to jump immediately after landing is something that feels like it's completely up to chance whether or not it'll work.This game is proof that you can have a beautiful-looking piece of work, but if the controls are bad then the whole thing is shot."
,Recommended,585690,32243228,Posted: 7 June,all,Suttles,"While I got this game for 10 cents, and I didn't expect much -- and am only recommending it due to its cost -- this game impressed me.  It's not a bad platformer for its price.  The main problems with the game could easily be fixed by the developer.I've played -- and beaten Kaizo Mario levels.  I don't mind difficulty.  I've perfected the original Meatboy, getting all the bandaids.  Hard difficulty is fun, and actually enjoyable. This game attempts to do difficulty, and succeeds in some ways.  The difficulty feels very artificial over all.You are a giant square, so your hitbox is very big.  The levels typically require tight jumps, but your character is literally a giant cube.  You can see how that's a problem.  Spike hitboxes are also rather large.  Oh, and your character slides like an lubed up icecube.  I actually got used to these mechanics, so I was fine with all of that.  I also got used to the really funky wall jumping mechanics.  Then the game decided having some of the stagnant spikes be spikes that fall, without any visual difference or cue would be a good idea.  The first time it happened I instantly died, but the level was easy besides that one spike so I kept playing.  I went through a very long level, doing pretty well with the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor mechanics.  Then another falling spike killed me.Pros --+Cheap game+Trading Cards+Achievements+Alright platformer, decent amount of levels and feels fluid enough to keep you entertained for at least an hour.  31 levels total.+Controller support+Art style is actually not bad, and it lives up to the games name.  Easy on the eyes and simple.Cons ---Your character is a giant cube, and hitboxes are wonky.-Random spikes that fall, without any visual cue.  Cheap trick.-The various symbols are overdone.  Each symbol gives you an achievement, and there's no ingame way to see if you've got them all in a level.   I actually had to turn my steam notification for achievements off, to prevent the notification from causing my death.Overall its a subpar platformer, that is about what'd you expect for the cost.  A cheap game that uses cheap mechanics.  I'd recommend it if you get a coupon, or are looking for a relatively easy game to 100%.  Don't expect a good game, but don't expect some horrible trash that isn't worth buying if its on sale."

76561198025321433,Recommended,585690,31999620,Posted: 27 May,all,American Currency,"A game deserving of a ""neutral"" review.It is a game about guiding a cube from one end of the level to another, picking up keys and letters on the way that give you achievements, while dodging spikes.The game honestly isn't that awful, but the controls are way too sloppy for some of the precise jumps this game asks of you. It isn't as apparent for the first 15 levels or so, but then it comes into play and the last half of the game is a struggle.I am giving the game an upvote for the nice minimalistic artstyle and the wonderful music loop that calms you down in even the most annoying level; truly a beautiful piece and the best part about the game. If you can look past the annoying controls and have some patience, you can play through the game in less than 2 hours, picking up 165 achievements along the way.Personal Score: 6.5/10 (its not bad, but has some flaws)"
,Not Recommended,585690,32427688,Posted: 15 June,all,Edward Biderman,"This game may be cheap, but it is not worth it at all.First of all, the physics in this game are absolutly garbage. Some levels have precision platforming and everytime you fail it it feels super unfair because most of the time you did land it, but you slid into a spike that for some reason has a square hitbox. Also when you move at all, it is basically a set increment. Maybe this wouldn't be a problem, but the amount you move from a quick little tap is way too huge.I cannot recommend this simply because I know there are free flash games out there with more detail and better controls."

76561197994983638,Not Recommended,585690,32321807,Posted: 10 June,all,insanepyro6,"Dont bother. First, all the hitboxes are squares, so no effort put in there; minimalist on that point for sure.  Then you get to controls and input response... this is the epitomy of minimalist, three buttons, ok, no problem, but why space and the left and right arrow keys?  Oh, and you can't change them either...  Now lets talk response.  Press the button and get one response, at full value. So no sensitivity to contols, ok, fine if you want to play on ice and that's where the difficulty is so be it, as long as the buttons are immediately responsive... hint: they are not.  Try this on a wall in game, slide down a  wall and press jump.  Every once in a while the speed at which you come off the wall changes.  Well why is that? BAD CODING and No testing.  To sum it up, the game is minimalist in design, effort put in, and testing.  Thus if you really want it, take the minimalist approach... pay a minimalist amount... Free.  And play it a minimalist amount. None."
