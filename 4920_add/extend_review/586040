Maps change your playstyle drastically, and the 6 factions all have unique properties. You can also rebind all your keys to your liking, and therefore it'll play like the RTS's you're used to. Highly recommended game, which also comes at a great price!"

,Recommended,586040,29909310,Posted: 13 February,all,V A L K O I N E N_ R O S K A,"This game is great. Its like Red alert 2 injected with stereoids and the battles can get HUGE. Havent played rts games in a while so it was a bit tauting to hop right into pvp (as this is multiplayer only version of the developers 8-bit army games) but you will get the hang of things pretty fast. The maps are diverse and look amazing. Turtling is not recommended bcos other players will just destroy your resource gatherers with air units. i r8 8/8 m8 will spend hours with this game :)ps. and its super cheap so there is no reason not to buy it right?update: I know the game is ment to be simple, but imo a bit more complexity/strategy could do wonders. Also some the Renegade and guardian vehicles models are so small for example comparing to the content of 8-bit invaders and could use rescaling. Putting all what i said on this update aside the game is great and i have high hopes in the future regarding these games.Also the game has a f2p version that you can fully play as far as i know. The only restraint is that you can only play 1 faction at a time which changes over some rotation time."

It satiated my thirst for wc3/starcraft/battle for middle earth 2 while providing me with an eery nostalgic feeling from the days of nintendo/snes. However this hidden gem is dead, barely anyone plays and you can search for a quick match for up to 20 mins or more at times. Also not everyone can host games (unless you know how to open and close the right ports). Really fun and easy to learn game but I would not recommend because the player base is dwindling into nothingness and you would quickly find yourself pushed to find games especially ranked ones."
,Recommended,586040,34428137,Posted: 22 August,all,Cochese,"Good Stuff:This game Has an okay amount of content to offer for $5.00. You get to play as all 6 factions anytime compared to the Free-to-Play version. Buying the game gives you the ability to host multiplayer games on quite a good selection of maps, including community made maps.Bad Stuff: There has been no new factions released at all, same 6 as always, and only 2 of the 6 factions are actually good: The Cranioids, and the Marines who both have very OP gathering systems and good units. Lastly, you have to play for the $15.00 version of the game in order to play by yourself, or singleplayer with bots I mean, and there arn't too many people playing this game, at most you will see 5 or 6 in a single lobby, most of the time just a few guys and bots.I would only buy this game like I did, to play with friends, and have a good amount of fun off of a cheap RTS game. If you are buying this in hopes to play with random people, and you want a good 50+ hours of enjoyment, you are wasting your time playing this game. As I said, only 2 factions worth playing, and I don't see anymore getting added anytime soon."

Read on!A truly wonderful gaming experience and certainly worth your time trying it out (especially at such a give away price!).Addictive gameplay, simplistic and easy to pick up, yet also provides a great depth of strategy to explore.Beautiful, clean and clear art style, easy to understand, distinctive and full of character.FACTIONS6 unique factions with diverse playstyles. Paying for the game gives you all 6, the FTP version gives you 1 at random and changes each day.MAPSA plenitude of maps, creatively designed, which promote varied playstyles, keeping combat fresh and surprising.ONLINEThis game does not have an offline skirmish mode, it has a quickplay matchmaking service and an online lobby. Although the online lobby is pretty empty fairly often, you can host and players will trickle in soon after. Would love to see the community boom up!I'd suggest getting a friend to buy this with you and practice a little together, though, jumping into the fray with strangers is a great learning experience too as often you will find someone at your own skill level, it helps that there is a FTP version too.COMMAND & CONQUEROldschool C&C feel but freshened up! Fans of the franchise shall not be disappointed.If you are new to RTS then this is an incredibly accessible place to start.If you are a RTS veteran then this will soon be up in your top 510/10 a must try!If you want to test it then try the FTP version but honestly I'd just grab the 3.99 version now, it's a steal!"
76561198164687079,Recommended,586040,30087347,Posted: 21 February,all,Capitalism,"This game is a very simplistic RTS both artistically and mechanically, but that does not discredit it. For $5 this will satisfy many who miss the multiplayer component of Command & Conquer games. All six factions are somewhat unique but at the game's core are three different factions. I have not played the game enough to fully optimize each play style, but there seems to be some balancing issues at the beginner/novice levels of play with some games ending in as little as five minutes.Overall this is a fun little RTS that will have you at the very least enertained, but at its best enthralled."

,Recommended,586040,32446697,Posted: 15 June,all,DemoMan0351,"Not bad for price, but one major issue looms. 50% of the armies are dogshit just because of the resource gather mechanic. 50% can gather from all nods on the map with ease, the ""fantasy"" armies have to expand their base by building buildings (1 at a time) until they reach the nodes and can only farm a small amount w/minecarts. Just played a 30 minute game and the enemy harvested literally 3 times the resources I did and I was constantly hunting harvesters to try and slow him down. I had no chance."

And if your unsure, just get the demo. Now, i've played many matches with freinds, and i've gotten that special name that comes with competative gameplay. ""Rusher"" . Now, this game offers many playstyles, and the maps offer many different ways to attack a enemy player, or AI.Just get it, it's some of the most fun i've had."

If you don't have a buddy that plays this then DON'T buy it, you won't have fun for the lack of faction balance."

If you get the demo you will have access to the best part of the game, the multi-player. You can join a match in the lobby from a arrage of maps, after that you get given a armie to play as but if you buy 8 bit arena you get access to all the armies. you have the choice of cranoids (aliens), guardians (high tech), lightbinders (medvial), deathsworn (beasts), renegades (normal army) and another one that i cant remember of the top of my head. I give it a 9/10. Just make sure you check out the battle cam good luck!"

,Recommended,586040,30282832,Posted: 2 March,all,{LEO} EpicDF | csgobounty.com,"FROM THE MAKERS OF STAR WARS: EMPIRE AT WAR (My favorite RTS to-date), COMES AN AWESOME, INTENSE RTS: 8-Bit Armies!Anyhow, let's get into this: For $4.99, it's the best RTS you'll find anywhere on Steam. Has amazing gameplay, and a wide variety of armies to choose from (although the Cranioids and Marines are kinda unbalanced).~~Pros:~~- Low price for good gameplay- Fun multiplayer experience- Incredibly replayable, I have many hours on this game- Good idea for a multiplayer-only version for less $$$- Nice graphic design and audio track~~Cons:~~- All armies that go against Cranioids or Marines are nearly ALWAYS destined to fail if the player of the said army is even SEMI-competent- No AI SINGLEPLAYER gameplay (although this is mostly okay since it's a watered down version and the full version HAS AI gameplay)- Low playerbase, however, if you don't see a game in the browser, feel free to make your own. After maybe 3 minutes at max, some players will begin to trickle into your game.- Glitch with starting games: For some reason when you start a multiplayer game and not everyone has clicked 'Ready', it gets stuck in a loading screen for an undeterminate amount of time. I have also found this happens (even with everyone 'Ready') on certain player-made maps.~~~~~~~~~~My Final Thoughts~~~~~~~~~~~Overall, this game is great, and in my opinion FULLY worth the easy $5 for hours of fun. I didn't really care for the campaign but if you want to have a go at that, and have AI gameplay accessible, I believe the ""full"" version of this game is buyable for $15ish. I would recommend the 8-Bit Invaders version the most, as it has the most OP armies though :P ;)I rate this game 10/10 IGN |LEL M33MZ CONF1RM3D|:D"
