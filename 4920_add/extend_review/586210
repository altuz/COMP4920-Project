,Recommended,586210,30866567,Posted: 31 March,all,Eavy,"I've been using the older, free version of this software in conjunction with Elite Dangerous for months now, dozens of hours (which, unfortunately, aren't reflected with my review). With its release on Steam, I'm happy to purchase it and support the author and further development.OVRdrop lets you put any window (and now also the whole screen or webcam sources) into VR as a virtual screen that can be placed anywhere within the cockpit. Some use cases are watching your favorite movies/series or clips/streams during long trips or while grinding credits, bringing up a web browser or text editor for taking notes, planning routes or checking prices, or displaying a webcam that's aimed at your keyboard.It's become an essential add-on to Elite Dangerous for me. Great software and well worth its price."

I was searching for this type of thing for a long time, so I'm really glad it exists. I use an auto hot key script to solve the control loss problem. I found the auto hotkey script from dev's post on reddit here:https://www.reddit.com/r/OVRdrop/comments/6iff61/is_there_any_sort_of_guide_to_setting_up_ovrdrop/djdcbsi/Based on that post, it sounds like dev intends to integrate this, which is my #1 feature request."

At the moment i am using it in Elite Dangerous to access my desktop from the comfort of my cockpit. Performance is outstanding. I am sure there is some impact on performance, but i didn't really notice it.Something like this should be integrated into SteamVR IMHO. Well worth the money !"
,Recommended,586210,32183108,Posted: 4 June,all,FrostByghte,"If you have any steam compatible VR device, you need this program.  Essentially it allows you to put a screen within your VR environment that mirrors content from your desktop.  I've been using it for Elite Dangerous. I can either watch videos while playing or mirror relative applications inside of the game environment.  Tons of uses, very responsive developer.  Definitely worth supporting."

,Not Recommended,586210,33210555,Posted: 3 July,all,Mass,"Not reccommending for anyone who wants to use this with Elite Dangerous. Problem is, it takes control away from your elite dangerous window, meaning your joystick/game controller/keyboard input won't work any longer. Great for VR games that only use the hand controllers though.EDIT: if you have a second monitor, then you can get it to work using the ""always on top"" setting in OVR. Without a second monitor, you can't get it to work with elite dangerous unless you use 3rd party scripts."
,Recommended,586210,31706359,Posted: 12 May,all,DocHollis,"Great program, works better than the original free version, but the windows don't show up when you record or stream a video, so it just looks like you're staring off into space to everyone else."
,Recommended,586210,32427047,Posted: 15 June,all,Mikeycantoon,"Pretty slick software.  I love to use it on the backside of my left controller, my non-dominant hand to see discord or my stream going while playing stand up type VR games.  For Elite: Dangerous I get to watch Netflix again while exploring deep space.  I like it."
,Recommended,586210,34546759,Posted: 28 August,all,precisionV,"Thanks to the developer for providing something that probably should be included natively in SteamVR. Will everyone who uses VR need this? Probably not, but when you do frquently need to access other apps or software on your computer while in VR, this utility is awesome. I'm using it with VR simulation type software where I often need to research or look up something in a browser. If you're using a RIft or Vive, you already know that removing the headset is not something you want to be doing constantly so having a utility that allows you to stay in VR while accessing other apps is pretty damn useful.I do think the UI could use some work, but from what I've been reading in the discussions, the developer is actively releasing updates and improvements."

Cannot get it to work with elite dangerous.  V dashboard works better despite being really laggy."

By real world I mean the rest of my PC.  Thanks to OVRdrop, I can spend more time in VR while still checking up on email, slack, & watch videos.  Can't wait for multi-monitor support!"

The framerates are brilliant compared to the old version.After replacing the Inateck (fresco chipset) usb3 card driver that came with Windows 10, all problems with dropouts are history. Now I can watch films in tilt brush and while playing Elite.Almost impossible to describe how useful and effective this peice of software is.Cant wait till it is a bit more polished.Well done.:)"

,Recommended,586210,35352276,Posted: 30 September,all,A Swamp Creature,"Very cool. I would like to see an option to hide the settings that appear in the top corner and on the bottom of the windows you generate, though. I use this to display my phone via sidesync only, so I'd like to get rid of the little in-game menus to modify that window.https://youtu.be/p_uxUl9veKk?t=7Another cool thing would be if we could someday have a ""touch input"" option instead of ""laser input"" only. What I mean is using a virtual finger to touch the display as if it were a touchscreen, like you do with the watch in Rec Room, rather than trying to point a laser at the screen as a pointer. This would provide less precision, but far more stability.A couple other things on my wishlist:-Rendering in-game objects above the window (obviously)-Having input work in the steamvr menu-Having a ""steamvr menu""-only option. So I could just press the menu button to see my phone or whatever, and control it from there."
,Recommended,586210,35045914,Posted: 18 September,all,MissBizz,"PERFECT! I picked up a Vive Thursday and wanted to stream by Sunday, and this game was exactly what I needed to read stream chat. It worked with all the games I tried, though one game if I moused over the chat in any way (in VR) it cut out the game sound? I imagine there's a setting I could tweak to stop that from happening."

,Not Recommended,586210,31482219,Posted: 1 May,all,SneakyJoe.ru,"Bought this thing to read chat from twitch etc.Didn't work showing grey screen at start, so I refunded. Toyed around some other solutions, and found out that OpenVRDesktopDisplayPortal works fine, but doesn't save settings - I had to setup everything manually each time.Since they're basically the same, I decided to buy thisa thing again after refunding. Still grey screen. I suppose, the dev broke something after his updates.Please, fix. For now not recommended."

This program gives you the added monitor within a game with all the customization you can ask for.It has crashed a couple of times but I'm not worried about it.  It usually works without issue and has lasted well over an hour on a couple of runs.Excellent program.  Climbey with a television screen floating is all sorts of fun.  I LOVE THIS APP!"
76561198000790392,Recommended,586210,31547890,Posted: 4 May,all,AgentM83,"Just adding my positive review, because I fear things of this kind of utility will go unsung in spite of functioning really, really well. It has been tremendously useful for me, and will probably continue to be so until SteamVR integrates more tethers to the real world (combining this with a mirror of my phone like Samsung SideSync allows me to watch for messages from my girlfriend or other phone notifications, and it also takes cumbersome distance between listening to a music player in a browser and hopping back into Tilt Brush for audio generative brushes out entirely). Thank you!"
,Recommended,586210,31134385,Posted: 14 April,all,Pelzgurke,"Great tool for any VR user. Watch videos while you play, have access to your browser or chat, view your second screen in VR and such. You can even watch 3D videos (SBS only so far).Performance has been vastly improved over the freeware predecessor, well worth its money.Usage can be a little bit fiddly, but I quickly got the hang of it and now I do not want to miss it anymore."

What he/she hasn't mentioned is the second monitor you will need in order to make it work properly, OR, you can spend 6.7 hours messing(I wanted to use a harsher word here) around with settings to ""Bodge"" the program to work.Sure I can get it to work on one monitor, it won't save settings, it won't allow me to do anything with the window at all unless I lose complete control of the game, and then getting the game back is a nightmare.For now this is a big thumbs down from me. DO NOT BUY WITHOUT A SECOND MONITOR!"

As a VR streamer on twitchtv this app is absolutely essential for a smooth streaming experience for both yourself and your viewers. Add to that the fact you can watch netflix while cruising the galaxy in elite dangerous. Or you can watch a guide for minecraft while playing Vivecraft. The possibilities are endless as you can just mirror your desktop in VR. If you attach it to the back of your controller you can only see it if look at your wrist. When you do this you can use your other hand as a laser pointer for the mouse cursor. This app effectively gives you seamless access to the entirety of your desktop.
,Not Recommended,586210,32303832,Posted: 9 June,all,[XGS]DonkyBoY,"I brought this to use with Elite Dangerous (While you can force it its not supported and you have to run extra scripts to make your joystick / hotas continue to work)Maybe the developer could actualy support the Oculus Rift like addvertised on the Store page.This product does not support any VR headset it supports SteamVR and as Oculus games use the Oculus-SDK it is useless for just about all of them as they dont launch in SteamVR)There is a bug that the developer uses to make this work with Oculus titles IF it works and that is to launch the game in Win7 compatiblity mode loosing the benifits of the Oculus driver and launching with SteamVR.(This is not what I call support for Oculus Rift)Why am I using the software if I donot recomend it to others =There are no other choices this is it, so if you want these features you got to put up with it untill the developer does the right thing and fix's / add's support for the Oculus-SDK(They claim this is not something they can do on thier end so I doubt that will ever happen)Or someone else release's a program that can do what OVRdrop can not."

We can and will wait. Good stuff needs time (onemanjob).I am using it for Elite most of the time. It just feels great to easily move and position your window (desktop or every other open window like vlc) around in your 3d vr space.If you can use alt-tab, then there should be no problem with interacting your preferred window (pause, next etc.)."
,Recommended,586210,35198878,Posted: 25 September,all,jimj,Great utility! Display desktop windows in VR. NOTE for Oculus Unreal games you have to set the game to Windows 7 Compatibility mode.Also awesome for development. Using UE with VIve you can see log windows etc from the editor whilst in VR. This only works for the Vive though not the Oculus.
76561197985114487,Recommended,586210,35235549,Posted: 26 September,all,Panthercules,"Amazing piece of software!  Was having an issue trying to be able to use the map inside VR while playing IL-2 Sturmovik - Battle of Stalingrad (BoS).  That game's devs have done a fantastic job of implementing VR for that awesome flight sim, but going to VR meant I could no longer easily use my old map methodology where I used to have the map displayed on an iPad.  I heard  about OVRdrop from someone on the IL-2 forums, and gave it a try.  It took me a little bit of experimentation to understand how the program works, but with relatively little effort I was able to use OVRdrop to get a copy of the BoS map injected into my airplane's cockpit in BoS - very much like looking down at a knee board like the real pilots would do.  It's even possible to interact with the map via the mouse (to zoom or move it around if necessary, like when I really get lost trying to get home).  This has really increased the utility and enjoyment of flying BoS in VR (which was already pretty amazing).BTW - I'm using a Rift CV1 and it's working great with it.Can't thank you enough for coming up with this and making it available - well worth the price for this gem!"
,Recommended,586210,35426662,Posted: 2 October,all,Fulltor,"If you are used to using multiple monitors for other things while gaming, then OVRdrop is very useful. The interface takes some getting used to, but once you understand how it works, you can really customize the tool exactly how you want. Use the presets to find a close version to what you want, and then tweak it from there. This is essential for streamers to use for chat as I can attach it to the back of the controller so I just flip my hand around to see chat while in game and don't see it when my controller is pointed in a natural direction. You can also switch to any open window, or the full monitor so you can basically control your whole desktop from within VR. It's also great for controlling music players in game without having to take the headset off and walk to the keyboard. Great product, just what I needed."
