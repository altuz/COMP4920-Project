,Recommended,586240,29992559,Posted: 17 February,all,ＪＡＧｏｒＮＡＴ,"So i dont really know how to start. Just know that im gonna speak about random things. Before these know this: This is a great game. You are going to find yourself in it. Just buy and play it. You wont regret.I bought this game this morning in the hope of playing a ""survival game"". Wasn't expecting to encounter a masterpiece.Im sure you felt this burden in your journey through life. Melanchony. You cannot enjoy anything, you cannot enjoy your life. You just see how pointless  this life is. How people made up our lives, their lives. Everything in life such as love, happiness, friendship, goals everything is a shelter made up by us. Or are they?It depends on you. Are you a soul searcher? Or are you an escapist?This game goes through these emotions, it makes you think about yourself, about your life about the way this world goes.""Should you really go?"" says the girl in the beginning.  ""There are more important things in life.""Should we really follow our ancestors by doing all these? By wasting our lives in the goal of getting a job? Buying a house? Having children? Are these the things that makes us ""human"" ?You know, this game hit me cause i  had these feelings for a long time.""I don't feel any kind of happiness or sadness. I just feel serenity. I feel melancholy.""""Melancholy is a great burden, but if you carry it, it'll  make you see things.""""I see things""""I saw things that no one was supposed to see.""""I'll never speak again. I'll never write again.""Melancholy really makes you see things. It helps you to see the truth. It helps you to look at life from a distance, like an explorer, like you dont have any bonds with anything. Like you are no human at all. It is depressive but somehow it is great. I guess thats why elderly says ""Don't think too much.""Why am i still alive than? Why are we still alive after knowing all these? Is it love that keeps us going? The game touches this point. ""All is lost when i put my head on your lap. It all fades away."" I think everything that keeps us going are like drugs. They makes us forget. They helps us to run away, hide.  ""I'll forget what i've been through. For that is the way to go through even more. Even more..."" the game says.,I still play lots of games, i watch tons of movies and series, i love my special one. Not just to keep going. Not just to wait for my death. I enjoy doing these. You know, there is a thick line between being a soul searcher or an escapist. But i still dont know which i am. But i'll try to be a soul searcher. Maybe in some point of my life, i will decide that if its worth all these. But not now. I should get going, i should search for the souls.You know i dont even know what am i talking about anymore. Just me and my feelings i guess. About the game, its great. Its a great experience. Definitely consider buying it. Thank you Kayabros for making this kinda game. Thank you for expressing my feeling better. Teşekkürler <3"

It shows that you don't really need fancy graphics, or expensive sound design in order to provide good time for the players. I always compare these kind of games with other types of entertainment that I spent money to. Yesterday the ticket for a movie that I went was more expensive than Soul Searching and definitely was a worse experience. Games like this, makes you interact, care and think, puts you into the driver seat. I always appreciate these kind of games and kudos to their developers.I definitely recommend it even with full price, it's much better time spent than a 100 min movie, and it's still cheaper :)"
,Recommended,586240,31868723,Posted: 20 May,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Soul Searchingis great example of an indie title that has modest scope, yet ends up being bigger than itself.The end result is greater than the sum of its parts. It has asoul. Indie games like this do what AAA titles could never achieve - they poke at fundamental human questions and issues, and like real life, they often do not achieve a satisfying resolve. That's okay. That's life.Essentially,Soul Searchingis a *very* lite survival sim where you are on a quest to 'find yourself'.Almost zen-like, if you ask me - there is no fighting, and it is hard to die (along with little-to-no punishment for death). You can finish the game in, oh, about 2 hours, but achievement hunting is fun and will double that. There is local multiplayer which I am eager to try because the wifey played single player and enjoyed that. That says something right there. Otherwise, there are several things that pleasantly surprised me. You will find a variaty of different rafts you can buy, and they have modular features such as oars, ladders, rudders, fishing gear, fresh water supply, etc. Really neat. There is currency and magic. The dialogue is well done, and asks meaningful questions for anyone who thinks critically about their life. There are small random 'events' that you will find out at sea, which is cool.And dragons.WhereSoul Searchingreally shines is in it's presentation.The music and game flow almost create a cinematic experience; it was touching at moments, for sure. I won't go into spoilers, but the story is good. Well, at least I can say that the first half had me super excited about it, but I felt it ended more with a whimper... Or perhaps I was hoping it would go another way - but that's okay because the overall experience is still great.Well worth the asking price. You will get an afternoon filled with some great gaming and a thinkpiece story.Pros:+Great zen-like/lite survival game+Presentation and game flow are brilliant and really showcase how indie games can have soul+Interesting story+Controller support is great+It's fun+DragonsCons:-If you value a dollar-to-hour ratio, you may be disapointed here - but the hours are certainly high quality-Be aware that the storyline is a bit dark (not a con per se, but just know this)Glad I picked this up and played through it.I look forward to getting the local multiplayer achievement, too. Absolutely charming."
,Recommended,586240,30050092,Posted: 19 February,all,volleys,"While the graphics are simple, the story is powerful. Soul Searching isn't so much about getting to the end as it is exploring and searching each island and listening to the people and what they are saying. There are times when the story explains things that make you wonder the true plot of the game, but it all makes sense at the end. In a way, without giving too much away, it is about finding life when struggling with the horrible things that either go on mentally or physically around you. The struggles of every day life and even the struggles of depression and how it affects a person. Soul Searching is beautiful and, though slow and slightly frustrating at times, is a wonderful story and very peaceful. I will happily play it again and again, perhaps enjoying the other aspects of the game instead of just the story."
,Recommended,586240,29948234,Posted: 15 February,all,Kabraxis,"Soul Searching is one of the best indies i've played this year. On top of it's heartfelt story, survival part doesn't get tedious at all. In it's ocean of surprises, there's a huge pile of content to explore with your small raft."

,Recommended,586240,29959956,Posted: 16 February,all,Household Companion,"Wow, game is just finished now and I didn't realize how the 3.5 hours passed by so fast, warm and smooth... Soul Searching was a really unique indie perl that would totally worth your time. I would easily recommend this game to anyone.There were really something there, that would easily touch to any soul, who would just dare to open it and take a look inside. Especially, the dialogs and cutscenes were really magical, that i have never seen in any other game before.To set sail to unknown with just a little boat and watching the clouds passing by... It was the unique feeling that Soul Searching builded up it's deepest core that makes it an unforgetable experience. I'll remember this one... Nowadays, it is very hard to find a game with that unique feeling. 10/10!"
76561198312435366,Recommended,586240,30269184,Posted: 1 March,all,Celadir,"I didn't expect very much going into the game but it was overall a very nice experience.It's a simple exploring game with minimal game mechanics, lots of downtime to think about what is happening with the story. Also has a great soundtrack.Most of the enjoyment of this game for me came from applying what was happening in game to my own life.If that sounds apealing at all to you than I would definitely recommend Soul Searching to you."
76561198039172991,Recommended,586240,31350801,Posted: 24 April,all,Diver,"If you are looking for a game that is short but includes some spirit in it, this is your game. It is a compact adventure with a nice philosophy in it."
,Recommended,586240,30095093,Posted: 22 February,all,umutd81,"Very impressive and original little game.You play someone who decides to sail away from home for ""soul searching"" (which itself is a bit mystery for us at the beginning). After you sail, story is delivered in bits & pieces and puts you into an introspective mode about yourself alongside the character in the game.Game really excels at evoking feelings of loneliness & serenity by the gameplay itself, which is simply sailing from one island to another by yourself and trying to stay alive while days & nights go by and nature throws interesting things at you.I think it's fair to say graphic style might not appeal to everyone but overall atmosphere is pretty successfull at luring you once you start playing, with nice details and use of sound and music.Can be completed in 3 hours, filled with little suprises. If you like indie games with personal stories (Ilike me), you'll probably like this one."
,Recommended,586240,30468095,Posted: 12 March,all,Frank,"This review doesn't contain spoilers but if you're reading this to get my recommendation, I'd instead recommend you just play the game, because I talk about things that it's better you discover for yourself.Lovely game, that's clearly very personal to the developer. Touches on deep issues but avoids lecturing or asserting its own point of view. Comments on society but avoids criticising any particular group or idea.I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys unique game experiences (like myself) and can appreciate a game that respects you as a player. The three hours it takes to complete the single player (haven't touched the co-op yet) float by, without a dull moment. Gentle survival mechanics encourage narrative, rather than suppress gameplay and the navigation helps the confined, rich story feel like a real journey.Disclosure: I have a vague twitter acquaintance with the developer, Talha Kaya, who sings you a song at the end and uses the word ""art"" a lot."

,Recommended,586240,30047008,Posted: 19 February,all,le.rodney,"As the description says, Soul Searching is like Life of Pi meets magical setting of LeGuin's Earthsea, with a special sauce. If you are looking out for an emotional experience that allows you to contemplate through a meaningful journey, then search no more. A masterpiece awaits!"
76561198055088852,Recommended,586240,30073533,Posted: 20 February,all,serkan3k,"Soul Searching is an evidence of that, games as a medium can not be defined solely with so-called genres. In no other survival game, I have felt such strong connection and empathy with the protagonist. It is beyond mechanics: The soundtrack, visuals, and audio are wrapped around a unique and compelling narrative. A stellar performance from the sole developer who worked day in day out to create a masterpiece. The best dollars I have ever spent since HM series. A must-have in your library if you are especially interested in games as an art form."

The story is very nicely done.This is one game you shouldn't be going for a speed run. Instead, I recommend you to talk to characters you meet, get to hear their stories, and watch what's around when you are on board. Just enjoy your journey."

Great music, sad story.I would love a multiplayer version that was more survival focused (rather than solely exploration focused) and a bit longer; that said it was really nice to just sit back and fish. Also, terrific support for us Linux folk!"

Story mod is not too long, but if you talk with everyone and search every island, you could find and learn new things.  You could learn new magics, if you search every island and every island include different stories. Try to take every oh (oh is a object that stands on the sea and their colours change time by time). I was feeling like in a space, but in the end I enjoyed a lot. If you love the songs, you can find in the Spotify. Actually I'm fall in love with songs.(https://open.spotify.com/album/0pDOKEohHN5VRCUan09wGn)At the end it's cheap and I strong suggest buy this game.Good and peaceful games. :)Yukarıda ne kadar yanlış sırayla yazsamda.Bu oyun size hayatınızı sorgulatmaya yöneltiyor.

,Recommended,586240,32360445,Posted: 12 June,all,Rooster Rawlington,"Seems to be based on the asinine idea that home is where the heart is and that a pre-existing social circle is irreplaceable. This is absolutely false. Just something I have personal experience with, so I felt it deserved a comment.Otherwise, the game is generally relaxing and fun, but at times slightly frustrating. I found the raft mechanics a bit fiddly, but this might be on purpose. That, and a dragon kept coming around to destroy my stuff, so I haven't yet managed to get to the farthest island, which is presumably the end.Cool little introspective game. I just happen to disagree with the writers."

76561198385131590,Not Recommended,586240,31846209,Posted: 19 May,all,Marauder,"**SPOILERS**In ""Soul Searching,"" there is a main purpose that is NOT supported by the game itself. That unsupported purpose is that we as people have to tackle our problems, not run away from them. While the black-and-white cutscenes do have characters that reflect upon this concept, the main story diverts completely away from it. The main story is short and very uneventful. You seem to be soul searching only because your ancestors did so, not because you actually need to. What did soul searching have to do with mending the friendship between people and dragons again? The story is completely capable of completion WITHOUT awakening any souls and learning their ablities. When the dragon took me back to my home island and the game ended, I wondered if throughout the game I was either trying to save souls (from what?) or create peace with dragons and humans again. Would I reccomend this game for only seven dollars? Only if you're looking for something aesthetic and pleasing to the eye. But to those who are searching for a clear and sensible story, be warned.Pros:-Looks beautiful-Great and relaxing soundtrack-Simple controls-Decent price (when on sale)Cons:-Short and confusing story-Uneventful dialogue-Large lack of development with characters-ALL components of the boat can possibly be burned (forcing you to purposefully die b/c you can't sail the boat)-Wondering what I had really accomplished after the end of the game"

,Not Recommended,586240,30636290,Posted: 20 March,all,Rawsome83,"It might be me, but I just found this game surprisingly frustrating..The controls are made unnecessarily complicated for how simple they are supposed to be. The ""survival"" mechanic is just badly thought out, as it forces you to go from A to B on the map. There's little to no leaniancy when it comes to exploration as you'll starve to death before before you can even begin ""exploring"".I know, you might be able to get a fishing rod and supply food that way, but I never got to see that. And when you inevitably die, you're brought back to a state where you're about to starve to death again. And stuff you pick up to eat doesn't seem to respawn.Idunno, it's just a bit wonky and not thought out in the survival department. It feels a bit ""on rails"" to me.I like the games abstract artstyle, but it also feels a bit empty in the way of mechanics. And like I said, the controls are just needlessly bad. I bet lots of people will like this, but I'm sadly not one of them."
,Recommended,586240,30019054,Posted: 18 February,all,ICould,"I don't know when will I finish the story mode, so I want to give you my thoughts of my first two hours of gameplay.First of all, the game is huge. There are too many hidden places and untold mechanics. Thinking on and tinkering with those  things makes the game even more fun (For me at least).Then you get to row to an unknown adventure where only you can make the decisions. As an RPG fan, I just love it.I can just tell you more and spoil the game but It seems that even the first part of the game has a lot to talk about. So, I'm just gonna end my review here and encourage you to buy this game.By the way, I give 4.0/5.0 to music and artwork. They are pretty good too.BON VOYAGE !.."
,Recommended,586240,30019953,Posted: 18 February,all,Ragnor,"Here we have a lovely indie game filled with melancholy, depresssion, hope, dreams, death and living. It is a very small game but you can clearly see that every piece of it made with love and care.The story mode is maybe a bit short but definitely sweet and surely make you smile and warm your heart. Also you'll probably miss somethings at your first play so you'll give it an another try at least on more time.Also when you have couple of your friends with you, you could try random mode. Playing it solo was fun, sailing with your ship etc. but it is much much more fun when you have your friends with you to sail with. When everyone operating a different stuff on the ship, people coordinating how to sail, navigate, fish then you'll see how it is totally different from the story mode but equally if not more fun to play.Buy this game, it is dirt cheap."
