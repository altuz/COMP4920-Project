,Recommended,586310,29603535,Posted: 31 January,all,CrainBramp,"Initial ThoughtsThis is a nice combination of a couple of different games, and plays like a collection of mini-games strung together, but well done.  The graphics are your standard retro-style graphics, but well done, with them not taking the excuse to do sub-standard models, as some developers using this style are wont to do.  The controls are very standard, and the entire game plays with a mouse.  When firing weapons, you have the choice of clicking manually or using an automatic version of the weapon, although with a caveat (more in gameplay).  Overall, a great first impression.GameplayAs I said earlier, it's like a string of small mini-games, but they are setup well, and integrated well.  You travel from city to city, picking up ingredients for tacos, unlocking new recipes for tacos, and selling tacos.  You can also repair and upgrade your taco truck and weapons.  The basic game play goes: (a) leave city for another city, travel on the highway, shooting up mutants, animals, and obstacles for meat ingredients, (b) arrive at city with the option of fueling up, serving tacos for money, upgrading your taco truck, and buying topping ingredients from the local store.  Rinse and repeat.  You may serve tacos as many times as you like in each location..Highway:The highway is a simple 3 lane highway your truck auto-drives down while you use your roof-mounted weapon to take out on-coming mutants (humans and mutated animals, the latter of which drops meat for your tacos) and other obstaces, and fire at items on the side of the road like metal signs (for scrap) and animals (like cows, for carne asade). When an entity that drops something dies, you still must click the item to pick it up, even if you're on automatic weapon fire. This can make auto weapon fire a pain to use.  It would be nice to see them switch to an auto pickup in this mode also.Serving Tacos:This is like many standard food serving games ... customers arrive with an order for a taco, and you must build the taco by using the ingredients in the right layer order, and within a reasonable amount of time. Quick service gets you a better rating and tips.  After serving, you either keep satisfied customers or lose unsatisfied ones.  If a customer orders something you don't have the ingredients for (you've run out, etc), you must cancel the order, and they are unsatisfied.Local Store:You purchase toppings for your tacos here (cheese, onions, salsa, mold, etc). Outside the store is also a gas pump to fill up.  It's a one-shot fee that simply fills your tank up, so strategic refilling is necessary. You can increase your tank range as you upgrade your truck.Garage:Here you can upgrade your truck in a number of different ways, and also use scrap (from shooting signs on the highway) to upgrade various items.Random Encounters:Also, while parked, you have the chance to have a band of mutants come roaming into town that you have to shoot up to protect your customers.  This might give you some sorely needed meat for your tacos and allow you to make some money if you were about to move on.ProgressionSince the game gives you the option of going to the city of your choice (here are both green cities (easy) and red cities (hard) that you can choose to go to), and also lets you serve tacos until you run out of ingredients, the progression is very much up to you, which I like.  If I need more money, I can just serve people until I run out.  In addition, considering that not all cities have all ingredients, there is some strategy in keeping ingredients in stock, and you *can* back yourself into a corner and not be able to serve without having to cancel your orders and even lose the game if bad choices are made.ReplayabilityThe base gameplay doesn't change, but your orders, the threats on the road you face, and so on, do change some. I don't think it would be a game I would replay, but I could see someone playing this again as something fun to pass the time.Graphics and PerformanceThe retro theme works really well for this game, and the performance is what you would expect out of a non-demanding game. Even folks with integrated graphics should be able to run this. The title has native 4K resolution support.  My system tore through this like molten steel through room temp butter; I'd like to see an option to limit your frame rate in-game so that you're not wasting GPU cycles when you're getting 1,000 FPS.Final ThoughtsA solid concept with a few items here and there I'd like to see changed. The game suffers a bit on the replayability side, but the rest of the game makes up for it.  A great first entry from this programming family, and a worthy addition to my library.Gameplay:3 StarsProgression:3 StarsReplayability:2 StarsGraphics and Performance: 3.5 StarsTotal:My Gaming Rig:http://crainbramp.com/my-rigMy Blog:http://crainbramp.com"

I've never played any games before (other than the kind on Facebook). I kinda knew what Steam was, but I had to ask a gamer friend for more info about it. I got Steam installed, found Gunman Taco Truck, installed it, started playing (on Easy) and promptly died. :-)I'm awful at shoot-'em-up games, but I'm having SO much fun with this one! I love discovering new things as I travel to different cities. The slot machine games are fun, especially when you're just a bit short of having enough scrap for an upgraded truck. There are so many interesting elements to this game that I'm never bored while playing. I die often, but that doesn't discourage me at all, because there are new ways to play when starting over.I definitely recommend this game. If an almost 50-year-old female with absolutely no gaming experience can have fun with it, you can too."
,Recommended,586310,29550040,Posted: 28 January,all,PikaCommando,"The game is actually a lot more difficult than I expected. The driving sequences test your reflexes from all that♥♥♥♥♥♥coming towards you while the taco-making sequences are like one of those memory games. There's also resource management involved too, with the food ingredients, scrap parts and money. If you suck at both of those, you'd wind up dead on the highway, beaten to death by a gang of chainsaw-wielding marauders (just like real life!).The artwork's great; it's in those sprite-based style reminiscent of those old Flash games on Newgrounds or Kongregrate like Infectonator. Music's good too; its Tex-Mex style fits the game but isn't particularly memorable.It's a pretty solid game, but there's a few minor flaws too. Some of the text in the game uses a generic font that just seems out of place (such as the numbers when you hit an enemy) and could've used a sprite-like font to fit in with the rest of the game's texts. There's also a slot machine minigame in some shops that you can win money with, but there's nothing in the game the scoring system (if there's any, because there's no controlling each slots so it could be completely random). Also, it's probably a bug, but I see a few posters in the mechanic shops have their text unaligned (running out into the walls and floors).Ultimately, I'd give a 5/7, because it's one of those games that's only great for short-bursts of time. A mobile version that you can play on-the-go while waiting for public transport though, now this would be the perfect game for that platform."
,Recommended,586310,29888979,Posted: 12 February,all,Tag Wolf,Amazing game. Even cooler developer (kid).Serious props to you for not making something in the fold and taking a risk by making a rogue-like / oregon trail / cooking game.It's actually fun and that's the most important thing in a video game.Thanks man. I can't wait to see what you make next!
,Recommended,586310,29620247,Posted: 31 January,all,Aeratril,"This game is refreshingly original, and simply fun. It's almost hitting some nostalgia strings for the 90's kid in me - I definitely have to give props to a new game that pulls off the retro style this beautifully. Love the graphics, love the creative premise, love the gameplay.It's surprisingly difficult for how straightforward the game mechanics are - I personally don't think that's a bad thing. I like the challenge.Great game - excellent job! :D"
,Recommended,586310,29723622,Posted: 5 February,all,Amon26,"You know that old phrase ""easy to learn, dificult to master?"" GMTT doesnt just walk that fine line, it dances across it.  A game made up out of a lot of microgames, it borrows a page or two from WarioWare, however, the resutls of each microgame game pays direct benefit into next.  It doesn't hurt that the whole game is pinned around a fun loving, insane sensibility.  The humor and lore is suckerpunch quick, unrelenting without taking precedence over gameplay.Honestly, I cant think of anyone I -wouldn't- recommend this to.  Its fast, fun, simple, weird, throwback and modern all in one insane package.  Very well done.  Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go to the Cantina for fajitas and a corona."
,Recommended,586310,29609447,Posted: 31 January,all,Deebs,"Edited this review-It seems the ingredient problem hasn't happened since, and I'm enjoying it much more. I don't know if something actually changed since I wrote last or not, but things are actually managable now and I'm able to get pretty far. So I'm changing my review to positive since it seems like that ingredient problem may have been a fluke.Overall, a fun game. I enjoy the different management aspects of it and the shooting portions are fun, if sometimes hectic in a good way.(Old review down here)You can edit reviews later, right? Because I really don't want to leave this at 'negative', because it -is- a fun game.However right now, it feels like a really 'unfair' game and I feel like there are balancing issues.My biggest issue is buying ingredients. Playing in 'easy' mode (which does not seem very easy, to be honest) and visiting about... six? I think six different cities, never once was I able to restock on cilantro. The only cilantro I had in the entire playthrough was the stock have at the beginning. Everything else I was well stocked with, but because I could not make more than the five initial tacos with cilanto, I was severly kneecaped at the beginning and ended up being unable to progress due to something that wasn't my fault as the player.I hope things get rebalanced. I don't mind ingredients not always being available because that's clearly the point of the game, but a six city run shouldn't lead to it never appearing."
,Recommended,586310,29741352,Posted: 6 February,all,\\ Oven Chips,"A solid game for the price, starts off easy but strategy comes into play rather quickly - managing gas, cash, taco supplies and keeping your truck in one piece makes for one very fun game."
76561197970879259,Recommended,586310,29958395,Posted: 16 February,all,Gol_Stoan,"So far finding this game highly enjoyable. Some interesting depth to something that seems simple on the surface. It is a Roguelike similar to FTL in some ways, and the taco mechanic brings to mind Papers Please. The taco recipes get more complex as you progress to different locales, and you are always under that time constraint. It is a neat mix of different elements that mesh together really well with lots of heart and fun. Would run out of gas and get torn apart by mutants again!"
76561198039506974,Recommended,586310,29910210,Posted: 13 February,all,ChanSama,"9/10. Better than 90% of the roguelikes on the market. (I only give the best RLs a thumb-up)I remember playing one Android game from John Romero's son. Not sure if it was this son. Anyways, this boy blows my mind. It's like a more balanced, more strategical version of Death Road to Canada. I loved that game but the RNG killed it. This game relies less on RNGs but since you can choose different routes to Canada and different paths of upgrading the truck, the replaybility is still pretty high. Even the easy mode will let you die a couple of times - this is still a solid roguelike.The only improvement I can think of is having the weapons auto-fire. In the current version a player needs to click way tooooo much, which is completely unnecessary.I gotta go but I 100% recommend this game. Good job, kid."

76561198003839110,Recommended,586310,30506549,Posted: 14 March,all,Xarion,"I first seen this game when Jim Sterling played it on the Jimquisition and was kind of on the fence about it. To my surprise, it's a great game, it really is, but holy crap does it crash a lot. In an hour and a half of playing it's crashed at least 6 times, probably more. Thankfully you don't loose much progress when it does crash, but it's still irritating.Crashes aside, it really is a fun game. Every piece of it works together so well. Making tacos to make money, buying ingredients (not everything available at every stop so you need to plan ahead), the road sections shooting down meat and scrap, upgrading your truck or buying a new one (a new truck makes a huge difference for those struggling).Glad to see John's son following in his dad's footsteps, and that the whole family was working on this project in some form. Looking forward to a patch to address the constant crashing, but otherwise, I highly recommend this game."

There are also some small annoyances like the game not actually pausing while you go into your recepie book, and it being very easy for you to run yourself into a rut when it comes to cash to the point where the only way to fix it is a restart. Overall it is pretty fun but needs a little work."

This could easily be a Breaking Bad simulator if you swapped out the blue crystal with tacos!The game feels very well balanced and the attention to detail is amazing for such a simple design. I feel like the developers really wanted to deliver quality in this release.Sometimes I feel like I might be playing this wrong, because my instinct is to make sure my truck is stocked to 100+ ingredients at all times. This allows me to travel around the US and never really go to the end game xD.It would be cool if there was a ""complexity mode"" which would prevent towns from dying off when you leave, and reward the player when they come back to visit, only increase the price of gas when revisiting the same town for the 2nd, 3rd time... etc.I just hate feeling like I can't save the world with my taco truck, too many dead people!"
76561198053059224,Recommended,586310,34093638,Posted: 7 August,all,GhengisPecan,"I bought this game because I liked the fusion of a cooking sim with a shoot em'up, which is a bizarre yet quite fitting combo in this game.  You drive around the US in your truck making more and more complicated tacos, fighting against more and more dangerous enemies and mutants. It's satisfying and addictive, in the sense that I can mute the game and chill while playing with a podcast or tv or radio in the backgrond. In a way it's like other driving sims, but involved enough that you can't zone out but also easy enough that you won't be terrified of what the game asks you to learn and do. I like being able to upgrade your taco truck in a variety of ways, with different weapons, decals, armor, and tools that make the game new. Multiple playthroughs allow you to take different routes and change how you play to make it last longer.That said I wouldn't say this game is an absolute must have. The repetition of the game sets in early, so if this doesn't click for you in the first two hours I would return it. If you enjoy the relaxed nature this game works in, even when you are blasting zombies to pieces, then its definitely worth playing.The big problem really comes in the fact that buying ingredients for your taco truck can be a bit of a pain because only 1 of the 2 types of pit-stops sells ingredients, so if you get unlucky and run a route that has the wrong stop 2 or 3 times in a row, you have to leave without selling tacos to the hungry survivors. If you don't feed them they die and, in my playthroughs, don't come back until I start a new game, meaning you can really screw yourself over without planning even on the easy difficulty.This means you need to grind in the early game to get enough money to buy enough ingredients to go on longer trips, which becomes more and more needed as you get closer and closer to the end location, especially because you will get the wrong kind of stops that force you to go without buying the ingredients you need for 2 or so stops.As for the map this game dissapointed me because if you want to go East and then North, good luck, because finding the on way that heads to the East Coast was annoying and caused me to lose a few games until I found which way took me there.Lastly, as of this review, the achievements do not unlock at all, and some people have trouble playing the game. The devs haven't said anything about this, so be wary of not being able to play. I suppose I got lucky but I have yet to figure out what the problem is due to a lack of discussion about this game. I hope that in wirting this review more people will play this game and get some ideas going.I would reccommend this game mainly because of its scope: its made by a small studio and shows it by having a great little charm and some shining aspects that really hint at what a bright future is ahead of the devs. I think that if this game is used as a test of sorts, then ""Gunman Taco Truck 2"" could be an absolute blast. The ideas in this game are wonderful, and if are polished and perfected, will make a successor a truly unique and fun game. Play this if you want to have good few hours, and want to see a project HOPEFULLY evolve in time."
