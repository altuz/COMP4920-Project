I picked up this game today and already have survived an event once in my short period of time playing. It's so fun to play and the feel you get when you are in the middle of 50 enemies as kensai and come out unharmed is soooo good. It's new mechanics have definently bettered from the other games.Pros: Good mechanics, small but diverse amount of guns, delfecting is reaction and intuition based as opposed to timing based, enemies can get the better of you if you dont position well, hard mode is HARD, great thematic graphics, low price, different classes bring challenge and variety, mana burst is very strong but well balanced, brain burst is so fun to chain and unleash with mana burst, very good soundtrack that gets you into the game more.Cons: Enemies sometimes shoot weird, sometimes waiting long periods of time before shooting at you(could be just to make relfecting harder), game could prove to be too hard for casual gamers, could be more class variety, don't see a need to set mana burst to anything but circular.Hope this helped you to a decision but I really hope you get this game I promise you will not be dissapointed."

While it's certainly the easiest in the series, it's hardly a problem. The control has gotten tighter, a new brainclap-esque mechanic on top of brainclap, a few more guns, and a handful of new enemies really shake up the UBERMOSH formula. I'm extatic that Walter Machado has made yet another near-perfect twin stick shooter that really gets my heart pumping."
,Recommended,586350,32335511,Posted: 10 June,all,Emo_Girl_2006_xXx,"Similar to UBERMOSH Vol 3, this one adds a new class and makes the whole game a bit harder."
,Recommended,586350,30484944,Posted: 12 March,all,Nico Nico Need To Kill Myself,"It's always nice to see a new volume of Ubermosh released, because though each game is a tweaked version of the next, the tweaks and fine handling are what really make the game.1. Adjustable manastrike is a nice addition, feels a bit more dynamic to use than the brainclap of earlier versions.2. Shielded enemies make for a slightly increased challenge, but you pretty much just ought to run away.3. 2nd best gun spawn time earlier? Feels like you get it faster than previously.4. Good soundtrack additions, feels pretty badass when loading in for a PR run.5. The lack of terrain is a good design choice over earlier Ubermosh volumes, but would like to see an occasional obstacle (in the last 10 seconds it's possible to ignore the screen as you pray for enough kills if you have the best gun and a good spray pattern.)Most I would recommend for a new volume is a new gun or two, with slightly more varied mechanics than ""more bullets and more spray."""
76561197978562969,Recommended,586350,30312670,Posted: 4 March,all,Mulliriot,"Great game in short bursts, you're basically playing a horde-survival type match that takes 90 seconds. Each class has 2-6 hit points (any damage you take is worth 1 hit point) as well as some other gameplay extras. Die, and you start over. It's a hard game at first, but once you get the rhythm down, you'll be mowing down enemies with ease.The only real criticism I have, is that the enemy bullets, and the smaller enemies themselves, can be difficult to see near the end of the game, as each kill leaves a bright blood pool on the ground, which can cover half the screen as the player gets snowball effect going with the kills. Possibly this is intentional? As the player tends to move away from the blood in order to see.For 2€ the game is an absolute steal. Pick it up, play it every now and then for maybe 10 minutes at a time, you won't regret buying."

Ubermost:Wraith just adds another class the wraith which I cannot even distinguish from the psyker. The other classes are still the same. Only melee is the most challenging or only gunner. But basically I like the catalyst the most. This is where I got my highscore of 1250 pts. New is also some swarmrider groups spawn and you lightning mana burst. There are no more disturbing obstacles on the battlefield."

76561198153774334,Recommended,586350,30852108,Posted: 31 March,all,i1y/\,"Another quality designer drug for us, pixelated gore addicts. I found this game in my library, probably because I paid for Ubermosh: vol. 3 recenty, but I of course I wouldn't hesitate to pay for any title from Ubermosh series. The balance came as close to the limit in term of ""dealing max damage without spoiling the fun"" as poossible, although I must admit that the game feels a bit less ""hard-core"" than the earlier chapters do. More, instead of ""Ubermosh: Wraith"" it may be as well called ""Ubermosh: Revenge of Kensai"" because of balance issues that occur for characters with ""Better manastrike / 40 kills for brainclap"" traits: manastrike leads to brainclap almost instantly. The most-specific classes (Wraith, Psyker, Kensai) are the easiest ones to play (and to get max kills per 90 secods), and Warlock is maybe the most difficult one, because it has only 2 lives, while it is possible to acquire ""better equipment"" in 15 seconds of play while still retaining 4 ""cores"" in Basic class. Addition of tough guys that require several hits is nice idea too, but is it only me who thinks that you should instantly slay them with a sword? Otherwise approaching them closer is not so rewarding.  Anyway, I would recommend this game both for newcomers and the fans, and newcomers should definitely buy this along with ""Ubermosh: Black"" to perfect their skills. Well done, Walter, and keep on!"

,Recommended,586350,29610916,Posted: 31 January,all,[ Maxie ],"I initially had some problems when first trying out the game but thankfully it's all been fixed now. That's a sign of a great game developer right there, one who helps fix the problems of the games as well as making new games. Have I already mentioned that I admire and respect Walter Machado as a game developer?But now that I've had chance to play properly, I can safely say that WRAITH is even better than before. You've still got the classic UBERMOSH gameplay of 90 seconds in the arena to gun down as many enemies as possible, but now you've got the 'Manastrike', a move that sets off at random intervals to wipe out even more enemies, as well as a return of the brainclap and the open arena.All I can say is that this takes all the best parts of the series and brings it all together in one juicy package and adds new extras and new achievements. And new music! As well as the familiar soundtrack, we've got some new songs to mosh to! Just makes gunning those enemies down even more fun.The only downside is that there can be some occasional slowdown when there's a lot going on (though that may be because my computer isn't all that powerful) but this doesn't detract from the experience. This is still stupidly good fun.If this is the last installment of the UBERMOSH series, then I certainly look forward to more of Walter Machado's future projects (and if you haven't already, check out Trip to Vinelands).All in all, this had everything I could expect in an UBERMOSH game, and more. Although I would love to hear more on the lore of the UBERMOSH world!"
,Recommended,586350,31226188,Posted: 18 April,all,3RDplayer,"Arcade Twin Stick Shooter Fun! The game wins through its simplicity. Wraith being the first game I played of the series. Lose a lot, get better, own em all! It sharpens your reflexes. Pickup and play and have fun!I started using a controller but found out that the analog stick used to move the crosshair always resets back to face into the lower-right corner when the stick is not pushed into a certain direction. So I tried the almighty mouse aim and it was much better to aim and shoot.Playing with WASD is not very healthy for my hand so I combined using the analog stick for moving around while aiming with the mouse, which improved me playing the game.In very few cases, players are plagued by framerate issues or like me by hickups, where the screen freezes for a milisecond. But I guess in 9 out of 10 cases players have a smooth experience with the game.Maybe some of these issues can be addressed in an updated version? I still highly recommend the game if you want to kill some spare minutes."

I love the new features, I noticed that there's plenty of new game modes, some new weapons, and a completely different gameplay from UM and UM:B. Can't wait to discover more. Oh, and of course, for a lil noob like me, it's still hard as sh*t.And I still love it a damn lot.GJ, Walt."

This is good for fans like myself, who breezed through the challenges in the first few games. I feel little incentive to ever go back and revisit those games, but this one really pushes me hard. Even after completing all of the challenges, I still sometimes feel like I want to play them all again.I would've liked even more challenges, and more depth to the game, but for the low price, it's an overall satisfying experience for what it brings to the table.I had some slowdown and minimizing screen performance issues when the field became cluttered. This didn't happen often, but when it did, it was very annoying."

Vol 3 is probably better as a technical score attack game because the mana charge added in Wraith feels a bit random and makes the full round much easier to survive, but Wraith is way more fun to play on every level and is thus the definitive version of the game."

The games themselves are often repetitive but i still find them fun and all just a step up in their own way. These characters, given a story of this universe that has already been implied, and given some gameplay like doom or shadow warrior, would be probably one of the best fps games on the planet. Highly addictive and very challenging, however basic and very simple. To someone looking toward playing the games, i would recomend you buy whichever is newest unless you simply want to own the other games, i like to support the company and i love the art in the title screens, i get the newest games for 30 cents or so usually because i have the steam package deal and just expand on it when its on sale, worth it to me"
