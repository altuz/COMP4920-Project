,Recommended,586880,32128913,Posted: 2 June,all,judgegr,"The game is absolutely awesome, this is how platform/metroid games should be made.Although Mini Ghost might seem like a usual -and tedious?- platform game at first, It's very well designed and quite challenging. Rooms need to be cleared quickly and accurately, bosses are almost impossible to beat but they can be handled by taking advantage of the retro style save/load system -after clearing each room- along with the teleport to base and health room. (-1 point for unbalanced difficulty of the boss)Generally, It feels like playing a older/primary version ofUnepicandGhost(from the same developer) without the rpg elements of those two. Achievements are tougher than usual, only awarded to those who can master the game. Also, it features a level editor and some custom maps are already available on Steam Workshop.All in all, it's a very well-made game, and honest too, considering the price.Verdict: Get it now! [9/10]"

What you see on the Steam page is basically what you get, a retro-style metroidvania with many of the fun and frustrating elements of that genre. Lots of tight spaces to jump through, lots of rooms that you have to figure out how to navigate, and lots of backtracking to upgrade your health and get a few upgrades (probably too much for such a short game).The art aesthetics are solid, and so are the controls. There is nothing ground-breaking or truly memorable about this game though. You will not fall in love with the character, the game is not designed to reach any sort of ""flow state,"" and you will not finish the game up with any good ""war stories"" to tell your friends.But if you are a fan of the genre and are looking for a mildly entertaining way to spend an afternoon this title might be just the right fit."

,Recommended,586880,31464255,Posted: 30 April,all,Red Fox,"This is a really good game for a really good price. lots of love and charm put into this game. Now I know retro indie games are a dime a dozen, but this is one that should stand out from a lot of the others.Its  basically a metroidvania type of game where you go around and picking up things to upgrade yourself. The kind you would find on the MSX system, and it does a very good job of being authentic. As a added bonus it also has a simple editing system for making a character, tile sets, and even a level editor to make your own adventure.  Another added feature which I haven't been able to mess with yet, is the mode where you can watch a friend play and either help them or screw around with them.All in all its a very sweet game for its price and its already got a lot of people making cool things in the workshop, so if your not too good at making things yourself theres plenty of customization for you to mess with, and more game to play when your done with the main campaign."

If you are a fan ofUnEpicorGhost 1.0you already know the scoop (both awesome titles, by the way).Mini Ghostis a prequal toGhost 1.0. I love the artwork demake and all the editors that have been made available to let the community take this one and run with it. The music is outstanding.While the character, tileset, and level editor gives this tons of potential replayability, the base game isreallywell done.You'll have fun if you enjoy this genre. The in-game comic art is top-notch, and everything is true to Fran's universe.Pros:+This price is insane. Yes, the base game is only about 2 hours, but really you've bought a tool box of editors that the community can go nuts with.+The music isoutstanding.+Controller support works well.+It's fun.Cons:-It doesn't just 'look' retro, it plays that way too. That's ok, but there are a few little frustrating platforming parts that are consequences of that.-You will probably deal with black bars on the sides depending on how you set the stretchIf you like the other games this dev has made, this will be no exception.If you haven't playedGhost 1.0, pick that up as well."

Sometimes that's what you want - and if it is there aren't many other options I can think of other than Mini-Ghost. So well done!+ charming low-fi graphics and sounds+ power scaling curve is just right+ save at any time! great feature!- requiring the secret at the end is a little mean

It's even on sale so it's even cheaper!A great platformer reminiscent of the old 8-bit games with authentic visuals, music and sounds with solid controls and design.But for me, what truly makes this game is special is the robust level, tileset and character editors. The game as it is is definitely worth the money, but with these editors included it makes it a must buy. They're so easy to use, you can make a 8-bit platformer of your dreams. I can't wait to see what other people can do with these tools. Shame you can't create your own music or sound effects, but honestly the editing tools and nature of this  game makes it much more open and freeing then say for example, Super Mario Maker. It may not be as accessible as SMM, but it's much more liberating.I haven't even touched upon the online options to troll your friends who also own the game, the speedrun challenges and other goodies. You like Metroidvania style games with 8-Bit aesthetics then definitely give this game a go.It's less then £2, it's great ^_^"
,Recommended,586880,31675979,Posted: 10 May,all,krayzkrok,"I grew up playing games like this, and clearly so did the developer because they managed to replicate the style and feel perfectly. It's a pretty straightforward game design, a metroidvania platformer where you explore the map, shoot enemies, collect cubes to buy items from shops, find other items hidden in crates, and take on a number of bosses. Items and upgrades enable you to access areas that you couldn't reach or navigate earlier on. You've probably played this kind of thing before.It works, though, because it's a tight game design, and because the basic mechanics of jumping and shooting feel great. Each upgrade makes a noticeable difference, and so progress feels satisfying and rapid. It's not a long game (took me around five hours, but I'm a completitionist and you can certainly do it in less) but then it only costs a couple of bucks. For that, not only do you get this great little game, you also get a surprisingly robust level and character editor, the results of which you can share on the Steam Workshop. For two bucks it's a steal, and if you want more then try this game's big brother (well actually, sister), Ghost 1.0."
,Recommended,586880,33011357,Posted: 29 June,all,limelight1210,"Fun little metroidvania, took me about 3 hrs to finish. The graphics are also very colorful too.A couple of the items were more difficult to find than I would have preferred because I walked circles around the map, but otherwise still a fun game and worth playing-even at full price."
,Recommended,586880,31871343,Posted: 20 May,all,Rhawne,"Fairly decent and challenging, and definitely worth the dollar I paid for it. Has full controller support and worked great with my Xbox controller. Make sure you find the secrets before you confront the last boss, but after you find the 4th access card or you'll have to do a hell of a lot of backtracking."

I finished my first run in about 2 and a half hours and I'm probly kind of on the slow side. It feels nostalgic with its charming visuals, but the game play itself is really smooth, controls are great, animation is fluid, etc. You can also make your own characters/levels which could be fun. Haven't even messed with that stuff yet. lol.At 2 bucks, it's a steal!"
,Recommended,586880,31496316,Posted: 1 May,all,goblin girl,"A nice, retro Metroidvania with graphics reminiscent of the old Apple ][ era.You're a troubleshooter sent into a dangerous maze to destroy a haywire computer. At the start of your adventure you kind of suck; you blast enemies, collect ""cubes,"" and use them to buy combat upgrades. Scattered throughout the maze are crates that contain either nothing (usually), more cubes, or unique items that give you advantages or make you able to reach new areas. Your goal is to defeat bosses, opening up new areas, and eventually reach and destroy the computer.Ghost controls really well, the graphics are bright and colorful, and the design of the maze is pretty clever. This isn't one of the all-time great Metroidvanias, but it's definitely a good one.What makes the game so interesting is the presence of several software editors. You can create new skins for Ghost or even entire new maps, then upload them to the Steam Workshop for others to play with. The inclusion of this kind of feature in a game this cheap is amazing, and upgrades this to a ""must buy.""If you don't use the editor features, Mini Ghost probably offers 3-5 hours of platforming action, which is damn good for the price. If you do, there's theoretically no limit (but I'm betting you'd probably start hankering for some more features around hour 20)."

A very nice throwback metroidvania with cute graphics, controls and mechanics that are just right and balanced, fun old-school gameplay and all in all is tightly designed. And the option to download and make yourself new tilesets and sprites adds lots of charm to the product.The only small problems are the silly design decision to put a power-up needed to finish the game in a secret side area, and the fact that the BGM volume remains extremely low for some reason. However Franfistro once again made an interesting old-school labor of love after UnEpic... and now, off to buy Ghost 1.0!"

,Recommended,586880,32160800,Posted: 3 June,all,rezoons,"""Mini Ghost"" is a very nice metroidvania platformer with a retro aesthtic. The game has a nice OST, a nice level design ( except for a couple of rooms) and is really fun to play. The level and characters creator is also a nice addition.Despite all the fun i had i still have two issues with the game. First, the bosses are either a tedious pain to beat with your main weapon or a walk in the park with the laser secondary weapon (but require grinding which is not fun). Secondly, the huge knockback your character get can also be a huge pain in some rooms, especially since ennemy's bullets go through wall and can sometimes be really hard to dodge because of that.Overall, count about 2-3 hours to finish the game and way more to get all the achievements. For 2€, i can recommand you to get it without any hesitation, even if it's definitely not perfect."

I wasn't a fan of the fact that bosses only showed up when I moved further into the room (I had to look up where to go when I didn't go far enough into the dead end room that boss 1 shows up in), and the patterns often created situations where it felt you were forced to take damage.

It is nostalgic and at the same time incorporates a lot of modern themes with the ability to troll friends.  I think the concept is rather interesting and I could see this potentially being a good spring board idea for future content creators to collaborate as well as for friends to mess around with friends.
