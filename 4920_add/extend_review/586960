76561198078807302,Not Recommended,586960,31674555,Posted: 10 May,all,nanognome,"It's a terrible amateurish game without any redeemable qualities, I'm surprised by ""very positive"" rating. It uses the same mechanics as VVVVVV (you can't jump, but can flip gravity), but if VVVVVV does everything right, this game does everything wrong, doing every rookie mistake possible. Hazards don't look like hazards blending with environment, you need to die to learn the rules. Save points are rare, so you need to repeat long boring easy parts if you failed later in the level. It contains ugly bugs - the game is not completable on 4:3 resolution. Add to this poor graphics, lack of content, any story, and uninspiring lazy level design and you'll get this My First Unity Project : The Game.Avoid even at $1. Yes, it's very cheap, but there are a lot of free Flash platformers or even open-source games much better than this."

,Recommended,586960,30319721,Posted: 4 March,all,♫ Mr. Rawphoric,"Amazing! I am not a big fan of platformer games and I thought I won't be able to get all achievements but boy was I wrong. 100% in just 65 mins. The game is really interesting. I also got it for just 10 cents (90% off coupon). Easily worth the full price or even more, though. Pretty cool art, 40 different levels. Some can be a bit hard at first but overall the game was easy. Had a problem with one of the levels. Couldn't see some of the plants but I changed my resolution from 1280x1024 to 1280x720 and I could countinue playing this lovely little game. Can't say much about the soundtrack as I've listened to hardstyle while playing this. :DEasily 10/10 because of the cheap price, decent amount of achievements and not that short gameplay, although if it was longer that wouldn't be bad. c: Surprisingly fun and kind of cute game.Want part 2 ASAP. AAAAAA! :D Thank you, dev. c:"

,Recommended,586960,30623362,Posted: 19 March,all,Kovic,"I Absolutely Recommend this game.Its somewhat challenging, but overall its an inexpensive and simple to 100% achieve puzzle platformer.The controls are quick and I didnt have any major rage moments, although some stages tried to give me one.  With the controls in mind, you can use the keyboard and it works fine, but I prefer controller because I like having a button to push for jumping/gravity control instead of the ""up arrow"".The music and colorful art style is very relaxing and I enjoyed the 45min or so I spent going through the 40 stages.  While there isn't a replay factor to this game, I could see myself going back to it because thats how relaxing the experience was.The achievements are mostly level based and the ones that require you to activate plants are easy enough to go back and get if you need to.  Most, if not all the achievements will be unlocked as you play through the game one time."
,Recommended,586960,31216196,Posted: 18 April,all,FliK,I tilted so much playing this game. Was worth it anyways. Not really long game (a bot more than an hour for me).10/10 would tilt again.
76561198018476373,Recommended,586960,30749930,Posted: 26 March,all,riv3rbird,"This game reminded me of VVVVVV so much I had to see if it was the same devs. It isn't. The only gameplay difference is that with Upside Down (UD) you cannot switch midflight, so while making the gameplay simple, it is still fun. Along with the calm music and cutesie graphics, UD is quite a relaxing puzzle-platformer. If you want a more adrenaline skill based game with the same mechanic, go over and check out VVVVVV, which came out 7 years earlier.I played UD with both a keyboard and controller, as some levels play out better with each, with one level even having sections that had me switching input device mid level. As a disclaimer I did have a 90% off coupon but even full price at $1 it makes a fun way to spend an hour, even if it is partly the amusement at racking up more than an achievement a minute."
,Not Recommended,586960,34561461,Posted: 28 August,all,aoterroroa,"""Upside Down will immerse you in an incredible adventure"" is one of the most dishonest things I've read lately. There's no story or 'adventure', just 40 incredibly simple 'puzzles' (some of which you'll complete within 10 seconds, on the very first try) that get boring quickly.If the gameplay concept (inverting gravity) sounds appealing to you, go buy VVVVV. It's much more exciting, challenging, charming, funny, and has much snappier controls and better music. If you've played VVVVV and enjoyed it, save your money; you'll hate this."

,Recommended,586960,31314055,Posted: 23 April,all,crippler,"Wow, right after beating the game i feel i need to write a review about it because i liked it really much!The principle of not being able to attack enemies AND not being to jump at all made the game very interesting. And it became very addictive, right from the beginning. What i really liked as well was the difficulty - for me it was just awesome because never too easy - and only 1-2 levels of those 40 were a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for me. The controls felt good (not smoothy) with the x360. and the calm, nice music fit, though i wish there were a few more/different songs..(No missable or grindy) Achievements + Cards + -90% Coupon = must have for me!Relax for 60-90 mins and have fun with it.9/10"

The gameplay isn't only simplistic, but also unoriginal. The gravity flip element can be seen in games like VVVVV. The graphics and music are pretty, but not a selling point. Overall, this game isn't worth your time."

You get a simplistic platformer with simple yet challenging levels. After a third time of play most of the levels you will finish them so the game isnt quite difficult. I only spent an hour and half on the game and finished all the achievements so their quite easy to get for you achievement hunters. All in all Good Game"

76561198365236399,Recommended,586960,32186801,Posted: 4 June,all,Awai,"A great simple platform-puzzle game and that's all there is about this game. You navigate the main character towards the blue onion-looking alike house per level. There is a good amount of levels (40) that you can choose to play a few at a time or play it all at once like I did. None of the levels were drastically difficult, but a few will get you excited for sure. I was definitely okay with the pace of the game and didn't feel bored from level 1 to level 40. The game has two types of levels: paced and not paced. In the paced levels, you will need a bit more skill and memory to recall when to flip and when not to flip the character as you progress in the level. In the non-paced levels, you can take all the time you want to map out how you want to progress with the level. Throughout the levels, it was fun and the music kept me entertained. Overall, this is a good game and I don't mind paying $2 for it. Not much replay value unforunately, but worth it. Minor things: 1) once or twice when I clip the corner, the main character gets stuck and can't move left or right; the only way to un-stuck was to flip up and down and 2) sound-effects did get slightly irritable, but you can change that.Perhaps a time-attack/race 2 players (with up to 4 players - couch) edition can be in the works? Having certain levels and then racing a friend(s) would be nice.For the value and this type of game, I would say 8.5/10"
