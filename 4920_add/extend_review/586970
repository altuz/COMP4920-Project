Graphics are great, Soundtrack is awesome and gameplay is challenging, yet fun, trying to beat each level.But the downsides are:- Difficulty is very random. Some of the levels are too easy, but some of them are just insane.- There is too much luck involved to get past the needle enemies. Sometimes the path is clear, but sometimes there is no way to survive it.- Some effects are too big and too bright. They will make you nearly invisible and it's hard to see, were you are going. (Well, you could argue, that it adds to the challenge)Big plus are the controls. You can play it with mouse, keyboard or controller and it feels very accurate. (Played it with a 360 Controller (but for some reason i couldn't select ""next level"" after beating one and had to switch to the mouse to select it. No idea why. Everything else is working fine.))Overall, it's a good game, but can have some frustrating moments."

,Not Recommended,586970,34335710,Posted: 18 August,all,JΔVI,"This game is very frustrating for all the wrong reasons. The devs have a very abstract idea of what ""hitbox"" means, and you'll find yourself dying over and over agaIn from wonky visuals, controls and physics.This would be a positive review if the game was free, but honestly you're better off spending the money (as cheap as it is) in Steam Cards."
,Not Recommended,586970,33048911,Posted: 30 June,all,Bernhard,"Review in english:I can't recommend this game. When I first started playing I thought: ""Hey, this could be good, evading lasers, balls that bounce, slowing time, shooting the enemies that are in front of you, and the controls are very simple.""; until the gimmicky things started appearing: black holes that slow you down to a minimum (seriously, sometimes you stop completely), spheres that shoot needles in random directions (and that will prevent you from completing some levels because you aren't lucky enough to have a good path to avoid the needles), and spirals that appear without any kind of warning, and you won't know where they appear until you have died like ten times because of them. Also, the hitbox of the sphere that you control is bad, sometimes things will kill you even if you are far, and sometimes you won't die even if you are close.The graphics are correct, normal for this kind of game, and the music is as good as the other games of this developer, but even if you have fun in the first levels, from the 25th level onward you will get frustrated. A game that could have been better if it weren't for the gimmicky annoying obstacles that appear.---Reseña en español:No puedo recomendar este juego. Cuando empecé a jugar pensé:""Hey, esto tiene buena pinta, esquivando lásers, bolas que rebotan, ralentizando el tiempo, disparar a los enemigos delante de ti y los controles son muy simples.""; hasta que empezaron a aparecer las cosas más baratas que te puedas imaginar: agujeros negros que te ralentizan hasta decir basta (en ocasiones te detienen completamente), esferas que lanzan agujas en direcciones aleatorias (y que evitarán que completes algunos niveles porque no has tenido la suerte de tener un camino para evitar las agujas), y espirales que surgen sin previo aviso, y no sabrás dónde aparecerán hasta que te las hayas comido unas diez veces. Además, la hitbox de la esfera que controlas está mal hecha, a veces morirás aunque estés lejos, y otras veces no morirás ni aun estando cerca de los obstáculos.Los gráficos son correctos para este tipo de juego, la música es tan buena como el resto de juegos de este desarrollador, pero incluso si te diviertes durante los primeros niveles, a partir del nivel 25 empezarás a frustrarte. Un juego que podría haber sido mejor si no fuera por los trucos baratos que van apareciendo."

Even though im going to keep playing it because it has become a question of pride.http://www.steamcardexchange.net/index.php?gamepage-appid-586970Thats a link to see all the trading cards, emoticons, and badges.FYI: This list is while graphics was on ""fantastic""."

,Not Recommended,586970,31049715,Posted: 9 April,all,Zombifiedfreak,"It's interseting, I think it's too short to cost anything, the controls are buggy, the screen will push you ssometimes, I wish you could change the fire button to left click but you can't, other than that it's pretty fun, nice graphics, intersting style of play, kinda fun to try and beat, the last level is filled with spam though and is very very unforgiving if you don't dodge every little thing. I'd get my friends to play it just to♥♥♥♥♥♥them off with how hard it is with its buggy controls, I wouldn't tell someone to buy it though, it's a waste of money even for how small it is, the game is 50 levels and each level can be beaten in 2-5 minutes, level 50 is the only level that took me like 20 only because it was so filled with spam, the controls could easily be fixed and made better, especially by making left click the secondary to firing instead of left ctrl, other that the only main issue is getting pushed by the screen, especially in parts where you have to be very very very precise and if you even twitch you die and suddenly the game just pushes you just slightly to the right.  The reason it does this is from the mechanic that makes the screen move to the right when you're not moving that fast, there should be an option to center the screen on the player, that'd help with that bug."
