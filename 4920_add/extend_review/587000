,Recommended,587000,32168261,Posted: 3 June,all,Blitzkrieg-ing_Fubuki,"For the past 3 years I have been playing the mobile version waiting for this PC port.The game has its flaws , but generally I am not disappointed.-Pros:+Nice arcade graphic+Nice set of soundtracks+Not too hard to master+Decent replayability+You get to nuke the world...enough said-Pros compared to the mobile version:+It does look much better+12 unique superweapons , a significant upgrade from the mobile's 6+I felt more control of the game+Savegame+Diplomacy-Cons:+Few bugs here and there+Normal mode is too easy, Hardcore mode is too hard (for some countries)+No multiplayer+Gameplay occasionally gets annoying and/or frustating+Some superweapons are underpowered+$12 at this state is abit overpriced-Requests:+MULTIPLAYERRR .I know it's hard, but please do , it'll increase the replayability hundred-times fold.We enjoy more gameplay, you enjoy more sales.+Fix bugs (I've found so far):*The opposite superpower(s) would not leave pact even after first-striking their allies and then gets retaliated back.*Intercept cruise missiles would freeze on the air after unsuccessfully intercepting a Dirty-Radium warhead*Sometimes the game would not let the player defend their nation until its too late*Buggy game start-up*Global-Trident Strike target selector is abit buggy and awkward*Zoom strength would reset to default everytime I start a new game*The notification bar (example: The US has reduced its arsenal) would sometimes bug out and turn empty before disappearing*The game sometimes does not give me credits for completing objectives (for example - I occupied all of Oceania which will turn unlock Australia , but the game refuses to unlock Australia or even just give credits of conquering all of the continent)+Buff following superweapons:*Cobalt Rocket: With the introduction of Dirty-Radium warhead,the Cobalt rocket is now completely obsolete.Please buff it in some ways , shorter production time doesn't cover the fact that Cobalt warhead only contaminates an area for 180 seconds ,while Radium warhead lasts forever.*Semey Launcher: ridiculously long production time ,but only acts as a longer-range variant of Trident-IRBM. If I wanted to reduce that nation into ashes that bad I would just build a bunch of ICBMs.Much faster. Please buff , either by reducing the production time,or make it reuseable but with some handicaps.*Solar Laser: Worthless in the state its in now.Very random - hardly useful.Please give it a massive tweak.+Add SSBN - Nuclear Ballistic Submarines. I have a naval fetish and I know naval forces play a large part in a nuclear war too. I'd pay for a fully functional war-capable submarine to be added in-game.+A difficulty between Normal and Hardcore+For future sales: As I mentioned , I may be a long-time fan of this game ,but as of now it doesn't worth 11.99. I think 9.99 is a more reasonable price. Or keep the price but add multiplayer.+Divide Antarctica into sections then add them in-game as occupiable territories (haha)+Let Allied victory be a thing in this game. No matter what you do , your pact members will always betray you towards the end of the game.+Workshop with custom gamemodes/superpowers/superweapons/etc...Overall ,for now,I give this game a 8.75/10 - Has high potential"
,Not Recommended,587000,32672813,Posted: 23 June,all,Turing Machine,"The game feels very arbitrary. It's basically a Galcon-style game but where you have to micromanage the hell out of your regions. The strategy is strictly optional since the one who clicks the most will always win. The UI and controls doesn't help in that — it's easy to confuse missiles visually, positioning of action options on a wheel is not consistent, region borders are getting basically invisible once there is some action on a screen, which makes it even harder to micromanage.Also there is very little depth to the gameplay.You can enjoy this game if you like Galcon-style action but don't expect much."

However for $12 on PC it really would need to bring something new to the table, instead of just being a direct port. Its a $4 mobile game, and you can play it on PC. If thats worth $12 to you, go for it. You'll get ~2 hours of actual gameplay after which you'll have a lovely but useless addition to your steam library."

Anyone who wants to be trigger happy with some  nukes should definitely get this game. Other than that, I have only experienced one annoying bug in the game: every once in awhile, I have to quit the game I had already started because clicking on my territories no longer brings up the rotary menu to choose the actions of that territory. If that bug gets fixed, then this game gets a 10/10, till then I shall give it a 9/10."

You can research your way around this, and target hostile missles manually, but since you can't pause this is frustrating...6) Not really a complaint(but sort of) but....you can intercept the enemy of your enemy's missle? Like when you click the ""intercept"" (or whatever it's called) button, it will fly into the nearest missle(at least from my observation). This comes into play when there are a ton of missles in the air and you are just trying to intercept everything, so you are just clicking to try to intercept everything, but your cruisers hit some other random missle, and you are like ""WTH?""...again compounded by the lack of pause....7) The AI wont break alliances...(prevented me from winning one time)....hell it won't even talk to you....even though YOU'VE CONQUERED THE GLOBE......smhLook I'm running on a♥♥♥♥♥♥machine (that does meet requirements)...A really good idea buuuuuuuuuttt.....I dunno maybe I am *GROSSLY* missing some obvious things, but I took a chance on this game, one of the *very* few chances I take on Steam, and this is my own reminder not to....If I'm wrong please let me know! I want to like this game!"
,Not Recommended,587000,32737963,Posted: 24 June,all,twig1919,"I bought this expecting something defcon like. This game is sort of defcon-ish. However, the tedium of no multi-select for regions means that having to select missles one by one makes this game simply unplayable. Even worse, the first strike mechanic simply wastes all your missles on a couple regions. Then you have to go back and manually rebuild the missles on every base. There really is no strategic depth to this game, but it would at least be a fun 10 minute time-waster if the user interface was improved to a reasonable standard."

Research whenever you can so you get your super weapons first. The infiltrators and the Tsar are good superweapons to use.  Most of my games last from 10 to 30 minutes so this game isnt very time consuming. It isnt a simulator and is good if you want to play a quick strategy game."

,Recommended,587000,33407885,Posted: 9 July,all,tipoima,"tl;dr:Buy on saleGame honestly feels like something in early access. It's playable, enjoyable, but mechanics seem very unpolished. First strike should have an option to adjust the radius of it's area, superweapons should have much more detailed desctiptions (for exapmle, EMP one should mention, that affected rockets still blow up, it really matters if you try to defend yourself with it.), micromanagement is fine, but not when you literally can't see your region because some nuke made it impossible to see the borders. AI isn't the best either. It's always behind on research, it can't shoot more that 3-4 missles at you without using first strike, it will almost always use first stirke after you do (which can be hilarious, if there is an EMP missle timed to fall right after)While it has it's flaws, it's still quite good. It can run on basically everything, soundtrack is decent, and it's fun to nuke millions of people into oblivion. Just don't play more than 1-2 game per day or you'll burn out pretty quickly"

,Not Recommended,587000,32100833,Posted: 31 May,all,Tyrian,"A fun game, but it has a few glitchy bits with the UI. Hit ESC accidentally, now you can't click on anything: restart the game. Click the wrong hotkey twice in a row, the highlighting effect is permanent now and you can't see anything: restart the game. Try to restart, but the 'continue' button doesn't work: restart the game, and then start a new game. Sigh.Gameplay otherwise fun and (mostly) fast paced. Crazy easy so far, I'm hoping that 1) these issues get patched, and 2) there's more challenge later in the gameplay."
,Recommended,587000,32170638,Posted: 4 June,all,HalseySpartan2,"This is a prettier version of Defcon that ends up being super engaging and really fun.  It's got a lot of deep strategy beneath the simplistic surface mechanics, and I feel like I've already gotten my money's worth and then some after just two hours.  I've completed two games so far and I'm excited to unlock the rest of the playable powers.  This is a great buy if you're looking for something fun, pretty, and quick - you can finish an average game in about 20 minutes once you know how to play."
,Recommended,587000,33953028,Posted: 1 August,all,Palaius | 夕立,"It's a very nice game. at first it seems a bit complicated, but It's very fast learned. One does quickly learn how to effectivly use Cruise Missiles and ICBMs (I always placed Cruise Missiles on the outskirts of my territory and build nothing but ICBMs inland)sometimes the controlls can be a bit weird, but i learned to life with it, because normally nothing bad happens.Some things I would love to see is a easier way how to tell what kind of missiles you have in your silos and not click on one state because you think it has Cruise missiles only to find out that it was an ICBM.also I admit that a multiplayer would be quite fun."
,Recommended,587000,32211436,Posted: 5 June,all,President Justin,"If you have played it on mobile, trust me, this game is one of the PC ports that are actually better than the one in the mobile. You get additional features like diplomacy (although it's a bit buggy and like temporary for a moment, but I hope it'll be fixed), more bloody superweapons that can be used against your enemies, and that you can use 2 superweapons at once to obliterate your ♥♥♥♥ing enemies once and for all!And if you're a DEFCON player, like I used to before, this is it's simpler 3D cousin that has superweapons, diplomacy, territorial expansion, and although there maybe no navies and that kind of size and mass warfare, it's kinda still worth it for purchase!Personally, I would rate it 9/10, there's still some bugs to be fixed, but eh, they can be fixed later on."

,Recommended,587000,32153381,Posted: 3 June,all,saviorchrist,"To be frank though the game is relatively simple, the idea is rather new and attractive to me, since very few games mentioned the strategy of nuclear warfare. And I think the game simulates it not perfectly but just well.But after you got to know the basic rule of the game, it became boring and too easy too soon (to be ally with US and occupy more lands, kill all other countries and kill US then you win). Maybe could make expanding harder or distinguish core territory with other occupied states. Or make each state different from each other, some deserts in Africa are equal to other urban area in this game, absurd."

(Though not a particularly challenging game.)-Nice graphics and sound, that fit with the message and the gameplay.-Important message (Don't explode the world).Cons:-The developers took some... creative license when designing the game. India and Pakistan are allied, and many nations that have disarmed are depicted as nuclear. Not to mention the ridiculous superweapons. It is a little over the top. Don't come into the game expecting realism.-Some territories can be difficult to target without hitting others. (Especicially just after an impact.) A minor problem.-Numerous minor bugs and glitches that will most likely be ironed out.Overall, a fun little game with a decent amount of replay value, even with a few issues."

Build up an arsenal and nuke the sheit out of some provocators. Spoil your neighbors plans to nuke you or some other sob... The limits seem endless.To me there are quite a few similarities to playing Risk - but with a little less strategic depth (which is fine with me)As for buying the Deluxe Edition: although the bonus content is a nice gimmick, it's practical use is limited - basically a smile and a thank you for supporting the devs in buying the slightly more expensive verison.  ...you're welcome :)"

First strike AOE is smaller than I would like, especially when you are sending a dozen or more warheads, the map can be a little hard to read at times because some of the colors don't stand out well on the map, and the diplomacy could be given a little more depth though some people may like that it's limited. It lacks polish making it a rough cut ""gem"".  My verdict is that if you like strategy games this one is most definitely worth consideration."

You start as a nation with varying difficulties and basically try to blow up the rest of the world without getting blown up yourself.The main concept is that you expand your nation, expand your arsenal and eventually out-nuke the enemies. There are no resources and instead time is your only resource, every territory you own can perform 1 of 6 actions:Build a defensive cruise missileBuild a long-range ICBMBuild a mid-range high-damage IRBMResearch upgradesExpand to an adjascent territoryor, fire an already build missileThe trick is that while performing any of these tasks, your territory cannot do anything else, so you have to balance your expansion, research, construction, offense and defence.The UI is actually very slick, clean and intuative. However i would HIGHLY suggest learning the 3 or 4 hotkeys.At the end of the day this game is a very quick and basic experience but quite relaxing (despite the fact you're ending the world). I would not say it's worth full price at $11.99 so catch it on sale if possible.Pro's:- Satisfying visuals and gameplay- Good UI- Easy to learn and playCon's:- Short- Expensive for the amount of content ($5-7.50 would have been a much better decision)Subjective:- Quick and casual- Bomb North KoreaOverall Rating: 6.5/10"
