Smooth crisp and responsive gameplay.Good gameplay - Check (Different characters, customization, skills and more).Good music - Check (Which is not a suprise from the talent people at Falcom Sound Team jdk).Good controllers - Check (Want to mention that is the ability to change the menu's buttonicons to match your controller, with the options being Xbox, DualShock, keyboard, and PC classic which is think is fantastic especially for me who have PS4 Controller hooked up).Good Story - Check (so far!)Need fix: I stumbled upon a bug where I played in fullscreen 1680x1050 resoultion the letters for the text was moved up and outside the actual letterbox which was kind annoying and made it hard to navigate the menu in the game but fortunately there is borderless fullscreen which cover that and is not affected by this.I will continue to support this amazing series and I'm really looking forward for Ys 8. Thank you XSEED!Overall I give this game 9/10 (so far) and if you are a fan of this series you should really get this."
,Recommended,587100,34633284,Posted: 31 August,all,alukarte,"Good port of a great gameBuying a console port on day one isn't necessarily a smart decision. In this case however I haven't encountered any crash, bug or otherwise unintended behavior after playing for 8 hours. For anyone who cares: Yes, it does run with stable 60 fps at least on my non-high-end computer.#Great combat and controlsThe controls are smooth and the combat system offers this overall satisfying feeling almost exclusive to the Ys-series. However, a gamepad is highly recommended.#Well aged]As far as I can tell, it is a direct port of the PSP version, no added content, no change to animations or cutscenes (fortunately no horrible 3D models like in some other ports from a well-known Japanese publisher...). The game does look a lot better than on the PSP thanks to higher resolution textures, but it is still a game from 2009. That said, the graphics are well aged and look beautiful in full HD.#Story as you'd expect it]The story isn't bad at all, although not too complex either. Some dialogue -> go somewhere -> fight something -> some more dialogue or event, that kind of pattern. Don't expect something like Planescape: Torment, but for an action-RPG it's pretty solid.#Fair difficulty, optional grinding]Four difficulty settings unlocked right from the start should be enough to entertain everyone from casual gamer to Ys- veteran. The learning curve isn't too steep, bosses can be a bit difficult if your level isn't high enough, but they aren't unfair. I'd say most if not all of them are possible without even getting damage, if you learn their patterns and can react to them. It helps that the game lets you retry lost fights and even gives you back the items you used in your last run.If you like grinding, you should probably choose a higher difficulty setting. Besides character levels it's also possible to raise the level of different skills for each character.#Conclusion]Buying this game should be a no-brainer for fans of the Ys series. If you like action-RPGs with great and responsive controls, you should definitely give this game a try."

And yes, it must be in caps.This release is twice as expensive, because it has twice the frames, making it twice as good.It also has some AA, which clearly justifies an extra fiver, so shut up and buy it, unless you don't like old school action adventures that kick you in the nuts with mean bosses.Be the man who doesn't care about petty romance.Be the expert ship-wrecking hero that defeats all that is ancient and powerful, with just a sword.Be the best friend of which is arguably the ugliest incarnation of Dogi in the entire series (you judgmental monster).Was this review helpful?Of course not.

But don't worry, the battles still feels great like before, and the music is badass as always.It's a really great game to pick up, it just sucks a bit because it got released less than two weeks before its sequel, Ys VIII.Any great fan of the series should pick it up, it's definitely worth your time. Also, there's a lot of interactions between Dogi and Adol, which is a really great thing."

,Recommended,587100,34647083,Posted: 31 August,all,GDwarf,"It's a Ys game, first of the ""modern""-style ones: Party-based combat, crafting, and true 3D graphics.The good:-The upscaling from the PSP original is surprisingly good. Some of the textures aren't great, and the polygon counts are noticably low, but it looks more like a PS2 game than a PSP one.-The combat is the same fun Ys standard: fast-paced, big on combos, with difficult bosses.-Less reliance on levelling up than other Ys titles. Traditionally a Ys game requires you to level grind, since every level of difference between you and enemies makes a huge different in your combat ability, this is much less emphasized here.-Nice nods to the series history.-Stellar music. It's a Falcom game, of course the music is amazing!The Bad:-The plot stays pretty thin, as is standard for Ys games. More depth than most Ys titles, but still not going to win awards.-...that's about it, really.Overall: An excellent Zelda-esque ARPG that shines through its somewhat-dated graphics due to its excellent combat mechanics and music."
,Recommended,587100,34875254,Posted: 10 September,all,Kain Klarden,"As with the previous entries in the series, Ys SEVEN is an action RPG, however, as Nihon Falcom like to change how series play from time to time, SEVEN was the first in the series to introduce the framework that is currently still used in the series - party based combat with instant switching between 3 characters, damage types, substitution of jumping with dodging, ability to carry around multiple different kinds of healing, increased amount of tiers of weapons and armor and changeable special attacks tied to them. Which leaves SEVEN feeling quite similar to the previous titles, yet quite different it pace and approach.For example, one element that was often criticized in previous titles (yet perfected in Origin as a mechanic) was grinding. And while there are new things that might require grind-like running back and forth (crafting-like collection of materials), grinding for levels never really feels like a necessity and doesn't give quite as much of a notable difference as it used to. 10 levels of difference would still be murderously easy to notice, but a couple of levels don't usually change the damage 2x times or more. So you can just run through the location killing enemies and not backtrack just to level up. Dodge instead of a jump also means that levels tend to be quite a lot more horizontal and encounters with enemies tend to have a lot of rolling and quick switching of characters to maneuver out of the harm's way and into a good position to deal damage. Also please note (and possibly rebind the default button) the flash guard move as it will become extremely important in some fights later on.I also must commend the story here in terms that it manages not just be ""fine for the adventure you're having"", but possibly best since the Origin and 1-2. Don't get me wrong, it's still full of basic tropes and predictable archetypes, but at least this time around the characters feel more or less memorable, something that Napishtim and Felghana struggled with. And the pace of the story is also pretty good and game isn't shy of making quite unexpected story turns from time to time, but never really missing a beat or getting too much in the way of the adventure (which is what Adol is all about, after all). And, of course, the music is the usual Falcom high quality. It never really reaches the heights of the originals, of course, as most things in the series, but it's really good and helps with the enjoyment a lot.What doesn't help is that the new system feels a bit... slower in general. Where Napishtim, Felghana and Origin felt incredibly fast and streamlined in all the right places (while smartly challenging), just what the series aimed at being with the first entries, SEVEN feels a bit too involved. There are too many skills, all with their own levels and initial tie to a specific weapon. There are enemies that will take less or no damage from a particular weapon/character. There are those craft-involving materials that you have to gather and essentially grind... Except, unlike the grind as done in Origin, this isn't fun at all. In Origin you could fly into a room, hack and slash through it, trying to keep up the combo multiplier to have an experience multiplier on, then into another room, then back again, all while keeping the pace and trying not to get hit. It was quick, simple, fun, but, sadly, necessary. In SEVEN the crafting/synthesis seems unnecessary, but if you want to have good times by the end of the game, you need to indulge into it. And it's slow, tedious and not fun.Which is a shame, because overall the switch to dodging and flash guard system fits the game so well, lessened grinding and improved story truly feel like an evolution of the series. But there are all those tiny steps back or sideways that, I feel, weren't really needed. I sure as hell enjoyed the game, the boss battles are still the show stealer (although, here as well, with 3 characters on screen and lots of effects they might get too overwhelming), but I do know that I could've enjoyed it more. And that I still enjoyed Origin and even Felghana more."
,Recommended,587100,34700771,Posted: 2 September,all,swquinn,"TL;DR playYs SEVENif you're a fan of the series, and enjoy it for what it is; if you're looking for a better story than earlier games in the series you may be slightly disappointed. Still, if you loveYsthe way I do, you will still have fun playing the game.------For fans of theYsseries, especially those who were unable to play the original release ofYs SEVENon PSP, I would recommend this game if for nothing more than a return to the world of one of Nihon Falcom's flagship titles.This isn't the best Ys game in the series, but it is still fun. There is a sense of retreading old ground in the game, most notably with the games story arc.Ys SEVENlacks some of the appeal of earlier games in the series, at least it did for me. Over all though, it was nice to play a newerYstitle again, and this time enjoy it on the PC.The party system is new as of this entry in the franchise. It simultaneously breaths new life into the gameplay ofYswhile at the same time creating a jarring contrast with earlier games in the series (even though Celceta was earlier--chronoligically--it was remade with the party system). Dogi speaks more for Adol than Adol does himself and this makes it really clear that you are playing a silent protagonist. When Adol was the only playable character you never really thought about the fact that he didn't have any dialog.Speaking of dialog, the English dialog is a bit campy at times, but I have yet to compare it to the Japanese text; my gut tells me that the original Japanese was not quite so over the top. Like so many RPGs, the story is somewhat contrived to get the ball rolling. However, I've seen and played games with far worse contrivances. The game itself is quite self-referential (e.g. Adol's ill-luck with ships), which should bring a smile to any fan of the series.There isn't a lot of hand holding, it follows the pattern of many JRPGs of yore where if you don't speak to the right person in many cases you can't progress the story. You're not always informed of what you need to do or where you need to go next, often times you find out through trial and error because the game physically blocks you from doing something until a precondition is met--although this is fairly rare. The game will provide subtle nudges here and there to prompt you in the right direction, but not always. Many of the hints come from talking to numerous people in a location, forcing you to build up a mental map of all the dependencies. Even so there are still a few missables through the course of the game, which can drive you nuts if you're a completionist and not paying attention.The music has always been on of the best things about theYsseries, Sound Team JDK's arrangements are phenomenal. There are new takes on classic songs from the franchise, and the game does not disappoint on new scores as well."

76561198106381324,Recommended,587100,34721301,Posted: 3 September,all,clashcat2000,"My first Ys title and what an introduction.Fast, frenetic combat, multiple characters with complex fighting styles, impressive soundtrack, Zelda like dungeons, a very good title.The gameplay is easy to learn and gradually becomes more complex. This game eases you into its difficulty, allowing you time and practice to digest its mechanics before adding another one in your plate. As such, you never feel overwhelmed with the options and mechanic. Contrast it to another action JRPG, Tales of Zesteria, who had a pretty dense gameplay which got progressively more convoluted, with tutorials that were essentially exposition dumps and you had a game that was very deep but no one bothered trying to learn. Ys Seven has challenging gameplay that has perfect pacing.Story is fairly predictable with a few good moments and twists. Solid and servicable, but not really mind blowing. Characters are fairly well written. Some more than others but no one comes off as annoying. Overall, a well made action rpg. A must play for fans of the genre. I can't wait for the next Ys title to come out on steam, which will be in a few days."
,Recommended,587100,34628248,Posted: 31 August,all,Drunk3n_Axel,"Another great port from Xseed. Love the cast and the idea of having to switch teammates on the fly to do damage to mobs based on its weekness from you or teammates style of attacks.  Looks good for a psp port.  PC options settings is only a fraction compared to the recent release of legend of heros cold steel.  Does support up to 4K even though you only can choose up to 1080P in launcher.  Black bars if you have ultra wide like me.  Same fast combat  as other older Ys.  Familiar music you come to expect from a Ys game.  Using Xbox one controller, extremely easy to map.  The game is hard but not hair pulling hard like older titles.  Playing on Nightmare and bosses so far are manageable.  I believe the dodge mechanic has something to do with that.  Its pretty easy not to get hit as much.  Overall don't miss this game if you are a Ys Fan."

,Recommended,587100,34876680,Posted: 10 September,all,Type Zero,The first game in the Ys series to use the party system allowing the use of other characters and a myriad of skills/attacks. This game isn't platform heavy as the earlier installments into the series but instead focuses on evading through dash rolls or guarding instead of jumping around.For a port the only problem that you might notice is the low quality textures but I was so busy with the high paced action and our hero Adol doing his usual thing that I barely noticed it for most of the game.

Combat is great, especially boss fights since bosses actually fight like bosses.

,Recommended,587100,34913172,Posted: 12 September,all,Count Talcula,"I cannot think of a game that would be better served by removing all of its story and cutscenes. I could write paragraphs over every line of dialogue that made me cringe or made me think ""that's dumb"", but the biggest indictment comes at the very end of the game (heavy spoilers):It's revealed that all of the earthquakes, monster attacks, and Iskan fever occur because Altago has lost its ""balance"" (whatever that means), and the Root of All Existence has to reset the world (ie kill everything and then have it reborn). This process occurs every 200 years or so. At the end of the game you kill the Root of All Existence and... every goes back to normal. The balance is restored anyway, the entire ritual was unnecessary. Don't tell me that's not a contradiction.Gameplay-wise, the newer additions only serve to annoy. In previous Ys games, you would buy equipment and find them in chests. In this game, you still do this, but getting end-game gear and medicine requires synthesis, which is like buying except you need to farm the ingredients. This is just adding a step. It doesn't make it more fun, it just takes longer.Fighting monsters is fun, jumping around spamming skills and dodging monster attacks is still fun like it is in every Ys game. But does the game NEED to STOP and SHOW me a new area, having the camera pan over the land and monsters I'm about to fight? Just let me DO these things, stop wasting my TIME. And while I'm on the subject, having to stand still to heal isstill not a good idea, this shouldn't be a thing.This is the weakest entry in the Ys series. Either Ys I, Origin, or Felghana are the best. It's still a Ys game, so you'll have a great time, but I can only hope this isn't a sign of things to come for Ys 8.Three out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ) ( )"

76561198066507458,Not Recommended,587100,34679733,Posted: 2 September,all,Yetsumari,"For fans of the Ys games that have been on steam:If you want more of the same, this game is not for you. The only redeeming quality about this game is the soundtrack. Everything I've came across from the Falcom sound team has been nothing short of stellar. If anything buy the soundtrack, read a story synopsis if you want, and move on.Tl;dr the combat in this game is an embarrassment to it's predecessors.I had hoped that this game offered a fresh, modern take on the Ys combat feel, but they made a game that I don't feel should belong in the Ys line of games. They only added variance and artificial difficulty through their poorly implemented combat system, exceedingly poor combat AI, and the nightmare of a game experience when these completely separate things with little cohesion get stuck together. They added a blocking system to Ys 7 that the tutorial doesn't even tell you about, I only figured out about it when I died to the first boss a few times and I looked into my button settings for a jump command, which they took out in favor of a dash command that you'll be spamming just to avoid walking at a snails pace literally everywhere. When I looked for a tutorial of the third boss there were people that at that point in the game didn't even know that blocking was a mechanic.Specifics on the combat system:They basically added rock paper scissors to the game with Slash/Impact/Pierce damage. In the game, Adol with his sword is Slashing, Dogi is Impact damage with his fists, and so on. Now alone this system is fresh, added complexity to a wonderful game series. Almost every cluster of enemies is varied, so it rewards you for switching between who you're piloting.Right from the get go you have access to an ability for each character, even as you unlock different abilities for characters, they're all only able to be used in combat, none of them seem to give invincibility frames, and the abilities are the only shared command on the entire control scheme, if you use an ability as Adol, the rest of your party will follow with their ability that they have bound to that button/key. From the get go I absolutely hated this, and actually purposefully bound the first abilities that I got on Adol/Dogi to different buttons so that I could micromanage more and not worry about the AI missing the ability, however this approach ended up becoming cumbersome when Adol and Dogi got second abilities that I had to bind to my two remaining buttons for ability use, and my control scheme for the abilities became completely invalidated when a third character was introduced.The final nail in the coffin is the AI that pilots the other characters in your party during combat. There is personalization (that ultimately has to be changed if you want to try to do things optimally). These settings are having them Gang up on targets with you, having them Split up, and having them attack the Weakest target. This personalization doesn't mean much, because the AI still follows the same flow chart and will behave inconsistently no matter what setting they're on. While on Gang they'll split up almost every time they get the chance because they calculate a weaker target than the one you're attacking, because they'll get bored and assume they have to restart the fight during the wind down animation of your right click combo even if the enemy unit hasn't entered combat yet, and even if they are two screens distance away from Adol. (literally they will aggro to things outside of their tether, and will snap back to you only to try running at them agian) while on split they'll calculate that you're done fighting because of the inactivity during Adols or Dogi's right click wind down animation, and dash directly towards you and then recalculate quickly to just attack whatever you're right on top of. On weakest target, they'll almost always split, because they register equally weak targets, and due to part of the flowchart seeming to be splitting up when possible, they will do that at random, consequently leaving it to random if they're even using the correct type of damage on the correct type of target. Often times there is a solution that would have them all dealing bonus dps, but they all randomly decide to attack the wrong type and they stay that way until you switch characters, making the AI think that you're out of combat, making them jump directly on top of you, only to realize that there are enemies around, so they'll aggro randomly again. This sort of thing also happens when you have the AI set to Split, or they'll do it when they split when you're set to Gang.add mid combat looting to this, when you fight one thing and kill it, your AI's will exit combat and pick up the loot for you, but in extended fights they'll whip around all over the place not killing anything properly, leaving ample time for the loot to disappear, leaving you to focus on a single target and hope your AI will help, then pick up the loot yourself as your ally AI recalculates to try to fight more enemies, then you have to properly dps something else, and pick up the loot while your ally AI recalculates separately to try to fight something else/ other things, rinse and repeat through every encounter in every area."

I spent 10 minutes walking around the main town trying to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ to do. Every store is closed, you can't leave the town, and you can't go to the palace. I'm all for exploration but ♥♥♥♥ give me a bone here.overall Poor looking and the gameplay was non-existant. Might as well call it ""Walking around town confused simulator 2017"""

,Recommended,587100,35324643,Posted: 29 September,all,synapsii,"First Ys game for me.  Oddly enough I actually really liked the N64-looking graphics.  Played the game on Hard, thought it was the perfect difficulty up until the last few bosses which never took more than one try.  Very responsive controls and cool skills make the game feel mechanically satisfying while also scratching a bit of that JRPG itch.9/10 recommended"
