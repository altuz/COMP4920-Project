76561198127113329,Not Recommended,587420,32221657,Posted: 6 June,all,~{DCMT}~ Ryu,"A very silly game with all the rag-doll physics you could want.Controls are a bit wonky and the cart gets twitchy when you get up to speed.  Can be a bit frustrating trying the same approach over and over and over (and over).The music is very repetative with no volume control or mute button.However, biggest problem is that the game starts you from the beginning every time you play.  I played for roughly 20 minutes and needed a break from the music (and frustration).  Not sure I want to go through all the same levels again just to get back to where I was when I stopped...It's silly for a bit of fun, but I wouldn't recommend paying for it."
,Not Recommended,587420,32208820,Posted: 5 June,all,riotsquad,"Dirt cheap and I did laugh a bit at the rag doll silliness but I can not recommend it.They're stating it's hard, so is the Trials series but in it you always know that you're losing due to not being good enough, in this game it about luck as you control it with the keyboard and therefore lack precise control, the camera angle is set with the mouse - it's at the wrong angle to view the road going downhill, which makes it even worse. (and after every restart it's at the same angle again)Even how you land in the cart will make a difference and then you have to precisely hit the jump to fly in the correct angle through a window and you can't change direction midflight... (this is already at 2'nd level and I don't know how many there are as I couldn't be bothered finishing it)This is not a hard game it's more or less pure RNG and the initial laugh gets washed away quite quickly, I wasn't expecting a masterpiece for the price but I was expecting at least a little bit of actual gameplay..."

Pressing R to restart seems to place you in levitation mode.I have to say that whilst trying to leave this review I'm being told I must play 5 minutes to do so, this seems like a punishment.[Edit] 8 minutes played  now and I've manged to get in the cart.

Playing it left me wanting that hour of my life back. Avoid at all costs."
,Not Recommended,587420,32332547,Posted: 10 June,all,AdamTwelve,"I actually liked this game. It's a dumb, cheaply made, sleazy trash-fire for masochists, and I'm okay with that. Sometimes that's what a weirdo like me wants. On occasion I like greasy fast food that sits like a stone in my belly. Every now and then I enjoy a film that makes me want to take a shower afterwards. Sometimes I listen to Coldplay.I generally don't buy these trading-card cashgrabs, but after seeing how frustrated Jim Sterling got with it, I got extremely curious. I'm glad I decided to try it. It was fairly entertaining at times, and it feels good when you finally hit your mark. I paid 84 cents, and I feel like I got more than I paid for. The reptillian part of my brain is pleased.Having said all that, I just can't recommend it. It's mostly luck-based with horrible controls, and the generic, forever-looping music gets very old, very fast. Also, you can't save it, so once you start, you have to finish it, otherwise you'll have to play the same frustrating levels all over again. Unless you're extremely curious like I was, you should spend your time and money on something else."

This is especially headache-inducing by the fact that there's literally no save feature, which means that, as soon as you exit the game, you have to start from the very beginning every time you play. Not to mention the fact that, if you're playing for the first time, you're going to spend more time trying to get in the damn cart than actually riding it.The soundtrack is unbearable, consisting entirely of royalty-free butt rock that was probably composed by Kevin MacLeod. The game doesn't even have a custom graphic on the start-up options menu, and the icon is literally just the Unity icon (of course this♥♥♥♥♥♥was made in Unity).This game's default price is 99 cents; I got it for 84, and even then, I still feel ripped off.

It is by no means a crazy good quality game but its low price makes sense for that. It isn't something you should want to pick up to play everyday and put in lots of hours but to play when your bored and play it as a joke. Its literally called Cart Racer. Overall its not gonna have the best mechanics or grachics or the most game play. But it is still playable and fun to play as a joke and make fun of.

,Recommended,587420,32802135,Posted: 25 June,all,DMDrzzt,"Alrighty, Let's start at the price, mostly because that's mostly what this review is based off of. This game retails for .99 USD and at the time of this review it is on sale 25% off and I paid .74 USD. The game is pretty plain layed out before you, What you see is what you get, jump in the cart, ride down the hill, and make it to the target. The mechanics are a little frustrating at times and its tad too simplistic. These aren't exactly characterisitcs of a good review but.. For .74 USD you really can't expect the world of it and I can play it for a little bit and get a kick out of it (Although it's mostly because of the glitchy failed attempts). My ratings of the game are as follows.--------Price - 10/10Game Mechanics - 3.5/10Enjoyability 8.5/10 (I can last about half an hour before it gets boring but if I'm wasting time that may be all I need)--------At the very least I would like to see more easter egg material. Upon trying to walk across the map to see sights you fall as soon as you hit the main road. Riding the cart just past most buldings you don't see much more than glitchy buildings and noclip zones. I understand it isn't what the game is built for but it wouldn't hurt to be able to roam around and do some cool stuff on your 600th attempt at the same obsticle. All in all I was satisfied and I recommend it soley as a game for time wasting."

,Recommended,587420,32319619,Posted: 10 June,all,Rowan the Russian☭,"Cart Racer is a cheap silly game where you try to jump in a shopping cart and steer it so that your body passes through a marker at the end.Each level consists of 3 stagesStage 1 is the feeler stage which is usually an easy ride to the bottomStage 2 is usually an aim for the marker involving going over a ramp of some sortStage 3 is sometimes easy but usually hard as it involves going over a ramp which has boost in the middle proving challenging your luck because you don't always get enough boost even when you seem to hit it perfectly.Difficulty is partially skill with a bunch of luck and attempts to each 3 stages level varried for me from around 30-50 from all the way to near 150 tries (each reset counts as a try so failing to get in the cart is included in the number).I personally like this game as in it's price category of ""cheap games"" it delivers decently. Despite some frustrating 3rd stages of levels I completed this game in less then an hour somehow. People who are complaining about getting in the cart are just bad at it (My tip is to not press S when in air and there's a short forward and jump trick to get in easy). Going back to it's difficulty, I think some of the 3rd stages are a bit of a kick in the♥♥♥♥♥♥. (moby♥♥♥♥♥♥haha). Moby♥♥♥♥♥♥stage was the first hard stage 3 I encountered where it was tricky to get your character onto the marker on his curved back. Besides the moby♥♥♥♥♥♥stage I found that the queen/princess whatever it's called stage 3 and the end level was very hard to get enough boost.Complaints includes bad menus which only has a start and exit button, no ingame volume control for the music played in background, no save feature, no level select even after you complete the game, could use some polishing overall.At it's cheap price point I can't really complain about the twitchy controlled simplicity of this unity powered game."

Well that was Cart Racer for me.It sort of reminds me of goat simulator without all the fun references and Easter eggs.Basically your main objective is to jump into a shopping cart and steer it down a series of ever increasing hill challenges.  That might sound easy, but it took me several tries to just get into the shopping cart without face palming.  Once you actually make it into the cart, a combination of luck and skill comes into play.  Luck being how well your guy rag-dolls into the cart, as it seems weight distribution plays a part in maneuverability.  And skill because... well you're trying to steer a shopping cart.But seriously, this game is hard...It took me over 170 tries on the first stage alone.Controls are a bit questionable (at least the part when you're trying to get into the cart), but overall workable if you're dedicated enough to learn through repeated failure.Graphics are pretty sub standard, with minimalist level design.  Sound is nearly non-existent, other than the background music.  The background music is meh, with the Christmas stage having actual (and possibly copy-written) Christmas songs.  It plays on a loop (not a terribly short loop, but noticeable if you've been failing 70 attempts in a row).And now we come to gameplay; the bread and butter of this title (and really the only reason anyone would want to play this).  The rag-doll physics are just hilarious (and very unpredictable).  Though something magical happens when you fail repeatedly to get into the cart, then you unexpectedly land a jump just perfectly...  and then you squeal with delight as you see the guys arms spread outward like Rose from the titanic, and his legs bent in an impossible, knee destroying angle.My first time was almost euphoric, with the joy ending a mere 4 seconds later after getting T-boned by a sports car on an infinite loop.  It was like a heavy shot of dopamine which had me craving more.  Just one more attempt to get it right!And that is why I can confidently recommend this terrible game.It's so bad that it's actually fun."
