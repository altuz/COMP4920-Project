,Recommended,587430,31361283,Posted: 25 April,all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","I Expect You To Die has been on the Oculus Rift for a while now, but even though I bought it once there I've been waiting forever for it to come to the Vive so that I could play it more with native control support. There are a lot of VR escape rooms out there, but even though IEYTD is intended as a seated game it's still my favorite by far. It takes about 2 to 3 hours to complete it the first time (there are 4 levels), but each mission has a list of hints for bonus objectives you can try to find by playing around with the environments, and there's also a commentary mode unlocked after the end of the game. It has a silly Bond theme that reminds me of No One Lives Forever, and the opening sequence is one of my favorite moments in VR so far. You need this game if you're into escape games at all."

Great atmosphere, sound, narration, etc.However, I beat the game in 74 min, so I guess the game is very short and/or too easy. I guess I can try to go back and do all the achievements, but to me the game feels over.For me, this is not enough to defend the price of this game. It would be worth it at a 50-60% discount."

,Recommended,587430,31363213,Posted: 25 April,all,Foogered,"The Good:- The intro credit sequence is awesome- Nails the spy theme- Missions require a little bit of lateral thinking- Some parts of the missions have multiple solutions- Collectibles that encourage you to replay the missions in different ways- Extensive developer commentary that can be enabled after completing the game- Game does a good job making use of its mechanics and settingThe Bad:- Play time is pretty short (~2 hrs) if you're not trying to collect everything- Most of the puzzles are very easy- When you die you have to redo the entire mission- May cause motion sickness for some due to moving sequences in credits/final mission- Seated experience with ""telekinesis"" mechanism for interacting with far-away objects (bummer if you prefer room-scale)The Ugly:- One puzzle had some hidden items that were a little too cleverly hidden. Spent a decent chunk of playtime trying to figure out the solution, only to end up looking for hints online---Overall, the game was a lot of fun to play despite some minor flaws. I can't wait to watch my friends play it. I am definitely going to do a second playthrough to listen to all the developer commentary (that alone makes the game worth it to me)."

If you've got the VIVE, get this as well. Some might think it's short (I spent about 2-3 hours in it), but I wouldn't expect VR games to last for ages either way."

I probably finished the missions in around 45 minutes - 1 hour (idk) but I'm still playing! a lot of my 5.1 hours is my brother and father playing, but the game is amazing and I still don't have all of the souvenirs. Also, the opening song is amazing! Also, my brother said this is the best vr game he's played. it is kind of short though, with only 4 levels. The levels do, however have a lot of content (my brother solved a level differently than i did) and a lot of achievements (souvenirs)"

It would be great if there wre a few more missions to complete but this is a top shelf VR experience as it is. A bit pricey for what it is, but if that was a primary concern you wouldn own a HMD, right?Great style, amusing writing, good puzzles. Definitely among the most polished and fun VR experiences out there. With 2-3 additional levels, it would be ideal."

What's really nice is all the polish that went into it. There are a bunch of interactions you can perform in the levels of course, and once you're done with levels there are achievements of things you could have done or ways you could have accomplished things differently. I especially enjoyed speedrunning each of the levels. At the end there's even developer commentary in each level, very nice touch! Oh, and the intro is awesome! Love the aesthetic!This is easily one of my top 5 VR games!"

,Recommended,587430,33529082,Posted: 13 July,all,Raldman,"I really enjoyed this game.Pros:- All four puzzles are very different.- Nice prop variety and interactivity- Solid performance (ran without a single hiccup!)- Pretty sweet animated intro- Nice art direction- Genuinely fun gameplayCons:- Hand models have weird fingers (probably needs more subdivisions on the mesh)- Super short in length- Animated intro has some very stiff animation (I'm an animator so this bugs me a little. Won't bother most people)- Voice acting is distractingly just okay. Not bad, but for a game like this, you'd want it to be very good.- Expensive price considering this is about as long as one telltale episode. ($25 USD at time of this review)- Not much replay value (unless you're willing to sit and watch your guests try to figure it out)- You completely restart from the beginning of the puzzle when you die (clearly to pad out the length)Basically, if you're in a financial position where you don't care about how much you get for what you pay for, I can completely recommend this wholeheartedly. It's easily in my top 5 favorite games I've played on the Vive so far. It isn't perfect, but it's a real joy regardless.Hope the sequel is longer. Unless that teaser at the end was for DLC.(Played with HTC Vive on a computer with a slightly underpowered CPU)"

Like half a snickers.It's clear a lot of care and effort was put into this, and the post-game developer commentary helps illustrate that. Plus, the intro credits sequence is already better than a ton of existing vr games out there.That being said, it's definetly short. About 2 and a half hours to complete, probably.

The game makes a very good use of the VR space.+ Can be played sitting down, which is nice if you're feeling tired or lazy+ Puzzles make you feel very cool when you figure them out+ Even after finishing the game, it's fun to go back and collect items or just mess around+ Genuinely funny, a good nod to the less serious Bond films, complete with Bond-esque opening creditsCons:- Very, very short. There were only 4 levels, which I finished in the span of 3 hours, making it hard to justify the price.- Player scale made me feel like I was floating above my seat.Overall it's a very good game, and I'd love to see some more content added in the future.

I actually liked the seated aspect more than I thought I would. At 4 puzzles, it's a bit short. I think 6-8 would make it worth the price. It also doesn't have a ton of replay-ability unless you are trying to get all the achievements. I think it make a good intro game to newbies. My 9 yr old daughter likes it too...

,Recommended,587430,32011195,Posted: 27 May,all,EvilTikiMan,"A fun but little experience, but feels kinda short for its current asking price. The puzzels felt alittle short and somewhat too simplistic, though the last two levels are VERY enjoyably hecktic in the best possible ways; though as they are short they dont outstay their welcome.The controls for pushing/pulling objects(via vive controls) is kinda irritating, but thats more a problem of the hardware than the game devs. If this game gets any additional levels, I would highly recommend getting this game. And if the devs read this i hope they will add more, and maybe even make some longer form levels as well where you go to more than one location in the level. I wouldnt blame people for returning it once done, but i think im gonna hang onto it to see if new stuff comes out.TLDR: its good little puzzel game that could stand to have a few more levels or just longer ones."

This game can be beaten in 20 minutes. The only thing that makes it reach minimum non-refund 2h of gameplay described below.- Bad gamedesign decisions: its not really gameplay value or replayability when poorly implemented or simply antilogical puzzle makes you restart whole level. Even Dark Souls had freaking shortcuts.

(the other remaining time was my fiance playing the first mission)- little to no replayability and lack of real achievments. finish room. collect all ... collectables in room. nothing item / room specific.-bit too easy. third level took me 8 minutes, final one was a breeze after figuring out the combination to the safe.overall its a very fun game. i feel at 15 dollars the game would be justified though. wish there was a so/so option for reviews"

As others have stated, you can beat the entire game in a short amount of time. There are only 4 missions.

But I've had great fun playing the missions, going for speedrun times, trying to find hidden solutions, and of course, demoing the game for puzzle lovers. The polish is superb, and the theme (James Bond) is all but nonexistent in other VR games.

Bump it down to 20. 15 would be the golden price. 20 is fair though.The game is simply a set of escape rooms with a 60s/70s spy theme which is both humourous and emmersive.The quality of the game is great. The graphics and textures are good, much better than the Unity trash thats out there now.My favorite aspect of the game is that there is no hint system (as far as I can tell), so the feeling of accomplishment and cleverness after unlocking a puzzle is great. I sat in the final room for atleast 45 minutes before figuring it out.There are some sections of the game which put a sense of urgency, (ticking time bomb, defense systems etc.) The only problem with these urgency sections is that once you have died by an urgency section, it is very easy to set yourself up to quickly handle the situation on the next try.Lastly, I really appreciate a VR game that works well in a chair ( the entire game has you sitting in a chair. )"

It's a little on the short side, which makes this a little expensive, but the gameplay is top notch. Never thought I'd like a sit down ""escape the room"" style game but it works fantastically for this. Voice acting is great, quite funny and to the point.If you're itching for a great VR game then yeah, pick this up. If you're not too desperate, then wait and get this on a sale, it's pretty much worth it at any reduction."
,Recommended,587430,34226553,Posted: 13 August,all,Rush,"A Fantastic VR experience that is played sitting down. You assume the role of a bond-style secret agent who has to solve puzzles under pressure. I won't spoil too much but the gist of the game is you are dropped into an area (like a secret base or special vehicle) and given a simple task. However this simple task requires you to complete several other tasks, often times under the threat of death if you fail, which ramps up into quite a tense and addictive puzzle game. Its got a cartoon art style that is very detailed and works great in VR and the game just oozes charm at every turn.One of this game's best features I think is the inclusion of Telekenitc powers. What this basically allows you to do is pick up objects that aren't necessarily within arms reach and move them closer or farther from you. This allows you to grab items from across the room without moving but has the added benefit that if you encounter any controller tracking issues you can use these powers to retrieve the item. For example, if the floor is not configured properly and you drop something, it might be nearly impossible to retrieve, but you can just pull it towards you now.The only downside to this game is the amount of content. Not including the bond-style opening movie and brief tutorial there are only four missions. Each of these missions are unique and can be quite hard to complete but are the same every time. Thus, after you finish them all, you're basically out of stuff to do. It seems to be a common for VR games to lack content. Fortunately  there is new content in the works!The game is super fun and oozes charm. Don't be fooled by the fact that you play sitting as its not a relaxed ride. With new content on the way, I'd say this is a must buy."

You are a pretty inept spy trying to foil the villains plots but getting killed all the time.  Tons of fun but like almost all the VR games out there this one has the typical drawbacks.Pros:The intro is so well done you actually sit through it multiple times.The premise and story is a great idea.The controls are pretty simple and rather intuitive.You can play from a seated position because of your ""Telekinesis Implants"" (which i would like to say is a great way of making the game seated compatible).Lots of reasons to go back and try for completeness and getting all the items for your office.Cons:Again with VR games it is very short.  You can ""beat"" the game in maybe an hour or two.Want all the items in the office it will take longerI (obviously) have the steam version playing it with a Rift so I have to reset my seated position regularly and view but I assume that isn't typical for others and doesn't deter from the enjoyment of the game.Puzzles can be hard and repetitive with little clues to go on.  You may have to die several times to get the mission right.Overall this is a must buy for anyone with VR.  It plays great in limited space (My Standing Area is a bit smaller than the recommended size here on steam)  and plays great seated with a few seated position resets now and then.  I do not have floor issues where things drop below the physical floor or anything.  Again if you have VR this is a must purchase."
