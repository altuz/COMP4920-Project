Once you get inside, the wealth and the depth of options and possibilities presented to you are remarkable. I can only believe that it will get better going forward from this point, as shown by the developer's desire to know how he could possibly improve the experience.In my opinion, Chroma Lab is worth at least three times what it is currently selling for, and to get such a full and rich experience for under $5 is a rarity. Buy this immediately would be my recommendation. You won't regret it, there's hours of fun for the creative type interested in exploring the possibilities offered within Chroma Lab."

For any of you seeking an interactive VR music visualizer... THIS. IS. IT!All you need to do is queue up some music on your computer then open Chroma Lab and GO NUTS!Steam Music works. Spotify works. A web browser works. Literally any audio source will work. Just play music somehow on your computer!If you want a little extra mind**** , follow these instructions to open a feedback loop from the Vive Microphone:OPEN Control Panel  >>  HARDWARE and SOUND  >>  SOUND  >>  CLICK the RECORDING Tab  >>  OPEN the PROPERTIES of the USB MIC (Vive Mic)  >>  CLICK the RECORDING Tab  >>  CHECK ""Listen To This Device""Now while in Chroma Lab, you'll be able to hear your own voice with a slight delay. It effects the visuals and really adds to the experience!!If I were to be critical at all, the interface has a learning curve and could use some work and explaination. BUT I SEE THIS GOING PLACES! KUDOS!!"
,Recommended,587470,34422982,Posted: 22 August,all,3dvirtual,"After two hours playing with Croma Lab (I’ve bought two hours ago) I can say only one thing: this is the best experience I’ve played (and I’ve tested a lot!). You can spend hours and hours in it if you like particles & physics, or your’re an artist or you want a trip without risks (I think I don’t need drugs, food or sex anymore ! ).Only could be better if you could share your presets with others (browse online) , or change particles with custom models; perhaps make the UI has a haptic response, multiuser sharing same space (impossible I suppose because the big data you generate) ; some lights you can put in space (visible on the sphere particles)….And the price is a bargain, I would paid 10 ,15 or 20€ after testing it; please, make some DLC’s we can pay the author for his great job!"

76561198042913113,Recommended,587470,34867030,Posted: 10 September,all,caidicus,"That was way more fun than I thoughtWho knew playing with particles would instill such joyI bought the game on a whim, in fact, I figured my daughters might like it, so what the hell.After 52 minutes in a single session, I realized I was having an absolute blast. I enjoyed smashing particles together, whirling them around, attracting and then repelling them, particles are quite fun!Lots of settings that make a differenceAside from the few tools the game gives you, you can adjust settings which change the shape and nature of the particle, as well as change the physics of how they behave. You can add gravity, make their colour change based on speed or thermals or even collision.I saw some sound options in there as well, to make the particles react to different sounds, although I didn't get a chance to mess with that as my headphones weren't plugged in.Either way, I didn't really miss the sound as I was busy feasting on the delicious visuals.If you own a Vive or an Oculus (not sure if this works on Oculus), this is a great title, and pretty fairly priced.There are certainly worse ways to spend a few bucks, as well as an afternoon.Pro Tip:Look at the world through the white pointers that float just beyond your Vive controllers. See a world within a world."

The answer is yes. You do. You should try Chroma Lab.At under $5, it's a no-brainer. I figured it would just be a fun little VR demo -- and in fairness, it is -- but the couple of minutes that I meant to spend in there turned into a couple of hours as I explored the variety of physics and graphical parameters, each of which can change the character of a scene in fascinating ways.You can tell the developer paid a lot of attention to the details here: it's well-optimized; the grab tool's sphere on one hand interacts with the other's in a metaball-like way; there are trippy stereo shaders all over the menus (including one sort of hidden in the targeting cursor).I don't have many criticisms to offer. The UI has a bit of a learning curve, and like others I think it'd be nice to be able to share saves. Additional particle shaders, coloring modes, and manipulation tools would be icing on the cake."

For its ridiculously low pricepoint you'll have an amazing time. It could be described as a virtual lava lamp but frankly that's underselling it - it's a marvelous way to relax and have fun causing colourful chaos to your favourite music."
76561198299344081,Recommended,587470,34426898,Posted: 22 August,all,nova,"Breathtaking, real-time particle physics simulation. This is a program that places you in the same space as hundreds of thousands of particles where each particle is given a set of physics rules to follow. This is all calculated very fluidly in the many cores of your gpu itself such that the many particles being simulated become an entity or entities that feel organic and alive. One moment pulsating swarms of bees, or galaxies of stars spiraling into a black hole or cascading fountains of fluids.Of course, this would be fantastic if it were simply on a 2D screen. But given this is VR, it becomes a truly spectacular and immersive experience within which you command and control swarms of colourful and pulsating particles using attractive and repulsive gravity. Add music and your particles will dance to the beat, becoming a spectacular interactive light show.This is mindblowing stuff and highly recommended!!"

Turn on any inspiring music on your PC and lose yourself in a tactile swirl of undulating particles that you twist and flip and explode like a wizard in a ball pit. Everyone who has tried this has been absolutely captivated and enchanted by it. From animators to professional drummers to IT guys, it makes everyone discover a real joy of playing again.I bought a 1080ti to future proof my PC for VR, and yet i havent experienced a game that takes advantage of it in a real way till this. 1.5X SS and 1 MILLION BALLS to play with! It is a stunning thing to see and control.Buy this game. For the love of all that VR could grow to be, buy this game. It is so decently priced, and once you start playing with the different particle types, gravity, colour reaction settings, and scale of the world, its got hours and hours of replayability. Make sure you play music. Make sure you show it to people you think look stressed and need an unexpected joyful shock of crazy play and grin inducing colour therapy. Make sure you tell everyone you know to try it and everyone you know with VR to buy it.If you hate it, refund before the 2 hrs. (I'm willing to bet for most people those 2 hrs will feel more like a mad 30 minutes at most however!)Im not associated with the designer in anyway, but this is such a great example of why VR is going to be big. Dont watch the videos and think 'MEH' The difference in the game is immense. You are physically in the world with a real solid swirling mass that bends to your will, you control it. And every choice you make in how to control it results in joyous visual feedback. This game deserves to be backed, if only to allow the designer to develo it even further.What are you waiting for? Buy it, find a playlist of your best soaring tunes, and then lose yourself. You might just like it, because me? I loved it."

I've always enjoyed tech demos, physics in games, etc so this really scratches that itch of being able to mess about with physics and change settings.  Chroma Lab is a steal at the price it's being sold for so if watching the video and reading the description for it interests you in any way, jump on it and buy this!  I played around with it while listening to music and it was so relaxing.  I like that it comes with various presets of environments for you to play with too.  Overall, it feels very intuitive and simple to get the hang of and I really can't wait to see future updates to this!

(maybe with a kind of fog around the user)- Do you know the opensource sandbox ""The Powder Toy"" ? Please make different particles interacting with each other- Pls make it possible to import 3d-models (.obj for example) to interact and play with the particles- It would be great to add or delete particles (I think the numbers of the current version is simply constant)- Different aggregate states (solid, fluid, gas) / maybe with temperature?- More simple tools like the sphere tool but with different shapes and functionsAs you can see, your game has a huge potential!
