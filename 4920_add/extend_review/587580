,Not Recommended,587580,31540780,Posted: 4 May,all,Rafport,"I don't want to be that guy, but I am disappointed about this experience. From the game's description I supposed to be able to explore and shape environments, but your possibility to move are minimal and your power to build or modify what's around you are close to zero (to throw a couple of trees is not to ""shape your world""). You're floating on air, the severe floor mismatch ruins the overall scale and immersion, I never had the feeling to be there like in Destinations of for closer examples in Vanishing of Ethan Carter's or Obduction's forests.Not a bad application, but very far from what I expected, and not very relaxing as well. Not my couple of tea maybe, I'm posting this because the couple of negative reviews avaliable are all old, this app changed a lot from his launch, and now is out from early access so this should be the final version.EDIT: Nature Treks introduced a new locomotion method, after my review. As the lack of freedom during exploration was one of my complains, it's something to consider for the reader (I can't try myself anymore, but it looks a big step in the right direction)."
76561197982674516,Recommended,587580,33667598,Posted: 20 July,all,manthorp,"This is my first review. I'm writing it because Nature Treks VR warrants all the attention it can get.It's a walking sim built from the ground up for VR - Oculus or Vive - with no narrative, no goals and no progression.  An elegant load room (playable itself) offers 8 (soon to be 9) beautifully modelled and lit environments ranging from a tropical island to a snow-covered winter wood.  Each offers a large environment with plenty to explore including a range of animals and vegetation and a few easter eggs.  There's a choice of modes of locomotion: fixed-point teleportation, and, for Vive users, point & click teleportation or arm-swing free locomotion.A togglable interface allows you to interact with the environment in a number of gentle, rewarding ways: you can seed new features: boulders, trees, vegetation & swarms of butterflies; and change the weather or time of day.  You can toggle a lotus which furls and unfurls in time with the ideal breathing rhythm for meditation.  Meditation was obviously central to developer John Carline's thinking in creating Nature Treks VR: the teleport points are indicated by a ghostly figure in the Lotus position.I don't meditate myself, but I do find myself again and again sitting down on the beach/carpet and simply enjoying the view for minutes at a time.  And despite the artificiality of the VR experience generally, I emerge from Nature Treks VR into the real world feeling palpably calmer and refreshed.Nature Treks VR is a great demonstration game to show off of the capabiliites of VR to first-time users, up there with the other great pretties-fest, theBlu, in terms of  aesthetics & finish, but with much greater interactivity and variety.  For Carline, the game is a labour of love and he is constantly tweaking and improving, adding new features and responding to user requests.I love my actioners as much as any other VR headset owner; but Nature Trek VR offers something different and complementary to John Wick or Vanishing Realms; in the same way that the warm shower afterwards is different from and complementary to a workout or game of soccer."

It's a spiritual retreat I can take anytime, instantly.Before you select your scene, you are standing in the middle of a circle of orbs. One of the orbs is the planet Earth. One is the galaxy. Another is the universe.  You can grab an orb, hold it in your hand, turn it around and meditate on it! When we have situations we are dealing with, sometimes it can take over our lives to the point where it seems like the situation defines our entire life. By looking at the Earth or galaxy from outside, one can get a new perspective on their experience and pull their energy out of the situation and back into oneself.Another orb is the sun.  You can place it on your crown chakra and imagine you are bringing the energy of the sun into your chakra system, body and aura.When I first got this program last month, it had 4 scenes to choose from.  Now there are more! Additionally, they have added orbs within the scenes.  One of the new orbs is a lotus flower -- grab it and a big lotus flower surrounds you so that you are in the center of the lotus while the petals gently open and close around you!Sometimes in the scene I lie down on my back and enjoy the breeze moving through the leaves of an overhead tree, or watch the sky."

I was expecting something comparable to The Vanishing of Ethan Carter in terms of visual quality and immersion, but this is definitely a few steps behind.These, in my opinion, are the things that can be improved:- the scale seems to be slighly wrong: everything looks zoomed in- the trees look ok from a distance, but at a closer look they're not round.. they all have clearly visible  edges and some of them even have a square trunk, which make them look unrealistic.- the grass and vegetation looks quite flat- the controls are not so intuitive: you can activate the sunny or rainy weather by grabbing the corresponding sphere and holding it, but it stops as soon as you release it.. how can it be turned on indefinitely without having to hold the object?"

This ""game"" looks great, and is very relaxing on my Vive.The locomotion may seem off-putting at first, but you quickly get used to it. I suggest walking in place at first (Or walking slowly and then teleporting once you reach the edge and walk back)I was skeptical on the occean, until I ran into a whale. My jaw dropped as I watched it float by. I'm not even exaggerating!This is extremely relaxing, and it almost feels like a lucid dream when I change the weather.

Blink Teleport is the worst as far as I'm concerned.

Or maybe animals that you could pick up and toss out into the environment.The graphics are good, not great, but taken in it's entirety with sound, lighting, animation and world design it is still worth picking up, especially for $10.    In the night scenes the animals glow a bit around the edges.  I think the lighting needs to be tweaked a bit.  There are animals, birds, insects in some cases.  The trees are swaying in the breeze.  Conspicuously absent were fish in the water.  That would be a nice touch.You are able to free teleport or pick preselected port areas.  It's a nice feature.  Might also be nice to have the ability to walk around.  There is a free locomotion demo on steam to see how and if this can be done.All in all I'm glad with my purchase.

Somebody like me who is married, has six kids, and works like a dog, this is nice little gift for myself to escape the insanity. The developer communicates with players, and obviously works like a dog himself to continue updates. You can tell that he is very passionate about this project and continues to improve it on a regular basis. There are several different locations to explore with beautiful lush environments. The music is nice. There are animal (which look great) interactions and environmental changes you can play around with. You also have the ability to drop trees and rocks in your environment to customize your space. I haven't had to test the improved/updated locomation, so I look forward to that. This is a little harder on my graphics card (Nvidia GTX 1080) with SSAA bumped up, so you may want to play around with that to get the right feel. If it's too low, you will notice a lot of aliasing around the edges of some objects. Fortunately, tweaking your Vive gets easier with every update. This is a VR experience. This is where you go to relax before your next mission in the next action game that you play on your PC or the next diaper you change in real life."

They're quite beautiful but really washed out and that makes everything look unrealistic. Water reflections are completely broken. When I turn my head the reflections move too. it's really distracting and it ruins an otherwise beautiful scene. I'd love to see some locomotion aside from the point to point teleporting. Some of the scenes (orange sunset, red fall, white winter) were terribly choppy. My 970 was really working overtime and still failed to keep up.I like the voice over and the music but for personal preferences I hope volume options are added. Some of the sounds (especially the water) sound shallow and compressed. All in all the app needs a bit more work before I'd be able to use it without focusing on things like broken reflections, weird sounding water, and jittery, washed out scenes.It's difficult to recommend anything in early access because you really don't know what the end result will be. But since I can't post this review without choosing one or the other, I'll recommend it with the hopes that the developer will take my suggestions to heart."

Then try it out when it's on sale!I bought this on discount for 5,99 Euros.I will keep it - nice to show vr to your workmates :)But there are some bugs and contras although:Even with free teleport movement, your teleport range is so close, that you end up having way too many areas where you can not go. The game gives you the tip to acivate the point to point teleport system to reach areas where you can normally not go. That would be ok when I could switch back or just port away again ... but I can not, bacause my hands (controller) disappears and you can only control by gazing and pressing the a to teleport to the next point! I have to leave to the main menu and reenter to have back my tgouch controller hands! That seems like a major bug!Update: The free teleport distance has been extended to up to 30 meters each time! The disappearing hands bug is now fixed!You have a glowing item belt around you, which keeps seeds for some vegation, flowers, butterflies and where you can manipulate daylight and weather (scenario dependant effects, like snow or rain, day or night). On Touch, once you disable your Item belt (by preessing the right controller stick) there is no way to pop it up back! Why?

Looking forward to spending time in here when I need to bring things down a notch.I do have lot's of feedback though that may ""sound negative"" but hopefully it'll be constructive and I'm offering it in hopes of improving the experience. :-Winter landscape:  some trees are floating.   snow appers to fly in multiple directions at once (on top of the hill you see snow going down and also up the hill at the same time, immersion breaking)-In Meadow:  Clouds really need to move even if very slowly (static clouds are immersion breaking)-Controls wonky on vive:   Controls for ""Rotating your orientation"" are the same controls as toggling music. So to rotate which way you face when you teleport, causes you toggle music on and off.  Toggling ""teleport tagets"" causes your current location one to appear. Which should never really be there (because you're already there :) ).    The button guide looks like it's made for some other type of controller.  Doesn't help with Vive controls :(    Also, you have to hold a really long time to activate a scenario (too long imo).-The voice explaining the colours really isn't necessary. I felt it was awkward and didn't add anything to the experience.-Red Fall:   The falling leaves are going down way too fast. I feel if you slowed them down things would be more relaxing (and maybe more realistic? don't know though).  Also they disappear when they hit the ground (immersion breaking).  If they could at least linger for a little while, and ""fade"" over time (as to not kill performance), it would help with immersion.Overall great work. Keep going and looking forward to see where this goes."

They could easily add game features to the package.  It is catered to a new age consumer, but those of us who aren't new age still like nature and would love to have additional features added.  Suggestions: 1. better locomotion, and allow full movement around the map.  2. Add hunting, treasure hunting, fantasy creatures, puzzle solving or war games (single and/or multiplayer) to package.   3. Make the movements of the animals more random.
