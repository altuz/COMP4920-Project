,Recommended,587860,32873345,Posted: 27 June,all,EternalGamer,"This is a great game for co-op.  If you have a friend or two (or five!) with VR, or even if you have a non-VR friend that is willing to play it with you, I can't recommend it higher.  For the price, it is a great time hanging out with friend and solving puzzles.It's cheaper than a fast food combo and literally about a fifth of the price of an actul escape the room experience.  It's a great value for the cash with some really nice looking environments and some great clever puzzles. The entire experience took us almost two hours, and there is more DLC coming.  For under $6 a great value.The developers have even integrated an optional hint system that unlocks new hints that you can view after a certain amount of time, which is great if you get stuck and don't want to let the experience drag on.One minor recommendatino to the devs and for playres: increase the default graphics settings before starting.  We were almost finished with the game before we discovered you can increase the fidelity making it far easier to read all the clues (not to mention enjoy the environment).  The standard setting should be at least medium or high, but it defaults to the lowest settings making everything look extremely blurry.Looking forward to the DLC!"

Definitely recommend playing it with friends (as any other escape room, duh)"

76561198015311403,Recommended,587860,30549190,Posted: 16 March,all,TheDancingPotato,"With SteamVR we have seen a lot of these lately but this is the first one I know of that has multiplayer.Compared to what you would pay for a real life escape room, this makes much more sense, especially consideringthat if you have a Vive, it's pretty much the same. It's cool that I can play with friends that don't havea headset."

The riddles were challenging enough to give you that 'A-ha' moment. There is only 1 level so far but the game is worth the price and the memories! I'm definitely looking forward to DLC, if any."

I really liked the dark theme, overall had nice riddles that need you to think and observe very carefully, blink or you miss it! For maximum fun I recommend playing it coop with your friends. Cant wait trying it in VR and looking forward for the next room"
,Recommended,587860,30546573,Posted: 16 March,all,Nif,Great game! Tales of Escape is a puzzle game and a very entertaining one. The game mechanics are intuitive and combined intelligently to create very interesting levels.I have not finished the game yet but the difficulty is well-balanced so far (which is the most important thing to create a GREAT puzzle game in my opinion!)Special note : the soundtrack is very cool :DRating : 89%
,Not Recommended,587860,30599360,Posted: 18 March,all,Googol,"Unnatural graping controls. But the most important ... Unlogic Puzzles! Not what we hoped it to be, sadly!But a great Developer who takes care and action! Maybe in a little while this could get really good.My friend and I played on Oculus CV1 with Touch Controls and a 2-3 camera setup.The PuzzlesWe could not get pass the first door. That was quite a frustrating experience! We felt there where not enogh clues around to figure out the door code. We did not use the hint system in the game though.The ControlsHaving to hold the Trigger for a while to grab something felt quite unnatural. We ended up wanting the Oculus grip buttons to be instant graping for stuff. And the front triggers to be teleport. Last but not least, a naturaly usable keypad on the locked door would feel much better. Seeing your real hands instead of controlers could also be nice."

76561198118649285,Recommended,587860,30541154,Posted: 16 March,all,Летче_ДВ,"This is a very nice game. I like a lot the general concept, the blood stains and the cold atmosphere that is used mostly in the two first rooms. The background sound is amazing and varies a lot which makes the game more stressful. Personally, I would add more blood everywhere and some meat parts(e.g. frozen pigs hanging in the second room) to make the player start feeling anxious. In general, I liked the game very much. Well done, guys! Give us more rooms!"

76561198033120055,Recommended,587860,30544142,Posted: 16 March,all,Kostas5007,"I love escape rooms irl and after playing some I went searching for video games like this. Most I have found have been singleplayer experiences which, for me, misses the point, so I am very much liking this! The game lasts just short of an hour which is what I am used to for these kinds of games, the puzzles can be tricky but as with irl ones, this is largely dependent on the player."

,Recommended,587860,33222657,Posted: 4 July,all,Shareal,"Wow, endlich mal ein gutes Escape room spiel, und dann noch mit Multiplayer Funktion :)Es stimmt, die Steuerung ist etwas Hakelig. Dies sollte evtl auch noch nachgebessert werden. Auch das man im Menü doch bitte auch den Controller zum navigieren nutzen kann ;)Evtl. noch eine Taste Einfügen, damit man auch dinge Werfen kann wäre gut. (für Nicht-Vive nutzer)Und wer nicht lesen kann: Es ist momentan Ein ""Raum"" (sind drei zusammen gehörende). Weitere werden per DLC nachgereicht ;3-----Wow, finally a good escape room game with multiplayer option :)It's true, the contols are a little odd and should be fixed. As well as navigating through the menu with an controller. (It's not possible, you still need your mouse)Maybe adding a key for throwing stuff for NON-Vive users would be nice :)For everyone who can't read: It's a single ""Room"" (three rooms connected together). More will be available later via DLC ;3"

It is a very cool concept, I will give it that. I'm sure it will mature into something cool, but for now I can't recommend it. I would say if this was a free-to-play game I'd recommend it."

,Recommended,587860,33304247,Posted: 6 July,all,Elysium,"Good escape room with friends. Not too hard, but a lot of fun to have.  Not too many of them here, so hoping for some new maps and such."

,Not Recommended,587860,34873505,Posted: 10 September,all,[M] Lopoetve,"Clearly designed for gamepad and non-VR, or sitting.Their idea of ""teleport"" is ""move 2 inches"". You cannot select where you teleport, it's always 2"" to your left at a diagonal.  Totally useless.Go play Robo Recall for a bit, then copy the move system.  Or SteamVR's.Until then, PASS."
76561198054129502,Recommended,587860,30658051,Posted: 21 March,all,Rawshen,"Cool game. My first ever escape room xD. I did struggle to put the puzzles together, but I guess the only real problem was my lack of attention. I haven't gotten the chance to play it in VR yet, but I imagine it would be much more nerve wracking with the music. And speaking of the music, I thought it was pretty mundane at times, until it really picked up in like what the last 5 minutes on the clock. I can't give an opinion as an escape room expert, but as someone experiencing this type of game  for the first time I definitely had fun. Looking forward to where your team takes it :D"
,Recommended,587860,30569870,Posted: 17 March,all,Panos CSGOSpeed.com,Wow i was waiting too long for a good escape game and know you can also feel the vibes with VR.I believe that the game is awesome and the best part is that you can play it online that's right !! you can play it with your friends or with strangers.My first expierience with the online community was a little bit challenging because i played with 2 Chinese people and it was hard to communicate but i loved it!.I am waiting for more to come.I'am sure that if you buy it you will understand why i am so excited.i 100% recommend it
,Recommended,587860,30640063,Posted: 20 March,all,angelo9888,Pretty cool concept! Thumbs up because it has potential...
,Not Recommended,587860,30564879,Posted: 17 March,all,_Baneslayer_,"Wow really? For $5.00 I dont really expect a whole lot but come on now...This was lower than my expectations. Theres a grand total of 3 or 4 rooms which anyone with half a brain could figure out in a short time. Definitely made for VR and absolutely no backstory, no real reason as to why you're there and no offense but the atmosphere was terribly off. Requesting refund."
,Not Recommended,587860,32797547,Posted: 25 June,all,Tyler,There is one level.  Will you pay multiple dollars for one single level? My friends did not know that this was the case and now I'm refunding it.  Don't waste your time.
,Recommended,587860,31123176,Posted: 13 April,all,CaraNerdJoy,Loved it!
,Recommended,587860,33705695,Posted: 21 July,all,J.,Completed it in 36 minutes so definitely not worth the money for how much content there is but you can easily finish it and refund it in the 2 hour period. If future DLC is free would consider rebuying it but if you're paying £3.99 per level for under an hour of content I do not see the point. The game itself is fun so give it a go.

It's great to play with a friend, and makes it fun to work together. I really hope they expand on this game and I wish there were more games out there like this. This is a fun game to buy!"
,Recommended,587860,32163078,Posted: 3 June,all,Thomas,"I played this game with a friend. We encountered a few game-breaking bugs but these were quickly fixed by the developer. Now that the game is working I definitely recommend it. The riddles are interesting and there is also a storyline that can be pieced together. There is currently only 1 level that is meant to be completed within 1 hour. It is maybe a bit short, but we definitely had fun and the VR support made our experience even better."

,Recommended,587860,34063319,Posted: 6 August,all,Draan,"Not that great, even though we 'escaped'. Directions are unclear, math is vague. Riddled with bugs in multiplayer. Scale seems off (everything is too big?) as well as no options menu for the graphics. Suffers from extreme post-processing. No 'You did it!' after finishing game, just back to the lobby. Multiplayer invite did not work several times. Maybe buy once it has matured a bit.*I have been in contact with the developers and after a lot of communication it seems they have fixed most of these elements. This has been a great experience and i feel obligated to change my negative recommendation. Good work devs!*Edited to update response"

We didn't use discord either, so ended up doing it all without talking. It was fairly easy but there's enough to keep you busy. worth the $5. Looking forward to more."
76561198071122755,Recommended,587860,35218065,Posted: 26 September,all,tabitha_twitchett,"This was a fun game, and I really really liked that I could play it with a friend.On the downside: the puzzles were kind of similar, a little more variety would be nice.  Also the sound quality was awful compared with, say, meeting with the friend in her summit pavilion or in Rec Room.A couple of requests:  Can we have an option to turn off the timer?  Not all of us find that playing against the clock improves the experience.  And an option to save would be helpful.  Real life can impinge on VRIt's not the best game I ever played, but I definitely recommend it and am looking forward to the next one."
