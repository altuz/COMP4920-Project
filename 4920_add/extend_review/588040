Shocked by the first several tunes. Last time I was shocked by a game's BGM was in undertale...Gameplay: 8.5/10Noval idea and brilliant language tricks, also some surprises which expand the depth of this game in mid-late game, but is a little bit repetitive.Overall: 9/10Extraordinary plot, amazing music, interesting puzzles, diggable lore.-0.5 some of the choices are not so 'logical' on a second thought.+1 The music and text coordinate so well in this game, creating a highly immersive experience.-0.5 could have more branches and endings, maybe add them in a DLC?In conclusion, if you are a fan of traditional interactive fiction games, or games like undertale/papers, please where you have to make a lot of choices, this game will surely give you something very familiar yet very different."
76561198270989380,Recommended,588040,32241095,Posted: 7 June,all,jkrd,"An innovative game of considerable quality with a fresh take on interactive fiction.With little of the repetitive clicking that we so often see in IF, the story and dialogue are highly compact, even to someone as impatient as me. That said, the story is by no means bland or simple. It is an immersive, engaging tale that manages to weave in charismatic characters with diverse, yet believable backgrounds and distinct personalities that develop as the game progresses.Given the game's nature (branching outcomes, multiple character stories progressing in parallel, leaps in time, mysteries and sci-fi etc.), I am rather amazed at how the stories manage to connect and intertwine with minimal flaws in logic. There are certain segments that I feel could be more meaningful/could be further explored, but personally I do find the story to be set at a comfortable pace.The game is peppered with countless CGs of very high quality throughout. I am not an expert when it comes to art/design, but I did appreciate the attention to detail that helped show more of the characters and the story setting. Music and voice-acting is pretty great too.Each story piece (represented by a square block) has multiple outcomes but there is often a ""true"" or ""best"" outcome which is required for the next piece to open up. The more text pieces to manipulate, the more combinations, hence the more outcomes that have to be created. This means that many outcomes tend to feature only a minimal change in detail, although it is understandable given the tight budget and the sheer number of outcomes that have to be created. Fortunately, alternative outcomes do contain interesting ""what-if"" scenarios, CGs and/or information that are otherwise not found in the ""true"" one, so there is still some value in exploration.That said, this game is in no way perfect. The gameplay, while fairly creative, does get a bit dry and repetitive halfway through. Sometimes, it is difficult to follow the author's logic (""why is it that rearranging the text in this sequence results in this ending?""). The overuse of the illusion of choice also cheapens the outcome occassionally. There are also a few bugs, although nothing that seriously interrupts gameplay. As an IF game, its innovation is notable; as a Chinese indie game, its quality (art, music, voice acting) sets a good standard; however, it still lacks polishing here and there.On overall, it is a worthy purchase for one to kill time. It also shows the tremendous potential Chinese indie games and IF games possess. I truly hope that an English translation can come out soon so that I can recommend it to my English-speaking friends."

The music and CGs in the game are also extremely well made. I would definitely recommend this to people who are interested in mystery/story driven games. However, as of now, the game is only available in Chinese. I look forward to an English patch of the game, so I can recommend it to my friends who do not speak Chinese. All in all, I give it a ""whatareyouwaitingforjustfreakingbuyit/10""!"
76561198193707749,Recommended,588040,35362891,Posted: 30 September,all,lesleyding,"My first comment goes to this one.This game is not so common in steam but more welcomed in eastern culture. The gameplay is using choices to control the fate to the character or characters to lead to several ending.The uniqueness of this one is the choice is to switch the sequence of two peoples' talks. And you can easily see their choices of talks will affect the fate of theirs and others from the tree diagram.Sometimes S level choice might not always lead to the best results.The story is interesting and the music is quite beautifully done to be in tune with the mood.I have always been a fan of such type of game. I have seen some examples in Japanese games. This one is Chinese. Well done.But, there is always a but, some of the lines might not very much logical. It happens because the line will be switched between different situations. In order to get all the trophies and badges, it could be repetitious to a certain extent.Still I will recommend it. The only thing is that it would very difficult to translate into English, I suppose."

If you've played 428, then I don't think you could be impressed by this game. But if not, please have a try. Btw, after finishing WILL, don't forget to play 428, one of the most fabulous text-adventure game ever made!!!!作者应该玩过428被封锁的涩谷、街~命运的十字路口、Ghost Trick哈哈。"

,Recommended,588040,34220587,Posted: 13 August,all,Myuu,"Looking forward to seeing the English and French versions of this game, even though the very concept of the game makes the translation considerably difficult.Meanwhile, a little review in English for those who would be intrigued by the concept!---Intrigued by the original design of this game, I played the Chinese version and was very pleasantly surprised.The principle of the game is unique, you play a goddess with a supernatural power: inverting the order of words in the letters that you receive from desperate characters who ask for help, and by this, changing the meaning of the sequence of words, and thus the course of past events and the fate of these same characters.You receive letters as you go and you discover at the same time the interwoven stories full of adventures of dozens of characters with entirely different social background, age, profession and nationalities.The characters are very interesting and endearing and the story rich, magical, dark sometimes yet still full of humanity. I recommend it to all visual nouvel enthusiasts or those who are looking for original stories without being afraid to read tons of dialogue :)The +:- Very interesting characters- Rich and touching stories- Original and interesting gameplay- Beautiful CG & OSTThe - :- Maybe too many dialogues for those who are not used to it- Obligation to re-read the same dialogues while trying several different solutions- The game could become a bit repetitive after a few hours- Solutions are not always logical- The ending (the story of the ""goddess"") is a little disappointing"

,Recommended,588040,32338364,Posted: 11 June,all,It suffices to show that....,"It is as attractive as ""Stellaris"", and makes a person who do not like interactive fiction turn to this game.To be honest, I do not know whether this game will keep its essence, if translated into English, since it uses too many word tricks in Chinese. But if possible, do not hesitate to try.p.s.: This is a dark story, and the napkin or handkerchief mentioned at the beginning is prepared for tears."
