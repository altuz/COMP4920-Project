76561198366194793,Recommended,588110,32367323,Posted: 12 June,all,Drunken,"One Dog Story is an absolutely phenomenal platformer that I would recommend to anyone, whether they're just casual players looking for a great way to pass time or hardcore gamers seeking out for an adventurous, engaging platformer. As someone else said, I love how it takes elements from different games, noticeably Shovel Knight and Cave Story. The attention to the detail is outstanding and the I love the graphics, it makes me nostalgic even though I just got the game a few days ago.However... as another reviewer stated, it can seem a big sluggish at times and get boring pretty easily. Sometimes quite a chore to trudge through a level.Overall, i'd say it's worth about half the price. Outstanding gameplay, levels, graphics, and more, just a bit on the non-exciting side. 6/10 in my book."

I have been playing the game using my Xbox controller with no issues what so ever, everything seems to work very well.The game is not difficult to play, with plenty save, health & weapon upgrade  zones, that you will find as you move through the levels, they do cost a small amount of mutagen, which you will pick up along with bones & ammo as you fight of enemys. I feel this game is 1 of the easiest platformer game's I have played so far, & I have even managed to kill 3 bosses already, thats after a few attempts with each 1, since I did not know what to expect. Now Im up to a lava moving screen, which has up'ed the challenge a bit more, but with persistance I will make it through Im sure.All I will say is I have been really enjoying my time with this game so far, & this is 1 platformer game I do hope I can finish, since a lot these type games do become quite difficult as you progress through them, & thats when I stop playing them as they get to hard & frustrating to complete. But so far this game has been on the easier side for me, so I hope I can finish it in due time.Price wise? Im not disapointed about my purchase, but perhaps waiting for a better deal would be a better plan;)Game does not disappoint;)"

,Not Recommended,588110,31599614,Posted: 7 May,all,Losian Rooke,":: Note - I originally gave it a shaky yes but have swapped to an absolute no since playing more. Too many technical glitches and issues, bad game design/code problems, etc.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=921566306tells the story nicely. Expect this kind of eye-rollingly ridiculous nonsense.. losing key items despite saving after getting them, cutscenes replaying (the floor is gone but NPCs hover in air only to fall again..? And nobody tested this to find that it happens..?), you can take damage during the several seconds it takes to go into a door, and on the next screen *before it has even loaded fully.* Enemies shoot projectiles and attack immediately. Or, another example.. Stand on lift it goes right, get to end of hall, downwards chute. Get to the bottom, death laser. Turns out the left/right platform I guess suddenly goes down and you *HAVE* to ride it down, despite there being no indication thereof, and it being entirely possible to work your way down with a recently acquiared item. Again, terrible design.The story goes way too minimalist and is kinda Engrishy.. it may have worked without all these other issues making it just tedious (or causing me to die because suddenly its time for dialogue but enemies can still spawn/attack/hit you), but it doesn't work. This game is flat out bad, sorry devs. You really screwed this poor pooch. I still hold firm that the aesthetic is good, but every aspect of the game design *is not.* I got to the point of just wanting to be done with and felt like I was at/near the end, but it kept going..  ::This is a really tenuous 'yes', unfortunately.. THe game is, in my opinion, only saved by its graphics and aesthetic, which in my opinion are really well done.The movement and jumping feel generally awkward and the left-right movement is painfully sluggish, making some of the platforming downright obnoxious and un-fun. Some of the bosses are super finnicky with the timing of reacting to their attacks - a certain falling-stalagmites type boss feels nearly unavoidable.. The screen shakes so violently and the view is so narrow, and your character so slow, that it's pure luck, not skill or reaction, that determines success.I'm not sure if it's the engine or the dev, but the gameplay/mechanics/performance side of this game are barely average. The aesthetic is spectacular.. The former will hold the game back, but at least the latter prop it up a bit higher than I think it would be otherwise. I was excited by it due to the lovely look, and the soundtrack, though relatively minimal from what I've experienced, is good. The game has a lot more of an 'unsettling' feel than I expected, and it sets an interesting tone.. but the hitboxes, hit detection, etc. all really subtract a lot. You can even get stuck floating and jumping endlessly, and it happens pretty regularly. Again, not sure if whatever engine/maker was used just sucks, or it's a shortcoming on the developers code-side, but either way, it really drags what could be a 9/10 down pretty hard. For me, I'd sit in the 6-7 range just because I can't stand awkward/bad feeling platforming and funky, finnicky hit boxes and detection.Also, there's no way I can tell to jump down, and you never can tell what items you can jump on or not, so you end up awkwardly running up and all around to get to where you're trying to go. A minor gripe, but still a bad design point.Edit: Actually, now that I've resumed my game I have cutscenes playing that shouldn't be replaying again and causing some weird graphical glitches and stuff.. This game needed more polish before being fully released, I'm sad to say. I really, really would put this at a barely positive 'meh' because of all these issues cropping up... in fact, I had looted a key card last time that somehow disappeared from quitting/reloading, despite having *saved*. I'm gonna swap this to a not recommend.. Bugs like this cause people to run laps and get lost because of poor coding/design. The game has a great aesthetic, but everything else falls a bit short. At this point, I'm swapping to not recommended. There is just too much that is badly designed or doesn't feel/work right. The game just isn't good, and it's a shame, because there's a glimmer of something that coulda been good. The story tries to be mysterious and aloof, but just comes across as flimsy and uninspired. Dialog is mediocre to bad with a few sparks of intrigue, but that's the exception to the rule.You can be attacked while transitioning screens and before loading. In fact, you can sift through garbage bags for items and be shot.. and it doesn't interrupt searching! And you can't cancel it, even though it lasts a good 3-4 seconds..So you're just stuck getting shot repeatedly. Enemies will load in before you do and protectiles hit you before the screen even fades in. Absolutely ridiculously bad design.It costs currency to save/heal, which is okay, except it doesn't actually serve any purpose. Enemies respawn and almost always drop a currency, so it just makes you stop and go back and forth between two screens to farm enough to save. It could be a system of forcing choices between upgrades/heals/saves, but instead it's just tedious.. more awful design.Edit edit: And just died while a boss did his shpiel because you can take damage, repeatedly, during dialogues, from other enemies. Great design, devs! It's not limited to just before-you-spawn and while-you're-transitioning-screens, nope, it includes dialogues too."

76561198072127207,Recommended,588110,31441794,Posted: 29 April,all,Arv,"I’ve been following the development of this one for quite a while now, but I didn't really dig the old graphics. But now with the new graphics and all the other bells and whistles they've added I like it so much better. An excellent platformer with a solid story.Now this dog CAN jump!IMO there aren't too many really engaging platformers now where you would run around and explore all sorts of rooms and locations.Each level is completely different - there are new enemies, but also new opportunities.Really enjoying it thus far, well done you guys!"

It's been 3 months now with no response, no fixing of bugs, especially some of which that are game-breaking.I cannot recommend it if the developers released the game and then threw it aside so quickly."
,Not Recommended,588110,32782677,Posted: 25 June,all,Spencer,"There are only really two words I can describe this game by: Awkward and clunky.It's everywhere from movement, combat, hit detection and dialogue, even down to the fact that saving costs ""money"", and that it's really easy to lose a bunch of progress with all those factors and lack of autosaves or checkpoints.Now, lack of autosaves/checkpoints and paid for saving would not necessarily be a bad thing if the rest of the game was there to support it, but sadly the floaty movement and unreliable hit detection combined with being stuck with a very short ranged melee weapon for frankly too long don't do the game any favours. And that's even without going into the floaty mess that is the camera."

It's unavoidable.-Level design is very ""oh hey go to the end of this path then boom find the thing then boom go back all the way down that path..."" etc.-Bosses are generally... well, super ♥♥♥♥ing easy.

,Not Recommended,588110,31642755,Posted: 9 May,all,BadgerWaffles,"First off, I was really looking forward to this game (it reminded me so much of cave story!). However, it is an extremely generic game with poor controls, layouts and dialogue. I didn't get too far into it admittedly but I just lost interest after the first boss. The writing for this game is just generic and thus boring. Amnesia is not an interesting and does not give a character depth. The robot in Cave story never said a word and had more heart than this dog dude does.I'll probably get around to finishing it someday, still a big disappointment."
76561197976001863,Recommended,588110,33218553,Posted: 4 July,all,deathx88,"Really enjoyed this game. It's a great platformer with similarites to Cave Story. I want to point out though, that this is not a metrovania game. It's still a fun action-platformer. Gameplay is straight forward, but feels polished. Plenty of weapons and collectibles to obtain with the occasional hub level and boss battle. Enemies drop items that you can spend to either heal, save, or upgrade your weapons. If you get hit your weapon level slowly degrades, ala Cave Story.I thought the story was interesting too. Some type of experiment goes wrong and you wake up in a lab with almost everyone dead, through some flashbacks you try to figure out who you are and why you're a talking dog. Reading from notes and computers can also help piece together some of the lore and the world this takes place in. I also don't consider this a kids game as another review said, it does have a dark feel about it, there are even some grim choices that could lead to multiple endings. I had a pretty decent challange playing on normal difficulty, so might be tough on the hardest skill.I picked this game up with the soundtrack for less than $5, and I must say, the music in this game is really good as well. I think this is an underrated hidden gem, and recommend playing if you want to experience a solid action-platformer with a 6-8 hour campaign and some good music, or if you just really like dogs."
,Not Recommended,588110,33460110,Posted: 11 July,all,31 CABBAGE,"Great pixel work, and a decently interesting story, if extraordinarily predictable. Honestly, this game is worth 2.99, not the 9.99 regular price tag. Bugs are a serious, persistent problem here. Plent of game breaking ones and really, really stupid things the game does that show a clear lack of focus on the programmer's part. I think this may have been made by someone who is extremely amateur or extremely lazy--here's to hoping it's the former. There are MUCH better platformers for the money if that's your bag. Maybe grab this on sale if it's 99 cents or something."

Oh yeah, you know that old cartoon - All dogs go to heaven? The game kind of reminds me of that... well, if you follow the story and read all the dialogs carefully - which is quite a lot btw. Sometimes they seem way too deep, which personally doesn't put me off. 10 battledogs out of 10!"

Several different endings and a decent story will keep you entertained. The graphics are typical of the 16 bit era, but unfortunately the game has some choppy frame rate issues at times on my system. When the particle count increases, there can be some major slow down. Doesn't affect the gameplay too much at least, though, and the game is good enough to make up for it.All in all, if you love platformers, you should check this one out."

76561197967286523,Recommended,588110,31547122,Posted: 4 May,all,Postendustrial,"I'll reccomend this game but really I'm giving it more of a sideways thumb because for every pro there is an equal and opposite con with one exception and that is the music and art which are beautiful and worked seamlessly into the game. Let me lay out what I mean-the level design and baddies are varied enough that it doesn't get boring and it's fun to play but the difficulty curve is all over the place so it goes from ""walk down this hallway and bust up these enemies with no sense of self preservation"" to ""fight this underwater rocket octopus and his million children and oh yeah you don't breathe water""-The story seems to be doing something cool and it doesn't fumble all over itself in the process, and there are a couple times when you can decide things like ""let this NPC die?"" but it doesn't change a lot except how you gonna sleep tonight. There is a moment when you can end the game early by escaping with aliens that threw me off, I don't even feel bad spoiling it because it is completely non-sequitur and doesn't reward the player in any way or add to the game. I like the idea but it in actuality it's just a cutscene that puts you right back at your last save after it ends because are you really going to not play the rest of the game you paid cash money for so you can fully immerse yourself in the fantasy? It isn't DnD your a dog person that finds guns and shoots stuff.-Speaking of guns there are a bunch but they all do about the same damage and function about the same and ""upgrading"" them does the usualy ""bullets get bigger and there are more of them"" thing which is acceptable but isn't breaking new ground.- One thing that bugged me was that there were times you would need to collect an item to progress but sometimes the item was literally two feet away from the thing you needed it for, so why bother making me get it at all? You can also do this thing to find secret walls but there was clearly not much effort put into that aspect of the game because they were always just a small box with a thing inside congratulations you pressed the button or shot up every wall you came across here's your dog treat.-The devs decided to forego the traditional ""chest with items"" for garbage piles which I don't really care about but it's a nice aesthetic touch except you throw the items you find it the pile away from you in every direction and the item physics make them bounce like rubber balls which means you will throw health and ammo and mutagens off cliffs and behind instadeath spikes and into acid and lava.-The save system is neat and I'm not going to question why there are save stations and health stations if the chest thing didn't matter to me but I did have to restart the game after I backtracked to saved and get health and realized the entirely vital elevator that I needed to progress had passed beyond the death lazer in the ceiling and it wasn't coming back even after I left the room and returned. It was also in this part of the game I went into a room that had a cutscene in it and was a dead end but when you leave that room back into the elevator room the elevator is beyond the death lazer and basically there were times when the level design was not fool proof which it needs ot be so my dumb♥♥♥♥♥doesn't have to restart the game because there is only one save slot allocated to each game and it is overwritten every time you save so when you do stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥you have to spend a few hours speeding through the beggining levels again.I'd say that parts of the game a genuinely enjoyable  and the style is nostalgically pleasant but it is not polished enough to feel like a great game.Also the whole hoverboard section was a huge letdown but at least they didn't f**k the jetpack up."

They hate games so much, that they did not even try to play their own game. It is so unfinished and full of bugs, that I do not even know where to begin. But first of all: camera!The worst thing about this game is camera. When you walk, jump or turn around camera shakes like crazy. And if you turn around and jump at the same time, it will take several seconds for camera to stop shaking. I am wrighting this review after 80 minutes of playing this game and I want to puke.In that 80 minutes I found 6 serious bugs. I was able to fall thought the floor, enemy was knocked a kilometer away by one hit of the bat,  items were bouncing on a floor, enemies were glitching and so on.Enemies... enemies are the second worst thing in this game. They are so dumb, that it is not even funny. Theymove into players direction or move back and forth for a fixed distance. That's all.  They can not even find a way to the player. Even flying enemy will keep moving into the wall and will not try to fly over. Another thing - enemies can not walk up the slopes. They can walk down, but can not walk up. Probably a bug.And final thing. After defiting the first boss I realised, that developers were not even trying to make this game interesting. They made nice trailer, that is all.They do not deserve any money for this ""work"". (Well, an artist does, pixel art is good. But there is no game in this game.)"
