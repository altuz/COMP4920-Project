,Recommended,588190,30403168,Posted: 8 March,all,Moogle,"Score! Another game playable on my Surface Pro 4! Here comes my first impression so far(First to Steam review this game wooooooot)The Pros:- Well... playable on a wooden PC with decent graphics!- Good balance between realism (Simulation) and entertainment (being a game)- Easy to pick up after a few runs- Simple configuration (easy to set up the game)- Endless gameplayThe Meh:- Photo-realistic graphics as they claim, tho looks like Google Earth graphics transposed into this game with some part of the airport being 2D, would love to see perhaps addon options to have payware scenaries themed graphics akin to those in FSX.- Runway/Taxiway lights are not in correct position half the time and the runway itself is not linear/straight, but staggered from certain POV- Nice voice recognition feature, though doesn't pick up at the speed of a standard air traffic controller's speech- Although the developers had given sufficient warning that this isn't just an arcade game, the tutorials could still be improved and become more in-depth for those who want to give the other side of aviation a try. Currently only those with some air traffic knowledge/background could pick up this game self-intutively,- At the moment in accordance with its manual the descriptions of its multiplayer feature is little to none beside how to set a session up, could expand a little more on that i.e gameplay, could also adopt the server list system (akin to FSX Multiplayer) for those who wish to join someone's session to do ATC together, otherwise there's no way of knowing who's out there unless you personally know that other person who owns a copy of this game.- Read back from AIs are weird, ""D"" (for Delta) pronounced as D, e, l, t, a sometimes (i.e spelling out the letter)- Lack of (binocular level) zoom/view point rotate controlsThe bad:- Too few buttons, often rely on typing taxi instructions or speech- Price tag is so expensive, not including the addons that add real air traffic schedules and liveries which seems to only be purchasable externally on their website, rather than offered in a single place (Aka Steam)- Certain aircraft's landing gear clipping through the ground O.oRecommendations:Overall why did I recommend this game despite all the mehs and bad seem to outnumber the pros? Well, as I mentioned (so did the developers) this game isn't meant to be as simple as just a game akin to airport madness or some other arcade ATC games, but a well balanced game between realistic simulation and entertainment. Despite all its flaws it's still a very good simulation to own a copy.However with its current price tag, I do not recommend buying the addons unless you really want real air traffic schedules and liveries (Mostly cosmetic), not to mention it's not purchasable via Steam so prepare your daddy's credit card if you're under 18 :)"

While it's not a 100% accurate sim of tower operations, it gets much closer than the other tower games.I've seen a lot of complaints in some reviews about how bad the voice controls are.  That is not my experience at all, and I think the problems with people's voice control is with the individuals doing things wrong rather than the sim not picking up the voice correctly.   The game uses the Windows voice functionality, and people should go through the quick Windows tutorial (10 mins) to teach themselves and the computer to recognize their voice.    Also, you must use left shift as the ""push to talk"" within the game to input your voice commands, and you must not release the key until a second or two after you finish speaking.  You'll know when, when you see the input bar fill with your commands.  My suspicion is that people are using the push-to-talk like they would in a normal voice chat with other people, which in this game will cut off the last word you said and keep the command from being parsed correctly by the program.All in all it's engaging and fun, and when things get busy it's extremely hectic."
76561197972286406,Not Recommended,588190,34314411,Posted: 17 August,all,Checkup,"If this game worked as advertised, it would be a highly entertaining and absorbing sim. IF it worked as advertised—which it doesn't. It's more like an early beta than a finished game. I downloaded 3D Pro with all of the DLC. The game is a small download which was worrying and you can see that it has bare bones functionality.The graphics are very basic, you can't zoom in to see the planes as much as you want to and the 'action camera' view is completely random and not very useful. Some of the planes glitch a lot and get pushed back for the wrong runway, for example if you are on Rwy 9 they will get pushed back initially facing East and then get turned 180 to face West for taxi, which means by then they are off the taxiway. If a plane is pushed back near a taxiway junction it can get frozen meaning you have to delete it, which incurs no penalty but sort of ruins the sim.There are severe frame rate drops with the aircraft, this is inexcusible seeing as the graphics are so basic. The planes hang in the air when they cross the threshhold and jerk down the runway. I have a decent graphics card NVidia 1060. At least one of the runways has a large tree in front of a crucial junction and again at the end of the runway. I don't know if this has been done deliberately because it wouldn't be there in real life. Even with the winds at 000kt the trees wave around as though they are in a hurricane.I gave up with the tutorial because it's so buggy, but the game itself is pretty simple so you can jump straight in with the list of commands. It helps to keep this open on a second monitor but from what I can work out only the most basic commands work (Cleared for take-off, Cleared to land etc.) I tried a couple of times to give more complicated instructions (such as 'taxi via taxiway B' or 'runway 09 via taxiway B6' but no chance).There are some compromises which may be because of the malfunctioning voice system, for example you can issue a take-off clearance and request to contact Departure, but if you give the wind direction you cannot request to contact Departure. This is because the voice system will only process two or at most three commands. The recognition is not bad (when it works-see below) but it only has a passing resemblance to actual ATC. There are no frequencies to pass, it works better when you don't pass the wind direction and if you get a single word out of order then you have to start again, although your intention might be perfectly clear.'Taxi to apron', 'taxi to ramp' and 'taxi to terminal' are all treated as the same command which is not a big deal but shows that the game is unfinished. The tower positions seem to be too high, particularly for the smaller airfields. There are too few airfields, I think three without the DLC, for a premium cost game. The weather options are very simple 'foggy' or 'stormy'. All they do is obscure your view out of the tower, but they don't really impact the planes (you don't have to increase separation I don't think) and again the graphics are poor with jet black clouds and a bright sun.The gameplay is very basic. You get to choose what time to operate the ATC but I can't work out if that is even relevant, with a bunch of planes starting up initially, then long gaps when absolutely nothing happens even though it's mid-morning, then all hell breaks loose, then nothing. With the more complicated airports you can have 40 planes requesting pushback and 6 ready to line up on one runway. I think you get the same number of pushback requests whether you are operating one runway or eight. The planes crash into each other on the ground which is unrealistic and if they end up face-to-face then you have to delete one as there is no way out of that.The instructions are very basic and some aspects of the game are not covered (such as the white dots which allow you to select which runways you want to manage). Many of the commands are not available unless you use a microphone, which brings me to the biggest problem:The problems with just getting the program to accept spoken commands are massive. The first time I played it didn't work. Then after I changed the language to English US and mucked about with voice recognition it worked - twice. Then it stopped again and I have tried all of the suggestions and it still doesn't work. There is a 'Test Voice Recognition' in the program - but that doesn't work, it does the same as 'Test Voice' (it just says 'Hello Captain' or something stupid). They urgently need to put some diagnostic software into the game that can be used to find out if the voice recognition is set up correctly, otherwise you have to keep quitting the game, tweaking something and restarting it only to find it still doesn't work. Sound settings are a nightmare at the best of times. I can get voice recognition to work in Word, but not in this game today.Overall I would say don't buy this game until it has undergone a lot of debugging and improvements, it's very expensive for what it is. If you can get the voice recognition working then I would say it's worth about $6."

My wife is an air traffic controller and even if she says its not quite like the real world its good enough for me :)But what does she know about towers anyway, she works in the basement controlling airplanes high and far away in the sky.If you have intresst in working in a tower its not that far from reality, I reccomend this game cuz my wife says its the most real tower simulator game she seen .:)Thanks for this game and sorry for my english"
,Recommended,588190,34613816,Posted: 30 August,all,zoli,"This game is far from finished.Pros:- It is a solid ATC simulationCons:- priced like a AAA title but looks like freeware- every extra airport is a DLC- the DLCs are way to expensive- the radio-transmissions don't sound like radio transmissions at all- voice control is just a Windows feature- You have to change your Windows settings to English - srsly???This game feels like an early access title but is priced like a top-notch triple A title.Instead of realeasing DLCs the developer should focus on polishing up the base game. I am sure this would result in better reviews und in consequence sales would go up.I still recommend it to ppl how are searching for a good ATC simulation, but would like to see some improvements."
,Recommended,588190,33774835,Posted: 24 July,all,Luke,"I have a huge interest in aviation so I decided to try out this Sim and I must say after a while the voice recognition is really really good first few times it was not detecting everything but now it really is fantastic. A few more features could be added but a fantastic sim, bummer you have to buy more addons on a different platform (not steam, their website) in order to get real airlines/callsigns which I feel should be in the base game.Little on the expensive side but it really can be seen as a puzzle game and give hours of fun, however buying DLC is nearly a must in the future however the layout has great customization, the traffic volume and time of day etc....Would recommend."
76561197960463009,Recommended,588190,32750274,Posted: 24 June,all,Guttermouth,"I've put a few hours into this game dealing with the runways a KLAX. I find it at it's core to be a really fun puzzle game. It's all about getting all those planes to move around the tarmac and to the runways and their terminals as fast as you can. My biggest grip is the voice commands. It for some reason cannot understand when i say the word ""AT"". Otherwise all my other voice commands work perfectly. It's a fun sim. And it's good for a quick 10-20 min game or play for hours. I'm enjoying myself both ways."
,Not Recommended,588190,31553107,Posted: 4 May,all,Dargonis,"I tried, I really did.  I love this genre and consider myself an aviation fan.  I bought the PRO version and right out of the gate the voice recognition did not work.  I would most likely have kept this game if I could have given those commands via voice.  Almost missed my refund window trying to troubleshoot the voice command stuff.  This seems to be a step down from Tower 2011 in complexity and available commands and all to look at some cartoon looking planes with horrible graphics and non-existent camera controls that just grabs your camera during take offs.  You can middle mouse button and pivot the camera from your tower but you’re looking at blurry 2d images (basically the same ones in 2011) but with 3d terrible planes floating across it.  I mean the decals are just not fit to the models correctly or resolution is wrong on them.. DENALI airlines. Completely blurry and the lights on the aircraft I can only describe that they glow like you’re looking at them after a full day of underwater swimming in a chlorine filled swimming pool.  Anyways, I been a steam user for more than 10 years and have probably 100 games on here and this is the first time I ever refunded.  It’s just that bad.  For a AAA priced game and the PRO version, you'd expect more.  $10 would be an appropriate price for this game as-is.  Sorry, can't recommend it."

76561197984004070,Recommended,588190,34285859,Posted: 16 August,all,Ianthius,"I loved playing Kennedy Approach on the C64 and came about this by chance on YouTube.....and I love this game!  Ok the graphics  might be a bit outdated but the gameplay, as fas as I'm concerned, is excellent.The best thing about it is the voice control, if you have used Voice Attack in other games such as ED then you will know how much better games can be with it enabled.  I had a couple of issues at tfirst but this required me to have the US English speech installed not UK, I'm not particularly bothered if it helps the gameplay. Takes a couple of commands at the start to get going but usually once going it works well.At first I thought my wife would find it a bit odd that  I was wittering on at the computer with my headset on but as she works for an airline she found it quite interesting.I play quite late at night so sometimes my brain is starting to fade and I get the commands a bit mixed up and have to redo them but that's part of the game.  I love KLAX using 2 runways and cheekily using a 3rd for takeoffs!  San Diego was a bit of a challenge with only 1 runway but with practice it will get easier.I suppose my biggest complaint is the use of 3rd party addons to make it more real, I still bought them anyway as it makes the game more realistic.  If only the MS voices could improve!A great game if you love this sort of thing....can't wait to try multiplayer!"
,Recommended,588190,34489990,Posted: 25 August,all,Like_A_Guetzli,"Although this game costs a lot compared to what you get, I think it is worth every penny.Pros:- Voice Recognition works perfectly, if you do the windows training for two sessions. I can now speak as unclearly as the real atcs and the game still recognises what I said.- You get feedback for everything you said on the ADIRS screen (so you don't have to look at the text)- The airplane models are well made and have a lot of details.- You can pop out every window and move them to other monitors.- Multiplayer works without any problems over Hamachi.- Multiplayer experience is fantastic. We just wanted to try it for 30 minutes and ended up doing ATC for 2 hours.- There are further addons for real traffic and real airplane colors (additional costs).- It is like all the ATC games you have on your phone, but 1000 times better and more realistic (and more addictive).Cons:- Sometimes the AI is a little bit buggy, especially if you have to correct a command (i.e. you gave the wrong taxiway) or the plane has to wait for another plane at an intersection or directly at pushback.- The graphics of the surroundings aren't that nice. But they are not the focus of this game- Performance is an issue on my computer. Especially on large airports like Atlanta.- It requires you to change your operating system to english (not that big of a disadvantage, but might be a problem for some users)- The feedback in the penalty system is not too clear. A log or history would be nice.- The price.Voice recognition is really the highlight of this game, it makes for the true ATC experience. So if you're interested in Aviation, Aeroports or just talking to a computer you should definately buy this game!"

What they don't tell you is that there is no way for you to see other players online. Unless you know someone who has the game then online multiplayer is possible. And still you have to know your public IP address, and deal with firewall stuff yourself. I bought the game expecting it would be easy to find other people to play with.The game looks and feels unfinished.The graphics are OK, but that's it.Sound effects are pretty bad - once I had a prop plane fly over but it actually sounded like there was someone with a leaf blower outside the tower.Overall I wouldn't say this game is worth the price they ask for, and in my opinion it probably shouldn't even be released yet."

But there are a few big issues imho:- Pilots talk constanstly over the citation/readback. So you issue an order to pilot A, pilot B interrupts because he wants a pushback or whatever, and only then pilot A confirms your order. Literally all the time at big airports...- Pilots do not report ""on (short) final"", they just say ""go around"" if the get close to the runway without clearance to land, and you even get a penalty for that...- Pilots hold on the runway if another plane is on the taxiway they wanted to exit, even if there is a free taxiway just 5 meters futher away...- You can NOT tell inbound pilots to slow down in order to control spacing.- In LA, pilots might taxi on runway 25L on their way to the terminal WITHOUT any clearanceMorever:- the voice recognition depends totally on Windows Voice Recognition (which must be set to US English, so the whole operating system must be set to US English...)- there are only 3 airports if you don't by DLCs- tutorial and online-manual lack some important detailsAll in all I don't think the ProVersion is worth the money.

A lot of comment criticize the game for speech issues.  I personaly, speak very fast, and the game never falters.  If you use the tutorials to teach your computer how you speak, you should have zero issues.  I think those that have issues, are most likely using bad speech combinations that do not work in the game thus equaling bad results.PROs....multiple airports including heavy traffic havens like KATL, KJFK & KLAX as well as some lighter traffic airports if that's your style.  MOST (not all) instructions to handle traffic are correct -- however there is still plenty to be desired for the programmers to fix to take this game to the next level.  Very challenging -- it's a ' Make the game the way you want to make it' type of sim.CONs -- PRO version is built on an old engine and has rather poor graphics for what is available these days for programmers.  The development team, however, does respond on the forums if you ask questions, which is ALWAYS a good thing.  They have indicated that improvements are coming.  Price is a little steep when you have to add in the various DLC's, but for the amount of time you will play after getting addicted to it, I can't knock it down.OVERALL -- Get it.  There are not many games out there that can match this.  Even if you're not an aviation fan outright, this may help you develop a new challenge and apprecaition for the job ATC does."

If it helps, I too have the same problem of Voice recognition failing to work after the 1st string of commands (also with an analog microphone.  Both Realtek and Line-in drivers are set at various levels to no avail) and the computer is also an alienware laptop.  Perhaps this will help narrow down the ""common factors"" in your diagnosis.---UPDATE: we hope that we are getting close to understand what is happening on the ""selected few"" computers. We will test it with Chazsi and if it is really a solution we expect to distribute a file sometimes next week.Once again your patience is appreciated a lotVic"

The realism is amazing its as close as one can get to air traffic control without being in  a real tower. On regular speed its quite relaxing as sometimes there are a lot of planes and sometimes there are one or none. When I am feeling like more of a challenge I ramp up the speed to test myself. SUPER STRONGLY RECOMMEND. Especially to people with more than one monitor, the game lets you sprall out radar, map, etc accross all of your monitors making it even more immersive."

The price seems a little steep for this  game as is. Tho only thing that really sold me on it was the voice commands. A little tweeking of that and maybe it would be worth the price. You might even get more people to buy it if you had a sale.

There are some cool features that I would like to see added for example maybe some emergencies and things that could hold up planes going anywhere so you have to mitigate and direct traffic in different directions. The one problem I hate about this game, is the cost to get new maps and all the extra stuff. I understand how the base game costs so much for the pro version with the whole voice commands and logistics of the game, but I don't understand how a new map should cost 20 dollars as if its a whole different map, when there are only a few things different. What you are telling this gaming community is that as you release maps, and when lets say you have 20 maps released we will have spent OVER 500 dollars on this one game, when maybe it would be worth half that. Base game yes keep expensive but 20 dollars for a new map is too expensive and you are going to drive down demand of the game and people will get bored of the same maps and not want to pay a whole games worth of money to get just a new map, at least thats my opinion. I have other games I want to buy yet I want new maps as well, but it will drive my love for this game down unless you look into how you are releasing maps."

That said, I dont really care if the graphics are the same, i'm not here to look at the scenery, i'm here to do ATC.But them bugs need to be sorted asap."
