Self-aware, goofy fun with ridiculous characters, intentionally awful dialogue options and shameless service.2. Cringy, pseudo-mature, self-serious drivel with the occasional ""lol boobs"" moment.I'm glad to say, after 1 playthrough, that they nailed the first option. I got a bad ending once I dropped all pretense of caring about the case more than the women, but the fun conversations, fast pace of the game and many options for diverging paths guarantee I'll go back and try to get different endings. And maybe not get horribly murdered next time...Seriously, it's cheap and it's a hoot. 100% Recommend."
,Recommended,588240,33291680,Posted: 5 July,all,Carnium,"I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Short, but sweet.Down to facts.PROS:- great cartoonish look that reminds me of an old German erotic games that I have played a long time ago (Lula: The Sexy Empire)- interesting story that keeps you peeled to the screen until you finish it- those mini games with girls are ""interesting"". Especially if you get the uncensor patch from the developers (HINT: check the message board for it).- funny dialogues where you can try and play a smartass, a charmer or a cold detective. Maybe even a combination of all three :)CONS:- no way to replay an already finished chapter. You need to start all over if you missed something or want to play something differently. That was my biggest grip with the game.- CLICKING. There is no fast forward or skip text option in this game. Not a problem on the first playthrough, but .....- the game is short and I was able to finish it in two hours with some chapter restarts to see the other options.Final score:8/10Especially recommended when it's on sale!"
,Recommended,588240,32842573,Posted: 26 June,all,Taebrythn,"I think it was pretty funny. before you go and buy it know there is huge boobs on all of the girls. if that isn't your thing just don't buy it. It also has adult content that you can choose to add or not. its a simple game. simply using the left mouse and holding it around the banana areas will allow you to complete the mini games. I don't know if its there in the censored versions.i enjoy the artwork, music, and its not the typical storyline.now there are features that i think were lacking in this novel such as skipping, saving, more slots to save on, options to turn the music up/down, backlog to see text you might of clicked too fast. Currently if you do click you could miss it and there is zero way to see missed text. I'm not sure if there is enough to do a gallery. if they do a 2nd one i think it would be nice to see different body options besides just large breasts such as medium small etc. this way it might attract more customers. i also hope to see the same artist again. they did do a good job."

,Not Recommended,588240,30863681,Posted: 31 March,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Yeaaaahhhhh, I don't know about this title; every component feels pretty 'meh' even for five bucks.I wanna be kind to the game, but I can't recommend this to friends with a straight face.Obviously, this is a visual novel with minor choices-that-matter gameplay.The artwork isn'tbad, but compared with titles likeHuniePopandNegligee, it's just ho-hum. And, yeah, those titles are more expensive - I get that. The whole thing is a click-fest. The writing inFrisky Businessis mediocre. The clown villian is campy, albeit generic. The storyline is super short. I completed the game once in just under an hour, AND nearly finished a second run in 15 minutes by skipping through stuff I had previously read. There are multiple endings, but it didn't merit more playthroughs for me. There are no options to review scenes like many similiar games.Frisky  Businessdid have some good humor, though. I can't say I didn't mildly enjoy the playthrough, but I would recommend other visual novels wayyy before spending time with this one. Check out the two I mentioned above, and alsoVa11-Halla,Magical Diaries, andHatoful Boyfriend(it would be a miracle if I got all those titles spelled correctly).Pros:+Humor is good+Characters were fairly well developed for such a short storyline+Multiple endings, but you have to slog through mostly repetitve story which dramatically shortens those extra playthroughs+There is a patch, at least+It's cheapCons:-Artwork is so-so compared to competitor titles (and yeah, most of them are a bit pricier - but they are worth it)-No collection of scenes like many similiar titles-Music is generic-Story is certainly nothing specialIf you are really into smutty visual novels and have exhausted the better ones - give this a go, otherwise wait for a deep discount."

76561198162703817,Recommended,588240,31894405,Posted: 21 May,all,aim4thetop1,"No fastforward or skip button.I can ignore the cheesiness of the story, but multiple playthroughs are beyond difficult because of this. Bought the game because it had certain 'content', and I love a good mystery, but it gets horribly repetitive when you're trying to get all achievements, and can't even skip to the choices that will help you get them.Some of the dialogue, because of how cliche it was, became predictable enough for my thoughts to align with the characters. Nothing I would say is impressive, and certainly not enough to make me go and refund the game. I bought it for the mystery and the content, which I would say that it did fulfill. Although the frequent chapter transitions really make me believe that it could have easily just been merged together. Easier to also not have a chapter checkpoint as a save.There's also how the text has a lot of the 'i's not capitalized like it should be, and considering this is a paid product, it really shouldn't be that way. Especally with the number of people in the credits. Still going to say yes on recommending the game however, since it actually was what I was looking to buy for the most part."

76561198013020221,Recommended,588240,32951147,Posted: 28 June,all,Kjas,"First off the important item--lol--getting the H patch to work took me 2 hours compared to 5 minutes for Army Gals and  Sakura Swim club combined. I am sure people with better computer skills can do it quicker but the average consumer is in for a challenge. Think of it as an unadvertised mini-game--lol. The game is basically Hunie Pop with out the marble matching or date gifts or anything but flirting and sex. The game has a few jokes and is done tongue in cheek fashion. I got it for under $3 and at that price it is a recommended buy, if you like short silly stories. Not erotic imho or pornagraphic but amusing.  The sexual content it is not for children with or without the patch. It is SHORT."

76561198060942125,Recommended,588240,30802417,Posted: 28 March,all,NurseNinja,"So this is my first review, but something abou Frisky Business makes me want to write about it so here goes. First, most people have to understand that the game isnotan entirely serious game, which from one look at screenshots is pretty obvious. It's a visual novel, which has a pretty decent story that knows it won't be taken seriously, adding to the humor and ease of access. Illustrations were done well, writing was pretty solid and I had an overall good time. The game was a bit too short, which is a common complaint among players on the forums. Another sorely missed feature is the abilty to make save states, leading to run becoming a bit too long. There's lots of replayability to get different endings and to ""make friends"" with the different girls, which was great. All in all, I can't wait for Frisky Business 2! 8/10 for a grade."
,Recommended,588240,30829011,Posted: 30 March,all,Bud,"I am honestly shocked on how much I am enjoying this game.  I was expecting a great looking VN (I saw the ad pictures on Steam only so far before I bought this Frisky Business.) but I had no idea that this game would be incredibly funny as well.Let me be honest, I figured that the ""Dharker Studio"" games were fun but I truly needed to play this...you know, a game that just beats all of your expectations and shows that a VN can be great again.It is late so I couldn't finish it but so far, I rate this at least an 8.5 out of 10 so far.  This could go up but like I said, I am only a little ways into it and I don't want to have my hopes too high for it, I want to be happy if it does well but not annoyed if it doesn't."
,Recommended,588240,30764381,Posted: 26 March,all,SpaceNinjaPirate,"I haven't yet played through every path available. but have finished the game a couple times already.  Here's just a few of my initial impressions of the game.The good:It's actually a pretty cool little visual novel.  It's got a fair number of choices you can make throughout despite it being so short.  The art is very well done as are the music and sound effects.  The main story is simple.  But honestly, the fanservice along with some of the humorous dialog choices presented make it easy to forget about the story and just play around.The bad:Most of the negative issues I encountered were due to the interface.  The game uses the Unity engine which means that a lot of the functionality of a regular visual novel engine is not present by default and has to be reproduced manually or through the use of an addon.  The first major feature missing is the ability to skip through stuff you've done before on successive play throughs.  There's also no way to go back (that I can see) in case you accidentally missed reading something or in case you want to redo a particular choice that you may have accidentally speed clicked through because there's no way to auto skip through and stop at the next choice (the default scroll wheel which is the defacto method of going back in other VN engines doesn't work for that functionality here at least).  And if there is a way to do these things, then surprisingly enough, there are no instructions on how to go about doing them.  In fact, when scrambling to bring up a menu to see how to close the game because I heard another member of my family walking up behind me, it was up to me to guess which key to press to bring up the menu (thankfully, it was the Escape key).  Thankfully the story is short enough that playing through again by just clicking through everything isn't a total pain.Overall though, it's still a pretty entertaining little game (especially with the 18+ patch)."

,Recommended,588240,30775862,Posted: 27 March,all,KazIG1,"It's pretty decent. It reminds me of HuniePop but with a story to it. I've only played it for 20 minutes but hopefully the game gets good. Seeing the other reviews aobut the game being short does make me want to play the game slowly so I can play it for longer but if that's the case, I recommend a DLC being released for it with new chapters and new storylines with new girls."

This was my first experience and I am so very glad it was. I'll go over it in a couple of categories, just to round out a review.The Art: Fantastic. All of the characters are drawn very well; They show emotion with the simplest changes of expression, which I'd imagine is very hard to pull off, but they do! And one particular thing that really helped me suspend my disbelief, the characters changed clothes every in-game day! I know that seems like a small detail, but it goes a long way in pulling you in.The Story: Well-Crafted. I was very surprised by how this game ended, more specifically by how excited I actually was to see the ending. All along you're given clues and contacts and other things to interact with... It's not super complicated, don't be expecting an INVESTIGATOR SIMULATOR 2017 kind of thing... But it keeps you engaged with a genuine sense that each little choice you make, will echo somewhere later on. It's a short story, so that lets them have decision making that actually means something. It's very tight.Additional Comments: I just finished my first playthrough, with NO SEX! NO TITTEHS! NO NOTHING! I played the absolute friend-zone all along, not peeping in anybody's windows when the game gave me the opportunity. I feel really proud of myself... but GOD DAMN... I am starting playthrough number two NOW! I can't wait to be a total♥♥♥♥♥♥to everyone, who does nothing but use his♥♥♥♥♥♥Great Game!

,Recommended,588240,35505130,Posted: 5 October,all,Jabroni Binyot,"Frisky business is a fun detective story that can heavily rely on smut. Which is pretty interesting because it doesnt force you into a specific route, and you can focus on the story by being actually professional.the art is pretty good, and the story can be cheesy sometimes, but its the good kind of cheesy. And the final chapter can actually be pretty intense.However, it misses some features that is pretty standard in Visual novels, such as a saving system apparantly it only saves at the start of a chapter. There is also no log, so if you miss a line, no way to read it back. No CG gallery either.I would definetly recommend this game to anyone that either likes cheesy detective stories or want some good smut (there is an uncen patch) its well, well worth the price."
