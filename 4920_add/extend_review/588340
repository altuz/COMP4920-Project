,Recommended,588340,30110281,Posted: 22 February,all,Jai,"You enter the world as a floating pair of fancy gloves, surrounded by wanted posters and a short description of the game, in a short tunnel behind a guard with a kick me sign.  As you dispatch your stationary foe and retrieve his blade, the world opens up.The very brightly lit world...I was able to yank the nearby torch off the wall and satisfyingly bank it off an oncoming train, but there was far too much light coming in to really get the stealth feeling on the first guard.  Now, this could very well be a practice thing and I just wasn't doing a good job of finding the hidey holes, or it could get much beter later in the game.  I couldn't tell you, because I couldn't get out of that first room...Now, I was able to step out into the room and fight.  And the fighting is very good, if the AI is a bit weak to thrust attacks and armor appears to be merely cosmetic.  Again, this may be mitigated by later enemy types, but I couldn't tell you.  Because the kick me sign is not the only tool pulled from the bully's handbook in this game.  Oh no, they also bring you a taste of that old classic, ""Stop hitting yourself!""For some reason, Impromptu has decided that your sword should be able to cut you.  And hoo boy, does it.  Constantly.Taking two steps? That's a slicin'Looking around for a teleport destination?  That's a slicin'Picking up an offhand sword?  That's a slicin'Slicing an enemy? Ooh, you better believe that's a slicin'The thing is, even as I was commiting seppuku through the first area, I was having fun.  There's a good game in there, I just hope Impromptu can cure my character's cutting habit so I can see more of it.EDIT: So, seems after the first update I'm not getting slashed anymore.  That is a major boost to the playability!There are still issues where the sword gets knocked out of my hand for no good reason, but the fairly quick turnaround on the slice fix really impresses me"

'Stolen Steel' is Not restricted by this!!!I really hope that 'Impromptu Games' do go ahead with making more content for this, as it has so much potential (So Much!). There are so many different things they can do with this, they don't even need to worry much about a story!I could really see the game becoming a VR Skyrim/Legend of Grimrock style of game, which would fill a big hole in the VR market.There are so many fantastic non-VR games to compete with out there but with VR it is much easier to stand out in the crowd (especially with this little gem!).Keep up the great work 'Impromptu Games' , I really hope that this game will keep growing! :-)"

Thank you kindly Devs!The first thing I would like to see from the Dev team is a method to change the button used for grabbing and dropping weapons. I find if I grip the vive controllers or swing the controller, my hand has enough pressure to push one of the grip buttons or the trigger and my sword disappears. too often I found myself unarmed when facing a foe face to face. Please give us a quick patch to move the pickup/drop buttons from the trigger/grip to another button we are comfortable with.Otherwise, there is no depth or story. This game is just pure raw fighting. A powerup system may be a cool idea going forward as well. Or at the very least, a cool set of shields. oh and putting away a sword in my sword/dagger belt. Awesome.Otherwise, play it. It is cheap and fun. GO!"
,Recommended,588340,30130671,Posted: 23 February,all,[PA] Darkmayo,"Not a whole lot to this yet but I like what I am seeing so far.Looks like to combat having a floaty weapon they put a bit of delay on how the blade swings, not sure if that is the right call yet but it works well enough.I found myself dying to mystery damage more than a few times, not sure if that is me hitting myself with my own blade or maybe stabbing myself on a sword on the ground.. or something.The character models look good, not sure if making an area darker by throwing the torches out of the way helps any. Did have a few guards walk by me so I assume I was hiding but I really couldnt tell.I look forward to seeing how this progresses and am glad to see it isnt yet another goddamn wave shooter."
,Recommended,588340,31087559,Posted: 11 April,all,Mango Moustache,"I loaded this up, killed five guards and got a wanted poster in my name. A++! Stolen Steel is really unique due to it's heavy reliance on stealth. While fighting enemies head on is completely doable, hiding in the shadows and waiting for the perfect moment to (violently murder) your target before silently slipping back into the darkness is the best way to go. If you're looking for a neat VR stealth murder game, this is great. Also, due to the murder enthusiam in this review, I am now on a watch list. Neat!"
,Recommended,588340,30178507,Posted: 25 February,all,JoshuaMerrick,"A good gam if you are tolerant of it being really rough. So far, it is the most functional VR sword fighting game i've found (sword fighting being pretty hard to do with current tech). If you are happy to pay a fiver for a game where you can mess around with the current state of VR sword fightring, go right ahead. Otherwise, wait for it to be improved a bit.If you are using a rift and are front facing, you can play reasonably well, but you will need to teleport around to get you and your opponant in a front facing position.PROS- enjoyable gameplay- varied enough environment to provide some tactical movementCONS- Sword physics needs a lot of improvement- Some blows aren't blocked correctly- Collisions need improving"

76561198063942102,Recommended,588340,31492645,Posted: 1 May,all,PS5Owner,This has the potential to be a cult classic.  The sword fighting is really fun.It takes some getting used to.  Once you understand what the game expects it can be very satisfying.The swords behave with physics which isn't perfect but is neat.  you have to be aware of your environment while fighting.You can equip multiple different swords that you aquire from the guards.  Kind of has a Bushido blade-like vibe while you're fighting.Fun if you like sword fighting.I hope they continue with this and add more levels and weapons.One of my favorite games to hop in and just kick some♥♥♥♥♥  Highly recommended!(My playtime is actually longer than .1 hr i was running steam offline for a bit)
76561198075955345,Recommended,588340,30220819,Posted: 27 February,all,Puma,Pretty good for £5. The 2nd update has made it a good one on one swordfight similar to combat in Vanishing Realms which is £20 for a bigger game. Happy to support and good luck with the full game you are developing :)
76561198010698558,Recommended,588340,30284114,Posted: 2 March,all,LeSwordfish,"Tons of fun! Some small issues (once you've locked an item to your hand, you have to manually unlock before you can pick up another if you get disarmed, and animations on the enemies can be a bit whack) but a steel for the cost (see what I did there?)It's not a big game, but an enjoyable one to throw a few hours into every so often."

,Not Recommended,588340,35038998,Posted: 17 September,all,FastLawyer,"This is more of a tech demo with very little content so it is very hard to justify the $4.99 price point.  If the sword fighting were more sophisticated, it would be worth that if not more.  However, the sword play is basic.  I didn't see much of an advantage to properly block and then swing.  It seemed it was always advantageous to swing wildly about.Obviously, kills are easier with stealth.  But with teleportation being the main mechanism to move and no crouching behind objects or walking silently, is it really stealth?  It's more like ganking.  Find a dark spot.  Wait until they turn their back, then teleport behind them to gank.  And there's only 1 VR environment area.This is a $2.49 game at most in its current state.  I cannot recommend this game until better sword play is added or more content.  More weapons, more enemies, shielded enemies, traps. etc.  More than 1 enviroment as well.Rate 4/10 needs updated content to be worthy"
76561197991896192,Recommended,588340,30536265,Posted: 15 March,all,Thanatos,"Accurate swordfighting this is not. Appropriate defences don't seem to make much difference, and while standing behind an enemy you can swing your sword directly through them and it won't register. Frustrating as that can be, I didn;t realize an hour had passed playing this game until I accidentally broke a lamp in my livingroom. For the price, it's a fun and diverting little exercise."
,Recommended,588340,30189983,Posted: 26 February,all,ScatManJak ;_;,"A super solid swordfighting experience.Many of the gameplay elements push the style of ""VR hand-to-hand combat games"" farther than I've seen before.Don't expect a full 2 hour game obviously, (if you do you're stupid). This is a showcase of an amazing idea, hope to see more VR stuff from Joe and the team"

76561197964578747,Recommended,588340,30734022,Posted: 25 March,all,Slum,"enjoyed playing this game - and will continue to enjoy it.    I found the one thing that when you disarm an NPC he walks over, picks up his sword and kills you almost immediatly while you stand behind him/her swinging, stabbing etc etc to no avail.  I still enjoyed it and yes was sweating a tad after an hour. - thumbs up for this one."
,Not Recommended,588340,32043614,Posted: 29 May,all,CaseFace5,"in its current state, wouldnt recommend Stolen Steel at all its very rough and still ran like crap on my i7 980 system. everything felt very unresponsive and I feel in a game like this you need to be able to do everything you would be able to do in real life such as slashing an enemys exposed leg (which does not work in this)Pros: its pretty.Cons: everything else."
76561198047184476,Recommended,588340,30198582,Posted: 26 February,all,Concept,Simply fun concept with good replayability. Great price tag for a fun little sword fighting.
,Not Recommended,588340,30232599,Posted: 27 February,all,thefishstick,Here's my first time gameplay video:https://youtu.be/vy9qIT-3GrgI also review other VR games on my channel:www.youtube.com/c/thefishstickA recently released sword fighting game on Steam fight the bad guys with swords you steal from them or find laying around. Overall this was a decent game however the AI is pretty bad and there is not a lot of content out for it for the price they're asking. As far as I can tell there is only a single level and the AI can be pretty clueless. This is another one of those games that should be a demo in it's current state. THAT BEING SAID i'm going to keep an eye on because I do like sword fight games and it has potential. I may check it out again later on down the road. But I cannot recommend it at it's current price.
,Not Recommended,588340,30180789,Posted: 25 February,all,Cwan,Just needs a few patches! My hands get stuck when holding two swords! i can also hurt myself randomly and feel like i die for no reason! lots of awsome ideas though please keep working on this. I will gladly change my review when this is fixed!

,Not Recommended,588340,30181441,Posted: 25 February,all,SentientMeat,"Very buggy and short. Hitboxes make no sense, you have to be right on top of someone to hit them. The game crashed on me twice in the 10 minutes I played. Saw the whole game in about 5 minutes. The basic gameplay idea is good but even if it was free I wouldn't bother with this unfinnished game without some serious improvements."
76561198020501236,Not Recommended,588340,30159238,Posted: 24 February,all,AlaricVanvelsor,Wow this is beyond basic as far as the early access games out there. The map is tiny. You can't stealth anywhere because the only form of locomotion is teleportation. The soldiers hitboxes make no sense. Parrying feels ok but handling swords are buggy overall. They seem to lag and and clip on random things. You should have only one grip/release button having both makes dropping your weapon mid swing entirely more likely. Even for 8 dollars i feel right now there isnt even that amount of gameplay.I will keep my eyes on it as it develops but this is not what i expected seeing the trailer and images i thought the map was bigger and stealth played a bigger factor. You can't even distract enemies with bottles.
76561197989536665,Not Recommended,588340,30156784,Posted: 24 February,all,Solidwaffle,"bunch of kiss♥♥♥♥♥reviews here. this game is not good enough to me to recommend. buggy teleport system, and the game is slow enough paced to have a more normal movement system. weapon handling system is wonky they never seem to stay in your hand. combat is borderline awful as weapons ghost quite a bit and a weapon connection with ai send them back 10 feet out of your range. i will redo my review if this gets fixed."
