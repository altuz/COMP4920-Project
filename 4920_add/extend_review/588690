,Recommended,588690,30806614,Posted: 28 March,all,DiablosDungeon,"Peace, Death! is a fun arcade game where you play as a Grim Reaper and sentence clients to either Heaven (Right), Hell (Left), or Purgatory (Down).The game is all about analyzing each client and observing their attributes before giving them their sentence. Demons and murderers go to Hell, non-threatening humans go to Heaven, etc.The game mixes things up as clients start wearing accessories and carrying objects that need to be examined (by clicking on them). Sometimes they will drop the object, or the object might have been covering an important trait of theirs. For example, removing a hat might reveal devil horns, which means that you should sentence this client to Hell.There are also random mini games that happen as you play to break the repetition of the standard game. The mini games are a bit hit and miss. Explanations are vague at best, so it is really up to the player to figure out how to complete each one.Players who liked ""Papers, Please"" will probably get a good kick out of this game. High-speed sentencing of clients can become repetitive, but it also tests your endurance, so it becomes up to the player to keep their focus or suffer the consequences.The game isn't too long, and I was able to beat it in roughly 3 hours. I don't really see myself playing it again, but it was a good time while it lasted."
,Recommended,588690,33402532,Posted: 9 July,all,Biscuitkzh,"Peace, Death! is a fast paced, increasing difficulty based game where you play as a Reaper who's forced to work for Death itself when he figures he needs some cash real bad.Your job starts off nice and easy, you just have to send your clients to Heaven, Hell or Purgatory. This task only gets harder as you move forward, with the game throwing at you more and more details to pay attention to, distractions, mini-games, and whatnot.The controls are really raw: furious clicking and WASD are going to be your best friends.The somewhat pixelated art style is quite neat, and mixes well with the colours of the game.The dialogues are simple but fun and the game is pretty much filled with quotes and references from other videogames, tv shows, movies, and such, which make the experience very enjoyable and will also make you go ""OmgwherehaveIseenthisbeforeImustremember"".The rock/metal creepy soundtrack is also a really remarkable feature of this game. What's better than condamning people while angry guitars and drums play in the background?It is relatively short but if you like tryharding and really wanna up your Reaper game then its replay value acquires a whole new spirit.Sending people to hell has never been this hard."
,Recommended,588690,31170957,Posted: 15 April,all,➨Wifey,"Oh, man.Man, oh man.Let me tell you why you should play with great game.Peace, Deathis a brilliant, cameo-filled, pop culture clicker game with enough great references, nice character designs, and funny dialogue to keep anyone's attention. It keeps you engaged with fast-paced decision making, as well as the aforementioned silliness that almost never gets old.You're the judge of judges, sending your targets to Heaven or Hell (maybe more), because youwanted a snack, and your fridge was empty. You take up a position with Apocalypse Inc, who is responsible for the aforementioned. Under Death, Famine, War, and Pestilence, you need to keep calm with catastophes galore - I'm not going to spoil too much. You'll figure it you.There's enough achievements to keep you entertained and busy, and from what I've seen, I don't think I'll get bored of this game for a while.I've not had this much fun with a $5.00 game since my last review of that Neko Sim.But, this game is ten times more awesome. Hands down. I don't know how else to express that.If you're reading this to make a decision on a purchase,buy this.You won't regret it."

,Recommended,588690,31996850,Posted: 27 May,all,beano,Cool little game. Reminds me of Papers Please. The english could use some work though. It is a little broken and can be difficult to understand even as a native speaker.
,Recommended,588690,33441731,Posted: 10 July,all,Mobius,"Peace, Death! is a really fun, fast paced game.It reminds me of papers please, but is much faster, more light hearted and more humorous. In this game you play as a reaper who is new to the job. You judge whether people should go to heaven or hell (and later purgatory) based on their features. Are they clean? To heaven! Puddle of blood, horn, glowing red eyes? TO HELL! Progression is clear and the difficulty curve is very reasonable. The game takes place over the course of several weeks, and each work day a new feature is added, thereby increasing the difficulty. This part of the game was well explained. However, I did experience some confusion when I encountered the four horsemen and fate. If they were tutorialized at all, I missed it completely. From what I've been able to gather, there are four horsemen, though you only work for one: Death. He and the other horsemen, famine, war, and pestilence, will sometimes have offers for you where you can gain and lose favor with each of them. Until the very end of the game, I thought I had to keep all of their influence as balanced as possible. At the end however, I found out that your score is (partially) calculated by taking your favor score with Death, and subtracting your influence with the other horsemen. I feel that this could have been explained at the start of the game. Also, in my opinion these special deals should only appear after a few days so that a new player isn't confused by them.Regarding Fate: To this day I have absolutely no idea what the character Fate does. He showed up once. I picked one of the cards he presented to me, then he left never to appear again. Once again, a little explanation would be appreciated here.Overall I think this game is great, and I had a lot of fun playing it.I would give this game a 7.5 / 10"

,Recommended,588690,30701412,Posted: 24 March,all,heatherjrock,"I've been watching the development of this game for a while and am happy that it's finally been released. It feels weird to say it's a more light-hearted ""Papers, Please"" but that's exactly what it feels like. You play as a Reaper who gets to dictate who gets into heaven and who must be sent to hell, and each passing day means there are more qualifiers that will exclude people from heaven (one day it might be horns, the next day it might be blood on their shirts, etc). Keep up with the pace and funnel people into the correct elevators within the time limit and you'll earn enough money for food (a reaper's gotta eat, right?). And the people say hilarious comments from time to time, so it's best to stick around and read them while you can (like one demon bemoaning the Winchesters, lol). Would recommend :)"

76561198274731934,Not Recommended,588690,32793524,Posted: 25 June,all,mimu,"Personally, I really like the game. Games where you have to follow a certain type of rules to win and it gets harder are really fun and you can have quick play sessions when you are bored or it can completely suck you in for many days.A big heads up though for people who are thinking of getting the game!! There is a part in the game where you have to judge people to hell for suicide. Fair point the game is about black humor and a nod to the old religious text what I understood, but if you are really uncomfortable about suicide in this context I wouldn't recommend this game to you. If you didn't know about this before playing you might get a really strong reaction when the rule shows up. (I had one and jumped to conclusions.)This review is more of a neutral than negative. I can see that it wants to be a light-hearted fun game but it's not very sensitive. I had a small conversation with the developer and he seems like a good guy so the rule is not out of ill intent or anything. I still think there should be a small notice that the game includes such a controversial topic as suicide in a joking manner so people know what they are getting into.It's a super cool fun game though and I think I'm gonna keep playing it now that I have gotten some of my worries out of the way."
,Recommended,588690,33593556,Posted: 16 July,all,Monster Watches You,"My new favourite game! You play as Reaper, a rather charismatic little guy who just wants to eat. Seeing that his fridge, and pockets, are empty, Reaper takes it upon himself to get a job! He gets hired by Death, assigned to sort out who goes to Hell and who goes to Heaven. It get increasingly challenging for Reaper as Death continues to point out more and more things that make people get sent to Hell. Not only is Death there, but he is accompanied by the other three horsemen of the apocalypse (Pestilence, Famine and War) who also need to hire Reaper for tasks here and there. I recommend this game for anyone looking for an entertaining and slightly dark indie game to pass the time setting new records."

The gameplay is similar to Papers Please, while also unique enough to match the amazing theme of sending people to Hell or to Heaven. The music is great, the art is great, overall it's very polished and well worth it's price."
,Recommended,588690,33727510,Posted: 22 July,all,malaisling,"A good looking and well designed game about memory, observation and consistency. Although it is somewhat difficult to get a grasp of it from the preview media of the game, it is about players clicking to send beings to Heaven, Hell and Purgatory. Players have a list of things that dictate who goes where, and various exceptions which change where they go based on certain factors. The game is centred on the player quickly inspecting each being and then making a decision about where they go, it all being about how consistent the player can be with keeping up the standard of accuracy without making too many mistakes.The animations, artwork and music are all nice. There is a new rule added to the game every single level, and even minigames that occur during the levels. There even numerous different models for beings themselves.At times, certain clothing articles and objects the player has to keep out for are somewhat vague. It is only vary specific models of certain sunglasses that look somewhat like eyes, or medieval alchohol bottles that don't blatantly look like alchohol bottles at first. Which causes some mistakes to be made, but over the course of the entire game this only happened maybe three times so it's not a persistent issue. The game also doesn't tell the player certain things which they really should know, like what the influence system for the Four Horsemen is even meant to be for. The grammar for the game in English seems to be, strange, but completely readable all the same.The only places the game really has problems is in its at times cruel and offencive sense of humor, referencing blatantly popular Youtube Let's Players who are already extremely well known so seeing them idolized in games is just obnoxious and unprofessional at this point; and the lack of an outro cutscene was pretty disappointing since the game had an introductory one.Although the game has some really neat looking character models, and Reaper is one of the most adorable things ever.The game itself is well worth the price for a couple hours of initial playing, although players that are more interested in this kind of gauntlet-of-not-making-mistakes challenge will likely get more out of it then some others."

But so far into the game everything feels polished enough.The simplistic gameplay is appreciated, For what it is, But what at first seems simple soon gets harder when more elements are introduced. That said its still a bit simple from what i have seen.Art: art-wise there are simply nothing worthy to complain about. The game has pretty nice color-palette, With nice pixel stylish looks.Music and audio: I have nothing to complained about, So far. I like the soundtrack enough to buy it.Fun: Yes so far it has been rather fun, Filled with plenty of referneces, I cracked up when i sent a jew to hell, It was not on purpose and right after sent hanibal lecter up to heaven."

,Not Recommended,588690,33547614,Posted: 14 July,all,vaustein,"'Peace, Death!' takes inspiration from Lukas Pope's excellent 'Papers, Please' but with a more cartoonish humor and much faster pace. I enjoyed the game thoroughly until the introduction of ""psycho paper"" silhouettes, which are comparable to the ""Most Wanted criminals"" bulletins toward the conclusion of 'Papers, Please'. If 'Peace, Death!' were sold only for touch-based devices such as smartphones and tablets, this would be a plus. However, having to move the mouse frantically from the soul being inspected over to the psycho papers interferes with the otherwise fast and smooth pace of the game. Also, the other functions - Send to Heaven, Send to Hell, Send to Purgatory - have configurable keyboard mappings. Why isn't there at least a hotkey to display the psycho pages? Although it may be a minor design issue in itself, the effect on the last few stages of the game is palpable and disappointing."

At first i thought it was quite quirky and funny. Then i thought it was fun. Then i thought it was slighty repetitive, but fun and original....then after i boxed off my video, i went to bed... then i came back down to my PC put the game back on and bacame an ""Eye of Sauron"". The fact that there is so much positive feedback already maybe maks my little review moot, but i fel i should still add my 10 cents.The game can be synopsised as thus You are Death. Your job is to either send people to Heaven, hell or Purgatory. Each day, oyur boss gives you more difficult perameters to work with, and you have a time limit wit which to use to decide who goes to hell, and who goes upstairs. Among the dead are some faces i sure recognised (Jason Mews and Kevin smith, anyone?).
