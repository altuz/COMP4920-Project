76561198064050389,Recommended,588730,32276947,Posted: 8 June,all,Jxt09,"The funniest trivia game I've ever played!There are these little quick stories where a character wishes for something (a girl to like them, etc) and a witch appears offering them a deal.  Answer 10 questions then the wheel of fortune will spin and if it falls on a question you got correct (green cirle) then the character gets the happy ending, if it falls on a question you got wrong (red square), then the character gets the bad ending.  Sometimes that means death!There are a lot of charcter's and their stories, and a ton of questions.  I don't think I've ever had a repeat question yet.  Oh, and some characters have multiple segements to their story.  Like a gamer wants to make money videoing himself playing for youtube, and if you get his good ending he does that.  Then in another scenario he's a success but is bored with it and wants something (can't remember) and the witch appears to give him another 10 questions.Each story is quick (depending on how much time you spend thinking about the questions) and the visual presentation is like cards with the images printed on them and someone is quickly putting a new one up as you go through the dialogue, and there's a whoosh sound to accompany it.  Very nice presentation, I like it.Music is whimsical, sound effects are good.Price ?  Seems fair to me (I lucked out with a 90% off coupon, heh) but you can make up your own mind.  I've played 4 hours and have not done everything yet.There are achievements, and trading cards. (YAY!)Game also is LGBT friendly, with at least one character gay (a girl).Only one thing I dislike is questions on anime, since I haven't watched any in 6 years and don't know anything about current series.  But you do have the option to set that category as ""infrequent"" so those questions won't appear very often.Can't think of anything else, so feel free to ask questions because I probably forgot something."
,Recommended,588730,32860068,Posted: 27 June,all,Toost Inc.,"Very short, a lot of fun.Making Trivia games fun is hard even in multiplayer settings, and this game definitely suceeds at that.The questions range from very easy to mopderate; it'll still throw you some very niche subject matter making a perfect streak a reasonable challenge, but with the luck based mechanic that isn't a requirement.The real star of this game are its characters and their stories though, I honestly don't see how you could make a single player trivia game any fun without those.All in all, definitely worth buying, and I wish they release some new stories through DLC or something."

,Recommended,588730,31866935,Posted: 20 May,all,Kimchi Tea,"A quiz game based around short, sometimes interconnected character vignettes. Simple, cute art style with diverse character appearances. The quiz questions are generally phrased in a way that helps you make an educated guess even if you don't know the answer, and you can adjust the frequency of different topics.My favorite thing about the game is that losing isn't just a game over, or even always a bad end for the character, but sometimes leads you to new and interesting storylines. In a game that's ostensibly about getting the right answers, there's more than one right answer. Even visual novels that are all about story often can't manage that. I love it."

76561198025156523,Recommended,588730,32791414,Posted: 25 June,all,Sydust,"I watched the trailer for this game and knew immediately that I had to have it. And I was not disappointed. I loved it so much that I might buy it for all of my friends. It's funny, silly, heartwarming, and heartbreaking. I immediately felt endeared to these characters and invested in their stories, lending stakes to a trivia game that I've never experienced before. Wrong answers felt like a betrayal to an old woman, a young child, or a woman trying to get her life back on track. I finished this game in one sitting and am looking forward to more playthroughs to see alternate stoylines.One note: I don't watch anime and was getting the anime answers almost entirely wrong, but was relieved to find out that I could turn down how often they appear in settings. There are options for other categories if anyone is having similar problems!"
,Recommended,588730,30984206,Posted: 6 April,all,Stend,"You want trivia with fun little stories? You got it with Majotori then.This is basically the game:A witch named Lariat with a complete obsession with trivia goes out asking questions to people who wish for help of any kind. She gets the satisfaction of playing while, whoever she plays with, get the help they need – if they succeed that is!Every story has some sort of consequence – either positive or negative, depending on if you fail or succeed a round of questions. All rounds have 9 questions and in the end a spin of roulette will determent the outcome.All the questions come from 4 different subjects – all which can be changed in options from “frequent” to “infrequent”.This game is absolutely relaxing with no clock ticking down your neck. Yes, this does also mean that you can cheat your way to a better success rate – but that doesn’t matter, because in the end, you will still learn from the questions and end up being a little smarter than before. If that’s not worth it, then I don’t know what is.It’s all made in a very simple art style, but it completely works and with the music it really comes together.“You wished to be entertained – and I made it happen”- You sure did! I’m glad I tried this game out and will differently recommend it."
,Recommended,588730,33497728,Posted: 13 July,all,Jazz,"Probably the cutest game of russian trivia roulette ever!With the same potential to destroy lives, so there's that.Honestly, this game was a lot more entertaining than I was expecting it to be. The fast-paced animation doubled with the quirky artstyle of the game keeps the transitions between narratives smooth and from getting repetitive. The only real con is that I now have an obligation to actually start watching anime so I can stop screwing up so many lives (I'm sorry Ava!) because there are a ton of trivia questions revolving around that - Honestly, my Biology Final was easier to guess on. And although you can change the frequency of the topics in your settings, there are only four categories to begin with but a fun trivia game nonetheless.tl;dr : Be awesome at trivia and make dreams come true. Win/Win"

,Recommended,588730,33681460,Posted: 20 July,all,Welshcake,"This is the best and most fun trivia game that you can ever play.There are such stories that will break your heart, make you smile, make you laugh, warm your heart.And the thing is, you WILL feel horrible about the wrong answers.Because you get so into such short stories SO quickly, it will make you feel responsible.And the questions are in my opinion, are quite challenging if you're not a huge anime viewer, I mean I do but there were questions that were from the series that I haven't even heard of!But you can toggle the anime questions down and increase others as well, that is an option.Art is very unique and simple but yet very entertaining.Soundtrack is limited but I think it suits the game perfectly.I just finished playing it once but since there are 1000+ questions, I will play the game again! I just love trivia and quirky stuff.And, I'm sorry old man, I've killed you. It broke my heart.Great game, get it."
,Recommended,588730,34627846,Posted: 31 August,all,SomeGeekyGirl,"I really loved this game. I don't think I could say enough about how enjoyable I found it. Yes, the questions are aimed mostly at newer anime, cartoons, or movies (and some of them are quite obscure), but I enjoyed the challenge. I do wish there was more range to the miscellaneous questions, but I loved that you could customize what types of questions were asked.That said, the best part of this game is not the trivia, it's definitely the neat little storylines that were strangely engaging, quirky, and morbid. I loved them - the suddenness and cruelness of losing a game, the randomness of spinning after answering the questions, and the surprisingly tender moments.The animation is pretty flippin' awesome, and there's girls kissing witches. Definitely recommended."

It does have some hard questions from time to time, but you don't have to worry about failing questions so much. At the end of the round, you still have a chance to win the story. There isn't a time limit if you want to cheat and look up answers too, but I think it's more fun to test your knowledge."

YAY!!!You are trying to win these trivia rounds to help these characters get their wish.  You lose the round, the character could lose their life.  You care about winning or losing and are excited to find out what happens next to the characters.  The music and characters and artwork really bring it all together nicely. The rounds take just 10 min or so to play and watch the story happen.  Its a good game in short bursts, or you can easily stay up all night playing. Grab some friends for help on the trivia.It takes about 3 hours to play through all the story-lines.  Then you can reset and try to win the trivia rounds for the characters you lost last time through.  You can even play a ""just trivia"" mode.If you are looking for a single night party game to play with your ""geeky"" trivia loving friends, this will do nicely."
76561198020067850,Recommended,588730,32247827,Posted: 7 June,all,Osselpi,"Excuse me but I have to write this out loud:THIS GAME IS AWESOME.Yes, that's a highly subjective assessment, but let me tell you why I already love it after playing it just for a little while. Of course, this short review contains SPOILERS, so be aware of that before continuing to read my thoughts.Running on the Unity engine (and being proof that there ARE good games using Unity) the graphics are kept simple still. Possibly there could be more (shadows, lights and all that) but this game doesn't need it, as it works great with its simplistic, fun and cartoonish style. If you haven't seen pictures or a trailer, think of South Park but slightly different. Being quiz-themed you'll very often encounter text boxes flying in but there's way more well done ""retro pixel art"" in this game than one might assume at first. Depending on which ""story"" you're playing there are some simple and yet captivating backdrops, urban scenery or even stuff in space. I'm still a sucker for nice ""old school"" game art, and the graphics in this game work extremely well for me.Sound? There isn't too much. You'll mostly hear the ""Swoosh"" and ""Woosh"" sounds when the text boxes or parts of the scenery pop up. We have a few music tracks; the main one looping constantly but changing here and there according to the scene. Nothing ground breaking imho but it fits the theme. The main song is a little carefree, joyful tune complementing the quiz-show theme quite nicely.Settings? You have the possibility to change the volume of music and the sounds, adjusting the occurrence of the different question categories or - as one might want to do - altering the resolution of the game or enabling/disabling fullscreen. You can switch the language too, of course.Gameplay? Yeah, how's that going to be in a quiz-themed game? Of course, you'll see a lot of the aforementioned text boxes confronting the player with the questions which are all multiple choice with four possible answers. However, before each round the player can choose whose story he wants to influence; there is a wide range of protagonists like a firewoman, a baseball player, an old lady or even a dog. Yes. A. Dog. Awesome! They are all facing a challenge or alive with a strong desire which is where Lariat the Witch comes in. She offers to fulfill their wishes but ONLY if they beat her in a quiz. The penalty for failing said quiz would be bad consequences which range from mildly sad (the wish simply doesn't come true; a student fails his exam, stuff like that) to extremely catastrophic (a person dies).The developer included an interesting array of questions into the game, spanning from video games to books, TV/movies/cinema, anime/manga and miscellanious other areas of expertise. I'd say it is mainly aimed at ""geeks"", ""nerds"", ""weird guys"" - you know. Us people, playing Dungeons & Dragons with pen & paper, us listening to J-Rock and Visual Kei, us who're delving deeper into science fiction than any other person. We, that are still reading Perry Rhodan books. You got the idea, right?Each question gives either a ""hit"" or a ""miss""; every correct answer increasing your chance that the wish of the protagonist coming true while every wrong answer is increasing the chance of a disastrous outcome. After the end of each ""lap"" your correct and incorrect answers will get arranged into a circle and then it's ""Wheel of Fortune"". Hitting a red ""X"" (wrong answer) will end up bad while hitting a green ""O"" means the wish will be fulfilled. According to the outcome of this ""spin"" the story will take a different outcome, either good or bad. Yeah, I know this description sounds weird but if you've seen it once you'll see it is a very simple concept.The depicted ituations range widely from your usual everyday stuff (job, school, things people do) to fantasy/writing (scenes from Romeo & Juliet for example) or ""historical situations"" (a princess wants to be married to the man of her choice).Some things I'd also like to mention:* A lot of the stories (all of them?) are ""multi stage"", so you can probably experience stages of the whole life of our protagonists.* You don't have a time limit, so you can take your time answering.* There are two save states. I think that might be important for some of you?* Oh noes, the game might be displaying same sex affairs! :OOO If that's a problem for you, y'know you could always go back to the dark ages ;). Pardon my wicked tongue.How did I get the game? I didn't know about it but I crafted a badge and got a 50% coupon for it. Thank heavens and hell for that coupon or I would've missed a great title at least for a longer time than necessary.What's there left to say? I enjoy it and will continue enjoying it, even play it with some friends or family members alternating for every character whose story we're going to influence. For 5,99€ it is a lot of fun, however if you're not as big on Quizzes like I am you might wait for a coupon or grab it in a sale. Seeing how enjoyable the game is, I think 5,99€ are absolutely okay.As of now, I don't know if the ""1000+"" questions will be enough in the long term, but with the possibility of patches or DLC there could always be more coming our way. I'd love having the option to put your own questions into the game, although I doubt that this might get added. Would make my day though. My year even.Thanks for reading,Ossel"

It's an awesome game, get it. Also, really good price and good for passing time."
76561198009305923,Recommended,588730,30841307,Posted: 30 March,all,JoJoestar,"Really neat cool little game.The premise of using trivia questions to determine the outcome of the stories is both original and engaging. Even though it's a single player game I feel like it could work really well as a party game or a game to play with other people watching, which also makes it a very good choice if you are into streaming using platforms like Twitch and such. The art style is simple but recognizable and the music does a good job selling the tone. If you like messing around stories in a simillar way to games like Reigns do, this is for you.This was the seriously objective and non-biased review, but who cares for that?Do you like good videogames? Of course you do!Do you like excellent gameplay? Yes? Just as I thought!Are you bored by all those other videogames where the only thing you need to do is learn complex mechanics and develop skills related to them? Yeah, I am too.What you need in your life is this thing, let me tell ya. This is the truest test, the realest of challenges. Here your reflexes and actual skill don't mean anything, what matters is YOUR VERY SELF. The knowledge you have accumulated up to this point is what will make all those cute little animals live or die.Really, buy this game, it's not like I am friends with the developers or anything."
,Recommended,588730,30864745,Posted: 31 March,all,Cobos!,"Majotori is a game I thought I'd like, but it has honestly surpassed my expectations. Characters are cool and have extremely diverse desires and motivations, which made me want to keep playing and find out more about their stories. Some were heartwarming and cute; others suffered dark and brutal destinies if I wasn't able to get Lariat to help them.My only issue with the game was that I got too many questions about Japanese animation (and anime protagonists' hair colors). Fortunately the devs included a nice option to change the frequency of some question topics, so I was able to tune this and get an experience that felt fairer. After this little tweak, I liked a lot of the questions the game asked. They're fun, you can learn from them and sometimes they'll make you feel a little stupid (that's good).Another cool thing about Majotori is that it can be a really cool gift. It looks cool and should be intuitive enough for anyone to play, no matter how much experience they may have with other videogames. It's also quite cheap and one playthrough takes less than two hours, so nobody has to commit a lot of their money or time to it.Majotori is fun, refreshing, engaging, didactic, and many other nice adjectives. Buy it and play it."

The game concept is great, and I like the way it is set up. The animations are cute and go well with the fun music. The problem itself is the trivia and the consequences of missing questions.First of all, a total of four categories; one being completely ambiguous, is not an ideal way to make a game in which the main focus is trivia. Second, whenver it lands on ""something bad happening"" most of time it is dull or straight up morbid, which really bothered me. Just because I missed a question about an anime I didn't know about deserves an old lady having a heart attack and dying? The game makes you feel guilty, and don't give me that ""just get gud"" because you and I both know that we've missed questions.I've been a fan of anime for several years now so I went into it beliving I would be pretty dang good, only to be bombarded with a bunch of new/ weird anime i've never even heard of. not ALL questions are like this, obviously, but i'd say at least 70% are catered toward a younger more mainstream anime fan. Overall it's just a frustrating game for someone who watches jeopardy all the time going in expecting to do well, only to end up screwed over with a horrid or tragic ending of a character based on my ""failure"". If you're fine with missing 3 questions and the spinning to start for it to trick you onto a X and get screwed over, then this is just the best game ever.EDIT: For people not finding this review helpful, leave a comment. Tell me why."

Why are they here? I'd recommend it if there's ever an expansion to the trivia base, but for now it's a little too niche."

The art style makes all of the characters look cute and innocent but even grandma is a cold blooded killer...How do you determine who lives or who dies?! 9 trivia questions from a diverse pool spanning multiple genres and interests and then once you answer all 9 your rights and wrongs are tallied up and a wheel spins that has nine sections corresponding to the questions you got right or wrong, which leaves a feeling of uncertanity once it spins because even if you got 8/9 correct the wheel could still land on the one wrong one which lends itself to a love-hate relationship with the game"

The manner in which the stories are incorporated into the series of trivia is quite possibly the most unique approach, and the questions themselves never cease to amuse me.Although I find it difficult to answer all the categories correctly, the satisfaction of being able to get the right ones (especially those pertinent to any movie or anime I've enjoyed watching), coupled with the intriguing twists to the somewhat ""generic"" stories is more than sufficient to keep me playing the game."
