I actually found a few levels that were significantly more difficult than anything Zup! ever threw at me. Level design is nice with no real bugs or issues with physics.Overall, the game is fun for those on the completionist/achievement hunting trail. It's just different enough from Zup! to make it not seem like a carbon copy. Not a whole lot of time to be spent on this game, probably under half an hour for most gamers, less if you're used to Zup!"

This game actually feels like a more polished version of ZUP, so I feel this is even better.As per ZUP, you unlock an♥♥♥♥♥load of achievements, but with a slightly harder difficulty, making them that much more rewarding to obtain.

I got this game as the Zup! games only for achievements and trading cards.BADThe main reason behind this rating is that it is 90% if not more the same as the Zup! games. I hate when someone copies the ideas of other people, I simply H-A-T-E it. 5/10 just to give it a positive rating, also a note to the developer - your achievements don't count until you close the game. It may be the bug on my side or something, but it's how it went for me. I completed the game, then checked the achivements - 0, closed the game ba-yam got them all at once."

Despite its 'Mostly Positive' rating along with moans about it being nothing more than a clone; this game is very good on its own merit.The only significant difference being, instead of exploding blocks to instigate the physics; you click to remove them one by one to land the blue cube in the zone. The puzzles here are far more interactive and responsive when compared to Zup! and may require you to perform several moves to complete the level which includes timing and complete precision.The game isn't a huge challenge but there are some great puzzles within the 60-odd levels that will take roughtly 45 minutes to finish. With 201 achievements and trading cards; it's a great little purchase and a sequel would be more than welcome."

More puzzles at higher difficulty and require more well-thought out planning and timing.  This title is for those who enjoyedZup!and either wanted more achievement rain or for a harder difficulty.  Complaining thatOikis just a rip-off is like sayingEvolandripped offFinal Fantasywhen both are respectable in their own right (the former being a tribute inspired by the production of another game).If you wantOik, I'd say you should spring for the bundle which will save you money, though if eachOikgame was  $0.25-$0.50, you'll find yourself entertained and challenged while enjoying a card drop to sell.

,Not Recommended,588970,29979519,Posted: 17 February,all,Applekid,"Its a shame there isn't a midle ground option on the recommendation. That's what I would give it. For the 80 cents or whatever I paid it has been decentish. Its nowhere near as fun or satisfying as ZUP which this game is trying so hard to emulate. Since I can't give a middle ground it automatically goes to a thumbs down.Get it if you are an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥, don't if you aren't."

,Recommended,588970,32339937,Posted: 11 June,all,Ted,"Very short (~70mins) very cheap (<£1) but good fun simple physics puzzle game. Get the blue block to the blue platform and eliminate the red blocks. Nothing too taxing here but still got a couple of ""ooohs"" out of me as I worked out what to do to get my blue block to propel itself across the screen towards it's destination and the solution."
,Recommended,588970,32433747,Posted: 15 June,all,Loc,"Not a huge physics puzzle game fan but I actually enjoyed this one. Nice design, levels reset quickly when you fail to let you get right back into the puzzle and for the price the amount of puzzle is sufficient. Good value for money."
76561198355036865,Recommended,588970,32573741,Posted: 19 June,all,SealieP,"Oik is a really cute simple puzzle game.  Some may say it's a rip off of another game, but I've played these type of games for decades.  You simple have to remove blocks or planks in the right order to have your blue block on the final board.  There's a bunch of levels and each level has three achievements.  Just completing the game yields all the achievements, no hidden random 1,000 hours connected and you might have a rare chance to get something that if you click on it fast enough and then get another rare random success roll then you can complete the achievements.  It didn't take me long to finish the game at all.  If you get stuck there are guides that will give you all the solutions.I got it on sale and can't really complain.  I do wish it had a windowed mode which it doesn't or I couldn't find it looking at all the controls.  I enjoyed the game the entire time I played it.  I put the music on in the end and found that rather enjoyable too.  I'll probably play it a few more times here and there when I have a few minutes to kill and want to relax and unwind.  If you can get it on sale there is no reason not to get it.  At full price you may find it goes a little too quick, but it's not overpriced by any stretch of the imagination.  It just depends on your means level."

It took me just under 2 hours to complete both of the games, so don't buy expecting hours upon hours of gameplay. (I personally just bought it for the achievements)Yeah go ahead and buy it, you can't really go wrong."
,Not Recommended,588970,32582729,Posted: 19 June,all,thelonefefe,"Sooo... these 0.9 hours are what it took me to finish and unlock every achievment in this game...I'm not saying it's a bad game, pretty fun actually. The physics are quite nice and understandable and I feel like each puzzle has multiple ways of completion and that's interesting but it simply isnt enough. I know its only like 99 cents, and I shouldn't expect much, but I've paid less for much more; it seems like the're streching one game over the 3 games in the series."

,Recommended,588970,33208786,Posted: 3 July,all,Mr. Ethical,"Don't get me wrong, I personally think this game is bad and only exists for achievement showcase.Some puzzles are too simplistic, there's no progression, and ""so clever that you only need 1 click"" at some parts. Some are even timing-related which I never consider as puzzles in puzzle games.But hey, it's a buck (64 cents when I got it) so it's not bad of a value"
