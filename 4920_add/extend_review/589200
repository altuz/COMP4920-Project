I'd love to have seen this fleshed out into an epic RPG, ala Stygian Abyss... as it is, it's still really good.Definity worth $8"
,Recommended,589200,31686101,Posted: 11 May,all,Exyborg,"This is a phenomenal game! It's a labyrinth exploration game that most definitely continues to scare me when I realize that I took a wrong turn. The atmosphere is incredibly tense with a variety of ways to not only scare you but to just creep you out. There is a main storyline which is well put together and generates random labyrinths each time. By doing this, you'll really never know what to expect in the next area if you happen to die in the midst of exploration. You can also simply generate a random map to explore which will tell you of your progress in detail after your death or escape. Because this game is created to produce a different experience every time, it has great replay value and will pay for itself without question! Definitely one of the best horror games I've ever experienced!"

I'm not afraid to play the game, but it's quite challenging to keep my cool, even after putting some time into it.Many members of my family cannot play for more than a minute or two before bailing out.Looking for a scary VR game with replay value?  Buy Dreadhalls.  Don't wait for a sale.  Buy it now."

Once upon a time, I owned an S7 Edge and Gear VR. This was my favourite game. Sadly, when the screen shattered on my S7 Edge from a two foot drop, I moved on to a different device and had to say goodbye to Dreadhalls.Now Dreadhalls is available on the Vive and WOW, it's even better when you are moving about in room scale! This is a near perfect game. The only thing I wish could be changed, is the movement system -- I'd much prefer teleportation than walking. Walking leads to motion sickness with extended play. Otherwise, this was money well spent. Thanks again for a terrific game!"

Then stood right in the doorway I was trying to go down. Behind me is a much larger hallway with a giant hairless rat walking it so it was a no go that way.Shadow as shole proceeds to have a door closing opening contest with me for as long as i care to keep trying to close it. I get pretty fed up trying to close it and turn around face to face with mrs ring like lady. flipped my vive off my face and quit. That is where im at, not really feeling the balls to continue yet"

Get killed by her and restart.  I think, ""oh that wasn't scary"" and I laugh about it.  Open another door to find her there again.  Think that I'll just run away and be fine, it's just her.

,Recommended,589200,34185435,Posted: 12 August,all,Johnnyhoboy,Been following this game for a while now. Definitely worth picking up to add to your VR horror library! Gives me the Amnesia chills everytime I play or when I show it to friends

I felt actually terrified and didn't wan to look around corners and stuff. The audio is also so ♥♥♥♥ing good, sometimes I did not want to open the next door as I was absolutely horrifed. I died to one of the creatures after running and screaming for my life, haven't put the game back on since. 10/10."

This is powerful stuff I tell you. I ended up hating having to look around because I nearly always ended up facing this black swirly mist and those two eyes staring at you. Just freaked the hell out of me. This is like a next-gen ghost train ride but worse.. MUCH worse. After finding the second 'eye' I had to take a break. Was too much for me. Now I know what it's like to be a big wuss. Hugely recommended and hoping they do a follow up or sequel. Toilet paper at the ready. Do NOT buy if you scare easily, you have been warned!"
,Recommended,589200,30430201,Posted: 10 March,all,SweViver,"Wow, truly one of the best VR survival horror games out for the HTC Vive! Check out my first VR gameplay, also with Mixed Reality view, in this video below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoV43t-MaJkMy short video ""review"" speaks for itself, but I have to add that that I´m amazed about Dreadhalls - its a lovely VR horror experience with beautiful graphics, perfect sounds and music that adds to the immersion and gives the game a creepy feeling from the first minute of your gameplay. Controls are perfect with FREE LOCOMOTION - no teleporting needed - and the control system itself with Vive controller tracking and room scale support works just lovely.I have only played for around an hour so far, but already almost sh*t my pants a few times - the jumpscare scenes are great, but the best part is that the game is scary even when nothing is happening for the moment - and that's how a good VR horror game should work. Its all about the atmostphere, sence of presence and immersion in the game.All in all, I just love Dreadhalls so far - and I would recommend this to anyone out there with a Vive! Price is low, so its definately a must-buy if you enjoy horror games - and if you dare to play them of course :)CheersSweViver"

But after playing the game I can certainly say the game has a sense of uneasiness which is something I look for in a horror game.....I found myself just trying to find the fastest way out instead of exploring but a lot of the times I got lost which gave you a sense of fear....it is a simple game audio and graphics are good but they have succeeded in giving me that horror feeling..
,Recommended,589200,30439766,Posted: 10 March,all,Skrunder,"Wow! I have been following this game since the early days that oculus was in development, This game is hands down the best vr indie horror experience you can get for the vive/oculus today I love how they added room scale and motion controllers makes the immersion 100 times better!"

,Recommended,589200,33870166,Posted: 28 July,all,mentatparadigm,"Horror is one of those things that's tough to quantify. What makes one person wet their drawers elicits yawns from another. But this is definitely a game that I think most people will find genuinely scary.Despite having graphics that look like they were designed for a cellphone (they were), Dreadhalls utilizes several very clever tricks and design elements to create one of the scariest experiences I've ever played. I'm wary of overhyping the scare factor for anyone who might be interested in buying this but I honestly cannot remember the last time a game made me jump or scream and this game has made me do both several times. Best of all, it doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares like several AAA titles I can think of.The minute-to-minute gameplay is reminiscent of old school dungeon crawlers only without combat. Instead, be prepared to run. Or sometimes to stand perfectly still. Or maybe avoid looking at the enemy. Oooor don't look away. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead.I don't want to say any more for fear of giving away the surprises but the level of immersion and the feeling of presence this game achieves is top-notch and it deftly avoids the trap many horror games fall into of having the same enemy type repeat over and over. Horror games tend to lose their chill factor once you figure out all the rules that the AI abides by; I still haven't worked out how some of these enemies behave and I'm not itching to have enough encounters with them to do so.The levels are randomly generated each time you play so you never become too familiar with your surroundings. If you die, you have to go back to the start of the area you're currently in and the map resets. You also have the option of loading up a random map from the main menu, which gives the game a good amount of replayability. This is definitely one of the VR games you'll want to show your friends when they come over."
76561197969372252,Recommended,589200,30431366,Posted: 10 March,all,Esge,"I had this for the Samsung Gear and loved it then.The graphics are great with good options in the menu for sampling. It ran great on mine on the higher settings - GTX970. The sound is incredibly creepy with whispering and fantastic ambience throughout.Being on the Vive, it just feels so much better. The game makes excellent use of the controllers and gives you turning options in the menu (which can be accessed from within the game) so as to combat any motion sickness issues. The locomotion is the standard non-teleportation method but it works well. I recommend trying the movement on the left trackpad only and use your head to look. You can also set the forward movement to go where you're looking and this will help if you get any sickness.There's enough variety and longevity for the low price and I highly recommend grabbing this. It is one of the most terrifying games available and isn't all about jump scares."
,Recommended,589200,30434503,Posted: 10 March,all,bplee93,"This is a terrifying game, and the fact that it's in VR makes it a lot scarier. It runs great too, on max settings i'm only using between 2 and 3 gigs of Vram and about 7 to 8 gigs of normal ram to run it smoothly. This is a must own for VR gaming."

76561197988533180,Recommended,589200,30424014,Posted: 10 March,all,Shovelface,"Freshly blazed, 5:30am, alone. Just failed my first attempt at playing this game. First few doors were chill, but then it was like being inside my worst nightmare. The atmosphere is haunting, the sound strips all sense of comfort. What really got me was the pacing of the jump-scares, which are plentiful, but not cheap like some other games. There was a continuous string of terror that connected one to the next that made the calmest moments some of the hardest, because you just expected worst.Only a few minutes in, but 10/10 as far as what this game is supposed to do - scare the fooking shet out of you"
76561198107474353,Recommended,589200,30498972,Posted: 13 March,all,smellypie24,"This game is pretty well made. But some of the NPCs get stuck on walls and such, which sometimes ruins the moment for me. The graphics aren't that great either, but its the VR experience that actually makes the game scary. Like being able to turn around and see someone behind you, that scares the hell out of me. No VR horror games do horror this good. I definitely recommend this for $10."
,Recommended,589200,34595710,Posted: 29 August,all,LadyNeko911,Ok this game is scary. Looking at it on the computer screen may not be as scary but the whole thing changes when you put on that headset. I have the Oculus Rift. I like the fact that you cant stay in 1 spot too long because the tall shadow creature will slowly get closer and closer to you. I know this because i got scared because i heard growling and i duct down beside a fountain in the corner thinking im safe when really i wasnt...haha! Its a good game but i dont think it will have too much replay value as the creatures all spawn in the same spot and once youve gone through it once youll know exactly where they will be. I do love to scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of people with this game (espicially ones that have never used a VR headset before thats always the best

I've gotten two eyeballs onto their pedestals but everytime I try to explore the new area the game freezes. I have 584 titles in my VR library and this is the only game to have this issue. Just now I tried five times to explore this new area and each time it worked fine for 5-10 minutes then froze. Waited till I'd tried multiple times over a week or so to give it as much of a chance as possible but still happeneing. Had no issues up until this point. Hope it changes so I can change to a thumbs up.

The atmosphere in Dreadhalls is spot on -- super creepy without being gory.  I've played other ""scary"" VR games, but this is the first one that literally had me running into a wall (seriously, I physical ran into a wall trying to get away from a monster) and, at another point, had me say out loud ""I'm done"" and then rip the Vive off of my head in terror.  I love this game and, when it is nice and bright outside, I'm going to give it another go."
