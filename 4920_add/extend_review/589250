,Recommended,589250,29813668,Posted: 9 February,all,War Machine,"This review was written on the day this game was released.This game has me pretty excited, it currently has a lot of potential, especially for how low the price is. I've been wanting a cool superhero game to play in VR and with a little bit of work this could be great. The comic book visual style was a nice design choice and the power animations look awesome for the most part. I enjoy most of the 8 powers currently in the game, though they could use some polishing. The game is pretty bare-bones on the gameplay side at the moment, but thats expected for an EA title.  Here is some long-winded constructive criticism for the Dev:General Critques:Hand representation in the game seems slightly off.  Almost as if your real world hands are gripping the wrists of the avatar hands. Arms feel very long.FIXED :)Seeing your hands make different gestures for different powers would be a cool touch.City feels a bit empty with no people/traffic (I'm sure more will be added later)Menu button has no function currently.Powers:Teleport:  A must have for VR games and a good power to give right off the bat.  While I don't use it as much as the other movement options (I have no VR sickness issues).I think it could use a bit more range, and the indicator should be a bit taller, as sometimes I couldn't see it if aiming up at a building ledgeFIXED :) .  A lot of places won't let you teleport onto them like slanted House roofs.Alloy (Gattling Gun):  A classic for damage dealing. Pretty standard, but I feel maybe it should have a few different firing modes like missiles and such for variety. Iron Man / War Machine style!FireballMade me feel like the Human Torch. Cool charge animation and seemingly infinite range.Ran into a small bug where the hitboxes on the fireball seemed too large and would explode right next to me as if it was hitting me/the ground instead of firing.ALSO FIXEDSpellsNice job on the visuals with this one. Seems to be a knockback spell and a damage dealing spell, even though to sign says there is a ""disable"" spell? They could use a bit more range and maybe a few more spells added to cycle through.  Also please add an indicator on your hand telling you which spell is currently equipped!ShieldMy least favorite because it doesnt allow you to move since it's in your left hand (movement hand).  Long cooldown on the short range knockback attack.The way you have to hold the shield makes it soo you can't see the cooldown meter on your hand too.FIXEDFlying: Couldn't wait for this one. Flight direction is controlled by controller direction.Feels good, but its wayyyyyyy too slowKinda fixed, could still be faster*.  Maybe the amount the trigger is pulled could control speed? Or maybe the menu button or full trigger click could enable super speed flight. You can also fly through the roofs of buildings currently.Super Speed: Yes!!! My preferred movement option.  Effects on edge of screen while running are cool.  Running direction is controlled by where you are looking, but I think there should be an option to let you change it to controller direction like flying.  Sometimes you need to look where your going before you change direction. It would be cool if running into an enemy would hurt them or knock them back. Theres currently a bug if you run directly at an enemy, it will place you on top of their head and then you are stuck there until you change to flight/teleport.Heatvision:  My Favorite damage dealing power.  It just feels good to use! A burn trail follows anywhere that u look.  I have no complaints on this one except maybe a little bit more damage and thelooping sound effect while using it can be a little obnoxiousFIXED.Great job so far, and can't wait to see whats in store for this game in the future!EDIT: Crossed out issues fixed with quick update."

But also like everyone else has said, I see a lot of potential in this game, and I really like what I've heard about the developer of this game. He recently quit his day job to work on this full-time. That's what I like to hear when it comes to indie game developers. He knows it's a big financial risk, but he's taking it anyway to work on something he's clearly passionate about. That shows great dedication. This is early access done right. It's so often abused nowadays, but this is what it's really for. Buying a game early so that the developer can afford to keep working on it and improve it.And if the developer decides to read this, I've got a lot of ideas for things to add in future updates:Superpowers:Super Strength (kind of a given)More elemental powers, like ice, water, earth, lightning, etc.Acid powersX-Ray visionTelekinesis (just point at an object to highlight it, and hold the trigger to move it around. Pretty simple)Technomancy: Make robots fight each other! Or make cars drive on their own. Maybe have them crash into robots.Size-Changing abilities: Become as big as a building to crush enemies, or as small as an ant to access secret areas and hidden pathsOther stuff:A story-based reason for the player's abilities: Maybe make it so that the player is a superhero with the ability to channel the powers of other super-people?Civilians: Civilians will naturally run from a fight. However, if one dies anyway, it lowers your score.Make flight faster (while you may think this would render super speed obsolete, I think the two are different enough for it to work)Combo powers: Using certain powers together creates something even better (maybe this is how faster flight can work? Have flight on one hand and speed on the other)Have robots explode if you run into them with super speedHave the lazer eyes come from closer inward. Right now it feels like the lazers are coming from my temples. Maybe have your vision go red when using the power, as well. Kind of like in King Kaiju. Now that I think about it, this game and its developer remind me a lot of King Kaiju. Maybe you two could collaborate on something?Have the power wheel mapped to the menu button, not the trackpad: I feel like this would feel more natural, and allow for the player to switch between attacks using the trackpad, as opposed to the grip buttons. You could still have a small game menu float above the power wheel when you press the menu button."

,Recommended,589250,30040048,Posted: 19 February,all,GamingWiggler,"Absolutely brilliant! This is what i wanted when i first brought the vive last year. A game where i am the super hero, i can fly around and blast things from the sky. Im very hyped for this game and im really looking forward to what the future may bring!My YouTube Video:https://youtu.be/TnNNgoSP1AY"
76561198036804616,Recommended,589250,29841595,Posted: 10 February,all,Caonum,"Fun and great potential, few suggestions would be that teleport needs something to feel special, animation or effect to make it feel cool, flying need to be a lot faster, i love flying but this one is just to slow, super speed direction should be changed from where you are facing, as its hard to control, other wise im super excited to see what the devs do"
76561198021950917,Recommended,589250,30117941,Posted: 23 February,all,NitroG,"I'm keeping this game not because of what it is now but what I feel like it could become. Current state it's a tech demo. the ai is a joke the powers are fun but there are no real objectives outside of collecting the 8 powers. You have a fast runner, (to me this should be combined with the teleporter click a teleport spot and super speed run there.) the teleport guy the flyer and the shield. then the other hand you have flame shot, some hexing attack which increases damage enemies take, laser eyes and a minigun. they all work fine.The runner seems about the most useless of the powers. kinda fun but can't jump so any object is a problem and not being able to turn your head while your running without changing direction is an issue.I would love to see heros and villians. A telekinetic power would be amazing."
,Recommended,589250,29855039,Posted: 11 February,all,hiandthemoon,"Super cool game so far. It shows a ton of promise and versatility. Obviously this developer knows what they are doing. Would love to see more of a story, concept, and gameplay elements come out. But the initial powers are nice. Should definitely have movement/locomotion from the get go, with teleportation as a power. I feel like this is a must now in new VR games."
76561197969445388,Recommended,589250,29991548,Posted: 17 February,all,mr madcap,"PowersVR features some of the best VR mechanics currently available. Though the Early Access build is essentially just a sandbox demo of 8 various mechanics, the price is right and the future of this game is promising. The comic book-esque art style suits the Vive's resolution limitations extremely well, and each of the game's superpower mechanics inspires you to interact with Metropolis Island in a new, fun, way. Ever wanted to shoot lasers from your eyes like Superman? Or perhaps you wanted to make a speed run through city streets like Quicksilver, or fly around like Iron-Man. PowersVR is the game you are looking for."
,Not Recommended,589250,30038237,Posted: 19 February,all,Shadow,"https://youtu.be/n9iBqL_6dY4Everything about this game was looked and felt good. It's hard to justify the price tag though...Graphically the game has a very unique style as far as VR titles go and I really like it. The way text pops up when you start your mini-gun spinning up or the enemies blow up in a great big BAM cloud. It really feels like you've been dropped into a comic book.The audio fit perfectly, from the BGM to the sound effects. Everything seemed appropriately super hero-y.The 'gameplay' consisted of unlocking all the powers and using them against a few static enemies. This is where the price tag doesn't match the content. I don't think I particularly rushed the experience and managed to finish in about 10 minutes. That translates to just under $1 a minute.There are better, more complete titles out there for that price. Titles that won't just be a sandbox, tech demo. It's a well done tech demo but it's still a tech demo.This will be a pick up if you really want to support future VR super hero titles. The devs need to eat too. I'd love to see a full game come of this and I have no intention of refunding. I can't however recommend the title at that price point."

76561198116304836,Recommended,589250,32797656,Posted: 25 June,all,Aerowyn,Pretty simple game at its current state but my Son loves it. I would recommend this for kids no question. I played around with it for a little bit but still a bit lacking for my tastes. Looking forward to seeing how this one progresses as we are really limited in the Super hero type games in VR so far.
,Recommended,589250,31091487,Posted: 11 April,all,Craig1287,"This game was designed specifically to fulfill your childhood (and current) dream to become a super hero. I love it so much. There's definitely improvements and additions to be made but the developer is working on those. Things like character challenges and a story based compaign, but for right now, the powers and world that are in there are just awesome. I can equipe the flight power and fly around shooting enemies with my laser vision, fireballs I summon from my hands, or with my mini-gun hand. It's so amazing and the developer has quite his full-time job in order to fully focus on the game.5/5 Dreams have come true."

,Recommended,589250,34073636,Posted: 6 August,all,Jewbone441xxx,"Game has some very promising features. Although not a real ""game"" yet, the mechanics are intuitive and really show off the freedom and potential of vr. If the developer continues to support this title its definitly worth a buy. NOTE TO DEVELOPER: keep up the good work man! I know nothing about developing a game, but if implementing a turning system for people that only have front facing sensors isn't too hard I would ask if you could do that. I love your flying and super speed mechanics but can't fully enjoy them since i cant turn around."
