If you don't have other friends to play this game with or friends who don't enjoy using voice chat- DON'T bother buying this - you won't have any enjoyment.2) It's £4.99. So you should set your expectations a little bit lower for the gameplay you get out of this - watch some online to see if this is the kind of game you would enjoy. IMO you're paying for the fun you get out of playing such a ridiculous premise with friends rather than the mechanics themselves.3) The dog mess should clear up if the lover slips in it once. And the dog shouldn't be able to body block doorways with his body. This makes things a little bit unfair and makes some rooms impossible to escape from.4) Would be nice to see improvements to the UI as it's severely lacking atm.5) Would be quite atmospheric to have different times of day as well
76561198100146100,Recommended,589320,32232669,Posted: 6 June,all,:bomberrat:,"This game taught me alot about life. It taught me about the rough daily lives of police men who are keeping our country safe, who come home to see their wifes in bed with another man. Take to a big adventure and countless hours of fun, playing as a dog, police man (husband), cheater, or wife. This game offers lots of vengeance and could very easily be a $60 10/10 game. My experience with this game has been unlike any other. Now i have played big title games like Dark Souls and Call of Duty, but none of them seem to match this. The adrenaline rush from playing the cheater, to the hatred of being a police trying to hunt down the cheater. If you do not already know this game is a 4 player multiplayer game. The wife and the cheater work together and the police and the dog work together also. The cheater is supposed to sneak around the big house finding his pants and his shirt, the wife uses communication or marks clothes or items like tazers that the cheater can pick up. The police and his dog are trying to hunt down the cheater and might have to punch the wife if she gets in his way. The cheater can pick up items like a tazer to taze the police to buy him some time and the police can do the same back but he would then punch the cheater to death. Once the cheater has collected all of his clothes he must need to find a key to unlock the front gate or a hidden door in the basement. The wife can find pepper spray around the house and pepper spray the police to get him off of the cheater and buy him more time. The dog can pee or poop around the house as traps for the cheater, he can slip on them stopping him from moving and letting the police catch and maybe kill him. Now let me stop bragging and explaining the game. Get out there and enjoy countless hours of fun with your friends or just some random people!!!!!!Thank you"

I wasted 25 minutes on waiting for servers to pop up and I can't get a refund due to the purchase being in my library more than 2 weeks. You can't even play the game you need 3 friends 4 people in total, to create a party and play. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME until it has more work done on the servers."

The only downside is that it has a small player base so not very many people play it. However, if you have yourself and 2 other people with the game you just play it together and have a blast. I know you can have 4 and it's more fun with 4, but 3 is still a really good time.If you are thinking about buying this and don't have any friends to play it with just buy it and you can add me as a friend as I am looking for a couple more people to play with myself as I only have 2 others right now that have it."
76561198040823941,Recommended,589320,31038651,Posted: 9 April,all,CookieDan,As long as this game gets updates I can see a future for it. If they just leave it to die then I will be very upset :(I love the idea for this game and if they keep improving the game then Im sure people will eventually change their reviews.For example the cloths are in the same place for all 3 games I played so I assume they dont change position. Once you know where to go it becomes repetative.I am yet to play with 4 people yet so maybe that will make the game that much better :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE3z0HwvC4w
