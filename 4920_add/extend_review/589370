,Not Recommended,589370,30133426,Posted: 23 February,all,SidAlpha,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB9QNAlNlEs**UPDATE: THE DEVELOPER HAD ISSUED A FRAUDULENT DMCA STRIKE ON MY YOUTUBE VIDEO THAT WAS OPENLY CRITICAL ABOUT THE GAME. AS EXPECTED THEIR ATTEMPTED SILENCING OF OPEN AND FAIR CRITICISM HAS FAILED. I HAD ISSUED A RESPONSE VIDEO AT THE TIME OF THE TAKEDOWN THAT CAN BE FOUND HERE:https://youtu.be/h4LIR4DwfZsPLEASE HELP SPREAD THE WORD AND FIGHT AGAINST CENSORSHIP****ALSO JIM STERLING POSTED A JIMQUISITION IN REGARDS TO MY DMCA AND THE DMCA MESS THESE DEVS HAVE CREATEDsteam://openurl/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSbwmYsbTKo**Also Totalbiscuit decided to weigh in on this as well. His opinion was as unflattering of Dalas as mine.Fur-Fun. If you buy this game you will soon enough appreciate the irony in that title. This game has been mired in controversy and even if it weren't, I would still most adamantly NOT reccomend this game to even my worst enemies.My first inclination this was going to be a bad title was the fact that the entire tutorial was done via voiceover by the Developer, who is a YouTuber with more than 4 million subscribers on his main channel. This in itself would not be a bad thing except that the audio balance was so god-awful that I was unable to decipher the 10% of what I could hear of his speaking due to the music drowning it out.Even after that, this game is the epitome of boring, dull, and bland. The ""enemies"" look and act like moving balloons which is fine because they are so unimaginably slow and the combat is so completely pointless that you won't even bother going near them.With numerous crashes, bugs, and glitches, this game is nowhere NEAR ready despite the apparent assumption that it is nearly completed by the Developer. The game crashed for me 3 times in less than an hour. I fell through the map 7 times. I got hung up on invisible walls countless times.This isn't a game. It is an abomination. Avoid at all costs.1/10"
,Not Recommended,589370,29934667,Posted: 14 February,all,Mildew,"Honestly this game does not feel like a platformer. The main collectables that you have to get are pretty much scattered in random places in the map it seems and only like half of them are a challenge to get. Like seriously some of them are located behind a wall on the gound or behind a plant that you can go through which you wouldn't even know you can go through without testing it. Nothing about this game is good. ""But it's early access you shouldn't be so harsh about it"" there have been plenty of platformers that were in Early Access that blow this game out the ballpark. The gameplay is boring, the cars are boring, and timon from lion king is in the game. Also putting invisible walls next to collectables so they are collectable anymore is stupid and honestly made me wonder which collectables or button chests were going to work which like 25% of the ones I went to actually did. I honestly don't know what you were thinking when making your game. Something like this being sold is a joke and is going to be taken as one as seen in one of your game trailers you have on the store page.EDIT: Played the game again after the game has been fully released to see if it is any better. It unfortunately is not. A lot of the problems stated before are still there and a lot of the bosses either fell off the map or ended up being in spots where it was very tedious to even get in a couple hits on them. Also I've had to cheat every single time I played to get to the final level like I don't even think there are 70 spheres or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they are called I could really care less but this game is still not fun the platforming is still not fun some of the ""challenges"" are unfair and they just are not fun to pull off and not satisfying, Also the ending is really meh too. Story is alright though I'll give you points on that but this game is still not worth anyone's money"

(yep, that's all I did.)http://imgur.com/a/jcZQKSee for yourself. I also have all links archived so you can go see for yourself. I did not lie.Apparently the dev and the moderator are banning anyone who say anything that might compromise the game staying on Steam, even though its true.They also delete and ban any post that shows youtube videos of gamers playing the game.Weird, since the guy who made this is apparently a youtuber himself. Why so hostile to me, though? What did I do? The moderator also is a youtuber. Yet they delete all youtube videos (mostly the one posted is Jim Sterling's)I will link to the reviews I found strange. This first one is actually by a friend of the dev, who was given moderator status in the forums.Not only is it a fake review, it appears that the moderator doesn't even own the game anymore. You can see my pictures of all thisin the imgur album I linked near the top of the review.http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198364952860/recommended/589370/I also archived it, because I have a feeling it will disappear when I write this review.https://web.archive.org/web/20170224084144/http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198364952860/recommended/589370/People are saying that the dev gave out steam keys in exchange for positive reviews, but when they told the truth and it was negative, the steam keywas revoked and so was the product. I'm not sure if that is what happened here, or if the moderator just got a refund. I'd ask him but I was bannedfor even mentioning it.Another review. This person still owns the game but they don't own a single other thing on steam that requires money.http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198322015866/recommended/589370/(archived)https://web.archive.org/web/20170224090530/http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198322015866/recommended/589370/Not much else to say, except this one's too obvious.This game has already been discovered to be using assets from Minecraft and the coin from Nintendo's most famous Mario games in their User Interface.They've quickly been changed in a recent update. Now they are low res, blurry (filled with artifacts) and are most likely clip art or stock images.Stolen or not, they look cheap, it doesn't match the art style. It look stupid.This is how they look now.http://imgur.com/a/wWKvJThere's lots of reason to believe they've stolen other content as well but you can read about it elsewhere.The graphics setting menu doesn't work. It has no ""apply"" button and when you close the menu, all your changes resort back to default.No way to rebind keys.No actual key layout provided. Its all guesswork.The voice acting is really really bad. The guy speaking english sounds like he has a mouth full of rags or mush.I keep falling through solid objects. The menu curser is tied to the camera, which is really stupid. Expect the camera flying around when you hit escape to open the menu.This game sucks..in a big way.  Fragile ego of a developer be damned, I'm telling the truth. You already banned me, so what else you got?"

""I'm sure it's not too bad,"" I said.I felt physical pain playing this game. Everything about it offended my senses. It's ugly, controls awful, is terribly designed, and I'm not sure why he thought it was acceptable to put this on the store front for 10 dollars with the quality it is. Everything about the visuals in the game is designed to make the player think they are having a very slow stroke as their mind struggles to adjust to all the awful effects. You know how when you get an organ transplant, your immune system tries to attack it? My body was rejecting all of this.I paid 10 dollars for an unrelenting shout type headache and I'm wondering if I can actually sue for emotional distress.Don't buy this game.If you get it for free, refund the free."
,Not Recommended,589370,30046845,Posted: 19 February,all,Jaberz,"This game is no where near perfect. I can't recommend it in this state. If the bugs were fixed and it was more difficult I could see myself paying $10 but at this point in development, I'm going to try to get my refund and come back when it is farther down in development. Don't buy this game yet."
,Not Recommended,589370,30130693,Posted: 23 February,all,Lord Crocosquirrel,"All right, then... I've had a look at the ""Product,"" and I'm not only not impressed, but Most Definitely Not Amused.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_wmWnnwTYUTwenty-odd minutes of assets of various quality, from the coins that the Deve *may* have made himself to the poor Meerkat that bears more than a passing resemblance to Disney's Timon character (have you guysEVEReven seen a meerkat?) the levels of wrong stack up like the layers of an onion the size of Jupiter fresh out of the fryer.The game is an extreme travesty, and made my brain bleed with the sheer incompetence on display. Makes me wish for the days when The Slaughtering Grounds was a thing...Because that game was at least worth a laugh when things went sideways-- this thing will probably go down in history as the most unfortunate project to be released this decade, and likely this millennium.Devs: Learn how gravity works. Observe a fsking Meerkat. If there aren't any at the nearest zoo, then watch your downloads of Meerkat Manor. Do something. Do *ANYTHING*.For a more detailed critique, there will be a panel discussion on Saturday:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRuPasnht7I"
,Not Recommended,589370,30148446,Posted: 24 February,all,Oscar Salas,"I did my best to make it fair, but it's hard to enjoy this game. The game itself does not give you any intentions to explore the world they offer. The voice over acting is unprofessional and clearly unscripted... that means, it's just there to fill empty spaces with no intentions. Also, controls are messy, there are a lot of bugs around. The short time I played, I encountered some. If I ever intend to play longer than I already did, I know what I could expect:- Worlds filled with nothing interesting to look around. Not even a story to support that.- More unprofessional crafted voice acting with no serious scripting.- Bugs.From artistic perspective, the game clearly wants to jump its errors by saying ""it's just for fun"", but that's not an excuse to throw a bunch of elements on screen that does not have any representation to the game. For example, an helicopter in the middle of a valley, considering the art concepts and design the general enviorment has... it's a big mistake. That means, the game does not even take seriously itself and does not have intentions to grow better or at least to create a fictional world that feels real.It feels there's no love behind it, just a bunch of random stuff to fill the game with whatever they can.I'm not a supporter of games that are poorly crafterd. The game should come out at least when they have an optimal experience to offer, with a decent result in general terms: better controls, better voice, fixed bugs and more. The game itself feels rushed... and it is.For the price, $10, I would suggest to invest money in other games of the same price... there are a lot of better options, even from games of the same category that are already old.If any of these points ever change, I would kindly give a positive review if it deserves it, but for now, the experiece I had for $10, in terms of gameplay, story and art are undesirable.2/10"
,Not Recommended,589370,30291324,Posted: 3 March,all,zrrz,The trailer looks bad. The game looks worse. My roomate tricked me into buying it. And on level 5 my computer doesn't look like that.

But its ""developer"" (Dalasreview), a putrid heap of toxic gargabe and a spineless smug utterly despicable bully, is even worse!Don't support this horrible person!----Edit: As a bonus, I'd like to share with you some footage I captured from the game. It's worth noting that despite my PC being kinda old, and not being that beefy, it can play excellent AAA games like Mass Effect 2, Saints Row 4 or Far Cry: Blood Dragon, and still run them smoothly (on medium-ish settings) and with an stable frame-rate. And yet this game... Well, look at the video and despair:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=876100550The reason I fiddle with the cursor on the title screen for so long, is because even the main menu is unresponsive! I didn't allow me to click immediately. Man... When even your title screen is borked, you know you done f|_|cking it up."

76561198061553886,Not Recommended,589370,30332311,Posted: 5 March,all,brandino,Well I can't say if this game is good or not because it keeps crashing whenever I start it. My PC does meet the minimum requirements and yet it still crashes at the main menu.I even ran this on my laptop whose specs actually don't meet the minimum requirements and yet the game runs on my laptop but crashes on my desktop that meets the minimum requirements.Obviously getting a refund for a game that I can't even start.

,Not Recommended,589370,30428651,Posted: 10 March,all,Sexy Super Slut,"The game wouldn't start for me. It showed some kind of tree with doors, with a view of a level on the ground. Music was playing, but that was the only thing happening.That reason alone is more than enough for me to recommend not buying it (or buying it and getting a refund), but I'll try to give some more reasons.Here is some gameplay footage if you're interested in finding out if this game is good (hint: it isn't. It's absolutely awful and it will always stay absolutely awful, in my opinion):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAKp2Fe6g6cOh, and the ""developer"" is a shady piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ as explained in this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSbwmYsbTKoDon't buy this game. Or do buy it and get a refund, which also gives you the opportunity to write a review. Instead of writing a review, you could write a post in the game's forums, but they might well be deleted if the ""developer"" doesn't like it.If you'd excuse me, I'm going to get my refund now."

Falling through floors and ceilings, floaty and horrible jump physics, and worst of all, the cannons and death ""animations""I bought this game on sale for around $3 and it wasn't even worth that.  Until the devs fix this up, it certainly isn't worth any money.Hopefully they make a sequel or something that's more refined and actually worth paying for and spending time on."

,Recommended,589370,31136215,Posted: 14 April,all,JolanXBL,"I like it, good game. Platforming is fun and everything is modeled really well. Sounds & music fit the levels (though I'm still on level 1) and the difficulty ranges from 'walk up to it' to tricky jumps onto thin poles. There are mainly coins and pearls to collect (may be particular to the levels), creatures to rescue, and even some unlockable goals. Graphics look great even on low settings, which I need with my i3 instead of the minimum i5 processor.The cat can double-jump with a flip and swipes with her paws. The second character is a little blue & black alien thing with bombs that it can launch like a cannon, or use to 'grenage-jump' (though that may be a glitch, hopefully stays in!). The poses in the screenshots are just character poses, like vacation photos, and aren't actually available in the game.If you encounter a MS Visual C++ issue when starting, try googling 'Windows6.1-KB2999226-x64' from Microsoft Update."

,Recommended,589370,30362229,Posted: 6 March,all,KirbyFan45,"I never thought I would live to see a game with a pun as the name, but here we go. After 1 level (Not including the tutorial) I would say this is worth it. Now to avoid controversy, I will get to the flaws first. First, is the physics when getting hit is dumb. Sometimes, it glitches you out of the level, but thankfully, you respawn. My second is maybe more my computer, but I have to lower the graphics to the bare minimum, and I still get some lag. Third, maybe caused by my lag, is that some of the click menus are not very responsive. However, I hope this can be fixed in one of the daily updates that Dallas and Doky are making. Doky has it harder since he is making a Sonic fan game at the same time, but I think it might be done now. Now as for positives, first, although not memorable, I liked the soundtrack. Very peaceful. Second is that the level design is not too big, but the right size. I didn't get lost at all, although I don't really get lost unless it's Zelda for some reason. Third is that the humor added is pretty funny. I laughed at a few of the jokes. Anyway, as long as you can forgive some issues, and want an innocent 3D platformer, this is the game for you. In fact, if the game does well enough, we might get a sequel called Fur Glory. Yes, I know my jokes suck."
