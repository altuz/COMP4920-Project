,Not Recommended,589390,34138177,Posted: 9 August,all,CrimZone,"Trashville, Trashdev, TrashgameTrashville is a top-down shooter game made with the Unity engine meant to be a horde based gameThe first impression that i had after seeing the trailer and featured images on the store made me thought that it was going to be a funny game, like dam boi look at dat T-rekt, those bananas ´n hot girls ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)But after play it, these are my impressions and points about my experience with this ""game""Pros:- Trading cards and thousands of achievements- The dance that performs the main character at the main menuCons:- Camera movement feels like♥♥♥♥♥♥and mess up controls- Enemy AI is broken (they will get stuck in mostly of times)- There are no settings, nor pause menu- This is an ""Achievement"" spam based game too, but the dev can't even do that good, achievements stop unlocking after some time and it's necessary restart the game (and cross your fingers) to make achievements work againThis game is meant to befinished around 3 hours, the dev really wants to make you play it but you can jump on a car (enemies won't hit you) so you can do something else on 3 hoursFinal Rating:🌟☆☆☆☆"
76561198073648775,Not Recommended,589390,30709729,Posted: 24 March,all,Suma,"EDIT 07-23-2017: Well, there were 2 updates today.  The game is playable again, but barely.  I don't think the developer is using a mouse and keyboard to test play.  The controls are so touchy and the screen jerks around so bad, you really cannot do much.  If the developer would put an options menu in the game with mouse sensitivity, it might fix this problem, but right now, the game is still in a terrible state and I DO NOT recommend it at all! I think the dev is upset because there were no zombies, only the boss and he killed me in seconds! LMAO!!! Yeah, this game is BAD!!!EDIT 07-22-2017: I just tried to play this again and it's even worse and unplayable now! They must have tried to tweak the controls and my character goes crazy!  He will not walk in the direction I try walking!  Sometimes he just spins in a circle! LMAO  The game is FUBAR BROKEN!!!Where do I begin?!?!?!  The title say's it ALL!!! lol Definitely TRASH!!!-This game is in beta. It has to be!  It's that bad.-Turn your gamepad off, because it will use both the mouse and the gamepad and freakout! (PS4 controller)-The controls are SUPER touchy and there is no way to adjust the mouse sesitivity. Very hard to play!-It has no options in the main menu, or anywhere for that matter!-There is no way to exit the game once you start playing.  You have to use keyboard commands to exit back to Steam.-Then it messes Steam up so you have to quit and restrart the Steam client.-The animations are so stiff, they're comical!-Has mini map but no way to find lost enemies. Yeah, they get lost! lmao-Game crashes on OS X 10.11.6-I have to Shift + Tab to get to the game when I start it up! lol-You don't actually have to face the enemy to kill them, just swing your weapon when surrounded! lol-It's so bad, I am keepng the game to show to friends! If a game is this bad, it a party classic! lmaoIt's so sad because they did put a lot of work into the game.  The environments show some sign of creativity, but the animations are so BAD!  The game needs a lot of work, but it is cheap.  If the controls were'nt so touchy, or if there were options for the mouse sensitivity, I might recommend this game, but again, the character animations are BAD!It might work with an XBox controller.  It has partial gamepad support for the PS4 controller, but it still uses the mouse to look, so it's unplayable. The right stick doesn't work at all and only one button worked. A word of wisdom to the dev's, ""Include Options!!!""  What a waste of the dev team's time! lol Fix it or ""TRASH"" it!!!

76561198312563277,Not Recommended,589390,32377864,Posted: 12 June,all,farmskins.com,Even with a buy price of $0.33 (USD) this game is overpriced. There is no in game pausing and you cannot edit any of the settings in this game! The mouse control/trackpad/controller is an absolute mess and impossible to control. I don't think anyone tested this game and named it trashville to represent the quality of the gameplay.

,Not Recommended,589390,34212521,Posted: 13 August,all,@Dicky Spanish,"I used to live in Trashville, it wasn't as bad as the towns name implies. Most people could afford the rent on a decent trailer home and there were plenty of fast food restaurants with home delivery. Mobility scooters ruled the footpaths driven by the obese and usually had a pit bull dog trailing behind with a matching stud collar like their owners. Many could afford the high cost of smokes, meth and crack so it was a higher socio economic trash town.Anyway it's was a lot more classier than the neighbouring towns of ♥♥♥♥♥ville and ♥♥♥♥♥berry where the freaks would come from, to rob our trailers and steal our crack pipes.Wasn't a bad life growing up in Trashville and even if we could of afforded a TV it wasn't needed, as it would of been stolen before we were able to plug it in.Ahhhh the summer nights listening to sirens, screams and gunfire gives me a warm fuzzy feeling just thinking about it.Game is not good enough to even be called trash."

Fun characters (poop emoji's my fave) and weapons, makes it undoubtably worth the dollar I paid for it.

Have you ever tried to cut your wrists and bleed to death in a bathtub because you have no friends? Well this game will make sure you WILL NEVER get friends! I started playing this game for only 13 minutes, and already my wife divorced me, my boss fired me, my friends have blocked my number, and I have been exiled from society! Now that I have no life, I can spend all my time playing Unity games such as my new favourite ""Trashville"". Trashville is the reason I have no family, no hopes for the future or any hope of spreading my seed as the legacy to the next generation. Trashville is a unity shoot-em-up. My favourite part of this game is the camera angles in the game! It is quite lovely as I move my mouse a fraction of a centimeter to the left and the camera does a 720 degree turn at the speed of my wife leaving me after I told her about this game. I sincerely thank the benelovent developers for creating this ""video game"". It has completely ruined my life. I write this as my suicide note, of the game that drove me to this. By the time whoever is reading this on the Steam Store page for ""Trashville"". I am sure it must be in the distant future as our generations grand children search the archives of ""Steam"" to see what games we played in the '10s. I cannot see any self-respecting person ending up here before then. I would just like you to know, that after I die, I will dedicate my life to haunting the developers for the rest of their sad, putrid lives. Goodbye."
