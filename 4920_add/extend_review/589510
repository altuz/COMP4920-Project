Not a bad game by any means, has the same charm as the original S.K., but why pay for it here if you can get it free with the original (now called Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove)."
,Recommended,589510,30975319,Posted: 6 April,all,Akka,"Blight the EarthSpecter of Torment is an expandalone prequel to Shovel Knight. It offers much of the same platforming elements while adding a bit more definition to the characters and backstory.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=899373479&fileuploadsuccess=1GameplayShovel Knight pogos on enemies, Plague Knight throws bombs, and the new Specter Knight dash slashes through airborne enemies to gain height.Every level from the first to the last caters to the unique movement, which requires precise timing. If you attack a target while they're below you then you thrust yourself down--you have to wait until gravity pulls you below your next target before you strike.Every level is available to you from the start, play them in any order. While you do have an expanding assortment of alternate weapons, I only ever used two. A far cry from the original Shovel Knight which had me alternating all my abilities actively per each level. Too many of these new alternate weapons were gimmicky and saw zero use.VisualOn top of the already impressive library of art assets available in the earlier titles, the developers went all out in adding plenty of fresh new content for me to soak my eyes into. Shovel Knight and it's DLC proves that pixel art can be beautifully tuned if you put in enough work.SoundVirt reprises his role as the lead musician, composing new unique material for EVERY single stage. Anyone intimately familiar with the original soundtrack will notice the new themes all bear leitmotifs from the original songs. Certain tracks are remarkably improved, while others suffer from only having been tweaked slightly and are worse off for it.PlotThe earliest game in the timeline, you've been conscripted to track down elite knights to form the Order of no Quarter. Campy, humorous overtones prevail throughout the story, save for the somber flashbacks. This is the perfect volume of plot for a solid platformer.SpectacleHaving already experienced most of the bosses prior, the impact is a bit lessened this third time through. I'm still impressed by the background assets and I love seeing the fresh angles depicted in certain levels.DifficultyRecovery items are plentiful enough that you won't find yourself dying outside of instant kill pits or to the errant spike. Checkpoints are frequent, and just like the earlier games you only lose a portion of money which you can recollect.You're given access to all the stages at once. The inevitable accumulation of hp expansions will trivialize the difficulty of any late game enemies and bosses. You'll still have to be on guard against the occasional instant death trap.The final boss, while very impressive to look at and in concept, is a bit too simple.Four out of five starsIf you've already purchased Shovel Knight (you should) then this DLC will be inside your base game as a free update. I appreciate the effort that Yacht Club games put into their updates, so I threw ten dollars at them even though I didn't have to. Good work should be rewarded. Good games should be played."

The story was pretty well done and of course with the goofy humor. Would recommend I got a little under six hours total before completing the first play through with many more hours to spend on it if you want to go into new game plus, challenges, and new games with codes in them posted online. Also snowboarding on your scythe into enemies deaths was just gold :)(Quick add on edit if you already own the original game you don't have too pay for this seperatetly it is already in the game as an update. I didn't know this but meh I love this series so I have no problem helping those out that bring me hours upon hours of happyness!!!)"

I would highly recommend this game to people who have previously enjoyed Shovel Knight or love 8-bit platformers. Cool music, cool game play and a great new game+.Definitely worth the $104 out of 5"
,Recommended,589510,31245064,Posted: 19 April,all,Routt,"Adding myself to the pile of people who bought this day 1 without knowing they already owned it, but hey, it's a good game.PROS-cool mechanics and controls-cool story-a prequel done wellCONS-barely any original music, just remixes of the original-shorter and easier than the other shovel knight games (although that might be because I already had experience with shovel knight so I just was too good)"
,Recommended,589510,30987442,Posted: 6 April,all,Temporary Secretary,Great addition to the series. Adds just enough on to the original game's mechanics to justify itself. The length is a good bit shorter than the first but the price is reduced to completely make up for it. All around great buy if you enjoyed the first.
,Recommended,589510,31040715,Posted: 9 April,all,Kragled,"I've played Plague of Shadows and og Shovel Knight around three times each but I can confidently say, this is by far the best version Shovel Knight. It is extremely fun and addicting and the level design is so so so good, not to mention the bosses. And the difficulty is higher than the other ones, but so is the reward. 15/10 One of my top 5 favorite games of all time.However, I have not reached the end yet so don't take this review as 100% accurate, because the ending could be worse than Mass Effect 3 and I would have no idea.OMG the ending is amazing!!!! My new favorite game of all time now above Skyrim and Dishonored"

The beautiful art direction is complimented with great story, characters, and gameplay. This platformer is one of the best I've played in a long time, and it will stay that way. Can't wait for King Knight!"

Amazing game diffently for thouse who love 2D platforming game. DON'T MISS THIS GAME!!
,Recommended,589510,31072259,Posted: 10 April,all,DJHarmony,"I'm gonna be honest, I was one of those people who never played the original Shovel Knight. When I saw this on here it looked like it was pretty cool and, despite my lack of knowledge on this series, I decided to give it a shot...it's definately not for amateurs, I'll tell you that much. This game is hard...I mean really hard. The bosses are all difficult in their own special way..except the black knight, the stages can sometimes be frustrating...again, except the first one and going back to get your loot can sometimes be a bit hard. All that being said however, I still kinda like this game. Normally games like this get me really angry, but the premace and characters are keeping me invested, something not a lot of challenging games do for me."
,Recommended,589510,32040981,Posted: 29 May,all,danmerey,"Great prequel to original Shovel Knight! If you played it, you should play this addon for sure.If you have the original Shovel Knight, DON'T BUY THIS GAME, YOU ALREADY HAVE IT FOR FREE and can play it using original launcher. I bought it because I didn't know this at the moment.If you didn't play the original game, play it first. Here's a link –http://store.steampowered.com/app/250760/Shovel_Knight_Treasure_Trove/This addon is pretty good: nice plot/story, wonderful level design, everything you loved in the original game.You can have some troubles with auto-climbing walls. This addon is a bit harder then the original game, but it's good for those who finished it.I recommend for sure, but don't buy it — you will have full game story if you buy/bought ""Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove"" (former ""Shovel Knight"")"
76561198054252348,Recommended,589510,33438734,Posted: 10 July,all,ChiseledDiamond GTB,"This game, especially the story aspect of it made me buy it as a standalone,  i wanted to review this DLC seperately because it took my breath away.Already my favorite character was Specter knight, his amazing design really making me intriqued as to his story, and i was not dissapointed!If you have the full game i would suggest playing this campaign FIRST, i feel like the twist ending works better if you find it out as Specter in the first game rather than ShovelKnight later.However you will most likely feel bad for killing Specter in your playtrough as ShovelKnight.As for the collectibles i felt this campaign had the most solid collectibles, not too many of them, and it had a pretty good payoff as well. The unique cloaks felt more worth it this time around, and the clever black and white/old school feel of the flashbacks was genius!if you have Plague of shadows i would suggest playing that after you play Specter of Torment.Overall this easily takes a spot on my list of favorite games of all time, and a SPECIAL spot as favorite DLC!"

I like how it doesn't overcomplicate things like plague of shadows did. The boss fights get frustrating due to a smaller health meter but the new challenges are fun and everything you liked about shovel knight is on hand,"

76561198044609295,Not Recommended,589510,34827522,Posted: 8 September,all,CastIronBoomstick,"While theoretically Specter of Torment builds on the original game's amazing formula, in practice it addes two new mechanics and the ability to constantly heal in order to make up for the lackluster boss and level design. This genuinly feels like a poor copy of the original in nearly every way. The levels are far less interesting and have (from what I saw) no new mechanics save those tied to the characters new core abilities (diagonal air-combos and a fairly clunky wallrun/jump), and the tension of bossfights is severely watered down by the aforementoned health regenerating item. The final nail in the coffin is the b-side music that I suspect consists of rushed remixes and off-cuts that never made it into the original game. That said, the game does appear to have an interesting story, and for people who REALLY enjoyed the original its probably worth a shot for the $10 pricetag. That said, a recommendation with a caveat is not a recommendation at all, and so this game gets the ol' thumbs-down."

,Not Recommended,589510,31195106,Posted: 17 April,all,Squiiddish,"In addition to being by far the weakest Shovel Knight entry, nowhere did Yacht Club bother to tell me that if I owned the original Shovel Knight I didn't need to buy this. I don't know what the hell ""Treasure Trove"" edition is, I just bought regular-old Shovel Knight standard edition when it came out. Turns out, I completely wasted $10 on this game I already had and Steam won't refund me. Sadness all around."

I love Yacht Club and their 3DS version (which I own as well) but this Steam version is terrible. I get that they're trying to expand this game as much as possible but please at least play-test the controls before you send it over to the PC world because this version is terrible. This review rates 2 out of 5 because of the controls for Steam. For the 3DS this review is pending because Nintendo still hasn't approved the game.=================================================================Update: This review seems to be getting a lot of hate. All I'm going to ask to those who are screaming is if your bodies are supposed to be 70% water how are you 100% salt?I've tried to mess around with the key bindings to improve the experience and it hasn't helped. I'm buying a controller to use with my PC later this week and I'll update the review after I'm done. I'm not trying to take shots at Yacht Club (I mean I even mentioned how much I liked them), it's an issue with the controls which is a legit issue. I'll respond to a few comments below.=================================================================""And you played for almost 4 hours, which is about how long it took me to beat the game. So you presumably finished it, awful controls and all. This review is garbage.""^didn't actually play all 4 hours. I tried to play for about 2 hours but I wasn't able to get very far. I kept the game on while I was working remote to preserve my progress and keep trying whenever I could take a break.=================================================================""Hey♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you know that the game was originaly for PC? The 3DS version is the newest version of the game (Besides the Switch version).""^This isn't true. Per Wikipedia ""the game was initially released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U in June 2014"", ""Ports for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox One were released in April 2015, the Amazon Fire TV in September 2015, and the Nintendo Switch in March 2017."" I've had the game since July 2014 on 3DS and I've had no issues with anything. It's been one of my most played games, graphics are amazing, controls (yes that thing I brought up earlier) were fluid, humor/gameplay is on point.=================================================================""if you are going to write such an awfull review dont be a coward and atleast reply to the criticism.""^Gotta go to that job to make that cash to buy games and write reviews to generate all of these wonderful comments.=================================================================""for someone who know's where it's at, you sure have trouble remembering his username.You clowns do know this series STARTED on PC, right???""^Once again not true, see the above Wikipedia reference.=================================================================""What kind of controller did you use if I can ask? I beat the version that was included in the treasure trove edition using a 360 controller and thought it felt very tight and snappy""^I'm buying a controller later this week, I'll look online to see what deal I can get on a 360 controller. I think the issue could be a few things, either I'm not used to playing a sidescroller with a keyboard, the game isn't as optimized for a keyboard, or my keyboard sucks (QuickFire TK)."

,Recommended,589510,31182223,Posted: 16 April,all,toxicitzi,"Having finished the first run of it, I can say this is a thumbs up.The game is mostly for the fans I think, but even new people coming in could experience nice things in it. SK the original is standard, as well as provides a free DLC for those that want more, where as this expands on the already existing game and provides another facet to its story and a completely new way to play the game.Another positive going on, while the gameplay update, difference and redone boss fights are all fantastic in their own right, it's the story that fans ought to check out here, that I believe is the crux of the game and I can't praise Yacht Club enough for how far they went with this title, it's really amazing just thinking back on it.as for a few negatives, some spots may seem a bit unforgiving I'd say, to mistakes that is (depending on the nature of said mistakes), but with enough practice people should get the hang of it. Still, for new comers, my biggest advice is to either find a solution around the wall walking mechanic and be most cautious about it alone, because that will probably be the biggest contributor in your deaths in this game, also, there are some items in the game that will help you a lot here, some Curios, but I'd say that the armors will help you the most in the difficult portions of the game.All in all, whether or not some will know it's worth buying, you should decide that for yourselves, the DLC has some minor issues and gets fairly tough in a few sections, but if you want more Shovel Knight and can't get enough of it, you most likely want to buy this."

,Recommended,589510,35234603,Posted: 26 September,all,716green,"Shovel Knight is one of the great indie games of our time. Clearly Yacht Club Studios is an incredibly talented group of developers and they were able to perfectly emulate the 8 bit era style of difficult but fair, frustrating but engaging sidescrolling action goodness.The game has 3 (soon to be 4) different campaigns but I chose Specter of Torment to review first because I find it to be the most fun so far. The diagnal melee dash attack is so much fun which makes combat just so enjoyable.This game is (comparitively to NES games) similar to a Mega Man game (MM2 or MM3) for the level design and maybe Ninja Gaiden III with the  melee combat.This is a retro inspired platformer done right and this is one of my favorite games hands down!"
