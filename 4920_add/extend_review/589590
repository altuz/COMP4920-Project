,Recommended,589590,32831243,Posted: 26 June,all,GigaByte,"Really fun game filled with hilarious dialogue.There's a lot of little quests to do, but you technically only get one day to do them: The day starts as Monday, do whatever you want, the day ends. The next day is Monday x2; it's like Groundhog day, but you keep whatever items/money you collected that day which is stored in your room.The gameplay is repetitive (you're repeating days), but you choose different dialogue/actions to try and complete different quests. The puzzles are complex, but the game has a ""Hints"" menu to help guide you a bit. If you mess up, you can either restart the entire day, or you can restart the current room/class period you're in which is really helpful.My only complaint is that there's no ""Skip Dialogue"" button; dialogue can be a little long sometimes and it'd be nice to skip it especially when you've heard the same lines 50 times.The main quests took me about 5 hours; I still have cards I could collect. Definitely a fun little game for $5. Don't think I'd play it from scratch again, but would love to watch friends play and see their reactions."

I ended up playing it for 4 hours not even realizing how long it had been. I can honestly say, from a pretty picky person when it comes to indie/low budget games, this game was quite good. I liked the open endedness and variety of missions and possibilities. At first it didn't make much sense but I ended up really liking it. If you have $5 and are looking for an entertaining time killer, I would defintely reccomend this game. 9/10. Only thing that I wish was that the cards you pick up did something."
,Recommended,589590,33152299,Posted: 2 July,all,reckonerX,"I picked this up on a whim, thinking... hell, can't be awful for $4. Then I wound up getting four hours of gameplay out of it!The game is deceptively simple: you're stuck in a Groundhog Day-style loop, reliving the same Monday over and over. Every day there are phases: before school, morning class, lunch, recess, and show & tell. Your mission is to try to figure out how to uncover the weird stuff going on at the school.When you complete one of the NPC's storylines, you unlock a permanent item that stays with you when the day loops over. As you complete more and more of the NPC quests, you'll get more and more items. Then you'll have to use those items in order to finally beat the game.It's dead simple, but the ""same day"" loop makes this feel very much like a puzzle game. How do you get that one character to be in a certain room at lunch? How do you ensure somebody will have the item you need by recess? How can you earn as much money as possible before the day ends? Though it's simple, the adventure/puzzle aspect of the game really works.The writing is funny, the characters are absurdly over the top. Gore and cursing and abortion and drug abuse and more. The game is definitely not for kids, but it doesn't really feel like it's trying too hard."

First off, you should know that Sean's games typically are usually not in Early Access long. This one is apparently for the most part done, with just bugs and smoothing rough edges left. I think it needs an ending, or so I've heard.Ok, how to describe this?Essentially, you are playing through a day as a child in kindergarten, but the day loopsGroundhog Day-style.It is dialogue heavy. You have an inventory, and make choices such as who to be friends with, and what to do with items.Part of the 'game' is learning what is the 'game' and how to play it.I'll leave it at that.A few things you should know. The music is good, although a bit repetitive. Just like the movieGroundhog Day, this game can be repetitive and is probably best played in spurts. Try to finish one run, then take a break kind-of-thang.It really shines with the humor - I laughed out loud several times and thats not typical for me.Pros:+Utterly fresh; I've not played anything like this - and I love that it takes risks and blazes a very unique path+It knows its scope and size and doesn't over-reach+Humor is outstanding+Makes me smile while playing+It's fun figuring out what 'the game' is+Too cheap+Controller supportCons:-Repetitive by nature (the mechanic is built around this)-Music could use some polish/variety-Probably not much replay value when you finish it, but thats ok because it's quite cheapIf you love indie games, please pick this up and support a genuinely great developer who delivers."

76561198355036865,Recommended,589590,32440638,Posted: 15 June,all,SealieP,"If you like this type of game, it's incredibly fun and enjoyable.  I loved it.The basic premise is that you play one day of Kindergarten over and over again altering your choices and getting different outcomes.  The plotlines are amusing and disturbing seeing as how you're playing a 5 year old.  You have several quests to do which means you do the quest in one day and finish it correctly.  There is also an overarching quest that you will collect pieces for throughout your play and later on exclusively for those pieces.  Each of the characters you interact with has quirks and as you play and choose different dialog options or other actions you will learn these quirks and discover hints to help you along the different quests.Some things about the game:It took me about 5 hours to complete the game.  I did look up help with a few bits and pieces so if you don't do that expect around 6 hours of playtime for one game.While some things must be done in a very specific order and precisely accurate, I did find a few places where you could change how you did things and still get the desired outcome.You can restart the room you are in if you make a mistake.  I loved this because sometimes I just misclicked and didn't want to have to start the entire day over again.  However, there are times when you get to the end of the day and realize you screwed up in the beginning and MUST start the day over again.  It can be a bit frustrating, but you are actually going to do the day over about 20 to 30 times.  Plus you'll have restarts that don't count which might increase that to about 40 times.The game is all about learning how the characters react to what you say, what items you have on you, and WHEN you talk to them.  So it really is trial and error and going down that mental checklist of, 'have I done this that way yet?'It is repetitive, but I never found it boring repetitive.  Each character quest feels very different.You get hints from the game that you can look over for help and you have a task list for each room as you go through the day to help you remember what you need to do with your quests.I honestly don't have many negatives other than I'm sad it's over.  I've started another game so I can replay it.  I'm not sure how many times I'll replay it before it wears out though.I highly recommend this game.  You'll love the characters, or love having them killed, and hopefully find it funny how many different ways you can get your character killed."

You're a little kid that trying to uncover stories of your fellow classmates and teachers. Each of them seems to want someone dead. If you messed up, you are going to die, I mean shot in the face, stabbed by the janitor, getting blow up, and etc dead. The good news is Monday always repeats and you'll start your life again if you get killed. The bad news is Monday ALWAYS repeats! It's like this is hells playground, you have to figure out the mysteries or you're stuck here forever!Pros:- Funny deaths- Cute sprites- Weird humor?- Reminds me of South ParkCons:- Quests can be too hard to figure outNeutral:- Bugs, it's in early development after allYou would think these kindergarten kids are innocent until you talk to them!

76561198142003271,Recommended,589590,31189064,Posted: 16 April,all,darklight_catcher,"Kindergarten. The gateway to hell. Where show and tell is a battle to survive, the teacher really is out to get you, and Monday never ends. Literally--Tuesday does not exist in this game. I don't remember Kindergarten being this hard.What starts off as a seemingly cute and charming school scene gets dark rather quickly, and for all that you have to fear from the downright sadistic and unchild-friendly staff harboring dark secrets, it is the antics of the classmates you will be forced to call allies that comes off as more disturbing. It kind of says something when even the obvious evil and violent tendencies of the principal or janitor pale in comparison to that of your ""good"" classmates who almost gleefully encourage you to perform increasingly horrible tasks and even outright murder. This game isn't only filled with Videogame Cruelty Potential, it's where I imagine the trope went to learn its trade. And no, the fact that these are children will not protect you or anyone else. You can be killed. You can also kill or cause the deaths or trauma of the people you encounter. You can get one of your classmates beaten to severe hospitalization with a mop or cause another two to attempt suicide. Taunt a classmate about thier broken home or gain their trust only to stab them in the back (or face) later. Or even wipe out your entire class much to the cackling glee of your teacher. You know, for kids!Ultimately you have to undergo every potential storyline in order to make it to the ""true"" ending and discover what's really going on at the school (well, partly at least, there is no explanation for Nugget). All in all, it was incredibly easy to complete the game within 8 hours, but those were 8 very fun-filled hours. Trying to figure out which set actions and events could get me which results was trying and frustrating at points, but the humor and storylines (mostly the humor) made it well worth it.The cons are that it is short and can get repetitive. You have to complete each ""path"" in order to get what you will need to reach the true ending, meaning you have to keep replaying the same day over and over again and do some very questionable things in order to progress. It's a lot of trial and error to figure out what to do for each person's path and you can only reset back to the start of the class period to try again if you mess up unless you want to play the entire day all over again--which you will have to do if you missed something from earlier on in the day. Fortunately, since each playthrough can be completed in a relatively short amount of time, there isn't too much you have to go through to get back to where you need to be. In addition, you can pass time immediately if you want to end the day quickly and get extra money doing so, and you'll be fine as long as you have something acceptable to present for Show and Tell at the end of the day. Money and certain unlockable items can be carried over in each playthrough, and once you have these items, they will remain unlocked and you don't have to try to get them again (unless you want to).Another issue is that the game is still in Early Access. There are still a number of bugs and glitches in the game, and some features aren't available yet. I've had occasions where I would try to reset to the beginning of a class period only to be told upon doing so that the bell just rang and class is over--requiring a second reset of the class period in order to return to the beginning and play normally. These issues are still being worked on, and it's questionable when the game will be completed and all aspects corrected. Even so, you can get through the overall plot, complete every person's questline, and obtain all of the Monstermon cards as it stands currently.All in all, the game is fairly short and while the playthroughs can get repetitive, with all the options available, that's not to say they are tedious--though you do have to be careful with the dialogue options to have specific outcomes be made available that aren't otherwise obvious. For $5, it's a cute and disturbing but all around fun game."

The hints can make it kind of obvious, but if there were no hints, there's no way anyone could reasonably finish the game.

I saw Jack playing it and figured I'd give it a try for myself, and it's as cool as he made it look. Sure, it's unconventional, especially considering it takes place in kindergarten, but in my opinion, games are supposed to break the barriers of logic and normality on occasion. Think of this game as one giant puzzle that needs solving. It's funny, clever, and I admit, once I got things going, it was just a blast.

The price is great, the early access is a lovely privelege and the game actually is so engaging. I don't want to spoil it, so just give it a try it's worth every single cent. I like the art style of the game, very simple yet super effective and it fits the theme superbly. There isn't much I don't like, the controls were kind of hard for me to get used to but they can be changed so, so far I am enjoying this with no major hangups. Also... major tip! For anyone who does have the game in order to progress in the day after taking all of the actions you want to take you have to hit enter. It will get rid of your apples but also give you twenty five cents for each apple you sell and the next event will happen when you have no more apples!"

,Not Recommended,589590,33324445,Posted: 6 July,all,Techbane,"Kindergarten is a mostly entertaining, twisted little narrative that's priced about right. The dialogue stands out, the art serves its function and while you spend 95% of the game listening to a single music loop, it's somehow just the right amount of upbeat, catchy, and discordant with the chaos unfolding around it, while managing not to be grating. I did, pound for pound, enjoy it. So why the thumbs down?(TLDR: A 'meh' ending and several design flaws that get worse the farther you play. The thumbs down is more to signal that this is a critical review if you're looking for counterpoints to unconditional praise.)Because amidst a perhaps misrepresentatively overwhelming sea of positive reviews and what Ididenjoy about the game, there are some rather pronounced flaws in its framework that add up toinsaneartificial inflation of playtime, and REALLY start to wear on you if you're going for the 100% ending. I want to highlight these for both anyone gauging their interest pre-purchase, and perhaps the devs too should they see this.The first and biggest problem is that while some of the individual stories and characters are engaging, the overall narrative falls flat with an extremely predictable (regular) ending, an equally predictable and underwhelming secret ending that serves as little more than a sequel hook, and some characters' questlines (particularly Jerome's) feel artificial, existing for little more reason than to give you an unlock to further the narrative. Perhaps one of the more intriguing aspects of the game is that it takes place in a short groundhog loop which somehow allows you to save special items to use on subsequent loops, but neither the loop itself nor this exploitation of it are ever acknowledged or addressed in the story.The second problem is that after you've run through the game a few times, you'll quickly feel your brain start to glaze over as you hammer through the dialogue trees you're familiar with. With how intensely dialogue-heavy the game is, it is EXTREMELY annoying to have to wait half a second or so between each line of dialogue you're allowed to skip. It doesn't seem like much, but consider that you'll probably go through a hundred-plus lines of dialogue on most runs and that adds upfast.I feel like my 9 hours to complete the game could probably have been shortened to 5 or 6 if the text prompts were more prompt. On top of which the dialogue also ties into everybody's favourite...The third problem: needlessly cryptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You canprobablyfigure out enough of the game firsthand to get the regular ending without using guides, but theutterly labyrinthinedialogue trees hide many more secrets than you would think. These are of course concealed by a literal minefield of ""wrong answer and you die"" or ""lack an item and you die (but there's not always a hint that you COULD have survived with the right item)"" situations. Such feats as unlocking playing card #3 would probably require an actual series of flowcharts to figure out yourself. There are ""reset current room"" and ""reset day"" options, the former of which is only of any use if you IMMEDIATELY realize you screwed up, as you'll frequently realize halfway through the day that you didn't bring enough cash to school and have to start over... or realize that you botched something in thepreviousroom which you cannot reset to... or you'll realize immediately that you messed up, but be thrust into the next room before you can reset. The difficulty curve is extremely uneven with the first few questlines available to you actually being some of the most complex to finish. To its credit, the game features a built-in hint system that gradually unlocks tips for advancing based on certain flags as you attempt, succeed, and fail to complete certain tasks. Unfortunately...The fourth problem: the game is still kind of buggy. You're unlikely to hit any real showstoppers, but aside from mostly cosmetic stuff like some characters referring to others as though they were in Condition A when they are in Condition B, a surprising number of the all-important hints never seem to unlock by attempting, failing, or stumbling around the task to which they refer, and will only unlockretroactively after you have already completed the relevant task.Some of the hints are also decidedly unhelpful, such as telling you you have to shank Character C during X time of day, withoutanyindication of the crazy web of events and dialogue trees you may never have even seen to get the prompt for that to appear.Like I said, I still enjoyed it. It was worth a few bucks. The flaws aren't that pronounced, until you hit a stopping point and don't always have much to go on to figure it out. When that happens, though, it gets aggravating fast."

It's fun to just walk around and try out all the many, many options you have, and then maybe trying out a quest by yourself. Other times you just wanna look at a walkthrough becuase it can be quite challengingYou have a certain ammount of actions you can do in each room and sometimes you can go through the ENTIRE quest, then find out you needed to buy this one item in the first room so you have to re-do the whole dya. That can be annoying, but once you finally do it the satisfaction is much better, and I think it adds more fun value.

,Recommended,589590,33675272,Posted: 20 July,all,Lord Revonworc,"First of all, I want to say that this game is weird.In a good way, though. It's creative, and unique, and like nothing you've ever seen before.In Kindergarten, you play as a boy going to kindergarten. But, shortly after you'll discover that there is more to this game than just going to kindergarten. Perhaps you'll talk to the lonely little girl and discover that her brother has gone missing. Maybe you'll talk to the weird little boy and learn that the principal is handing out drugs. Maybe you'll talk to the janitor and learn... that he's a man of his word. Whatever you do, you should find out quickly that something is not right with this school.Kindergarten is an adventure game... in a sense. The gameplay revolves around collecting and using objects in order to advance the various quests you get from characters around the school. Most of them have some quest you need to complete and rewards you with an item needed to complete another quest down the line, and the story, for the most part, is aimed at trying to uncover the mystery of what happened to the missing kid.That being said, neither the gameplay nor the story, is really the reason to play this game. The reason to play it is the humor. A lot of it comes down to just how twisted this school really is. You could be playing house with one of you classmates, and the next thing you know, she'll be berating you for your alcoholism, and you'll be asking her for a divorce.And, yes. Children can die in game. In fact, several of the quests require you to kill certain people around the school to progress. Which would be horrifying in a normal setting, but these children are not sweet and innocent by any stretch of the concept. Some are downright unapologetically cruel to the point where you want to see them die, and this mixed with the insanity of the setting and the clever way they're done leaves most of the death scenes still quite entertaining to watch... for the most part. A few deaths maybe go a bit far, but those are in the minority. Though it's also worth noting that the humor is also deeply rooted in the dialogue. It's usually worth looking through all the dialogue options just to see what sort of things people will say, and how they react to certain events.Now, for those of you out there who think this makes the game sound too macabre, messed up, and shocking to be enjoyable... it really isn't. The cartoony pixel art graphics of the game keeps anything from getting too graphic, and there's no real prolonged suffering from anyone (with one exception)... just weird and whacky death scenes surrounded by genuinely funny dialogue.I bought the game while it was in early access, and even back then, I realized that the game felt polished enough to be a full game if the developers just stopped updating it. And they haven't stopped yet, either, even though it's out of early access.All in all, Kindergarten was a very enjoyable experience. The only real downside to me was that it involved a lot of trial and error, and one death was a bit too much... albeit that one particular death is actually avoidable. (when Cindy asks you to get something gross from the Janitor's closet, grab the note instead of the bucket... you'll thank me later) Still, despite the handful of flaws, this game is still very enjoyable to play through, and I highly recommend it."
,Recommended,589590,34875852,Posted: 10 September,all,Yoongicorn,A fun and entertaining game to enjoy for a few hours. The animation is good and acts as a kind of good juxtaposition to the tone that the game has. At times it was a little bit frustrating trying to work out exactly what needed to be done but overall I did enjoy the element to it. It's a game to be enjoyed as something rather quirky and different because you don't expect kids (and the staff) to be acting the way that they do. The story isn't really anything major but luckily that isn't a game that depends heavily on its story to sell it. Instead it's the diffferent zany personalities of the characters that makes it so interesting to play through (and who doesn't love watching them all die in different ways haha).But yeah it's a good definitely especially considering that it costs less than £5

It's got an Invader Zim ""gruesome horror hidden in plain sight but everyone except you is too stupid or apathetic or medicated to notice"" feel, while being bright and peppy and sugary sweet. It tackles the complexity of player choices by having the day reset after the end of every day except for your money (up to $10) and key items, which makes it a series of puzzles you solve with dialog trees and the resources you got from previous playthroughs. Very compelling. There are a lot of trial and error and deaths you weren't warned about beforehand, but it then tells you why you died and how to avoid it in the future, and no death sets you back more than a couple of minutes. Worth more than 2 hrs satisfaction if you want to solve the deeper murder mystery story or if you're the completionist type.Oh, and don't eat strange nuggets."

This game is really twisted.At the end of the day your main aim is to collect the YU-GI-OH knock off called Monstermon and find what ever happened to this kid called Billy.Also its Grounds-hog day, So enjoy seeing Monday.GamePlayThe game is very colourful, but don’t let that fool you for what is hidden under is twisted carpet.While taking control of “The Kid” your aim to repeat and never ending amount of Monday to help find Billy and the given tasks that you will get from the characters in this game.The game itself is a simple choice game, with some exploration while only small, so expect to see the same rooms over and over as you will be repeating the same Monday.Each Monday your other Mondays are forgotten, so take this chance to correct what choices you did wrong and complete the task for each character once a task for a person is complete (Eg. Cindy) You will get an award at the end, this can help complete other task and you get to keep it. (These Awarded Items are given at the end of the Monday you completed the task in and are kept though each Monday you Start) Each time a choice is chosen in the game you will be wasting an apple (You have five for each time period of the school) Use these wisely as wasting them could mean a reset of the game as they are needed for tasks.There is also Money and a vendor so… That easy to what you use that for, but also the money can be used to Complete tasks too.My ThoughtsThis is a very interesting game, with funny dialogue and one hell of a twisted school to be placed in.You will find most of the children are an odd bunch of Kids, all with there own personality and twisted agendas and I can not forget the adults, we have a:Mrs. Applegate: teacher only here for her Pay check.Janitor: A really old and Twisted Minded Janitor,Who will kill Children with his mop, Do not tick Him off.The Principal: Not much is Known about him, But when you see himYou might get shotWith this interesting bunch of characters this is were the game shines, The more days you pass the more you will see repeated chat boxes, this can change if the right option is chosen, But be wary some choices can lead to drastic situations and it is up to you to find them out.ScoreWhat can I say I am enjoying the game and I feel there is more to go with this early assess title as the game has yet to be completed, but for the price I spent for it (£3.99) I will say:PLAY ITHere is a Youtube Video on me Playing the Game:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKtWEJoSMkM"

This game is all of them, in a manic and fun romp through childhood difficulties!If you're a fan of Shin Chan, with a solid dash of Kenny's fate in South Park, this is the game for you.Some of the jokes in here had me howling with laughter.Others had me groaning in (appreciative) disgust.No single moment of this game can be called boring.PROS:You can play it all within a few hours.You can play it in little bursts.There is no WRONG way to play.The little jokes, and hidden stories are AMAZINGLY well done for something so simple.Dark humour throughoutIt takes thought, trial and error, and intuition to play without guidanceThis is not a game of obvious solutions.DEFINITELY not a kids game.""Ms. Jigglytits""The most hilarious death dialogue I've seen since the old Sierra days (and actually helpful, too).No moment of this is without humour. Sincerely. Even the most efffed-up moments of this game have that little chuckle, right there, just waiting until the next line.CONS:My ONLY con for this, having done all the available (Early Access) stories, and all the cards.....is that to do it all, it is somewhat repetitive. This means you can mindlessly SLAM through some areas, but I could easily see some being mind-numbing. I think, discounting days of just running around to refresh the piggy bank, it took me about 16-18 'days' to complete everything and obtain all the cards.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this game. It was a delightful forray into the zany childhood trauma that is Kindergarten....in Hades."

Can't wait to see the secret bit for collecting all 25 cards!*The new ending added in the card update confirms a new gameKindergarten 2WHICH I CANNOT WAIT FOR!A Bit About The Game - Warning Spoilers May OccurYou are achild in kindergarten,hence from the title. A kid namedBillyhas gone missing; his friend and his sisterNuggetandLily(respectively)""knows who knows"".You complete missions from each character:Buggs, Cindy, Monty, Jerome, Nugget, Ms. Applegate and Lily, in which you gain items from them as you complete them.Note, some missions require you to obtain an item which you receive from a different mission.Each mission is unique and provides different routes and dialogues.The Janitor will impale you with his mop if you continue to bug him; as long as you dont have an item to get you out of the situation. Similarily, the principal will shoot you if you say the wrong things.You can buy items fromMontyproviding you have the money. One thing I disliked about the game was you can only have $10 in your piggy bank at home, however it does solve the problem of everyone completing Monty's mission too easily:You need $20 dollars at the end of the day (after show and tell) to complete the mission, bearing in mind Buggs will steal half of your money you bring to Kindergarten (if you bring over $3). To complete this mission, you should buy the yo-yo and screwdriver from Monty before morning time and then talk to Nugget and get sent to the Principal's office. During morning time you can sell the pills you got from the Principal and give Jerome the yo-yo: in which he then gives you a stolen hall pass for you to go to the Janitors closet. inside there is a box with $5, then unscrew the shelf and get out of there. You know have a hall pass to sell and you also gained $5. Skip through the rest of the day to earn more money.The ending will surprise you, however I will not include it in the review, you should really buy the game to find out yourself. The game is great! There si a secret thing at the end in nuggets cave when you get all the cards. But this has not been released yet, and I am waiting to see it for myself.

Although it isn't long, there is a nice collection bonus that pads the run time -- that's actually rewarding to complete. The characters are whacky and you'll love and hate all of them in turn. If you're looking for a violent kindergarten similator -- or if that's something you never realized you needed until reading that phrase, dig in!So while the characters were fun and the story was interesting and rewarding to puzzle together, the game did have a few flaws. Namely the text. The text is humorous and brief--the first time. But when you go 4/5 on a character's storyline and want to blaze through / skip the dialogue you've already run through you're out of luck, more or less. You can speed up the text but skipping it is still a time ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Especially at the end, as I was finishing the card collection, resetting the days and going through the dialogue felt very tiresome.On a different note, the puzzles were almost without exception ridiculously easy to solve. However there was one that I encountered that stumped me for an exceptionally long time (Monty's storyline). That's when you really feel the burn of combing through dialogue repeatedly to get to all the different possibilities and finally find a solution. The reset room button helps this somewhat, but if you make a mistake and think you're okay to advance but that crucial item was in the room before it--you're out of luck. Have fun waiting through all the dialogue again.So TL;DR:Pro: Original, fun, funny, interesting characters, and a full circle storyline.Con: If you get stuck you're in a dialogue nightmare of no escape"

Otherwise, theres only a couple bugs i can see, mainly in the cafeteria, and the music could use a little bit more variety. A very promising game, and the best $5 i've spent in a while :D"

You play as a kindergartner trying to befriend others like the teacher, psychotic principal, janitor and other students alike. The dark humour and adult jokes can give you a chuckle at times as well.

I have completed the entire story and found almost all the collectable cards in less than five hours. Hopefully, the developer will update this game and add-on new days of the week to completely make this game more open and fun.Overall, this game is awesome, and I totally think everyone should try it, especially with it's low price of only little over five dollars.Amazing!"

LOL!If you don't like inventory puzzles and dialogue trees, then don't bother with this one.  BUT, if you do or if you're on the fence, the story is wonderfully clever, the oddly lighthearted dark humor is genuinely whimsical (spoiler alert: I got a real laugh the first time I was unexpectedly shot), and the gameplay is solid.  It's an adventure game that tests your patience, but has more than enough story to make you want to 100% for the ""good"" ending, even while you curse at it."

76561198059342678,Recommended,589590,32515023,Posted: 17 June,all,Jake Mistake,"For a more in-depth review, you can check out the video below:https://youtu.be/-74-kc7tHCAOtherwise, here’s a highly summarized pros and cons list after a primer about the game.PrimerKindergarten is an abstract puzzle adventure game. You play as an unnamed kid who has the power to relive the same day over and over again and you go around helping the other children (the puzzle element) in the Kindergarten which, by extension, sheds some light on the establishment’s secrets.Pros1. Simple but entertaining characters- unique personalities that, while not memorable, were entertaining for the course of the game nonetheless- provide subplots that tie into the main storyline in the end.2. Engaging puzzle mechanics- Puzzles come in the form of helping characters with their quests- Puzzles require the use of resources like money and time (in the form of apples)- Puzzles require a good degree of trial and error and backtracking and it’s pretty satisfying when you figure something out for Puzzle A when you’re just talking to random people.- Game rewards you for gathering information first instead of trying to tackle puzzles from the get go. Encourages a more patient playstyleCons1. Repetitive backtracking- While backtracking is fine, having to see the same scenes over and over again ruin the pacing a little. Would like the ability to fast forward past these scripted events because otherwise it makes them unnecessarily slow.2. Basic visuals- Not a huge criticism taking into account the game’s price but it should be noted. The title often looks a little outdated due to the recycled animations and pixel artstyle.ConclusionKindergarten may not have a deep story or the best presentation, but manages to deliver a unique puzzle solving experience through both its setting and execution. I would definitely recommend this game at full price."

,Recommended,589590,32805442,Posted: 26 June,all,A P E I R Ο N,"I bought this during the Steam Summer Sale and to be quite honest, I did not expect to enjoy this game as much as it did. I felt as if I laughed more than I should have with its dark humor and gory-ish scenes. But this was a nice change of pace for me since I normally play FPS games. Mixed with a type of comedy and puzzle game, it was great playing even though it did not last very long. One downside I had was how repetetive the game can get. It's just a minor reason, but it got annoying once and a while each time I mess up and had to restart. This isn't much of a problem but more of a preference, but I disliked how I couldn't use the D-Pad on my controller to move around. It's such a small issue, but it bothered me because I don't really use the analog sticks for movement unless it's a racing game. I'm currently trying to get a 100% completion with the achievements and such.Overall, I'd rate this game an 8/10 because of the pure enjoyment I got out of it.[SPOILERS]One thing I thought was difficult for this game was how confusing everything would get in each quest. I eventually had to resort to finding a walkthrough to get through some levels, such as gettingThe Secret Devicefrom thePrinciplefor Nugget's mission orgetting enough moneyfor Monty tomake the keyon his mission. I think in the future I will make my own walkthrough of the decisions I made in the game because I know everyone does it differently and also since the game has been updated."

There are also ""monsterman cards"" in the game which serve as a collectible item which again draws you in to keep on playing and searching for them (I also believe that there is an achievement for collecting all of them) The story starts off relatively innocent and cute and quickly derails (i mean this in a good way) to a complete mess.

This game is so over the top and I didn't stop laughing once I got into the game.  The characters crack me up.  The items you can find and buy are amazing.  Why on earth there is a kindergartner peddling cigarettes and yo-yos is beyond me but I enjoy it.Got beat to death by a Janitor then fell down a hole.10/10 Would dump blood on a little girls head again.

Not always immediately obvious, but easily solvable when given a bit of thought.There are a couple of bugs, but nothing completely game-breaking (and some got fixed the very next day anyway).I don't buy into early access unless the product is currently worth the money spent. At its current state in early access, I would consider this a solid buy at $5. It is very much a completed game, with just a bonus ending yet to be released."

I saw a couple thumbnails of Youtubers playing this game and thought,""Eh, Ive got 10 dollars left in my wallet, I can always return it."" SOOOOOO glad I didn't. The game starts out a bit odd if you dont know what your doing at first, but once you start to unlock the hints in game your direction and game choices become clearer and easier to follow. Whether your going to play for the Teacher and ""eliminate"" all other students, or be the best boyfriend ever, there is always something new and fun to do. The game also features a set of 25 small trading cards(called Monsterman Cards) and each one is earned by hunting them out or doing some VERY obscure and odd things that you would never do IRL(like, who goes back for thirds on Slop?!?!) The game is shorter than other games, I beat it with all the steam achieves in 5 or 6 hours with no online help(barring one time when i had no idea what ""stab the bully and get his stash"" meant). All in all I give it a 9/10 and would highly recommend playing this without watching any videos online first.P.S.

It seems like most people enjoy it a lot so it may just be on me but I thought I'd leave a review for the sake of other impatient people out there. You end up having to backtrack through a lot of the game to do the right actions. This means going through dialogue you have seen dozens of times before while mashing the button to skip through it. Unfortunately it doesn't let you skip through dialogue very quickly. So it was just too much time wasted on getting back to a particular point for me to say I enjoyed the game. It's a shame because outside of that it was a fun and interesting game. Just a mechanic/design choice that killed it for me.

The game is challenging, but you are  given lots of hints to help you out. The game is so simple and it accomplishes what it trys to do flawlessly. Something that annoys me about the dialouge is that when you talk to someone and press the talk button again to make the rest of the dialouge finish printing, there's a slight delay before you're response options show up. It's annoying because in many cases I'm repeating actions I've already done, and I've memorized which responses to choose, so that delay just wastes my time. Other than that, the game is really good!"

,Recommended,589590,31046328,Posted: 9 April,all,☯ ackwell,"It's a bit rough being early access and all - there are bugs here and there. You might get stuck in dialogues or accidentally select the wrong option because game didn't register your cursor (it seems to register it once you move the cursor, but defaults to the first option in the list even if you have your cursor ""pre-hovered"" over the option you want to pick and click LMB).Disregarding the bugs this game is pretty great. Entertaining and at times shocking(ly funny), with puzzles that become challenging due to the dependancies some puzzles have on each other. It can get frustrating when at the end of a big puzzle you realize you've missed/forgot about one small detail and have to start over again, but it doesn't ruin the game or anything.With a price tag of €5 this is definitely worth it if you like puzzles, funny dialogue, and dark comedy."

Except for the collectables and bonus ending (that's not even in the game yet) and to be honest this game is a waste of time. The plot is meh. Bugs are in the game and can vary from just broken visuals and animations to game breaking bugs which make you unable to control your character.6/10. Killing kids is fun. Would recommend.

There are a million other ways the creator could have presented that plot line without making it seem like women (who dramatically under report♥♥♥♥♥♥because of fear of reprisal and public shame) simply make up stories about their sexual assault to get boys in trouble. It's a dangerous myth.I would have given it a positive review otherwise.EDIT: I'm getting a lot of backlash for this review, so for those interested here are some actual statistics with sources.The United States Department of Justice estimates 8% of Sexual Assault Accusations are made falsely, with other government agencies reporting as little as 2% and virtually all research reporting less than 10%. That means at least 90% and more likely between 92% and 98% of reported Sexual Assaults occured as reported. According to the Department of Justice 2 out of 3 Sexual Assaults go unreported and of those unreported sexual assaults 20% did not report because they feared retaliation and 13% believed the police would not do anything to help and 30% further refused to give a reason for not reporting their attack. Sexual Asssault impacts all genders, and men are significantly less likely to report sexual assault out of fear of public shame and retaliation. False Accusations are often misreported in criminal justice reports as they are usually lumped in with ""undetermined"" or ""unfounded"". Being too late for a♥♥♥♥♥♥Kit test or being unable to afford a♥♥♥♥♥♥Kit test constitutes a large portion of ""unfounded"" sexual assault cases. According to the DoJ of every 1000 reported cases of sexual assault in 994 of those cases the perpetrator will walk free. Do the math. That means for roughly every 1 ""false accusation"" there are 27 actual sexual assaults and 26 if not all 27 of those perpetrators will go free, with only 9 of them being reported to begin with because of the victims fear that they will be retaliated against or have their case dismissed by police as ""unfounded"".If you're interested in getting involved to help survivors of sexual assault or if you yourself are a victim of sexual assault know that you are not alone and there are people who can help. Search for the National Sexual Assault Hotline or the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Abuse & Incest National network (RAINN) online. In an emergency please always call 911 or visit a hospital as soon as possible.https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-systemi.

Yeah, it sounded pretty stupid to me as well, and trust me, it is, but that's what makes this game amazing. This game is recommended for those who enjoy over the top characters, dialogue that would make anyone shocked that someone could even come up with this stuff, and enraging moments where you realize you must restart the whole day. This game is kind of a rage game, as for if you forgot to do something and made it all the way to the end, you'll have to restart your whole day and do the whole thing again. This may make the game seem super tedious, but when you do advance the story and do things correctly, it makes you feel really smart! The story is really interesting, as for you must do certain quests to get items and use the items you get to complete other certain quests. This is interesting, but once again, makes the game very repetitive and gets annoying after a while. To sum it all up, Kindergarten is an extremely over the top game that could drive you insane, but still has all of it's funny and intuitive moments to make playing it worth while. I would rate 7/10."

Kindergarten can be described with 1 word ''PERFECT''. Kindergarten has 8 different storylines that need a lot of patient to finish cuz if u miss something in the storyline u lose it all and u can lose even your life. In its early access the game has only some items, 8 achievements and 8 storylines for all the achievements (after a storyline it will give u achievement). So i think after the early access there will be SO MUCH MORE to play in the game and the game should be way more than 5euro.10/10 - one of the most enjoyable games ever. Should u buy it? - definitely.Got exploded doing the horse riddler. Got shot by the principal. Got beat up by a bully to death. Died falling in a hole. Almost died from a poisoned nugget.

Its core mechanic revolves around repeating the same day over and over again in order to complete a series of tasks in the correct order.When hearing about this game, I thought the gimmick would grow old and frustrating fast. Luckily, the short duration of days and the huge amount of hints given to the player make it very fun and encouraging to try new things to get different results. Its wacky and try-hard offensive humor also makes it really fun to play and mess around. I only wish that you could more quickly skip through dialogue and cutscenes, as it can become really tiring seeing the same ones over and over again, especially if you're going for all the collectibles.Kindergarten is a great, funny, and fun little puzzle game that anyone could easily get lost in for a few hours.

I feel super glad that this was the first game on Steam that I finally have beaten, (Since I usually only play Rocket League) and it has also let me to laughs and awes.  I have to admit, I did see the ending to the game, but what I didn't expect was those creepy white monsters.  Saving Billy was the best achievement of the game, so I don't know how the creators can possibly add on to the game.  I would definetly buy the second game if I got the chance to.For those of you that gave negative reviews, I am really disappointed in you.  By far, this is one of the best Steam games that I have ever played, and I hope that it stays that way.  Paying the five dollars for this game was worth it, and if they did have any updates to it, I suggest that you play it quickly.  I wish I did some youtube videos for the game, but instead, I just watch Jacksepticeye, and if I need help on Monsterman cards, then Bubble Knight Gaming.The Best Parts Of The Game: Becoming friends with Nugget and going into the Nugget Cave was one of my favorite parts, not because it led me closer to Billy, but because I thought that this was a secret part of the game.  I did not have to look up any YouTube tutorials on how to get there, it was just simply by befriending Nugget when the teacher wanted me to.  There was another way to get to the Nugget Cave without the Ms. Applegate, but I had forgotten it.  The second best was the ending, obviously because I saved Billy, but also because I got clues to find all Monsterman cards.Questions:- Why do the hints appear after you completed finding the Monsterman card, if normally you'd get hints before you find it?- Is there a way for me to get Early Access to the complete version of the second game (If there is one)?- How was the Janitor part of this, and why did he not die when you fought the principal?Anyways, that is my thought on the matter.  If you are considering buying this, I definetly would if I were you.  Okay, thank you and goodbye!"

It's a comedic game that will keep you there for hours.This is definitley not a kids game, so if youre thinking off buying this and you havent watched the trailer please do.The art styler in my opinion is great and the animation is suitable even in early access.The characters have very different characteristics making interacting with each and everyone feel unique.Some answers to things have you scratching your head a lot, some being a little drastic so keep that in mind especially since there arent any guides yet. (you cheating piece of....) On the other end of that stick though... there are a ton of ways to grab the ending you want so i can almost promise you that a playthrough will never replicate itself.The items can be used in a multitude of ways, so grabbing the special items monstermon cards is possible even when running short on time.the gameplay is also unique with apples in the corner limiting how many actions you can do in a given ""level"" if an apple is next to a text box is there you will have to spend one to select it. If you have nothing left to do in a stage press enter to use your remaining apples each one giving you 25 cents this way. There are also ways to get moved to another level without using all your apples so be careful you'll have to figure out that on your own.finally when talking to people EXPAND ALL DIALOGE OPTIONS this is a must since one little change in your answer can have a completly different outcome in the end. I found this part the only tedious part.FOR SHORT VERSION+Gameplay+Art Style+Character+Setting+Repeatability+- Searching for the right path-Exausting certain dialogue repeatedly9.8/10"
76561198010735967,Recommended,589590,31852162,Posted: 19 May,all,Kudryavka,"It's an interesting game, that is kind of like a choose your own adventure story.I say it's only kind of like a choose your own adventure because if you don't go along with one of the seven set stories, then you won't get any choices. Furthermore, if you make a wrong choice during one of the stories, it will end in failure and you'll have to restart the room you were in, or if you were really unlucky, you'll have to redo the entire day again. So really, the game likes to let you think you have a lot of different options, but there's only one preordained path you can go through, and if you deviate at all, you'll fail.That being said, the writing is definitely funny at times, and the over the top violence is definitely shocking the first time you see it. So while it's kind of a bummer that the game is so linear despite not appearing so on the surface, at least you do WANT to go through each story just because of the weird characters and the great dialogue.Honestly, if this game was even ten dollars, I wouldn't recommend it, but for a measy five dollars, it's not bad. I'd say check it out."

76561198050856670,Recommended,589590,32970160,Posted: 28 June,all,Yerm Stypersani Terragon,"i became aware of this game after seeing that a few youtubers started playing it, and was tempted to watch them just to see what it was like. but I decided that it would probably be best to play it blind and just see where it goes, and oh my god did this game surprise me. and i would recommend you do the same if you find yourself curious, because here is a perfect example of a game that just has to be played for yourself. it will not be fun at all to know all the answers going into it. and on that note, this review might have some spoilers, so play the game first before reading onwards.somehow this game manages to cram as many things into it as possible without feeling like the devs just tried to lazily piece something together and push it onto steam, and every mechanic is just cranked up to 150%. this game will kill you in more crazy and unfair ways than Dark Souls. this game includes more illegal activity and crime than a GTA game. this game will have you reseting the game to try different choices more than Undertale. and this game's humor feels like the perfect love child between South Park and a Lego game. not to mention that each character has their own destinct personality that you immediately latch onto within the first half hour. this game nailed everything it was going for presentation-wise. i did notice though that some details are a tiny bit off, and as a guy who has been coding for about a year now, it leads me to believe this is somebody's early work, or even first game. and if it is, dude keep it up, this is fantasic and the industry needs more devs like you around.the story goes like this. you are one of 8 students attending a local kindergarten. one of them has mysteriously gone missing, and the others pretty much want nothing to do with you, a lot like going to actual school. you them discover that the janitor and the principal have been up to some weird stuff... weird, murder-y, type stuff. you them have to assist each of the 6 other students so they give you special items that help you progress further. these tasks will vary from ""oh so thats what i need to do!"" to flat out rage inducing. you sometimes need to elaborately murder students, or teachers, and most of the time you will be dodging dialog options that kill you and make you restart. yeah, this game gets pretty messed up. and one point you even have to pour blood on somebody's head.now onto the actual gameplay. as I said, you will be restarting more times than Undertale, because this game is 90% triggering certai events in the right order to yeild the right results. you could find yourself reseting the same day 20 times just to learn you didnt grab enough money at the start of the game, of there was an item you needed to pick up, or you could have simply chosen the wrong dialog and strayed to the wrong path, forcing you to start over. it gets frustrating beyond belief, but in a good way. every step closer you get to the correct path feels more and more rewarding. for one quest you need to save up $20 in one day, and various events can give you more money, but if you arent sure exactly which ones to trigger, you will have just wasted a day and will have to try all over again. you only get to trigger 5 events per room, and sometimes getting items or moneycould take up 2, 3, or even 4 event triggers. sometimes you need to rigger an event in an earlier room just to have the right item to be able to trigger enough events in a later room. its very trial-and-error based, it forces you to experiment with possibilities, which is why i recommend playing it blind. knowing all the answers will ruin the fun.for some additional notes, this game has full controller support, but it really is up to you which feels more comfortable to use, which is a nice touch. the graphics are simple, you could argue that theyre bad, but i personally loved the style. and there some collectables hidden in the game for all you completionists.Gameplay: 7/10-there really isnt much to be said other than what I stated before. its fun by all means, but Kindergarten is by no means a gameplay driven game. the choices do make for a lot of great possibilities though.Story: 8/10you replay the exact same day over and over again with only special items and money being saved. this removed the risk of permanent consequences and allows you to relive dozens of insane stories. there is a definitive ending though, so dont worry about that.Humor: 8.5/10each character is messed up in their own right, and you cant help but laugh along with it. this game was in no way meant ot be taken seriously. even the name itself ""Kindergarten"" is its own sick joke.Graphics: 7/10pixel graphics with some amatuer although nice visuals.---------------------------Overall: 9/10kindergarten is that perfect blend of insanity, violence, and humor that is great for a good kick. its the brilliantly crafted gems like this that are what make the indie game community shiny. i would highly recommend it"

In addition, it costs so little, though I had more fun with kindergarten than a game that cost quadruple that. That's why I love it. It is simple and is just based around the concept of a child surviving a day in kindergarten and completing missions for people. This game is good for anyone [disclaimer: pixelated blood and gore] and is definitly worth it."

Because you can:1.- Take any actions that use up your stamina2.- Press enter to use stamina to get extra money and move to the next puzzle room or scene.Another thing is, everyday is different and you can do things you didn't do they day before and so on to make different scenarios, maybe that's why the days are kind of short, but it's understandable.The only ""downside"" I see is that, to get certain scenarios to happen, you will replay the same day quite some times if you mess up, you have to do it in a near perfect or perfect run because of the limited stamina you have at your dispossal per room or puzzle room.Btw, you will die a lot if you are experimenting with the choices, but tbh, it's really fun to die in this game!"

I bought this game once before and refunded it, but that's not a comment about the game, and more so my impatience at the time. I'm glad I did because I got it even cheaper on sale. But it is definitely worth the measly 5 dollars they are asking for. There isn't much to do in this game, and you will be repeating the same actions a LOT, but it's really about unraveling the mystery. From what I've gathered so far you're trying to find out what happened to Billy, Lily's brother who went missing. During your first playthrough it will seem that the janitor did it (because he ♥♥♥♥ing murders you) but I can't imagine it's that obvious. It's really hard to explain why this game is good, but if you watch the  video on the homepage and it seems appealing there's a good chance you will enjoy it. Just don't expect much freedom or exploration, that's not what this game is about. Defnitely recommend it though.TL;DR: Groundhog's Day murder mystery in Kindergarten with 0 freedom and exploration.

You repeat the same day over and over trying to solve the mystery of what is going on at the school. Each student has a mission that you must complete to get a permanent item. These items help you complete some of the others quests, and If you dont do them in a certain order you could waste a day. This makes the game very focused on trial and error, which may be a little too aggrivating for some but I found it fine because I am a fan of Lakeview Cabin (GET THAT GAME). Each character gets built up with a story and a personality,and you will find yourself liking all of the characters by the end, even though they might not particularly like you. My only problem with this game is that the story ends on one persons mission, snd the ending is very epic with lots of mysteries revealed, but then you restart and go after the card ending and its not as great as the story ending. It doesn't ruin the game, but it is a little underwhelming, even though there is a nice sequel tease. I have to say this is one of the best games to release this year, so get it."

I mean, unless you want to get all of the collectibles, it's a pretty quick game. The humor is just great and the characters are very unique. The dialogue is spot on and the events that play out are quite funny. Anyways, if you like a nice and fun (slightly dark) indie game, you should buy this."
,Recommended,589590,34804200,Posted: 7 September,all,Giu,"All I have to say is that this game is great. Its quirky humour is worth the price of the game alone. I probably played longer than most as I enjoyed seeing all the outcomes and jokes your own elimination brings (and I had some trouble with the monster cards which I'll mention in a moment). All in all it's a fairly playable game. It's not exactly super easy but you do get rewarded with hints and plot points with every time you fail your quest for friendship. The only thing that caused me some trouble was getting a handful of the harder monstermon cards. Some of it made sense others were hard to guess even with the hints. I was worried that the payoff wouldn't be worth the couple hours it took for me to find them all but the secret ending was worth it. It's not the funniest joke and is more akin to trolling but I had a good laugh out of it personally.All and all you should really get this game, it's a great thing to whittle away at for several hours and the quirky style is just fabulous."

It's funny, it's cheap, and you can kill all of your classmates. It will net you a few hours of entertainment but after that you will probably forget its in your library. Regardless, it's fun for the price and is worth playing at least until you finish the storyline."

I wanted to click back and watch it, but I thought I'd grab it on Steam to try it myself. I'm really glad I did.This game is essentially a flowchart. You don't play this game to enjoy the mechanics, you play it to ferret out just another hidden line of great dialogue. It's a maze where every turn leads to something genuinely funny, albeit probably game-ending.I finished this game in just about three hours. 100%, Card Ending. This game isn't a mountain of content, but I'd gladly have paid ten dollars for the same experience. Checking out the devs' other games next weekend, this is a good thing."

The way I try to 'sell' this game to my friends is, ""It's like if the tasks in Majora's Mask to help people were it's own game, but mixed with the movie Groundhog Day.""It's Monday and you're the new kid in a school where bad stuff goes on, it's always Monday. The day is split into around five different segments, each with their own set of objectives. Each segment is a different part of the school day and each subsequent segment has objectives that differ depending on how you interact with the other students/faculty. At the end of the day you may be rewarded with a special item for your actions, along with collectible cards and money are the only things that carry over. Everything else is just as it was on Monday, your first day of school."
