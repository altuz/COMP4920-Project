,Not Recommended,589760,30422486,Posted: 10 March,all,KRiSX,"Love the idea of this game, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired... The ""Australian"" setting really rubs me the wrong way being an Australian myself and makes me just feel plain awkward... badly used Australian slang all over the place...That aside, working the the cars seems like a very simplified version of Car Mechanic Simulator, it's ""ok"" at best... then there's driving the cars... oh boy... a simulation this is not... I like that they have support for using a controller to drive, but using the right analogue stick to accelerate is criminal...What I'm saying is, this game is not worth the asking price... sorry devs..."
,Not Recommended,589760,30495389,Posted: 13 March,all,Pyrlix,"There is a lot of potential in this game, but damn... sadly too many issues.The cars drive like a boat, very clunky. Unrefined driving physics. Repairing feels very unintuitive, imagine playing Car Mechanic Simulators with no helpers and a pair of boxing gloves on your hands.My car was not driving because the clutch was not engaging, reason was a carburettor with 60% durability? Does not seem too bad to me...If you are into fixing cars... get Car Mechanic Simulator.If you are into modifying your cars with simple building... get Jalopy.If you want a hardcore summer simulator in which you can build and modify your car... get My Summer CarIf you want to design your own car but not be able to drive it... get AutomationOr stick to Street Legal Redline Racing. Thats pretty much the same game, but plays much better. The graphics even look the same.Maybe i rebuy it, when the game got a couple of updates and improved all in all."
,Recommended,589760,30936200,Posted: 3 April,all,Werwolf,"So many negative reviews.... it makes me sad. This game is actually great. It models things many games do not model...little details like faster times on some shifts, because you hit it just right... the worrying sound of a drive belt squealing popping up in the middle of a race.... parts degrade over time, and you must constantly put love and attention into your car. Oh, speaking of your car.... So, here's how it starts.One day, while performing jobs for your boss, you look in the paper for some parts.... and you see IT.IT is the perfect car... a ruined wreck, or perhaps a high mileage family grocery getter.... or perhaps, an old, used up drag racer that has been wrecked. Maybe that old four door gas saver over there in the corner? Let's call this.... The Turd.So, you buy your Turd. You realize just how much stuff is wrong with your Turd, and how much money you will have to spend to fix your Turd. So, you start spending. Maybe these control arms will be better.... maybe this carb will net me more horsepower... maybe this TOWER SUPERCHARGER will get me where I wanna be... seriously, yes. You can buy a tower supercharger in this game, and then hang on for dear life as your otherwise underbuilt Turd refuses to turn, refuses to brake, refuses to do ANYTHING but GO, shredding your crappy worn out street tires to the tune of a glorious supercharged v8 at full yell, laughing like a complete pyscho. Back to the drawing board.......... many, many hours later, you have finally built it. The perfect machine.... the unbeatable MONSTER. You proceed to destroying everything within 1000 miles of you. One day, you take her out to the track to show her off to your lesser financed opponents.... you leave the line in a tower of tire smoke. Suddenly, your drive belt starts squealing. You slide more than usual in that turn, because your tires are getting old and worn. You don't accelerate as fast, because from many hard races and some impacts, your tuning has changed for the worse. You realize the brakes feel stiff, responseless. It's time for a rebuild. The sinking depression comes back...As a professional racer of over fifteen years, I can tell you this game does a better job than any other of simulating those minor and major inconveniences. Oil must be changed. Installed a new radiator? Don't forget to fill it with coolant! Before the race, make sure your tires are inflated correctly...This game will teach you more and give your more of the amateur racing experience than any other game out there. You must pay attention and let the car speak to you.For the places the game lacks, the developer has great plans. He is very down to earth, does his best to respond to all feedback, and actually LISTENS to his playerbase. Updates come on a regular basis. Yeah, the game isn't perfect, and it's not for people who don't want to have to think. This game will challenge you, make you go HMM, HUMMMM.... make you rage about how ""my car didn't do this last time"", because it changes every... single... race. That is, until you figure out that you have something broken. Well, crap. Let's look in the paper......."

It seems incomplete, and I was genuinely surprised (and disappointed) when I revisited the store page and couldn't find the text ""Early access"" anywhere."

The dev really does need to finish it because what little is here is good there is just not alot of it. The graphics are not the best and the controls need work but the basic game play is fun. Buying cars then either stripping them down and selling them for cash or keeping them to do them up i have always wanted a game like this so to the dev KEEP IT UP.

The faster you start going the worse it becomes, and this can become costly as you need to repair cosmetic damage.The first track is very difficult. This unlocks the second track and then the third. Currently there are only three tracks, with the first two being on dirt.After 10 hours I feel like I have finished the game as it is currently. If I need a new car 30 minutes of racing and I can buy one from scratch. This is in stark comparison to the amount of time required in getting my first car fast enough to beat the first track.Not a product worth its current $20 price tag. Yes I know it was a small team of developers, but handling is vital in a car game."

Maybe $10, but they need more content (Variations in car customization does not count).-EDIT-I would also like to point out to the developers:-I have over 30+ hours in My Summer Car-I have over 20+ hours in Jalopy-I have over 25+ hours in Car Mechanic Simulator-And I grew up playing Street Legal Redline Racing back in the early 2000's, I literally played this   game before and after school almost everyday for years.To say that the game was made for certain people is like saying that I am not the kind of person it was directed toward, which is wrong: I like the idea, not the content available for this game.THIS GAME is not worth more than any of these games,  had it been cheaper I would not have expected more out of this game, but $20 is too much for a game that: Feels old already, Feels generic, barely has any content from the beginning (THIS IS NOT A EARLY ACCESS GAME).-I will pay $5 for what it currently has, maybe $10 if they add more stuff (Cars, customization, better physics and controls, and if they step up the graphics more.-I will NOT pay $20 for a game that feels like an old rip-off of the previously mentioned games."
76561198009127998,Recommended,589760,32008539,Posted: 27 May,all,Warmonger,"Fantastic ultra fun game!!! Different than any other game you will find. You buy cars and fix them to go driving around a free roam open world map and go racing.Building and Repairing-	The vehicle building and repairing portion of the game is the best out of any other game I have ever played. Adding and removing parts to and from cars is quick and easy, one mouse click per part.-	You can buy cars and trucks ranging from brand new to totaled off wrecks and everything in between. At the beginning you won’t have much money so the cars you will be able to buy will need allot of work. Once you have bought your first vehicle you can either buy parts you need or buy and part out wrecks until you have what you need to build something that runs.-	Most of the parts can be swapped between vehicles. You can make cars into off road racers or trucks into drag cars. There is an extraordinarily wide variety of options for doing what you want to the vehicles.Driving-	Weather you spend the time to do a total frame off restoration or fix a vehicle up so it barely runs you can leave your garage and go free roaming around a fairly decent size map. This is what makes this game different than anything else I have played. You can drive around the map at your leisure, find people to drag race with, drive to a race track and race, go and fill up with gas or just drive around and see what there is to see. I don’t know of any other car building games that let you just go out and drive around and do whatever you want to.-	Racing includes street racing with AI characters you find on the map as well as on four designated race tracks. One oval dirt track, one off road course, one oval paved race track and one paved race course.Note:There have been some unfavorable reviews due to the handling of the cars in this game but with the update on May 26th those issues have been fixed and the cars now handle beautifully!I would highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone!!!"

76561197998264878,Not Recommended,589760,30479363,Posted: 12 March,all,Rayune,"TL;DR version: Decently fun for a few hours if you like tearing apart and fixing cars to min/max one of your own, but needs more content in that area of the game. The driving, on the other hand, is infuriating for anyone who is not a die-hard fan of racing games.I wish I could give this an actual ""mixed"" review, but due to the binary thumbs up/thumbs down of it all, I will give it a thumbs down because of the high price tag.The good:I enjoy buying an old wreck, dismantling it for parts, fixing the parts up, and selling them off. Meanwhile, it's enjoyable to craft a car from all of these parts and occasionally running across some really good engine or gearbox in some old heap that you got for dirt cheap. It can be fun to mix and match parts, and there's a process here that gave me some enjoyment: buy two new factory cars, pick the one that you enjoy driving more, dismantle the other one, and start swapping parts to see if there's maybe some Narnoo suspension that improves how you feel about driving your Wanja. Right now I have a Wanja frame with parts thrown in from a Narnoo, a Buthabang, and a Magura. I promise no degree of accuracy on the spelling of those names, by the way.HOWEVER...The bad:$20 is way too expensive. That is something that I will say right now. It intrigued me, and I enjoyed it for a solid 8 hours, but I don't know how much more I will play it. Meanwhile, I have clocked in about 31 hours on Car Mechanic Simulator 2015, which has a cheaper base price and goes on sale regularly. While it's fun to strip down the cars in this game, it's pretty simplistic when you compare it to Car Mechanic Simulator, and money becomes pretty frivolous once you cross that $100k mark. There is no opportunity to upgrade your abilities, and the interface takes some getting used to before you can really get around things with ease. Furthermore, many of the parts have various numbers listed, but there is no explanation of what they mean. I can understand horsepower and torque as they relate to an engine, but what in the world are these heiroglyphics relating to the suspension? Or how about the steering? Are big numbers good? Are big numbers bad? I know that the answer here is not simple, and that each driver will like things to be different, but it would be helpful to have some in-game indication of what the numbers even MEAN.However, all of these gripes are nothing when you compare it to the driving aspect of the game. I mostly spent time comparing parts on my car just trying to get it to stop feeling like I was driving on BUTTERED ICE. There's simply no way that I am going to be able to control the car well enough to finish any given race, let alone actually winning it. I know that racing a car isn't an easy thing to do, but that doesn't mean that intentionally making things hard to handle adds to realism. It just makes things frustrating. It's still fun for the car building aspect of it, which needs more content, but I hate the driving part of it. Not worth getting at full price unless there are major changes to controls and interface or at least some more content added."
,Not Recommended,589760,30483493,Posted: 12 March,all,FupaTroopa,"Review as of 3/12/17Revheads is what can be a mixture of Street Legal Racing Redline and Car Mechanic Simulator.Great idea, bad game.Cons1.Once I read all of these reviews saying that the car physics are terrible I just thought to myself that they're overeacting and my god, I was wrong. The physics feel like GTA IV but if someone stole your shocks. The cars suspension feels like marshmellos.2.The price is very hefty for this game. It's a disgrace that it's not classified as an early access because it sure feels like an early access game.3. Huge lack of aesthetic customization, you're unable to change anything on the outside of the car except for the few rims that the game has. The only thing you can do is change the paint and vinyl.4. I'm not a graphics person but the graphics in this game are terrible, it looks like it was made 10 years ago.5. I dislike the fact that this game is set in Australia, the slang is extremely cringy and the setting really doesn't match with the game idea in my opinion.Pros1. Great idea for a game, its the type of game i've always wanted. Great idea, poor delivery. Has potential.2. Dev is a really nice guy. He's going to update it and add more cars he said. I would've added few cars to the cons list but that will soon change. Hopefully3. The dash system is very unique and I really liked customizing my dashboard and gauges.4. KangaroosHopefully this game has a brighter future, I may rebuy it if this game gets fixed. So please hold on to your money until this game is further developed."

I am glad I did.I am enjoying the simplicity as well as the variety the game offers.I like how wear and tear is a factorI like how you can build up a car, drive it, break it, and then fix it up again.If you have played car mechanic, My summer car, or jalopy.. you may just find this title to encompass elements of all three of those titles. In many ways, Revhead takes the best elements of those games and brings them together for a unique game experience.I look forward to ongoing updates which will add to an already interesting concept."
,Recommended,589760,32390745,Posted: 13 June,all,SizZLeR,"Its EA and that means limitations and bugs, but so far I havent encountered any major bugs or errors, meaning some things doesnt work in the intuitive way youd like them to, but the game is fully playable.If youre a veteran in computer games and you played games like Street Rodand Gearhead Garage and enjoyed those games, then you will love this one.It has the best of both, where GG offered 3D graphics and repair jobs to earn cash, SR allowed you to race other cars for money.I love shopping for parts and cars which is done thru a magazine with ads, I guess its somehow charming to browse adds where everything is in a more or less different order, yet devided by category like ""Gear"", ""Engine"" etc.Unlike SR, different parts fit more or less all cars, like you can take any engine and stuff it in any car you like.Engines doesnt go the same, they differ in specs and max rpm, like some are high torque low rpm engines intended for heavy 4x4s while others rev to 9,000rpm and will work better for race cars, but you can put growler or screamer in any car you like, you can even make an offroad car of a coupe by replacing tires, rims, suspension and swaybars.The driving part itself needs work and w/o a gamepad youre out in the cold, but it does work very well, though it feels pretty blant and unreal, yet its not in a gamebreaking way and with practice youll be drifting corners like a pro very soon.Overall the game is good, a lot of work has been put in to the details matters and adds depth to the game.......IF you prefer building rides over driving them as the building part is far the best in this game in its current state."

Fault,"As I write this, the game has been updated twice, and the developers have just published their roadmap for where they want the game to go. I'm writing a positive review based on the astonishing potential that this game has. This game really does get you close to that fun feeling of that all-round classic car enthusiast who builds, fixes, and races their cars. Someone who loves everything about them.So rarely does a game like this come along that works so well that I encourage you to give it a go and put money towards it, and show the developers that you're interested, and that their plan towards developing this game is worth doing.At this stage, the game is incomplete, but what is there is definitely enough to keep you entertained for your £15 (or local equivalent's) worth, and remember - the developers are planning on adding new content to the game each month, and they have some serious plans for this. I really hope they get the support they need. The game is getting not that much press at the moment, and I think it does deserve more, and the developers should try to publicise it harder.So pop open the bonnet, get in there, and get your hands dirty!"

That being said the driving is so terrible that I didn't do much racing nor did I explore the map more than a little. The car mechanic gameplay is extremely frustrating in that you are given a customer's car and only vague instructions on what to do with it, when you think you have completed the job you turn it in to receive a only a binary response with no feedback on what you did wrong and no opportunity to try again. These problems could be forgiven on an early access title, or if the game were cheaper it could be fun just for the building aspect but as it stands I regret my purchase."

It is an excellent bush mechanic simulator where you can really put the parts from any of the cars back into any of the cars.

Devs do bother to actually keep it being developed and do a lot of improvements to it, though it's still limited by budget quite immensely.Car handling is fairly average as of this review."
,Recommended,589760,30676310,Posted: 22 March,all,Tone Katano,"First and foremost, do I recommend this? Yes, for $20? Ehhhh that's kinda debatable, if you have the money to do so, have at it, but if you're waffling back and forth because you don't want to ""lose"" the 20, maybe wait until it gets updated a bit.Ok, so from start to finish for my first 3 hour session after buying the game + about 30 minutes of post update testing. (The other hour and a half was from just idly buying used cars and fixing them and nothing else XD)Main Menu: Lacking, I'd personally prefer it if there was a way to change audio and video settings from the main menu rather than in the game as the music when you first load up the game, doesn't use the same settings as when you're ingame so it's rather loud at startup.Ingame Menu System: Quite easy to learn, I don't mind it at all... but the newspaper system... ohhh boy. It's cumbersome and painful to use at the best of times, not from a ""Darn, they don't have my part"" standpoint but from the ""Where is the driveshaft supposed to be?"" standpoint. The system for switching from garage to driving, or garage to track is very slick and quick with little to no faffing about.Mechanic System/Aspect: Where the game shines, do a bumper to bumper inspection of each car you get and replace as necessary. The part selection system could visually work a bit better for me personally, I have tough times noticing what is currently being selected, but that's probably just me not paying close enough attention.Driving Characteristics/Physics: Well, it's better... it was HORRID to start with, very floaty (not saying a 70's muscle car isn't floaty, just not like it's not attatched to the wheels kinda floaty) and I often had issues with random bouncing around, which keep in mind, this was a brand new car I bought and it's like the suspension didn't even exist. Now, the bouncing is not as bad, and I can turn better, the traction is MUCH better, much much better, it's very nice to drive with compared to the start where you could drift a drag car.Parts Deterioration System: Yes, just yes, it's great and works well, when you buy a car and think ""This is perfect!"" and see that the exhaust is beat to hell and you HAVE to fix it, it gives you the same ""FOR F*CKS SAKE!"" feeling as it would in real life (But with less anger :P).Buying and Selling of Parts: It works.... I already mentioned my gripes with the newspaper system, but once you get past that is just works, it's a good way to make some quick cash so you can buy that supercharger you wanted to get but realized you're $14 off.Racing System: Just like part selling, it just works, the AI can be tempermental sometimes (I made one literally flip out and get stuck by touching it lightly), but they work about as well as you could hope for a game where it's not the 100% main focus (Moreso 40% from what i've seen so far, maybe just from how i've played the game lol)Post update bug notes: I own the Narnoo offroad truck (The brand new red one) and it suddenly had almost full body damage after loading the game back in, it cost quite a bit to repair it, which was kinda annoying but at least no parts were missing. Same truck also stopped being able to handle jumps well, it likes to land nose first and pivot on the front wheels almost stopping on the front bumper, before it would just uncontrollably bounce about.And one mild annoyance... as a car guy.... WHY IS THERE ONLY ONE EXHAUST MANIFOLD ON A V8?!?!?!.... ok heh.... that's done haha.I know I didn't mention a couple things, but the things I hadn't mentioned, I either hadn't dealt with yet, or didn't see them needing to be mentioned.Overall yes I do recommend the game, but I feel as though the price point is a bit steep, use discretion when purchasing and remember, it may not say ""Early Access"" but they're working very hard on it.Thanks for reading!"

After a whole bunch of gameplay, this consensus of recommending this game tears me in 2.Lets just go over the pros first --The quality of the gameplay is supurb-This game can keep you entertained for days-Car aesthetics are wonderful-Scrapping, rebuilding, and racing your own cars is very satisfyingNow to the cons --There is not near enough of that quality gameplay, very lacking quantity wise in that area - This one is the biggy, you'll find yourself pretty bored after 5 hours of play if you lack some imagination.- Handling feels like its replicated from ROBLOX (Apparently if you use a wheel it is much better)- Once you get so far you can just grind 10 second drag races for $5000 winnings each (Pretty much infinite amount of money if you grind it)If you believe in the devs to continue developing this game, buy this game. The devs need a big update within the next week or so to keep my interest. If there isnt one in the next month my review will most likely change. There just isnt enough content.Note: Devs are claiming there is currently 300+ hours of gameplay in its current state. They make that statement because if you want to make every combonation of car, it will take 300 hours. NO ONE is gonna do that.IMO, there is about 5 hours of very solid gameplay here."

Then spend an hour driving: testing, street and track racing, time trials.There have been two updates since I bought the game and each one has addressed in-game issues (bugs, balance, etc) as well as added new content (parts, races, etc).Still... there's no burnout competition in the game. #SummerNats"

Buuuuuut, It's not without it's problems.So here's a neat little pro and con list for ya!--PROS--LOTS of customisation. There's not a whole lot that can't be interchanged between the 7 cars in the game.Degrading car performance. Might seem like a small thing but not many games actually do this. The more you race your car, the more damaged the internal parts get and the performance degrades, then failures are a strong possibility.Fuel. You need it. It's not a game to refill it for you either after a race or a drive. Just like real life, YOU need to fill it up when it's low.Fluids. Like Fuel, Fluid levels drop and in the case of Oil, needs to be changed when it gets old.The Fluids that are in the game are: Oil, Coolant and something I've never seen before simulated in a game, Battery water level.Many many races and things to do.Make a ' Mad Max ' car. Seriously, you can do this! You can quite literally create a frankenstein car thats made up of parts of many cars.Gauges: Speedo, Tacho, Fuel, Oil temp, Water temp ( overheating is a thing ), Battery charge level, Alternator output. All with mulitple different looks so you can make essentially a custom dash layout.Game itself runs pretty nicely, I've had no crashes and no bugs that I've seen. Also runs at a constant 60 FPS.--CONS--Horrendus driving controls: Seriously they are terrible. Don't even bother with a Keyboard, It's undrivable. I used an Xbox controller and it works much better but still pretty bad. A good thing to note is you do get used to it after a while.Physics: Kinda same with the controls, Pretty bad. Though once again you do get used to it.Graphics: Cars look pretty good but the world graphics are pretty bad.Mod Support: None yet and it's kinda a shame. This game would lend itself well to Mods.Repeating secondhand cars and parts: This is a small niggle of mine, Theres a ' newspaper ' ingame which you buy cars and parts from. The niggle is that after a while you see the same cars in the same configuration time after time. I love to be able to put in more variations.-------------------This game is different in a lot of ways and I love it for that!If they improved the physics and the controls plus added Mod support or just added a little more variety in this game, It'd be perfect.That being said, for me, the pros far outweigh the cons and I most certainly recommend you to try this little gem!"

My first car was heavily damaged and by the time I had worked 30+ jobs to try to earn more I was still thousands short of buying a new engine. I'm sure if I had a working car I could take it to races and make a lot more, but it's hard to get to that point. Maybe I just got unlucky...I still recommend it, just watch your in-game finances."

,Recommended,589760,30538970,Posted: 16 March,all,TunDeri,"After reading the reviews here complaining about various things, I got curious.I personally feel like this is sort of a re-imagining of the mechanics made familiar in Street Rod games in the early 90s. I like the familiar feeling of browsing through the in-game paper for parts and cars.Now, for some reason the economics feel really broken. When you master the art of repairing crucial parts from wrecks, you'll be selling them back at an amazing price! I tried to pass the first time trial race with every car I got my hands on and failed over and over, until I saved up enough to buy a lifted 4x4 muscle car. This enabled me to pass the time trial and progress with the races.So, let's move on to the race department. The first race of every location is always a time trial, and it's always the most difficult race you'll face there. I've managed to get lucky to pass the bronze time at every circuit but I can only dream of reaching the silver or gold times. I'd say the requirements for silver and bronze need to come down so people can actually make progress in the game without having to grind for ultimate gear to do so. After time trial, the other races are ridiculously easy.Oh, and the dirt tracks feel really strange to drive. You sort of have grip, and you don't. It's easy to gain high speed but even offroad tires can't keep you from spinning at the next curve. This needs to be looked at, devs.Finally, for everyone struggling with the first two tracks: Keep at it! Once you get further, the tarmac track is actually nice to drive :)"

,Recommended,589760,31745646,Posted: 14 May,all,Homiccus,"A good game for all motoring enthusiasts. Has its quirks and is full of glitches, but on a good path.In Revhead you control an amateur racing driver trying to make his way up the local ladder. The game is divided into three distinctive parts: garage, racing tracks and the town, each with set of activities.Without further ado:The Likes.- genuine feel of backwater, dilapidated garage that sees old jalopys and bangers more often than flashy supercars.- every car comprises dozens of parts which are removable, configurable and swappable. Need wider tyres? No problem, buy or scavenge a set of rims and off you go. Engine too small? Get a used V8 from an old 4x4 and stick it in. Change the drivetrain to awd while you're at it aswell. Yup. That's how far this game goes in ride customization.- parts and cars market is accessed through ads section in a newspaper. That's right. No PC or iPad for you. To find what you want you need to scour the ads and hope for the best. I love this, it adds a lot to the flavour.- driving and racing. At first I shared the view of many reviewers here on steam, that the car driving is unplayable. And then I realised that I'm trying to drive a 20 year old car with 300k on the clock and worn out tyres at 60mph and expect it to corner like a beemer. Ain't gonna happen mate. Change suspension. Install stiffer sway bars. Change tyres. Fix steering. Bam. Car handles like a dream. Even on a keyboard. Stop whining and git gud.- impromptu drag races in the town add to the range of activities. They're a good source of money and are done onthe main town map. Nice touch.The dislikes- genuine feel of an indie game made on a shoestring budget. Requires tons of polish to shine.- the graphics looks a bit dated for 2017. Cars look unrealistic - we need more dirt! - and are not tremendously detailed.- the Aussie setting is a bit cheesy and over the top. The game tries to be more Australian than Australians.- the town feels dead and needs more day-to-day traffic and pedestrians.- last but not least: Revhead desperately needs more content. More cars, more tracks, more engines, more parts.Overall, I'd give the game 6.5/10 at the current stage of development. Solid game but requires a lot of tlc to shine."

Fixing and modding the cars is fun (CMS15 players will enjoy this, and probably feel right at home), and once you get your control method dialed in*, driving them is fun too. The racing AI isnt perfect, if youre expecting AI on the level of something like an ISI sim, or Forza, youll be disappointed, but racing your creation around is still fun.  The game still seems to be under active development, so it will be interesting to see what they have planned for future updates.*If youre playing with a gamepad, dont let the way the cars handle on the street put you off (if youre trying to stay bettween the road lines, driving racing lines they are ok), the way the driving and physics are as of Update 8, the controls will initially feel darty or sluggish depending on your settings.

You start your journey somewhere in a small village in Australia.This game is very addicting, you get experience, as you gain the in-game experience, you become more and more familiar with parts, ""feel"", damage appearance, and what is most ""cost efficient"" when repairing a car.You have very few diagnostic tools so you are forced to do the diagnostics with visual identification. You can sell them back to the shop for extra money or repair them, you can take on jobs too. If you guys liked Street Legal Racing and my Summer Car you will like this one too.When you finish a race, you get a breakdown of exact lap times, and how you rank against the other racers. This game has more going for it than Car mechanic simulator. Each component can be removed, replaced and swapped between other cars. challenge others to win their cars, or you can just free roam with your car, pull it out of the garage and take if for a spin.Driving the car feels heavy like a real car, I had no lag, game runs very smooth, good tutorial and I like being able to have many different cars to play with at one time. You can set your car up for street racing or dirt. At first it was a little hard to figure out but once you understand the layout and what's going on you start to put cars together pretty fast, No grinding, great sound track. I think there are 6 or 7 different camera angles so that's cool.

,Not Recommended,589760,30431270,Posted: 10 March,all,Soros.SL,"It's simple and empty, feels like Early Access title.There are 6 or 7 cars in-game, i believe. The only visual tuning is vinyl.I liked a bit of Car Mechanic Simulator, when you get a car and description of stuff, that happens with car (overheats, stops braking, etc.) and you need to fix it.Getting money is repetitive: buy old car, fix all parts you can fix, sell a car for profit, repeat.You buy a good car, buy a donor, make it one car. Yay, you have a beast. But racing in this game is kinda meh. Three tracks, three modes on each: time attack, race, 1v1. AI is not very bright... I raced three times on each track, and never came back there.I don't know why i liked this game, but i think it's okay.Overpriced in my opinion, but cheaper than Car Mechanic Simulator without DLC. Though yet again, in this game you don't have as much content.Still, there are many games that much worse than this game.Anyway, APPROACH WITH CAUTION."
