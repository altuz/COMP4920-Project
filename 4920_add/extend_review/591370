,Recommended,591370,32271609,Posted: 8 June,all,Bad Whippet,"What is it?Production Line is a management/tycoon simulation game where you must put together production lines to build cars and (hopefully) sell at a profit.  You start out with some basic processes that will build a car from start to finish, but you soon realise how very inefficient this becomes as half-built cars form long queues, bottle-necked by a time-consuming and lengthy process such as painting.  As a result, you need to research different specialisations so that you can break up those processes into smaller activities, thereby being able to work on more cars at once.  There are three car types you can build at this stage.What's good about it?I love how each stage of vehicle manufacture has been emulated.  The graphics are fascinatingly detailed.  It has the same compulsion and addictiveness of other tycoon and management games where you are convinced 'just one more go' will ultimately offer the best and most productive operation!I quite enjoyed Big Pharma, but I think this game is better.  It lacks the polish of Big Pharma but it has a bigger granularity to it.  There is a larger element of problem solving (clearing bottle-necks, trying not to lose too much money in your processes etc) in this game, and the graphical detail in each process is great.Anything not to like?It's Early Access, and that means it comes with all the typical EA problems (lots of crashes and instability issues, lack of tutorial and a feeling of incompleteness here and there) but, my word, it is fun!  To get started, a very helpful startup guide (in English only) has been pinned in the forum - I highly recommend reading that as it will get you started in no time.Right now, the in-game 'competition' really doesn't seem to do anything, there are no campaign goals like those found in Big Pharma and the finance model doesn't really seem to go anywhere other than 'stay out of debt' (it would be nice to have more involvement with meeting customer demand and beating off the competition - so this area needs more work really).  It also crashes a LOT right now!  However, the game is still very much under development and it's shaping up to be a tycoon classic.In summary...Production Line is a management tycoon game still very much in Early Access.  As a result it is buggy, but the developers seem active and engage with the community.  This game offers a fun challenge.  I've put in 10 happy hours already and haven't tired of it yet."
,Not Recommended,591370,31851091,Posted: 19 May,all,Exchequer,"TLDR: This game is Big Pharma with cars. This isn't as polished, which is fine because it is early access. However the statement on the steam store that this version is fully playable is not accurate in my opinion. I have had 6 crashes in my third hour of gameplay and the AI is questionable.I saw a lot of positive steam reviews combined with the promise of a fully playable game. So I decided to give this game a shot.First experience:I must admit that I did have a lot of fun in the first 2 hours. I did not really know what I was doing but soon I figured out how to scale up my factory and ramp up production. So far so good.annoyance - stability:In the third gameplay hour I crashed at least 6 times, also my autosave got corrupted. The forum does not have a subsection for technical issues at all. Which is not very promising (takes 2 minutes to create a technical sub-forum).annoyance - gameplay:Basically you need to sell cars. At the start of the game your biggest threath is scale; you need it to stop loosing money. Howeer there are also invisible competitors. The only thing you know about these guys is that at some point they research techs such as ""windscreen whipers"" and ""steering headlights"". When multiple competitors complete this the tech then it is deemed common. If you do not equip your cars with this common tech then you will need to lower your price.So of course you will research this technology. However, herafter you will find out that you CANNOT implement it because apparently you also need the process tech. So now that you know that you need to take a good look at the proces tree and try to mix and match process with technology.You must remember that accesory specialization unlocks: lights, horns, seats, windscreens and dashboards. So then you can go over to the tech tree and try to find a tech that would apply here. For example car alarm will not work, that requires door tech. For doors you must remember that you need body specialization that gives fit  roof, fit doors and fit bodyframe. But you also need subspecialization "" door specialization"" that unlocks door panels, fit windows and fit wing mirrors.You still with me??? In the end the only way to efficiently play the game is to know both tech trees by heart.annoyance - ai:The pace at which the AI seems to launch new features. My second game I was aware of this and invested fully into tech (10 offices). However even that was not enough and soon I was behind at least 5-6 features. On the forum the dev aditted that ' the ai will be heavily nerfed' . Since the ai cannot be turned off and being behind means having to sell below market price for me that means that as of as of right now its not really playable.Conclusion:So instead of the expected economic/strategic challenge with a puzzle element right now the most challenging part for me is the Tech tree layout combined with the the crashes. The game has potential but right now I think you are better off playing Big Pharma, which also has some interesting campaign options.edit:Nuanced review and removed individual bugs, it is early access afterall.edit2:Game recently updated. AI's progress in tech is now slower, however at the same time cars can be sold at unlimited profits (e.g. 400%). Meaning producing a handfull of cars without any efficiency at all is enough to create millions in proceeds."

For 2 hours.Gameplay at the moment is very basic and once you learn the game mechanics it gets extremely boring and repetitive. The only challenge is learning the game and the fun element drops down a cliff once you're banking money.That being said the game has potential to be great, but is barely a fraction of it yet. At its current price it is not worth at all.Wait for its development before buying."

Along the walls are dotted the occasional door for exporting cars or slot for importing materials, much likeBig Pharma.Opening up the build menu shows a list of machines that handle a different part in the process of building a car — the chassis assembler, the body fitter, the quality assurance station, etc.You can even start manufacturing the parts for your cars in the factory, bringing down costs but introducing a whole other branch of machines.As you start researching new technologies, the problems multiply. Each of the stations can be broken down into individual machines — the accessories station breaks down into lights, horn, seats, and windscreen, each a station with a single task running at slightly different speeds.Still in Early AccessProduction Linecould turn into a great game but even now its good fun.THE GOOD- Complex production- Graphics are immersive and bring life to the factory- Nice research tree- Still adding contents to the gameTHE BAD- Not much audio- Limited car models for now- Still in Early Access8/10DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD |GREAT| AMAZING | MASTERPIECE"
76561198007313116,Recommended,591370,33581649,Posted: 16 July,all,Rever,"The game is well optimized. The dev is extremely active. For these reasons alone I would recommend the game. People seem to want to comparing this to Factorio and that really isn't the right genre. With the fear of over simplifying things Production Line is more building / management and Factorio is building / survival. This game is a lot like Big Pharma or Factory Engineer. I think if you liked Airport Sim, Project Highrise, Game Dev Tycoon or even Prison Architect, there is a good chance you will like this. The challenge of the game is to get as efficient as possible. There is little survival aspect, besides don't run out of money. There is a lot of ""oh shoot"" (explitive cleaned up) I should have done that this way, now what to I do? My biggest disapointments with the game are minor. Things like being able to cross over conveyor lines and have separate import conveyors would add a lot more control of imports, but remember this game is very actively being worked on. Maybe not having this is intended to make it more challenging. We shall see.The review I read that got me going said that this game is boring. Why? Because zombies aren't attacking you? No guns or explosions? Maybe naked people would help? Remember when someone says a game is boring, that is not really a review. It is just an opinion. Nothing wrong with that per se, but it is no indication whether someone else will like it, unless they have the same tastes as the reviewer. I say that because I think it is pretty harsh to give a thumbs down based on your personal tastes. So now for my opinion, I love it. I stop playing and wish I was still playing. I woke up and was making coffee, thinking about how to get my imports more efficient. I have things to go do today and wish I didn't. I opened Steam, saw a negative review, and like a good fan boy here I am. I am sure this will wear off eventually, but for now I have spent enough time not playing. Good Day."

Already there is a large amount of depth and complexity, and if you're looking for something similiar to Big Pharma or Factorio, then this game is a definite option.It's definitely an early-access title - lots of features aren't yet in the game, there isn't really a proper tutorial (though there is a guide on the forums which is really helpful), and I've seen a number of minor bugs, but the game is being worked on rapidly and is improving all the time.Positech have a good history of supporting and developing their games, so you can be confident that this will make it to the finish line in a strong polished state! Getting in early also gives you a chance to influence development via the voting menu (you can vote on the most important features to add via the main menu).Overall definitely worth a purchase!"
,Recommended,591370,31841980,Posted: 19 May,all,AxonC,"I don't consider myself to be a seasoned reviewer of games but with Production Line, I felt that I had to. When I first saw the concept, I found it very, very appealing. It appeared to merge the typical management genre with complexity which other games I have tried have lacked. Owing to this, I was not disappointed when I opened the game up for the first time.The learning curve of the game is quite steep at first and even when you think you have cracked it, you are hit with additional research, rival companies who catch up with you - prompting you to innovate your production process - and the constant challenge of producing enough resources to build your cars. You a have to do this whilst still trying to avoid having your funds go below zero.At the time of writing this, the game is, by all accounts, far from finished but the framework set down by the developers at this early stage, gives the game a lot of potential for the future."

The same kind of fun you might have by building and MANAGING an amusement park. Nobody else has done this and their are so many options with cars. Keep in mind however, this is a pure management and money game.Pros:-This is a true active developer. Their last update positively impacted gameplay by adding market demand factors and diversifying models.-The gameplay is intense. You can go bankrupt easily in the first few hours.Cons:-Only Sedan, Compact, SUV. No sports cars yet...-Currently its one strategy. If I start over on another map, I will do exactly the same thing and win.-No fun endgame. The endgame is just producing more regular sedans, compacts, and suvs, and producing more of their parts to minimize cost.-No brand or marketing whatsoever.I would ignore cons because I think the developer is going to update most of this and turn into a complete game. I am very excited."
,Recommended,591370,31884681,Posted: 21 May,all,flacwby,"First, I've had this game for over 5 months as I purchased it directly before it hit Steam EA, so I have 100+ hours and it is GREAT!As a 2D game FPS isn't an issue, and I've had only 1 crash in over 100 hours so stability is great. The game is updated almost weekly and every week the developer posts a vlog on Sundays about upcoming features and feedback received. Many EA developers are great but I will say by far Positech Games is the most active game developer with the community I've seen and I have a few dozen EA titles (although I do have to say Keen Software House is just as active).If you like management games, but not necessarily the gathering of resources then Production Line is awesome."

I had Production Line on my wishlist for sometime, as was Big Pharma, but as the positive reviews kept growing for Production Line, and it really ticked all my boxes I went for it.About 20+ hours played now, and I really love it! I love strategy, sims, building , tycoon style games and am also a MotorHead so this really was ideal for me.The interface is intuitive and gameplay is great for an early access game, and the developer seems to be really hands-on and developing the game at a great pace while maintaining quality gameplay.After about 20+ hours I am now at a point where I have researched all there is (at this current point) dabbled in Marketing, but do not see the pay off to be worth it. But being OCD I am always looking for a more efficient way to layout the line and ensure productivity is always above 60%. LOVE IT! and just wanted to say for the price this is a great game for anyone who like management style games.Bravo and Kudos to the developers."

Lots of dev blogs and overall a trustworthy developer from previous experience (BigPharma, Democracy).So far, encountered two crashes, not bad for an early access title, not great either, one did kill my save as it corrupted the save file (would like an opportunity to keep multiple autosaves) but for £12 its reasonably priced for the amount of gametime I expect to get out of it.Feels very much like factorio but with more of an efficiency focus which is great if you love that part of factorio!Can't wait to see more options and features in the future.One bad point, the rival companies seem to research at a much faster pace than I'd like, each feature doesn't really feel like you've 'worked' for it, just appears in 2-3 minutes of research time.

( im often setting out my Tafe assignments while playing games) and it is a little annoying that everytime i click out of my game window that it pauses the gameMy issues....- sometimes if i go to save it crashes instead..(does not happen if you create a new save file... only when you try to overwrite another one)- being unable to delete save files that have been copied from another computer(they wont delete from in the interface even though they do show up)this game works great on my computer (which i think is in dire neeed of upgrade)My comp:- windows 10 pro- intel i7 3.40GHZZ- 8gb ram- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650"

Found this game 2 days ago on YT and it's kinda strange I overflew it several times in my Steam Exploring List.I‘m really impressed by the game mechanics since setting up your own assembly line is just fun and the research tree goes really deep. The different approaches to play this game are nearly endless.Nonetheless there are several details that I missed (regarding the „late“ versioning of the game) such as giving your company a name or choosing an icon for it. Bankruptcy can come really quick and sudden without the possibility for the player to choose to continue if there are still loans available.But as I said these are just a few details and not really relevant for gameplay.I like!

I can barely research a basic tech in  that time frame  with 6 research stations working.  As a result i have to sell my vehicles at a discount to theirs becuase i lack these advanced tier technologies to place in my vehicle, thus hurting my profits meaning less money to put into a new production line or research tech faster.I understand that this is only in Alpha and the delevoper has already stated that the AI will be nerfed signifgantly in the future, but as it stands now i cannot recomment this game."

In this game you're in charge of a car factory and you need to set up production lines for vehicles.The good points:- The game goes in great details, you can actually manufacture most of your components in late game and you can also equip your cars with the lates technologies. These need to be researched and you also have competitors how will do the same. The rarer the feature the more money you can ask for it.- Graphics are nice- Good overall performanceThe bad points:- Need to have patience in the beginning as the tutorial is almost useless.- Too easy to finish the game- occasional bugs (nothing game breaking)Suggestions for the developer:- we need more body styles for cars: estate (wagon), van, mpv, sports car- Goals, for example you could have 200 orders for suv's you need to fullfil by date, or have 100 orders for cars with navigation for a company that employs salesman.That's it.

It's not a completely realistic manufacturing business sim, but it is better than anything I'm aware of (and I pay attention to this genre).The core of the game is placing stations and conveyor belts in a factory, in a quest to have a smooth production line (hence the title).  Achieving a smooth flow in this game is much easier than in real life, which is to say that it's pretty tricky.I picked this game up on the first day of Early Access; in the two weeks since then, there have been two updates!  How Cliffski manages to be responsive on the forums at the same time is beyond me.  Right now, the game is playable and enjoyable; bugs are minor.

It is most emphatically not and never will be a realistic production line simulation, nor a tycoon style game.If you really liked Big Pharma you could take a shot at it in EA, otherwise I'd strongly suggest waiting to see what we end up with.  The developer is dedicated and will make something fun out of this, I'm sure - indeed if you like BP it is fun already just not finished and you can expect bugs, game changes you do or don't like possibly breaking your save game, more bugs, and more changes.  Will be revisiting the game from time to time and if things change dramatically I'll update this review accordingly.  There's definitely a lot of promise here for a Big Pharma fan."

There's no clear development roadmap and it's not clear what the final game will/won't include, and where the game is in the development cycle (is it almost done? Are we years away? etc). If you're averse to early access, I advise to wait and see.OverallThe game seems like it has good potential. Management is a bit complex, but manageable. There's not an obvious optimization path (""build 2 of these for every one of those""), but it is pretty linear.  Making money quickly is hard (currently) but sandbox modes let you play with basically unlimited funds.It doesn't seem like it allows for a lot of creativity, and there's very specific things required for each kind of car (it feels much more structured than something like Big Pharma which allows a few different paths to get to the same result - Production Line not so much).The developer is very active with regular releases, but as noted before, it's not clear how ""complete"" the game is at this point, or what else is/isn't coming. Most updates are just balance tweaks. A roadmap (even general) would be very helpful."

And guess what happened then. My profits plummeted from the bug not allowing me to apply my upgrades to my vehicle out of the blue (Cars randomly just started to go to basic and couldnt even change it with the design maker) and completely destroyed my save.

If you try to set it and forget it to try to make money there is a good chance you will come back to a game over screen.As such, while I wouldn't be able to reccomend the game based on how little time it takes to unlock everything, I can recomend the game because it is definitly a better simulation of the market then many games that set it and forget it works. Really my only major complaint apart from to quick to get through is that there is no option to move machines (at a cost) rather if you need to move a machine you need to delete it and rebuild it and reapply the upgrades to it. While moving it for free wouldn't make sense (cost of labor of dismantling and reconstructing a machine isn't free), but flat out having to destroy it and rebuild it lossing all its upgrades doesn't make sense either.

You link the 'slots' with conveyor belts and provide resources to these 'slots' via resource conveyors from fixed points around your factory. The finished vehicle exiting your factory for sale via fixed 'Export Slots'.With different shaped slots, conveyors that cant cross and limited factory space you start to see where the challange is, fitting it all in as you expand.All the ususal suspects are there for a game of this genre, a comprehensive research tree, marketing and design considerations for your vehicles, pricing and cost of manufacture vs importing pre-made parts. Also cosmetic choices for car colour and the factory....and best of all an active Developer passionate about the game.Cliffski (Cliff Harris) has been producing regular Dev Blogs over on You Tube and they are are worth your time to watch. If you would like to more more about the coding behind the game Cliff even goes into that in a few of them.The forums are active with a great player base offering up bugs and suggestions and Cliff is very active there and we have already seen player feedback influence good changes in the game.Cliff has a strong vision for the game which he is always driving towards and this in turn leads to regular updates for both bug fixing and new content.If you like this genre of game your money will be well spent supporting Cliff and Prodution Line. I have had many hours of fun out of this already and there are still exciting developments in the pipeline."

Well done dev.Cons: Crashes, can't remove resource routes without deleting everything else in the same location first, minor graphic glitches. I'm sure these things will get sorted.Would like to see: More models and equippment. Special paintjobs, special rims, mufflers, factory engine boost on expensive models etc etc. Special orders like armored, specific color and tinted windows. You get my point.Anyway, totally playable as it is now - get it and support the devs."
