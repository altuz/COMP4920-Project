76561197970302234,Not Recommended,591380,30872670,Posted: 1 April,all,guz,"Great idea for a game, diffusing Bombs Old school with cliping wires and pressing switches. It's nicely polished as well, but it's lacking content. I think the average person will be done in less than an hour.While playing the game you get the distinct feeling that the creators of the game didn't have a too firm grasp of the underlying concepts of logic gates or just plain electronics themselves. The OR Gate for example has a whole tutorial section, when it serves no function that a forked trace wouldn't have fullfiled in most cases. Also the last puzzle in the second to last section features a solution that is - in contrast to the rest of the game - physically impossible to create with real world electronics (a circuit that powers itself, though the mechanism is well described in the game so you are not likely to get stuck there).I feel that the puzzle design in general is somewhat lackluster, some puzzles are solved by just clipping all wires or switching all switches and many don't even have a way for you to accidently trigger the explosion prematurely. In general they do not feel 'clever', the ones that are a bit more tricky are mostly so because of obfuscation and not because of clever circuit design (the final puzzle is a prime example of this).The mechanical foundation on the other hand is very solid and if this ever gets workshop support i think the user generated content will make up for the easy and somewhat shallow puzzles included in the base game.If one hour of casual - and maybe educational - distraction is worth the asking price for you then go ahead, otherwise i suggest waiting for future updates."

The whole game is essentially teaching you more complex mechanisms, but the game's over right when it feel's like it's just begun.I wish it was longer, I agree with others that a board designer or random board generator would make this game really phenomenal."
,Not Recommended,591380,32320025,Posted: 10 June,all,SirBittle,A fun game if you're interested in logic and circuits but I cannot recommend it at this time. The game is pretty much one long tutorial and I was able to complete it in two sittings over a total of 1 hour. It sounds like there may be updates in the future to add more types of circuits and perhaps a circuit editor. This game would greatly benefit from that.

,Recommended,591380,32733526,Posted: 24 June,all,Kranodor,"One caveat: It's super short, so watch the price. Steam tells me I have 1.5 hours in this game, and 38 minutes of that I was on the phone and didn't bother to shut the game down, and I've played through completely. So it'll take you around an hour if you are somewhat experienced in logic puzzles, probably up to two if you aren't - the levels are very short (there is usually a one- or two-minute timer), and success or failure are often pretty much instant.What is this game about? It's a logic puzzle game. There's sources of energy and lines on which the energy travels, there's components on those lines, such as switches, logic gates (AND, OR, XOR) and some others, that will change on which lines the energy travels or doesn't. The goal is to either get the energy to certain endpoints (often multiple ones, at the same time) or to cut an already existing energy line, all while avoiding to supply energy to specific other endpoints.Namely, for most levels, there's a timer with detonator, featuring one endpoint for power which is already supplied by default, one to three ""disarm"" endpoints that have to be simultaneously supplied with energy to work, and one ""detonator"" endpoint, supplying which will mean instant defeat. A few levels are introduction levels, which only serve to show off how a part works, and the remainder - slightly more than a handful, really - are the most interesting ones, featuring clocks and detonators as separate parts, with the goal being either to cut power to the clock, to the detonator, or to cut the connection between the power output of the clock (that goes active once the clock hits 00:00) and the detonator input of the detonator.I don't want to spoil too much, but there's levels with traps, less-than-obvious solutions and some with a simple fix to a very complex problem. It's great fun, if you like logic games, I just wish there were more levels."
,Not Recommended,591380,30884695,Posted: 1 April,all,N!ot!c,"This is a very fun game, and I dont regret the fact that I bought it; however there is so little gameplay that someone can burn through the entire game in an hour. If there ends up being an expantion with more boards and maybe a ""make you own bomb"" multiplayer feature, this game is definetly worth the money. If this is the games final iteration, you may want to save your money for another title."

I made snip snip and click click with the bombs. A couple times they went boom. The boom wasn't very satisfying, so sad for that. I got a bit less than an hour of playtime out of it, and that felt like not enough.The game balances between simple layouts that allow for quick deduction of the implications of a particular action ... and obfuscated layouts that try to hide the system from you and deny you a clear deductive path. Of course, the whole thing falls apart when you consider that a given level's board doesn't change between attempts. If you're willing to sit there spending your entire time working out the circuit ... sure you'll explode, but then you'll have a whole new countdown to keep solving the same puzzle. So they're not really a timed challenge.I've been trying to pick up more quick puzzle games lately to vary my gameplay ... but I felt like this one was a dud."

But I think it has potential, so it gets a thumbs up (albeit a weak one).Having played the demo, I was excited for a Zachtronics-like hard as nails freeform puzzler. This ain't it.When you've done what feels like the tutorial, the game is over. That's 30 minutes to an hour, tops.But what is there is GOOD. Great, even. There's the basic building blocks of something brilliant in there. I want to support further development, and I hope that money helps make the game better.If you're interested, there's a demo available on the game's website. If you like the mechanics and don't mind that you'll only get about twice as much time out of the game as you did the demo, I'd say buy it.I really hope the developer decides to expand this. The concept is great, but there's no real challenge."

Around an hours play time so up to you if you feel it's value. Personally happy with the time i got. Would have liked some more puzzles as it does feel like the game is a tutorial for more levels mixing up the system taught. Any future levels added would go down well as left me wanting more

I probably would have taken much longer without that. I still managed to blow up the bomb about 20 times or so. Unfortunately there is little replay value. A bomb editor and workshop to share bomb designs would be awesome or maybe randomized bombs, if that is technically possible. Basically anything to increaes the replay value after you have beaten the game in about 1-2 hours. It was a lot of fun though and the game is relatively cheap. I would have paid more money going to the cinema and watching a movie so I'd say the price is okay."

,Recommended,591380,30817377,Posted: 29 March,all,kutya,"The idea is great, and the execution too. But just when I started having fun, the game ended. Actually only the last bomb was actually hard. Okay, I know basic logical circuits, so none of the concept were new to me, but regardless, the game is lacking in content. It would be pure awesomeness if we had dozens of bombs like the last one. This way, the game feels like a tutorial for a future game.I have to compare it with SpaceChem. In SC, I spent hours figuring out some of the puzzles and I still didn't finish it. Here, the puzzles work out quite quickly. Okay, there has to be some tension with bomb defusing, but give us more time and way more complex bombs. I'll anyways recommend the game, because in all other aspects, it's great. Especially if you're new to logic circuits. Also, if you like games from Zachtronics (Shenzhen, SpaceChem, Infinifactory) and such, you'll like this one too, but will probably also feel it's too easy/short. I would gladly pay double/triple the price for x3-4 of more complex bombs. If you want to learn digital logics, this will teach you the basics in a couple hours and it's probably one of the most entertaining tools to do so."

Consider waiting to grab it for real cheap, for as of right now it’s less than an hour of content. It’s a solid little puzzler with a handful of decently challenging bits, but the game in its entirety feels like the tutorial to something else."

The game starts with solving simple circuit problems.  Your objective is to sent current down a ""diffuse"" path, while avoiding the detonate path.  Some bombs require you to cut power to the detonator altogether.  It starts with simple rocker switches, progresses to cutting wires, and ramps up to ""AND"" gates from there.  Each section adds a new mechanic on top of what you learned in previous sections.  On top of all that, the bomb steadily counts down until detonation (you can increase time allowed in options if you are struggling).PROS-Very fun gameplay-Great soundtrack-Graphics are very appealing and fit this genre-The difficulty ramped up at a good rate as I progessed throughout the levels-The game gives you a fair amount of time to defuse on each level-Defuse mechanics are fun and can even teach about simple circuitry-I enjoyed the little comments you receive when you fail and blow up the bomb-Priced fairly-Did not encounter any bugs or glitchesCONS-Would have been nice to be able to rotate the bomb around like in ""Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes""-Wish the game was longer, beat it in about an hour and a half or so"

I finished it in a little over an hour, but that was in one sitting, and I was engaged the whole time, considering the possible ramifications of each little button press, each wire cut.Now that the complaint is out of the way, here's what I liked:1:  I greatly enjoyed the core concept, solving puzzles to diffuse bombs, but then again, I'm probably slightly biased toward puzzle games.2:  I liked the implementation, specifically, how they ramped up the complexity rather than just dumping stuff on you all at once.  The way I see it, it makes the game approachable.3:  I don't know why, but I really got a kick out of the tension created by the two constraints you have to operate under:  you have to get the circuit to behave the way you want to in a short time limit (anywhere from 1 minute to 1 minute 30 seconds, and sometimes even 2 minutes) AND you can't mess up.  That, I think, was the bigger part of that equation, predicting that this wire I'm about to cut will diffuse the bomb, being wrong, and being greeted by the White Screen of 'Asploding.If this game gets updated, and/or gets Workshop implemented, I think it'll really shine.TL;DR - Kinda short, but a fun puzzle game."

,Recommended,591380,30845317,Posted: 30 March,all,Ryke,"I feel like I have to give this game a thumbs up because it's quite good and well-made in many ways. It's a logic puzzle game reminiscent of zachtronics games, based on circuitry and logic gates, where instead of being presented with a straight-up puzzle or being asked to produce a particular output, you have to disarm a bomb. It's quite good. It really eases you into it if you've never played such a game before, but it does throw in some clever tricks, and the sense of tension that goes along with a ticking bomb adds something to it. But it's too short.I got through this entire game in 74 minutes, and I would say that despite having played similar games in the past I actually had a bit more trouble with it than I should have had. Even someone who's not a fan of logic games or puzzle games at all could get through the game at least as fast, probably faster.The game desperately needs a level/bomb editor and workshop support. I really, really hope the dev uses some of the money they're getting from this to work on adding those things, along with some other additions: more mechanisms (particularly detonator types; I feel like there's some potential to get creative with bombs that need you to do things other than cut off the power or send power to the right places to defuse them) and possibly even stuff to build more than just bombs in an editor mode. With user content and Workshop support, this could be almost on par with some of the best games in the genre (i.e. zachtronics, pretty much) but more accessible to people who aren't puzzle/electrical engineering/programming nerds.At CDN$ 6.62 (15% off), I was pretty disappointed. At the same time, let's be honest, some of my lunches cost more than $6.62, so I can't complain too much. It's not such an unfair price even if you can get more content for the same price in other games. But if the dev uses some of the money to add Workshop support and/or more content, I'll be more than satisfied."

There are only one or two non-tutorial levels for each introduced component, usually not even very challenging. This is very sad because there is a lot of potential in making challing puzzles with early components by just throwing more components on the bomb so the player has a larger challege to understand what happens."

I played through the whole game in 50 minutes.But everyone talks about that so let me tell you what I love about this game.Now, normally I really hate adding pressure to puzzles. It feels like an unnecessary addition to what, in my mind, should be a relaxing experience. But the way timers are used in this game is great, and I feel it really added something I haven't seen in other logic games. Multiple timers, timers that do different things, timers that play against each other, timers that you need to manipulate in different orders and different ways - it's just great. And if you are of a nervous disposition you can always just set off the bomb and study the circuit at your leisure. You can even still interact with the components on the board after the bomb goes off. I'm really glad that feature is in there even though I didn't take advantage of it much. I did reset a few bombs because I knew I was going to run out of time, but overall I actually really enjoyed playing against the clock, and that's about the highest praise I can give for a puzzle game that adds stress as a main element.So basically, yes, this game is a bit overpriced for the play time, but the developer sounds like they want to continue with it, which I would love to see, so if you want to support the game I'd say go ahead and buy it.
