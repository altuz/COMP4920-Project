I gave it positives the first 3 times, Zup 3 showed that there could be hope for the series with a couple new additions, but Zup 4 is literally just an expansion pack. I'm not sure what more we could expect from a game that is now being released monthly, but it's making me lose a lot of faith in the failing Greenlight system.If you're here for achievements, don't let my review stop you, it's the same♥♥♥♥♥♥ different month. So easy a kid can do it, lots of achievements, etc etc.The game is starting to become repetitive and as someone who has developed games in the past and put my heart into my work, it's annoying to see this become commonplace.

By the way, which modern game can make a claim to this nowadays?This is the 4th game in the Zup! series and it did not disappoint. Getting all the achievements is fairly easy and one can get them all within 1 hour of gameplay. There are a total of 66 levels included in this game (excluding the DLCs) and if anyone feels that they are being stuck in some level, the guide section of the community hub provides a very detailed and helpful walkthrough.Highly recommended to hardcore achievement hunters, casual gamers and young kids too."

It took the achieve out of achievements, it took ""simplistic"" to new levels of yawn, it is now the standard for what an indie game should be, stuffed with hundreds of achievements with (as they promote) minimal effort and time needed to play or complete. My ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 4th grader kid brother can beat this, so can you.500 this time, so humble from the 1500-some of zup 3, the achievement pool has been sliced for whatever reason, thought I would get a 3k carry over here.

,Recommended,591420,30108531,Posted: 22 February,all,Otter Chaos,"Zup is a sort of junk food that also happens to be very high in vitamins.  Of course, by junk food, I mean video games, and by vitamins I mean achievements.  Now, Zup 4 is rather conservative with its 555 achievements compared to Zup 3 with 1708, but the Zup experience has always been about lots of reward for little effort.Imagine you go to work in the morning.  If you actually do go to work in the morning, you won't need to imagine this part, but just play along, ok?  You sit down at your desk and start writing an email.  The twist is, that with every word you write in that email your coworkers shout “Hooray, you did it!”  and shower you with confetti.  If that's how your work day actually goes, well, don't quit your day job, but for most of us, that would seem like overkill.Yet this is the way of the Zup.  Just about every click is rewarded with at least three achievements, each an everlasting testament to your total mastery of video games in general.  Does that cheapen the meaning of achievements as a measure of skill?  Oh, you bet it does.  Is it still fun?  Yes.  Yes it is.So sure, you can play Super Meat Boy for months trying to get that most elusive achievement.  Meanwhile, I'll be here getting 2610 of them from my Zups.  Guess who wins?  That's right.  No one.  Play what you want and just be glad you don't have to shovel confetti off of your desk every day."

,Recommended,591420,31026752,Posted: 8 April,all,JacquesLeSauve,"Since it's unlikely anyone would start here in the series and skip the previous games, I'll forgo the usual overview and get straight to the good stuff. For anyone keeping score,Zup!was an interesting, fairly modest puzzle game that, whilst fun and entertaining enough, was hardly setting the world on fire.Zup! 2was an improvement, and in my own opinion, the peak of the series with a healthy mix of new ideas and a good balance of challenge, spectacle and fun.Zup! 3was pretty much more of the same and felt like an extension of 2 without really offering up anything all that new or exciting. With Zup! 4, it kind of feels like one step forward and another one back as it seems to give and take in equal measure.The stages here are a little bit more clever than they were in the last game, and it can be fun to see different pieces interact with each other and produce interesting results. Seeing a chaotic explosion of blocks flying everywhere only to eventually land perfectly into right where they all need to be is, more often than not, really satisfying. The problem in this outing, however, is quite a lot of the game feels like it's on autoplay and you're just kind of nudging the whole thing along more than applying any kind of creative problem solving.It has a ""Rube Goldberg machine"" feel to it as you watch various sequences and phases play out and just click the occasional block here and there to get the next part going. Like I said, it's all very clever stuff and fairly fun to look at, but it just isn't very engaging and I never felt particularly accomplished at any point as a result.I think the whole series can kind of slip through the cracks of certain critique in a way simply because of the price point and the fact that it does what it sets out to do and provides plenty of quick-burst, no-frills enjoyment that's pretty inoffensive for the most part. It's kind of like the fast food of gaming that way, or the sugary snack that you maybe know you shouldn't be ruining your appetite with but, even so, you still can't help yourself. And in that sense, this game, just like the others, is a quick and easy treat you're not going to make a big fuss about, but will still enjoy and probably end up indulging in again at some point in the not-too-distant future."

,Recommended,591420,30063032,Posted: 20 February,all,kayhmkay,"This is a 'if you liked the previous ones, want plenty of achievements and get this on sale' recommendation. Otherwise known as 'mixed'.Zup! 4 returns with another 60 level set of box explosion puzzles. The game does come with hundreds of alphabet style achievements just like the previous ones. (Though these are the most attractive ones, in my personal taste.)The game mechanics are the same. Click the red box for explosion, get the blue ball on the green platform. The green moving boxes and grey deletable ones return. The new mechanic in Zup! 4 is the orange box which will slowly erode after the blue ball touches it. For me, the orange boxes was a nice addition, but maybe not enough to make this game stand out from the others: this easily could have been just a DLC to the previous ones.Out of the 4 games in the series, I found this one clearly the easiest. It took me less than 35 minutes to 100% the game. Personally, I think this is too little content even for a $1 game since I'm not interested in the alphabet achievements. The number of achievements, while more moderate than in the previous installment, is still too much in regards to content. Still, there is something oddly satisfying in completing the levels as easy as they might be.All in all, nothing really new, but nothing wrong with the game either. It takes a certain person to enjoy these kind of puzzles, but they are addictive and very relaxing which is the basis for my 'recommended'."

The puzzles are relatively straightforward and well designed. Some may catch you out a little here and there but for the most part they're not very tasking and you can complete any of the games in under an hour.This game did exactly what I wanted (gave me lots of cool achievements to decorate with) and wasn't a chore to play so would recommned highly to gamers with similar intentions.

,Not Recommended,591420,30243740,Posted: 28 February,all,NeZ,"Zup! is a tiny puzzle game series where you bomb a ball onto a green floor. Each level is short - some require a prayer to RNGesus, most don't. This is the fourth game in the series and one of the shortest. This means it's a LOT easier than Zup! 3. It's a HUGE step back.So I can't recommend it. If you like the series or want to buy the game for the 555 achievements - fine. But if you're new to the series just buy Zup! 3. It's much harder and has over 9000% more achievements. If you want more achievements but a game that feels extremely tedious, buy Zup! 5.For comparison, here are the 6 Zup! games so far and how long it took me to get 100%:Zup! 1: 118 achievements, 17 minutesZup! 2: 229 achievements, 26 minutesZup! 3: 1708 achievements, 48 minutesZup! 4: 555 achievements, 23 minutesZup Zero: 1043 achievements, 37 minutesZup! 5: 2130 achievements, 46 minutes"

,Recommended,591420,33286617,Posted: 5 July,all,KingKull2112,"So this review is going to be for all Zup! games, not just this one. Therefore, I will be literally copy/pasting this across all of my reviews.Many people call these games out, citing that they're card farming games. While this may or may not be true, these games have some very good puzzles. Sure, they're short, but I feel that the price I paid for them is well worth it (Less than a dollar for each game in the summer sale?!). Some of the puzzles are really well thought out and it feels good to complete a game like this. So here's the pros and cons.Pros:-Good music, never found myself reaching for the mute button. The music IS on a loop, but it's comparable to Hexcells' music, so if you enjoyed that game's music, you'll enjoy their music as well.-Well designed puzzles, especially in 4 and Zero.Could be a pro or a con:-A ton of achievements. If you don't want to artificially inflate your achievement count, don't play any of these passed 1 and 2. If you don't care or you in fact do want to do that, go ahead and play all of them-Feels like one of those games you would love to play on Flash sites like Newgrounds or KongregateCons:-Short, but enjoyable. You could actually ♥♥♥♥ the dev(s?) out of money by getting 100% achievements in less than the 2 hour refund periodOverall, I enjoyed these games enough to recommend them all."

You get assaulted by achievements of every letter in the alphabet and you have to listen to Steven Universe Credits music the entire game.Oh... and what is up with the rediculously large menu proportions? I had a hard time finding them because they were so rediculously big. Like seriously.Can't wait to play (spend my money on) all of the other Zup! games in the series!To sum it up, the game is a ball game and that's what makes it so *cough... Different.. *cough... Physics and achievement is addicting to the human mind, so...don't let your brain fall in to this quick gaming high... But... If  you can't resist the power of the ball game, you can get this genre much better by going on basically any flash game website.This should be a flash game or a school project and not a money-making steam game.
