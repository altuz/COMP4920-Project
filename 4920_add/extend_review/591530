Usually, if the PR and community is good enough for a game you can put up with the faults and forgive it while they do their best to improve it, right? Unfortunately this is not one of those cases. I refunded the game not because it was bad, but because i see little future in it. It's a game dependant on the community and, because of bad community management and virtually no feedback improvement, this game's community is destined to fail. Censorship is never a means to increase playerbase, and blatantly ignoring said current playerbases' feedback is a recipe for destruction.As it stands now, this game has no leg to stand on it's own and i think it'd be a terrible time and monetary investment, despite the game being pretty fun and the characters and art direction well designed."

And when I say ""their game"" I mean Cwavesoft's game. Nexon just hacksawed it 'for us'.Funny how those women exist in real life, though, wouldn't you say? Should they be banned there too, just in case they're making someone uncomfortable? Walking around, existing! The nerve of some people, eh, being born a certain way.I'll change the review if they fix it with a revert or a toggle. Until then, consider this yet another person's sincere response to abusive, misguided censorship.Oh, and for those who only care about the gameplay, Nexon have said these things:“Early Access version opens up the game by offering all Hypers and their item sets. Players can try out the Hypers as well as different combinations of items and give us feedback on game balance. It has the core content and features in a playable state. We will be relying on our players' input to polish them.”“When we officially launch, the game will be Free-to-Play with an in-game shop. Early Access version will not have an in-game cash shop, but it will give access to all 28 original Hypers in the game at a flat cost.”While some of that that may be technically true, they are already selling one additional ""Hyper"", that is to say character, for in-game currency -and there are multiple characters shown in the game's trailer that are not in this version of the game at all, at this point.In other words, the ""offering all Hypers and their item sets"" line is a blatant lie. This paid early access version of a title that will soon be Free-to-Pay (no, that's not a typo) does not contain ""all"" Hypers, just the ""28 original"" ones, an admittedly diverse bunch but by no means all of the ones created to date... certainly not compared to the Korean version's character roster. I'm not saying they should have done all of the characters at once, but if they weren't going to do so, then they shouldn't say ""all"", they should say something like ""the starting lineup"". If you're paying for the privilege, you deserve to know exactly what you're getting for your money."
,Not Recommended,591530,34883886,Posted: 11 September,all,CryoGX,"Honestly; no idea what verdict to come to at the moment, but I feel like typing something up, regardless. First off: do I like this game? Yes. Will I recommend this game? As a game? Yes. As an investment? No. Wait for the game to become F2P as it's hard to actually play with people currently.I've been waiting for this game to be localized for quite some time and pulled out of closed beta, and learn of the whole censorship thing.Regardless I buy the game. I'm not gonna spout the same wall of text about the art changes because, yeah, by principle it's pretty bonkers to do it and pThat alone's a pretty big red flag but whatever, I still felt like playing.As for actual gameplay: it's fast, frantic, and pretty fun. It aesthetically and technically feels as hype as its name suggests, at least at first impression. Playing Sapitelbub feels like playing Elsword with 1000% more MOBA and 203.7% less P2W grind, but apparently melee assassins aren't meta.Though, I wouldn't know that because this game caps out at like 150 or so people a day as of right now. Finding an actual PvP game is either a test of patience or nigh impossible.I understand that this game is under the usual post-beta Founder deal, but usually inherently F2P games release ***as*** F2P and include founder separately for those who choose to pay early, instead of closing the game off to only founders.You're trying to increase your playerbase early right? You're trying to maximize feedback now that you're out of beta and can start significantly catching up with the korean version, right? Causing a controversy and having a confirmed-to-be free product hidden behind a paywall shatters early hopes for the community size. I checked the forums; the exclusive group of pre-launch users are leaving too, and they take pretty nicely to the fact that apparently this followed up immediately after beta, with little to no recognition of those that came before it. Nice.***I CANNOT form a final opinion of this game as of yet as there's legitmiately not enough people ingame at a time to allow me to do so. Makes me tempted to just go get PUBG or something in the meantime but I'm pretty sure I'd be banned for stream sniping some irrelevant person I've never heard of before this game gets a population.What needs to happen ASAP:-This game HAS to release S T A T if you want a community to grow. You made a long term, controversial decision that has had very immediate effects on the potential of this game to grow. Unless you open this game up for everyone to at least try, it will not get much better. Let me restate: ONE-HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLAYERS AT A TIME. ""We're aware of this."" I know you are. It needs to be addressed quickly. You can maintain the founders' pack as an optional thing, but you NEED players or the few you have risk getting sick of it.-I WOULD say do something about the censorship but it's apparently a permanent ""said and done"" sweeping change, so there's literally nothing we could do about it. So I hope you've assessed the consequences of that thoroughly and have other plans, if not going F2P before I finish this wall of text, to increase the currently incredibly limited population.Despite the extremely questionable decisions so far, and being under Nexon, I really want this *game* to do well.***EDIT: A bit of research shows that Alpha/Beta testers transitioned and got Founders' status for free. My bad on not reading up for that better. As I've said, I don't have a verdict, yet, and I really want this to work out. Realizing the mistake on my end lightens my mood quite a bit, but it'll take a while for the whole censorship taste to get out of my mouth. I'm personally staying to see things through as an optimist, but currently, I will not tell you to get this game. ( But I won't stop you if you want it. )>>>EDIT2:It pains me to say but I actually feel as though this game is in severe danger of dying. Let me change my last opinion in the review: Do not buy it. I am explicitly stopping you here.Sudden Attack, Ghost in the Shell, and Dirty Bomb/Extraction all were under Nexon at one point and were either killed, or shifted to a different publisher (Dirty Bomb lives on!) The common thread was that the games didn't see that much play. And in the case of HU, we're seeing 25-40 people on average at a time, capping out at 100.That's a terrible population number. You'd think the peak 100 people that play this game would have more of a direct, immediate influence on it, and yet the first course of action was brought about by people who ***AREN'T*** a part of that exclusive group.Regardless of how slight the censorship was, thinking back on that alone means that they did indeed exclude their own audience from early on, amplifying all of the potential factors that can lead to an early death for this game.Look, I want to be optimistic, too (and was). This is a fun game when I find people, and the aesthetic is nice. However, realistically, this has been a series of unfortunate events that will likely continue. Be realistic, too.If this game gets the lucky end of the stick and gets taken under someone else's wing, then I'll be all for it again. If, miraculously, the marketing and community management for this game, under current circumstances, increases significantly, I'll also be in there. However, the factors are too much to ignore right now. I'm making what I feel is the safest decision now in this scenario.I've requested a refund. Peace out."

The game is fun but doesn't do enough to differentiate itself from other games in its genre like Paragon. I still want to play, but the bait and switch advertising has left a bad taste in my mouth.

,Not Recommended,591530,34917822,Posted: 13 September,all,TUKKY,"Do not buy or come near this game. Not only do they make changes without listening to the community, they also have terrible staff. Especially on Discord. The support is horrible. Dont bother going on Hyper Universe discord, they have really abusive mods and a horrible community manager by the name of 'RAZIEL WARMONIC'. If you post or give any opinion on the game that is less than favorable they'll either delete your comment or ban you off discord lmao. Nexon US needs to hire better staff that are over the age of 15.  If you have an opinion about the censor change, you get banned. If you have an opinion about the current state of the game and how to make it better, you get banned. If you question the Community Manager's logic or rules, you get banned. lmao. But in all seriousness, the game isn't worth $16 for Early Access. If you get a beta key, you might as well sell it and get a decent buck cause this game won't last 2 months of full release. it'll end up like another MxM. It's sad since the game has potential, however with the staff on board and the blind eye from Nexon from their abusive staff, I fear the game will never get far because of the ban on criticism.The game is also full of bugs that has been around since alpha. Ladder bug, last hit bug, boss kill bug (where even when you kill the boss theres a chance the perks of siege tanks go to the other team even when none of them were around the boss when it was killed), theres also a bug where the game randomly ends and the winning team is random. The servers are also really bad and people are currently getting disconnected. There was also a bug where if you picked Turner, Yuna or Tooth/Tops you'll get disconnected (however this was fixed last week/ finally) All these problems arent worth the $16. Wait for F2P and then try it out but I fear by then the game would already be dead. Take this review as you want it. Also should be noted that the staff make jokes about the negative steam reviews daily and don't take them seriously. Maybe they will once they start looking for another job :D"

So sadly I cannot recommend this game because frankly, the game is not worth the price.I don't agree on the Censorship thing Nexon went with either, but personally it doesn't bother me, as I like to play the game and have fun, which doesn't depend on the characters art having a rather large chest, (Not that i mind), but i get that it's more of a matter of Nexon just not listening to their community or whatnot.I hope they plan to release it from Early Access soon, because if they continue like they are right now, the game won't have much of a future due to it being behind a pay wall in a world with so many Free2Play MOBA's, and that the people who have already played it, is showering the game with bad reviews, which doesn't exactly help getting more people to play the game either.

,Not Recommended,591530,34901052,Posted: 12 September,all,chawklette,"Hyper Universe is a fun game at its core, which makes it a shame that I cannot recommend it. It currently has a few problems that neither the developer nor the publisher care to fix.One of these issues is the very long queue times. They basically render the game unplayable. It can take anywhere from 20-30 minutes to get a match, and when you do, its almost always versus the same players from your previous round.To put this in perspective, back in closed beta when the game was free, I could get a match in 5 minutes or less. Obviously, the problem is a lack of players. One might ask where all the players have gone, well I’ll tell you.Its story time, gather round. In the beginning of the Hyper Universe there was a closed beta and all was good. Despite having a limited selection of characters (no Sasha? Camilla? Michelle??) everything was fine, queue times were bearable and it was generally a fun time for all players involved. And then early access came along and it was obvious that Nexon had changed the game from what the players played in closed beta: the game had been censored. So players took to questioning, inquiring why this happened. Eventually the developer responded and instead of listening to the flurry of negative feedback they had basically said: “Deal with it” in so many words. This started the exodus of the disgruntled Hyper Universe players. People refunded, or just dropped the game entirely and stopped playing altogether.Despite not even launching yet Nexon and CWAVE have basically set a bad tone for launch. While HU may be a fun game if you actually get to play it, I can’t recommend it until the developer and publisher make some changes in how they handle their game and interact with the community. I would advise anyone interested in Hyper Universe to reconsider spending their time and/or money somewhere else, preferably on a game with a future. All the thick thighs and spandex butts can’t save Hyper Universe from an inevitable death at the hands of an incompetent developer and publisher combo."

This game's skin option are extremely limited not because of it's early access but it's extreme time consuming to obtain with little player based, you will find yourself without rest and feel it's unproductive repetitiveness. No intricate item customizations or build options for players to make their characters/hypers versatile in different situation like other MOBAs does or any attempts made by developers to change otherwise. This game may try to sell itself to us by claiming to be of MOBAs but none of it's content distinct itself from game like Elsword with is just a regular pvp hack and slash button mashing game with absolutely no competitive aspect of a MOBA and I have played the likes of LoL, Smite, Paragon etc. I wasted my money, so hopefully you guys will learn from me and wait until it's free because as it stands it not worth it, just because you add tower defense like system does not make this in anyway shape or form a MOBA game."

76561198068065140,Not Recommended,591530,34890525,Posted: 11 September,all,Mordeth Kai,"Since discussion of the games censorship is being aggressively and stealthily censored on the steam forums, I'm putting this here.Context to keep people up to date:Nexon decided to censor outfits to make the game more palatable to a wider audience, they defend their decision on the basis of an in-house study that recommended the changes. Basically, the only people asking for the censorship was Nexon themselves.In response to all the complaints of censorship, Nexon has pressured the developers in Korea to censor their version to match the western release. This was done on the basis of making all versions equal because if people can't point out regional differences then nothing was censored. Yes, they are that stupid.Why is Censorship Important?Let's rewind back to the 90's where we had a game called Mortal Kombat, which had blood removed from some versions. Sure, without the blood it was still the same fighting game, and yet at the same time lost its soul. Anything artistic can be cut from a game without compromising gameplay, the entire thing could be reduced to stick figures and it would still have the same gameplay, so where do you draw the line?Blood isn't needed in games so we can cut that out, sexual content and nudity isn't needed so we can cut that, references to homosexuality isn't needed so it can be cut, religious references and symbols aren't needed so they can be cut too, and it never ends. If you gamed in the 90's then you saw it all, all of those things have been censored in one game or another on the basis it might offend someone or limit the audience. In the end, you either give a damn about the future of gaming or ignorantly think censorship will only be used in ways you approve.#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorOr you can actually judge the censorship that has been done on a case to case basis and see that this one actually isn't so bad.If they change more they will loose more customers. Remove a complete char on the bases of censorship and i'm out. We pretty much all have our own standards when it comes to censorship. This level is not enough for me to take the stance of boycotting the game.I'll say it again though respect towards everybody their opinion on the matter, but the discussion is pretty much over. Any and all conversation about censorship should be talked about on a forum thats against censorship in games in general. It's time to stop beating the dead horse.A year or two ago, gamers were trying to fight censorship when things like the Miku butt slap was being removed from Street Fighter V and costumes were being cut from Bravely Default and Fatal Frame. Sliders, costumes, and religious references were removed from Xenoblade Chronicles X, and DOA Extreme 3 wasn't even getting a western release. People were defending and rationalizing these things, and then Steven Universe had a kissing scene between two girls removed. The people who had been defending censorship threw a fit. I wish I could say the people who had been fighting censorship joined their enemies on the issue, but very few did. They relished the poetic justice of seeing the people who defended censorship get a taste of it.It's like ice cream. We all have flavors we like and don't like. If you don't like rocky road, then you probably won't care if it gets taken off the shelf. If you're allergic to mint, you might want mint chocolate chip removed. When someone speaks up saying ""that's my favorite, please don't take it away"", people who don't care will tell them they are being childish, that there are plenty of other flavors to choose from, that they don't need that flavor specifically, until it's their favorite that's on the chopping block. If an ice cream manufacturer is only making one flavor of ice cream and they want the broadest group of potential customers, they will go with vanilla, the blandest flavor. No one likes it, no one hates it, it doesn't appeal to any specific preferences but everyone is a potential customer. The difference between games and ice cream is that games have a well documented and recent history of this crap. If gamers don't band together to put a stop to it on a matter of principle, it will only get worse.https://img.fireden.net/v/image/1456/79/1456798347118.png""The more examples of this that the industry provides -- the more options we give management types to use for filling the blanks in statements like, ""Well, ____ did it!"" or, ""Well, ____ had worse censorship than that!"" -- the harder it will be to convince anyone to leave games intact in the future.""https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3socra/censorship_bust_slider_removed_from_character/Fun fact, the group that butchered fire emblem fates not only got to keep their jobs, but now they will be going to Japan once or twice a month so they can tell developers what they can and can't put in their games to avoid inconsistencies and accusations of censorship.

Censoring games that were already originally FAR from NSFW or porn is just pandering to people who can simply not play a game if it bothers them so much.An option to toggle on or off the level of sexy content would be fine, as I understand some don't want to play games with too much sex appeal with their kids around, but censoring like this sucks.As for the game itself, it is fun, and a cool different take on the MOBA thing with really nice graphics, but melee characters get pinged by turrets too easily, too quickly, and can't possibly avoid their homing shots even if they just barely crossed the line into a turret's shot zone then ran the opposite way immediately. This makes all ranged characters vastly more effective and fun. That needs to be fixed.The game also only has one level to play, so it gets old pretty fast. That's okay though since it is early access.With some tweaks to limit how much turrets screw over melee characters, new stages, and a censorship toggle in the options, this could be a really good game.

The issue is respawn timers being horribly long, 2 minutes at mid-late game. Gross.The team that wins is the one with the most CC, and since majority of heroes has some kind of cc ability, that makes it impossible to truly counter when you just get locked down and demolished. Ignitia is also disgusting with her damage.I think it will have an audience, but it's not me. Peace out, nerds."

Universal items give you some flexibility on basic stats and efffects, Unique items, which are for their own chars which buff them example (max stack of burns increased by 1 or Cooldown reset from passive now affects your ultimate).Current major issues...

Think of this game as that with anime-esque like characters and if you're not into that stuff, no one's forcing you to pay up those 17 bucks. At least I hope not.Is it censored? They made the changes to the art to make the women less sexy by covering up their skin more and shrinking their boobs. Yet not the blue skinned man wearing no shirt. Tch, equality my♥♥♥♥♥Shrinking those boobs is why I am giving them a negative review.Is all this due to why there is such a low lack of the playerbase right now? Yes as I have lurked in the discussions on both steam and the official forum and other sources, yes. That playerbase were the same people who were initially excited for this game, signed up for the closed beta a few months back and for those who got the game before the change, I feel exceptionally sorry for you.Why did I get the game? I let my second head convince me that maybe Nexon NA will change their mind. Hahahaha...people like them will NEVER change their minds. Don't be a sucka like me and get this in Early Access.

Lets get the positive out of the way.  I like the feel and look of the game in terms of control and aesthetics.  The controls are there and I have had no real issue with my xbox one controller hooking up and jumping right in.  Coming into this I was initially unaware off any censorship going in, so I found the character designs to be pretty nice and pleasing to the eye.  Also not surprised yet another developer would cave to the SJW and Feminist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of today that wouldn't even take the time to play this game and live simply to troll us gamers that would.On to the negative:  Simply put,  my biggest gripe is that I start the game and litterally 10 to 15 minutes into the game I get a severe drop in frames followed by a crash and the joy of rebooting my computer because apparently my graphics card decides to crash along with the game.  I tried every setting I could imagine from lowest to highest, windowed, not windowed  etc.  Nothing works.  Take a look at the system specs above and idealy it would appear this game should run on a toaster so one has no conclusion to draw other than poor optimization to be the culprit.  I would return this game if I could but I am well over my two week threshold so I have no choice but to wait.  Also for what little I can enjoy of the game,  I see what could potentially be overpowerd characters that I'm sure will make the game unbalanced and overall unenjoyable.

I've never seen a MOBA die this fast before.1. Broken promises“We’ve fixed queue times” - I… queued up for 90 minutes…. NINETY minutes…. NINETY MINUTES. As a solo queuer. Not as a  multi queuer but a single person who could fit into another 2 man or 3 man team but nope. The queue didn’t pop up and someone dodged… I didn’t hit queue button to requeue… I sat there for 90 straight minutes waiting on the time to tick. In this day and age where MOBAs rule the competitive gaming industry there is no excuse for a player to sit in a queue for 90 minutes straight.Video Proof:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh63j33JkiY&t=2731s""This game will ALWAYS be free"" - Turns out, this game actually went buy to play. Originally $9.91 exactly then up to ""$15"" at 15.99 (actually 16 bucks).  The devs spoke on this saying that they wanted their most loyal players getting a large 24 benefit of getting 24 hypers and to test out the game for them. Yes... we did get that large roster... but why isn't the game itself free. The game could've been free, not break its philosophy of ""NEVER"" going buy to play. Other games have already shown that they can go free and have loyal customers who pay for the game (aka ME!!!!); the game being another steam game called SMITE.""We will reduce the amount of CC lock that happens in the game"" - Okay... the devs nerfed some characters who could stun you 5 times in rapid succession (those 2 characters' stuns lasts about .8 seconds each = nearly 4+ seconds of being stunned by a SINGLE hero. Good right? Well... in korea... they've just released New hypers that could stun 4+ times and are able to bypass immunity... yeah... THAT'S NOT GOOD.“X will be available next update” - Liu (Bruce Lee character) was slated to be released in early access… Liu was not available in early access. Formerly existing Hypers such as Arslan and Signal were removed from early access. [if you payed for the game… you will not receive these promised or formerly released characters… that you should’ve gotten - (“you will only receive the currently existing 24 hypers in the game”)2. Game problemsYou have to play nearly two hours of forced beginner bot games (receiving a massive 30% stat boost) before you can get any real PvP matches. Assuming that each match is finished at 10 minute mark (simply hard pushing for the win) and it takes about 2 games to gain an account level and you have to be level 5 to start pvping; that’s nearly 100 minutes of boring bot games at optimal speed.So you’re level 5 now? I hope you like going up against 3-4 man veteran player stacks that don’t want to play with “newbies” because they don’t like losing because of a new player that hasn’t figured the game out. Yeah… I hope you’re ready to lose… again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again... as a solo player EVEN if you start figuring the game out. Oh… did I also mention that I sit in queues for 90 minutes to run into 3-4 man veteran player stacks with my team being all new players CONSISTENTLY? Yeah… that’s not fair."

,Not Recommended,591530,34729402,Posted: 4 September,all,Roman Reigns,"Disclaimer: I can't really recommend this because of censorship and the way the devs are handling the negative feedback that the early access players are leaving on the forums. They've already managed to lose many founders after all the drama this caused.As for the game itself, the concept and mechanics are great but ruined by balance and the fact that item builds are all pretty much the same in the end so it ends up being all left to whoever has a more broken hyper. Match making is pretty silly but gets a pass since there is only about 200 concurrent players. Stuns are way too long and can be hit in succession with little to no degration.Back to the censorship, I can't help but feel that it'll drag out content from being released. As the pr guy in the forums said, they are redrawing portraits, changing models, and messing with the physics. To me that sounds like a lot of work, especially after having to translate text and recording voicelines it'll create a bigger gap between korean and na games.Onto the localization itself.The voice overs are actually pretty quality though I would've preferred dual audio or just korean I can actually say I enjoy the vo in english enough to not demerit the game. The text on the other hand is pretty botched. Names and items being changed even though the originals were already english is just one example of this. Not knowing any korean or having played the source material makes it hard to point out any jarring differences in the story skits though I still enjoy what they wrote so that's a plus.Finally is the Hyper Cube system. Completely garbage. First of all you only get 3 cubes a day plus whatever you get from the level rewards. Next you gotta get 10 to 20 samples of one item to create it which is ridiculous given that they put all 3 taunts in the reward box for every character making it hard to even get a skin you want. Then you gotta roll power cubes as well once you have enough to craft anyway. Taunts should be removed from the cubes and placed in the store for purchase that way we aren't fighting rng as hard for these items. The synthesizing is even worse, you disassemble your rolls and spend 5 coins for 1 sample instead of the normal 3 you get, and it's still rng so what's the point.TLDR - Screw censorship and the devs inablity to listen to the already tiny community it has. Gameplay is solid but broken. Translation itself is ok. ♥♥♥♥ Cubes."

There are 5 or 6 different classes and all feel unique with their own micro-gameplay involved from combos to for instance switching card suits for different effects on your attacks.

It takes too many frames to start moving when you hit the movement buttons or keys. This makes the game feel bad and takes away some of the fun. In a game like this you can't have this problem. This is my biggest problem so far.- Low playerbase.- You don't unlock interesting stuff while playing and winning games. This doesn't motivate enough to keep playing.- Some abilities balance problems. But this is normal in a game like this.- When there are too much players fighting at the same location is a bit hard to distinguish what is happening and where is your target.- The map is not interesting. It needs more things like platforms and things to do to make the game more fun. I don't like the ladders too much.**I really want this game to be better and become something bigger. It is different from the rest of the MOBA games and I love fighting games, that is why this appeal to me more than other games of the genre.**"

The only true cons I have is mainly how the equipment system works. You have to have a set built before you can play how you want to play, but because of this, you are not able to switch out equipment during game or buy items like wards and whatnot. So if your team does not have a ward, then you're without ward. And you can't resell everything to build a counter build against the other team either. Once you've selected your build, you are entirely stuck with that build until you lose or win.However, as of right now, I don't see it much as a problem, but there were times where I wished I could buy a ward. So at least, if the game does change, I do wish to have temporary items like wards or potions to be bought in a temp slot for those specific items at least."

There's only one map and it's easy to read and understand what's going on. Characters are varied and all fill their roles and with items allow you to customize each character to further diversify their roles to how you want to play. Most important thing is that movement and actual attacks FEEL right that's a big thing for me in side scrolling games.Good art :Even with censorship it's still good. Also the censorship is self censorship as in the artist themselves chose to do it so heck off with anything saying creativity > censorship.Animations are varied between each character, fir each character, and are very fluid.Optimization :I run it with a rx480 at 1440p and it matches my monitors 144hz refresh rate without a single stutter. This is while running 1-2 other games in the background as well.Balance :This is perhaps the game's weakest point and it's understandable considering how early on the game is. Some characters are just simply better at their roles than others. It's hard to tell if this is an issue with the characters themselves or if people haven't found the right item builds to make characters work at their prime. Either way it needs some work.Cash Items :I went in assuming there would be some but there weren't any. You get coins after every match and use those to purchase more gear set slots, emblem spaces(cosmetic), and that's about it. On the official site they say that skins are coming but right now there's only pallette swaps. Those swaps by the way are super hard to get. You are given a chance to get 3 boxes a day, 1 per win. And these boxes randomly have 3 of some item that can be used to craft those pallette swaps along with avatars and I guess other items for characters to use but I've yet to see those. They also can give materials to gain access to new characters but buying the game at the time of writing gives you all the heroes after a few matches.I'd suggest this game to anyone and I have to a few friends already.

Recently, some companies and developers have begun to get creative with the execution of this style of game. And I hate them.This one, however... as a lover of side scrollers, platformers, and just a retro action nerd in general, I felt right at home picking this game up. You select your item loadouts before you even queue from the match, and you can even set the order in which they auto level, making it so that you're never sitting at base, wondering what to buy while your team is out there, dying. You can experiment with different builds, which can change the entire playstyle of the character you're playing.It's a recent release, so it only has one map, but starting Early Access with 28 characters is impressive, and all very different in their style of play. Heck, there are even 3 characters in the thumbnail of the game above that aren't in it yet. I have high hopes for this game's future. It's already very fun, and I'd love to see the content they add to it over time.This game will likely be a major part of my Twitch streams in the near future."

,Recommended,591530,34492354,Posted: 25 August,all,Ｃritical Ｈit,"This is one of those games while yes, it's advertised as a MOBA. I played a few hours of it and wow, I'm hooked. It is really one of those games you need to try out. Because just watching the gameplay by itself doesn't do it justice.It all began honestly when I played my first few matches and I went, ""Huh, this really has a Smash Bros. kind of vibe to it"" but with some cooldowns. So there are fighting mechanics to uphold like zoning and hit boxes. However, what makes this game a lot faster paced while keeping it fun are: item building can be done at any time, and auto attacking gains you mana. Maps are simple and a bit on the short side.It definitely trumps Brawlhalla and Awesomenauts, and the microtransactions in this game is really just ""Hey if you want to collect cosmetics here you go."" For the game's current state of 24 playable characters, it seems balanced for the most part.With that in mind, there are caveats for the cynically insane people. For example, the publisher is Nexon USA. While they have made improvements as a company in terms of keeping things micro-transaction friendly (by a few margins), I have to disclaim that fact before purchasing in.Outside of that, however. It's a solid Early Access Game and when it goes live or if the game changes drastically that warrants a de-recommendation, I will change this review.Recommend to: MOBA/Side-Scrolling PvP Players, people who want a side game to play that they can relax to and PvP with at the same time.Do Not Recommend to: People who are on the fence with Nexon"

Check to all of those.I bought into early access because a friend of mine did, and at the time, the founder's pack was on sale so I thought why not buy it and try it out. After I bought the pack I realized that I really got a lot of value out of my money, by recieving a ton of heroes and their equipment for only 10€ (the sale price at the time). Compared to other moba games with offers like these, it stood out to me as being pretty inexpensive and having great value.Currently even if the playerbase isn't that high, I keep coming back every day and get into great PvP matches with all sorts of people. It's a small community, but a pretty cool community as well (if you don't consider the doomsayers and the protesters that are trying to be as visible as possible on reviews and media like reddit and forums).I think the gameplay is polished, and I can and will definitely recommend this game to others.

(this could be just me/work in progress?/EA?).- Lost of negativity surrounding (minimal) censorship.- Lots of hypers still missing from the roster.- Que times are doable, but can be slow depending on what time you play.End verdict:So far a enjoyable 2d moba that sorta of plays out like a brawler. It's pretty fast paced and overall has most elements you would expect from moba type games. The only reason this game is getting allot of negative reviews as of late is a people having trouble with the censorship matter.As i personally don't feel this influences the gameplay i will fully recommend it.

They are not wrong to point out western markets tend to prefer more modesty but they will also have to consider who their core audience is.

I did a little bit of research and discovered that the game was censored for NA audiences, and that did at first detract from my decision to plunge in, but we'll touch on that subject a little bit later.After going ahead and splurging on the Founder's Pack for myself, I started playing through the Prologue and on into vs. AI games for the first time. The game controls like a dream. Everything is slick and responsive, frame perfect inputs. You can tell the developers have a bit of fighting game experience here. There is an array of characters (Hypers) that you can choose from, all with a role to choose from, be it DPS, Healer, Tank, etc. The normal staples of MMO and MOBA gameplay. The action is fast and furious, and games wrap up in a nice time frame, about 20 minutes each, though some can drag on. (I myself was involved in a very intense back and forth 40 minute game!)The Founder's Pack seems like an excellent deal to get you jumpstarted into Hyper Universe, as you'll get all of the Hypers in early access.After that, when the game goes live it will be totally free to play. New Hypers, Maps and Items will be released in the future, like many other games of this nature, and having a bit of advanced knowlege of the Korean game, I know which ones I'm looking forward to!Coming from a very long League of Legends career, I find Hyper Universe to be a breath of fresh air in a stagnant MOBA genre.Now, shall we address the elephant in the room.I find it funny that there are so many bad reviews about Hyper Universe. Oh boo hoo, getting all uppity because you can't see ♥♥♥♥♥ in a video game. Here is a message from the Developer's CEO, CWAVESOFT about the issue:http://hyperuniverse.nexon.net/en/news/article/25193/special-message-from-our-developersAs you can see, this is not just NEXON's decision, but also the choice and decision of the developers to edit the original game in Korea as well. In the end, the amount of skin shown on a character isn't going to affect gameplay in the slightest. A good game is going to remain a good game, regardless.(To be quite honest, I didn't really notice, you can still see a fair amount. :^) )If you're on the fence, take the dive like I did. You will be pleasantly surprised.The team is highly loving and caring of their product and community, and I support them wholeheartedly."

,Recommended,591530,35173207,Posted: 24 September,all,Midnightspecter,"First time review, so here goes.I could say that this game is great fun, that it looks and moves amazing, that it takes MOBA elements and puts them in a 2D setting, that it calls out to oldschool fighting game fans and bridging the two genres. But everyone seems to be talking about 2 things and 2 things only: the censorship, and the lacking roster compared to the Kr version.First off, I'll agree that censorship is bad, but in this case, there was excessive response to it, both from the devs and the playerbase. The devs seem to have been preparing for if (big if) the game was to be an object of streaming and broadcast competition. We've seen this before, how event organizers took players aside and effectively told them that some char skins couldn't be used since they're being broadcast on TV (DoA, Street Fighter, ...). But putting such an emphasis on this aspect could and should have waited till the game was more popular. Worried about coverage? Wait till you actually *get* coverage before you worry about it.Then the playerbase also blew things out of proportion. Again, censor is bad, but it was really a minor alteration. But it's so prominent in the reviews and comments that it's now the *only* thing people see, and it's killing the game even before it got past the starting block. And really, there were times when I wouldn't have even noticed the char art alterations had they not been explicitly pointed out. I was more focused on, oh I dunno, actually playing?Now the comparison with Kr version. Are we behind? Yes. But this is a necessity. This isn't like Ultimate versions of fighting games like Injustice or Street Fighter. Those are full priced games, which added the DLC in long timed increments. The Kr version had a longer time to release the new content, and properly monetize it. It would be too much of a financial loss to have the game be exactly like the Kr version upon release. Sure it'd be easy to call this a money grabbing tactic, but how else were they to make a profit? The few Hypers that will be released soon? That wouldn't be enough. The early access was a way to make up for that financial catch-up. But why were people complaining about what was a good deal? Getting all characters unlocked for 10$ is a far cry from paying individually for each one later.Bottom line, the idea of censor is bad, but it's not a game crippling alteration. Let the game mature and get off the starting block before you condemn it, and the long waiting queues are a direct result of all I'd just stated."

You never know what is completely scripted- Game longetivity-> The game will probably never break through and stick to the community it created in its first few months-> With a small playerbase and people asking for more updates, prices for cash-shop items will probably increase overtime- Localization-> It takes a while to localize updates so unless you read no news you'll probably be jealous of them asians- Not worth the pricetag-> 10USD would be more realisticI can tell it's a decent game but it probably won't last me very long. I do think it deserves more players than it currently has, which isn't all too bad to be honest, so I would recommend it. If you like MOBA's and want something fresh, I'd say go for it.What I'd tell the developers: your game will never compete with giants such as Master X Master (which has a low playerbase anyway...) and you probably won't steal enough players from Awesomenauts so try not to be too greedy and pass everyone a bunch of cool goodies, especially while it's in beta. I don't think the updates will come fast enough for players to stay interested, so host some community events and reward everyone for sticking with you guys.*** Review update ***So I sank a bunch more hours into the game (a lot of which was sitting in the menu though) and so far I play about 3-5 matches a day. It's pretty easy getting into a game if you ask enough people (EU) and if that doesn't work I go to NA East (5-10m queue)."

That is not in any way, shape or form true as their opinions are not what form games nor what make them succeed, especially given that they want doesn't affect the game in ANY WAY! They're literally requiring that the games female characters look like Hentai chicks for them to enjoy it, and yet it literally changes nothing about the quality of the game and the actual gameplay - so why the holy hell do you need it? (Hint: They don't, they were just spoiled to feck by their parents as children and now expect everyone to give them exactly what they want, otherwise that person is wrong.)Onto the game! This will be short as I'm not exactly the most atriculate of people, and I believe you should try it for yourself and if you hate it so much, you can also ask for a refund. From the eight or so hours I've played, the game is easily one of the best MOBA I've ever played - and I've played them all. While a few characters (cough athena cough) are a little overpowered and need a bit of a push to take down,there aren't any that are SUPER overpowered like in games such as LoL and Smite (cough warriors cough), and you won't really find any being able to 4 on 1 people.  Despite the characters coming in your basic archetypes of 'Bruiser (aka warrior)', Support, Tank, Striker (Hunter/Archer/Shooter ect ect), Assassin and Specialist (Sort of a mage though some have ranged basics and some have melee, and all of them are different; though most are known to do high damage while lacking most other things, especially tankiness), each character is highly unique. Not only to each other, but MOBA's in general. There's your basic 'female priest with a huge stave' who has like 3 heals and a revive, then there's the more unique alien girl who can switch between damaging auto attacks and healing auto attacks, teleport people from base into a fight/just next to a fight for an ambush and hase both healing and damaging mines, as well as a 'literally heal everyones entire hp bar because screw your damage dealers', with a passive that heals part of her hp every time you heal them, every character has it's role and it's spot and it's unique types of doing what you want to do.None of the tanks are the same, none of the supports do the same kind of support, none of the bruisers have the same style or the same CC or the same damage types, and none of the 'mages' do the same form of damage; you can be your own favorite character and play how you want. Not only that, but another unique feature allows each character to build their own item builds with items unique to that character, ones that strengthen, prolong or in some other way buff one of their abilities.Also, a few reviewers have (again) lied their faces off by somehow trying to argue that matches take 'hours' to find and you're unable to even sustain a match. None of that is in any way true; the longest I've waited is 4 minutes, which is about the time I wait in the EU for Smite and LoL matches, so I really don't know where they thought that would work.All things considered, it deserves at least a 'very positive', and one should not take the random dislikes as the actual review; especially considering that the people not recommending the game are salty as all hell over their anime tiddies not being seen. It's pathetic, childish and pure ridiculousness. Give it a try, I highly doubt you'll be upset over it!"

They whine about the jiggly physics being gone but don't say anything about the gameplay. It's a great game, period. Ignore this vocal minority, because they don't care about the game, they care about their personal ideals about whether games should or shouldn't be censored. They don't review about the game, it's just bashing any amount of censorship applied to a game. Hyper Universe is one of the best games Nexon has released. Done."

The art style is fantastic and the way the game is setup is a pretty different from the normal Moba format. Its nice to have something new, but still feel familiar to games like League of Legends, HoTS, and Dota. Despite the ridiculous amounts of negativity surrounding the ""issues"" of the game, if you enjoy the fast paced combat of mobas, and want to try out something new give this game a shot."

The controls make you want to pull your hair out, and the combat is blocky, and wonky. Save yourself the $10. Play a new fun moba like Gigantic or something."

If you can get over the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s being slightly smaller, then maybe you can find the actual entertainment in the game play."

I've read through the negative reviews, and pretty much all of them are virtue signaling over a slight variance in art. The characters are still VERY SEXUAL. If all you want is to ogle anime tiddies, please stay out and let the game die though. For real.Playerbase isn't great, but if you live in the US, queue for US East at pretty much any time and you'll get a game within 5 minutes. Even better at peak times, >2 minutes. Don't even attempt to play on US West or EU. You'll sit there over an hour waiting. If you can manage to wait 2-5 minutes for a game, what you find is a unique gameplay exerpience not ruined by art localization. If you're very concerned about playerbase, check back if/when it goes free to play. Should bring in a new wave of players."
