,Not Recommended,591790,32079599,Posted: 31 May,all,Logmannn,"Coming from someone who regularly plays Onward, bullets and more, Pavlov and sometimes even battledome. I really wanted this to be good but it wasn't. Maybe because it is in pre-release? Every other vr gun game that I have is better than this even without destruction physics. I would probably give this half a year maybe even a year before I would consider repurchasing. Here are things that the developer needs to fix before this becomes playable:*no reloading by cocking anything... All you do is put the mag in.*when you try to put your mag in your hand will sometimes get stuck to the gun even when you have a mag in your hand*No eject button for mags either*3 on 3 is waaay too small of teams*die when putting your head into something on accident*no indication whatsoever as to how you died*die when you go outside of the building that you are defending?*get stuck in walls*no clear idea as to what you are supposed to do. There is a bomb and it looks super complicated as to what you are to even do with it on the offending team*talking doesn't work really at all. Nobody really talks removing any social aspect of the game. It is entirely push to talk with grip and it doesn't work all of the time*no muting or kicking annoying people once they figure out how to talk*players spawn in as white bodies and you have no idea who is on your team or not*no bodies at all?*hands stick to the gun and easily fall off and no option to turn this off*no other scope options other than iron sights (Not that you will use them because your hand will pop off way before you can get it to your face)*you cycle through two options of items using the menu button instead of actually grabbing items...*clip is in an awkward place and is hard to grab as the collision is too small*destruction isn't nearly powerful enough*maps feel super small*not everything is destructible. you see a desk and you can't destroy it. you see a brick wall and you can't destroy it. you see a bunch of guns and you can't move them.*no grenades or ability to throw c4. you keep clicking and when the c4 finally sticks you blow yourself up because you kept clicking.*no reason to use destruction because everyone guns it out anyways.*you can walk right through someone*no music*no movement sound as far as I could hear*pistols have like 3 bullets*guns can be one handed easily*guns have unlimited clips"

The quality is pretty impressive for early access.This is the most underrated or not talked about game on the VR market. At 10 bucks, it's a steal.

76561197991505382,Recommended,591790,32062619,Posted: 30 May,all,mshagg,"This is a day 1 review.  There's a few issues the dev is aware of which will no doubt be fixed.  Anyways, some impressions:Some impressions:- Overall the core gameplay is in good shape and does what it says on the box.  Quite entertaining when the wall you're taking cover near is blown open with a fistful of C4.  I dont like to compare different games but, think Pavov with attack/defending roles for each team.- Good selection of weapons, which feel quite different, as well as options for breaching instruments (sledge hammer, C4) or shields.  Defenders have a number of reinforcements which can be set up strategically to direct the incoming attackers.- There's a few glitchy moments, particularly with weapons handling (i.e. a gun that wont take a magazine and a new one needs to be retrieved from an armory).  Sounded like the dev was pretty familiar with them so no doubt they will be fixed.  Nothing game breaking and we were able to play a few full games through to completion (first to 4 wins).- Non dominant hand automatically locks to the weapon, which results in some unexpected interactions, i'd personally prefer a toggle- Be careful with the sledgehammer as you can TK when you spawn for the attack- The game is begging for some throwables... grenades might be a bit OP but flash or smoke would be epic.- I would like the ammo belt to be a little bit lower as it sits fairly high on your torso and can be difficult to see- Teams being able to hear one another on the radio is listed as a known issue in the menu screen.  It did make for some reasonably good banter though.- Performance was good, no frame drops on this system and has quality and supersampling settings in game.Solid shooter for the 9 bucks I paid and only negatives is that it's just in need of some polish.  Capable of some varied strategies which I didnt really get a chance to explore in the hour or so we spent figuring everything out."

,Recommended,591790,33690124,Posted: 20 July,all,Killertom63,"I am a massive fan of Rainbow Six: Siege. I love the game. This game has the protental to be that! The Developer is working closely with his community and listening to what they've got to say about the game.Whether you want to go in with C4, or just sledge hammer you way through. The simple yet effective controls are easy to learn. The guns are easy to use and communication between your team is easy.Create kill holes to flank your enemies, or just go in guns blazing with a riot shield!To those who are worried about if there are players or not. JOIN THE DISCORD. The Developer has scheduled game nights for us all to enjoy a game or 2 with the dev and other players.It's still early on but since the first time I've played, it had changed a lot.NOTE. I've only played 2 hours, this is because I'm not used to this type of locomotion and I get motion sick really easily. So I play 2/3 games everytime I play.Sometimes Games can be quick, or they can be long. Depends on how tactical you are really.Anyway, if you're a VR player this is a must buy game. It's $10! It's not even like it's $$$$.BUY BUY BUY! :D"

One is a defuse the bomb and the other is kill the enemy team before the time runs out.Defuse mode is played more tactical and you need to be more careful when entering, and the map helps with that. It has some places where you can hide and abush the enemy team. The map is really easy to learn and i feel its well balanced.Kill the enemy gamemode is a more intense way of playing this game. All of the walls are can be destroyed so you have to use your reinforcements to create a room where they cant just suddenly kill you from behind. The map is smaller so you can check all of the rooms easier but there is still good ways to ambush it.This game is awesome but needs more players. If you get on the discord for this game there is channel for a cometogether were you can ask is someone wants to play and if its the rigth time you can have more than 2 game rooms full.Cant say that i had so much fun in a game since this one."

With many other shooters offering a similar experience, Breach It brings a different style of attack and defend gameplay that is refreshing. The game is Early Access which can act as a red flag for buyers, but rest assured the developer is very active in updating and even playing the game. Breach It may be short on content like many other young VR titles but the solid gameplay and ability to improvise with friends in multiplayer makes up for the wait of further updates."

One team finds the bomb and defuses while the other team defends and the way the level is setup creates a lot of good hallway shootouts.  THe destruction is awesome.  You can use C4 or a sledgehammer to break down walls.  Defenders can put up a certain number of metal curtains to protect some walls from breaking and wood on the doors, which can be shot or broken down..Guns: have a good feel to them, accurate aiming, great sounds and impact.  It has a simple reload mechanic at the moment, grab and pull out mag, then grab one off the waist and slide it in, no cocking a slide to chamber a round.  No fire selector yet.Some drops from games in the very early acess, but most games have been solid and ran good.Overall a good start and dev already dropped some fixes after a day."

,Recommended,591790,32154720,Posted: 3 June,all,molinaridude,"Have you ever wanted to experience Rainbow Six: Siege in virtual reality? Then this game is for you.The game works very much like Rainbo Six, the defenders board up doors and reinforce walls while the attackers prepare an attack plan. The attackers can, when planning their attack also choose a utility item as well as a weapon. This can either be a riot shield, a hammer to break holes in walls, and C4 to make even bigger holes in walls.The game released less than a week ago into early access, so most of my issues with the game will probablly be fixed over time. One of themr is that there is currentlly only one map, however, because it randomizes the spawn points of the defenders and attckers as well as provide different ways to enter the building, it doesn't get too stale. There are only 5 weapons currentlly in the game, which doesn't really affect the game, semi-automatic and burst-fire rifles would be welcome, but will probablly be added on later. Player models have not yet beed created, insted there is a floating torso and helmet, the creator has said he is working on player models. I've seen some people complain that they can't distinuish between allies and enemies, but in the middle of a firefight you are not supposed to, whne in a calm situation the colours of the two teams can be easilly distinguished.The game is quite fun and, although not finished yet, the game doesn't cost a lot of money and I can definatelly see more potential in the future.Possitives:Most walls are fully destructibleRanomized defender and attacker spawnpointsEvery item in game (that is not part of the environment) is physics basedMany gun skinsNegatives:Only one mapNo player modelsLow weapon varietyHard to aim down sights"

,Recommended,591790,32059835,Posted: 30 May,all,Handerre,"I can definitely recommend Breach It if you're looking for a medium paced multiplayer shooter that inspires both tactics and fun.Controller mechanics:Touchpad locomotion only (controller sets forward direction)Manual reload (simplified)Two handed rifle grip (proximity grip only)Obviously inspired by Rainbox Six Siege, this is a VR game with destructible walls and special equipment like hammers, C4, and shields. The replayability factor is great thanks to all the potential approaches available, and this is good since there’s only one map available at launch. Also there’s a decent gun selection, nice graphics (Unreal Engine), and great performance. Get it!"

It is the first VR game to have breaching mechanics just like Seige, and it applies simple combat with basic movement to create a wonderful game that anyone can get into quickly. I admit, this game has plenty of bugs and still is in early access. But think about it, early access means that this game is still in development, and that means that it isunfinished.

Maybe some day I can come back and change my review. It's an awesome idea but I just get the vibe that there are more artists on the team than actual game developers, although that may or may not be true. Some things i'd like to leave,- Bots fire straight through every wall, killing you if they hear any sort of noise.- Basically no one plays, which makes it worse since the bots make the game about unplayable. Pretty much would only possibly be fun as of right now if you had freinds to play with or as they suggest, organize a game on their discord- At first glance you think there are plenty of weapons to use, but really theres about five I believe? The rest are just call of duty style painted reskins.- Map selection seems limited although I know this is being worked on- Gun handling seems a bit wonky at times, it sometimes seems like bullets just disappear before they hit the end of a hall- You get 45 seconds to gear up and make a strategy which really isn't much because most of the time is spent getting gear.It's a really awesome concept and I will look to play again if I've seen it's changed or gotten better but right now all I find myself doing in it is walking around."

,Not Recommended,591790,32185178,Posted: 4 June,all,Foxx ♠,"Pros:-Nice playermodels, like a SWAT version of Rec Room-I like the main menuCons:-sometimes the round just won't start when you're pressing the red button-can grab 10 bazillions mags in one hand-no round chambering, just switch mags and fire-blowing C4 is the same trigger to place it. it often refuses to places itself on walls. you end up dying trying to place C4 when it suddenly works-The whole game feels like something achievable with 5 guns blueprints, a few destructible mesh walls in UE4 and too many skins per guns. And it's probably what it is.-if you make the mistake of grazing a wall you'll get stuck in it. So you have to physically walk off the wall in your room scale before you're able to use the locomotion again.-if you try to step outside the building as defense, the screen gets so red you don't know what's happening and then you just die. ... ok.Overall it was a nice little experience, but nowhere near what I'd pay 8.99 dollars for. As it is when I wrote my review, this is worth about 5 dollars imho.I expect my opinion to be unpopular due to the success of the game and how many people are crazed for VR games, and I recall when I was a kid how every game seemed perfect, but it's not doing it for me.Wishing the best to the dev(s) who seem like a nice guy, and hoping that the project will keep growing up!EDIT: According to the devs the problems are related to a laggy host. I was hosting half of the games, and I have optic fiber internet connection."

In VR, weapon handling and manipulation are important to me, I like the guns to feel real. Something 3H and Onward do really well. This game willl stay on my whish list and I'll continue to follow it. But if you like realistic weapons handling this isnt it, at least not yet."

At random times,  the controller will rumble endlessly until you exit the game. The bots can spot you from anywhere and will shoot you. Most guns in the game are just reskins of each other, and you never have enough time to plan your breach because it starts 45 seconds after you spawn. If you work on the game a bit more, fixing the bots and bugs, then I might play this game again."

This seems like a very basic issue that would affect a large number of players, so I don't see how it isnt fixed. Game must also be put in compatibility mode to run at all with Oculus, and it crashes SteamVR. I cannot recommend this game in its' current primitive state. I am chnaging the review to positive for now, because the Dev has messaged me personally to try and help, which isnt seen often and I appreciate. Im holding out hope for this game."
