,Not Recommended,592030,33837871,Posted: 27 July,all,Le Sweesh,"I wanted to like this game, the advert made it seem very fun and charming, but a few things prevent me from really enjoying it.1. The total absence of music. I get it, its a blocky world, but the game feels so barren and empty when the only thing you can hear is ambient wind and gunshots. This really detracts from the advertised ""hilarious"" game for me, I honestly feel even just the music from the trailer would liven up the environment a lot.2. What you can and cannot interact with can be very unclear at times. This could just be me personally failing, but I found a lack of clarity could get in the way of me enjoying a puzzle.The game isn't terrible by any means, but I feel it could be a lot better. I hope the game gets a bit of love and polish in these regards, most particularly in the music department, because then I'd like to give it another shot.Update: since this review the devs have added music. I have yet to re-purchase the game and experience it for myself but this review is now out of date and should be taken with a pinch of salt. Props to the devs for listening to feedback."
76561198014672868,Recommended,592030,33914600,Posted: 30 July,all,luke.zie,Have a hard time recommending this game.  It was fun but if  you can squeze a hour of gameplay out you are doing pretty well.  If they could add level creation as part of the game it would definitely be a thumbs up.  To be honest I am sick of the job simulator and such type of games available for the vive and this kind of falls into the same kind of category.I'll give it a thumbs up since it was well executed but definitely not worth $20.  If this was not a vr game it would be worth maybe $2.50 .

Have your friends over and watch them struggle hilariously as they try to find the bomb in some guy's pants! xDTo think that TWO guys made this game is staggering. My hat off to them for their hard work and dedication in making a dream come true."
76561197968761535,Recommended,592030,33837459,Posted: 27 July,all,AnD4D,"While I do think it's a game worthy of being recommended, I do feel there's a massive ""BUT"" here...In this game you need to be patient, and need to be happy with very repetitive gameplay and trial and error.Some levels appear to have quite a few ways of solving them, while others only seem to have 1. Some levels also appear to have randomisation implemented, so where you feel as though you'd like to learn how the level develops and the order which things need to be done, on occasion you simply don't have a choice. Enemies will spawn in different locations each play through, so if you don't keep your head on a constant swivel, you will lose.I also experienced what I consider a bug, in which I caught a bullet just before it hit someone I was meant to save, but they still died. Seriously, I had it in my hand, but they still died. I also failed a mission because someone I was trying to protect tripped over a wooden board... ducking a knife that was heading for him. Found that a bit odd.The graphics are cute and simplistic, and the physics appear to be pretty fun.I honestly can't recall any music being played, so if it was, it was instantly forgetable, but the majority of the sound effects were pretty cool. The only problem, I had, was the main robot that talked to you throughout the game. For some reason, the developers felt having Microsoft Sam speak to you in an obvious synthesised voice was acceptable. For me, it just lowered the level of polish of the game. It gave the only speaker in the game ZERO personality. Sure, they're a robot, the voice is synthesised, but it had no character what so ever. I hope they actually pay the small amount of money it'd cost to get someone to redo that voice, but it made the game feel cheap. The robot looks like a robot, make him sound like a robot.Catching bullets and reuniting them with their sender is a lot of fun, and catching a rocket and sending that back was just amazing! I actually steadied my stance and braced myself the first time that happened.When I came up against my first enemy, I simply took his gun away from him and moved over to his friend. After realising I couldn't fire the gun, I simply threw it at his head, knocking him over. I noted a grenade at his hip and plucked that from him before his body hit the floor. I glanced over my shoulder to the guy I took the gun from to see that he had now pulled out a knife. While impressed with that, I tossed the grenade his way. Killed us both, but was still pretty cool.HOWEVER, while I do think this game has something to lend the gaming community, and is therefore recommended, it's simply not a game for me.So, if you don't like trial and error, and watching and hearing the same things again and again and again, I'd skip this one."
,Not Recommended,592030,33954260,Posted: 1 August,all,Gr8pboy,This game is far too short to charge $18.Most of the levels are really straighforward and require no problem solving or quick reactions like they do on the better levels.
,Not Recommended,592030,34176381,Posted: 11 August,all,Skeeveo - konitchiwa,"The entire game, plus it's bonus levels can be beaten in less then an hour. Don't bother. No replayability - many, if not all levels only have 1 real solution."
76561198112189287,Not Recommended,592030,33894973,Posted: 29 July,all,GloryToArstotzka,"A very bland game. I had high hopes this would be as entertaining or intriguing as GORN or SUPERHOT VR, but instead it turned out to be shallow as hell. You cannot throw a lot of objects, there is no music, and it does not have variety at all. Overall, it didn't hook me at the beginning, and playing through just a little bit did not even catch my attention.P.S. Don't mix politics with games, unless it's something like Democracy 3."
,Not Recommended,592030,33993275,Posted: 3 August,all,InDifferent,"I'll start with the positives for this game, it's polished and has a bright and colorful look that immediately reminded me of Job Simulator. Some of the scenarios in the game are creative and I enjoyed reading the flavor text for each one. The premise behind the game is fresh and unique and that was the primary factor for me purchasing it, but unfortunately the game did not hold up to my initial expectation.While the levels themselves are colorful and bright, actually playing them was boring. One major failing of the game is the sound design. As others have stated, there isn't any music when playing the puzzles which causes the game to lose all the charm it has in the trailer. The lack of music means that majority of the game is you listening to the occasional gunshot or smack from you throwing something at an enemy. A majority of the puzzles were incredibly simple and all of them have pretty much only one way to solve them, which meant that I knew exactly what I needed to do when I started and just had to go through to motions to execute. The game is short, but in these early days of VR I'm willing to have short games if they are a polished and entertaining experience (e.g. I paid the $30 for Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality and do not regret that purchase at all).I feel what would really help this game would be to expand the ways that you could prevent someone from dying. For example, the level where you are preventing an old man from getting run over could theoretically be solved by popping the tires of the truck causing it to veer off the road, or possibly building a ramp for the truck to jump over the person you're trying to protect. You could even add achievements for each possible way to solve the level to encourage experimentation when trying to solve.Overall, I'd say keep this game on your radar if you're interested but wait to see if the developers update and add more content before buying."
,Not Recommended,592030,34009603,Posted: 3 August,all,Creepy Ostrich,"Way way way way way way excetera too short.Refunding because I have limited funds and want to spend them on something that doesn't take 20 minutes to complete (I replayed all the missions again and failed on purpose. Really is a shame because the actual gameplay is so incredibly cool but not enough replayability to be worth the money.Also the lack of music makes the play seem kinda lboring so do what I did and play the song that Quicksilver listens to when running in Days of Future Past.In short: love the gameplay, hate the package."
,Recommended,592030,33894156,Posted: 29 July,all,CorwiN,"Quick facts:No janky physics or weird bugs.Appealing voxel-style characters.Fantastic bullet-time gameplay.I turned a river of rats into a river of blood.Might be a bit short, but a lot of VR games are.Check out our gameplay video here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIZU3qH0C4MLove what I've played so far. I stripped people. I saved people. I stabbed people. I grabbed bullets out of the air and turned them around at the people who shot them.I'm not really sure how long the game is, but this is one of the most polished and well-designed VR games I've played in awhile. Would solidly recommend."
,Recommended,592030,33908701,Posted: 30 July,all,Louis Theroux,"One of the first VR titles that actually felt like a game for me, rather than just a glorafied tech demo. A great premise and a lot of enjoyability. The later levels even getting pretty hectic. I'd love to see some additions to the level or some extra challenge modes. Perhaps even a level editor if possible? Love it!"
,Recommended,592030,33843040,Posted: 27 July,all,Mr. Blue,"The game is fun. The concept of moving through the world as if everything had been slowed down is a great concept. The mechanics are interesting, and they make great use of the slow motion in several puzzles. Were the game released at a lower price, or with more content, I would highly recommend it.The main objective of the game is to find your client, and prevent their imminent demise while the world around you moves at 1/10th the speed it should. Your client could be in a war zone, being fired upon by enemy soldiers. One way you could save them would be to grab the enemy soldier's gun, and beat him over the head with it. You could also grab the fired shots mid flight, and redirect them into the enemy's face, killing him and thus saving your client.It took me 89 minutes to beat every level. Now, I only beat each level once, and using one solution. The levels are replayable, with a variety of ways in most cases that you can win each one. There doesn't seem to be enough variety in your choices though.The developers have expressed their intent of adding more content, and perhaps a sandbox mode / level editor in the future. As the game currently stands, it is fun, but it does seem to be a little lacking on content.I will recommend this game. I feel I need to reiterate that It is fun, and the devs have said they will be adding more content. Keep in mind though, that replayability seems to be a large focus of the levels, and will be where you get the majority of your playtime out of this game from."
,Recommended,592030,33842735,Posted: 27 July,all,o-super,Had a blast playing this game.You can finish the levels in many different ways and it's fun.Perfect to laugh with some friends around or to show VR to new people.
76561198107935355,Recommended,592030,33933999,Posted: 31 July,all,Ira The VR Enthusiast,This Game is So much fun! Please Make More levels!
,Recommended,592030,33910827,Posted: 30 July,all,LostTfamaze™,"Pretty short game, but it is an interesting concept and fun game.Pros:- General silliness (Stripping people, taking their guns straight out of their hands, etc.)- A few levels are actually somewhat difficult- Charming graphics despite being blocky- Good level design overall- Gory funCons:- Rather short for the price- Interaction with some objects is lacking (Can't shoot guns)- Objects are oriented exactly as you pick them up. If you pick them up sideways while your controller is straight up, you have to rotate the controller sideways to get the objects straight up.Overall: If you are looking for a polished, goofy, gory game then you have come to the right place. Sure it isn't super long, but screwing around on this is pretty fun overall. It also just released, so I do have hopes that more content will be added in the future.Suggestions:- Content creation. This is pretty much a necessity, and a good content creation area would make this game so much better.- Maybe add some really hectic levels where you start with weapons instead of having to find knives or catch bullets (Kinda like the grandpa bonus level, but with even more craziness.)- Just adding some more levels in general."

76561198089979881,Recommended,592030,33983088,Posted: 2 August,all,Waurgus,"I really love this game and will play just about any scenario you put in front of me.Slowing time down is absolutely one of my favorite abilities of VR, and this game uses the concept to great affect, allowing for multiple solutions, so playing the same mission can be a new experience, or a further perfection of your plan.And it isn't just a one-note gimmick, the creators are clever in the mission design and have a great sense of humor.Thank you for creating this game, I can't wait to see what you guys do next."

76561198319594732,Recommended,592030,33871114,Posted: 28 July,all,B_Skizzle,I really like the slow-motion mechanics combined with the fact that each case is an interesting problem solver.  Plus it's hilarious!  I recommend this to those who are looking to think and have a good laugh in VR. It’s definitely a fresh experience for me.
,Recommended,592030,33873951,Posted: 28 July,all,Toupee,"It's fun, but also pretty straightforward. After completing the missions, I really can't think of any way to go back to do them differently. I think this game would benefit a lot if the level designs and hazards were randomized each time you played — it feels like it needs some kind of way to add value to individual play sessions. I can't really see myself picking it back up, but I'm curious as to how it might go over for VR parties.Don't know if this is kosher to link to but I made a video review here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1jWS-BtNAI"
,Recommended,592030,33885029,Posted: 29 July,all,flynn2k,"Ok, just got done with it today. I like the gameplay and concept. I will say that the game feels short for the $20 and I would hope some more levels would come out at sometime."

It's funny, light hearted, and best of all, the tasks of each mission vary a great deal, which to me, is what VR is all about, providing new (and in this case, obscure!) experiences. Some missions are railroaded but some give you many ways to creatively complete them.Basically, it's a puzzle game with violence"

76561198166825506,Recommended,592030,34800927,Posted: 7 September,all,killshot308,"It is a great game, if you have the money lying around then DEFINATELY buy this game. My only comlaint is I would like to see A LOT more levels. I would like more fighting levels and not as much puzzle levels, because once you figure out the puzzles, it has no replay value. The slow mo fighting in this game is a lot of fun and makes you feel really cool."
