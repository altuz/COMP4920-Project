76561198045151993,Recommended,592260,32063149,Posted: 30 May,all,Darth_LucSky,"Do not underestimate this software: For its price, you can do most of the stuff of other (in my opinion) overpriced mapping software. What makes this software unique in my opinion is the Steam Workshop: You can import (and export) a multitude of libraries, each containing a lot of essential stuff for mapping, thanks to the effort of dedicated users. This is kind of the weakness of the software, too; at its ""vanilla"" state, it does not offer much. Even so, it has very useful tools to create maps, giving a sort of Photoshop vibe to all of it (layers and effects). So far, this has been the most easy-to-use and efficient mapping tool I have encountered, not to mention the most inexpensive one. Still, there are some things missing that I REALLY would love to be added (see below).Let's make a quick summary:PROS:-Very unexpensive, compared to other mapping tools-Open to modding (additional content, Steam Workshop)-Easy to use-Easy import and export of maps (to PDF, PNG extensions, the import accepts a lot of formats)CONS:-The unmodded program lacks content-Could use some more sofisticated effects-It lacks some tools (undo button, tint bucket to fill an an area)-Could use better features to make large area maps, such as atlases (current tools are very supperficial)FINAL VERDICT:Dungeon Painter Studio is the choice to go if you are looking for an easy to use and cheap software to make dungeon maps (it is also good to make overland maps, but not ideal). If you want to do more sofisticated and detalied stuff, envolving pretty effects, I recommend you try another software.TO THE DEV:Dev, I'd love to have a way of apllying a brightness effect to my floors, it's a pain in the *** to do that manually (by creating multiple layers with different colors varying in brightness). I miss a way of apllying lighntning effects to my floors and making more beautiful scenarios :(All in all, keep up the good work and thank you for this amazing software!"

,Recommended,592260,30685137,Posted: 23 March,all,Haratu,"This is the easiest map editor I have come across. I found i could make maps on the fly and it took me mere minutes to work out how to use the basics. After a few hours I had grasped all the ins and outs of the software. The learning curve is very smooth and very soon even cmplex maps can be constructed easily.Maps are pretty even with default textures, making it an excellent tool for the amateur map maker like myself. I highly recommend it to those who lacks the patience, skill or knowledge of more complex mapping methods.It has a nice range of built in textures, however it can easily adapt to custom textures with only a few file additions."

Therefore, I recommend it.  Hopefully, supporting the prodcut will encourage further development."

You can layer textures with bevel and drop shadow to create walls and terrain contours (for hills etc), you can add/subtract polygons to create cavern cutouts out of your mountainside or to create secret rooms, you can import your own textures from the internet (and you can resize the textures to deal with any resolution issues), you can import PNG/JPG files (like old maps) as ""templates,"" resize them to fit your grid, and then trace them to add details or change things, you can import objects from dundjinni or roll20 marketplace or wherever you get them and place them with transparency intact.  It's just all-around one of the best mapping softwares I've found.  I used to use Campaign Cartographer 3 but this UI is just so much more intuitive, and the ability to seamlessly import textures while the program is running is just so amazing that it's become necessary.  10/10 must buy for any dungeon mapping."
76561198059675635,Recommended,592260,30858913,Posted: 31 March,all,keraejis,"I have been using the web version of Dungeon Painter and mixing that with modifications in a paint program has been helping my PnP games a lot. I thought it only fair that I purchase the Studio version as a way to support and possibly donate for how much I've used that program.I haven't had much of a chance to use it yet as I've just bought it but at first glance I can add a bit.Pros:1. The textures are much higher quality than the web version.2. The interface is much more streamlined and intuitive.3. As many has said, I've found this to be one of the easiest programs to create an encounter map, either for DM, player or even battlemap use.4. Many needed features not found in most other programs are found in this one.Cons:1. I'm sure this will change but there are a low number of textures. The web version has many, many more but I'm guessing that is because that one is free (freeware textures) and many textures can not be used in a commercial product. With funding and the community, I'm very much looking forward to the updates.2. Re-sizing is a little offputting. When I re-size a texture, instead of enlarging the actual texture, it tiles the fixed size of the texture to fill the enlarged space. Making an option for both of these ways of enlarging a texture would be great. If there is one, I did no see it.One thing I noticed different than the web version that would be better imho, was... on the web version when I'm laying down a texture and I don't have enough room, I can use the mousewheel to scroll the page down to continue laying down the texture. On this Studio version, when I run out of room and try to scroll down to show more screen to lay down more texture, it scrolls through the other textures in the texture menu, effectively changing my texture. To scroll down I have to click the sidebar and pull it down. This doesn't mess up laying down the texture but if I'm counting an odd number of spaces or not using the Snap To Grid option, it can become a problem."

But the object selection feels a bit limited, and importing custom art is more of a pain than it needs to be. A feature that's missing that's 100% needed is integration with the steam workshop to fix both of these problems easily.Still, it's head and shoulders above it's competition (Which really says something about the state of map-making software).

,Recommended,592260,30212795,Posted: 26 February,all,Delioth,"Super solid map maker. It has multiple themes that come together nicely. It supports straight line draws, multi-line draws, and arbitrary arcs for lines and walls. Rectangles, elipses, brushes, and arbitrary polygons for terrain.  Grid-locked or not locked placement of everything (Walls, terrain, lines, objects, text). % transparency on anything, customizable overlays/effects that can apply to any singular object or a group of objects as a whole. Oh, you can group objects arbitrarily, and nest those groupings- and you can still manipulate individual objects within by navigating into the group to select. It's incredible how much you can do and how efficient it is to do it.One gripe is that undos or deletes sometimes zeroes out the transparencies of some elements; but I expect that'll be fixed, since this is a really good beta. EDIT: The devs are on-point, and this gripe was fixed within 12 hours of posting the review."
,Not Recommended,592260,34726038,Posted: 3 September,all,KeviniveK,"In its current state, the program works well for very small maps with few items. If you plan on creating a larger and/or detailed map with many items and layers, glitches - disappearing tiles, items that can't be placed, lag, etc - begin to appear, and they stick around.The features of DPS are great, but they don't mean anything if prolonged use of the tool spawns bugs that defeat their purpose.If the devs can put some very strong effort into squashing bugs, I'll start using this again."

It was easy to use and I could gen up a map for Roll20 in a jiffy (once I got used to the mechanics). I love DPS and everything that Pyromancer has added and very excited that I can look forward to many updates in the future. In my book, this is a must for game masters looking to create their own content.I still have a lot to learn, but here are my additional thoughts after 12 hours and five detailed maps.Some of my favorite features:- The creator is very responsive to inquiries- The export options which include  a Roll20 image export- The art is varied and high quality, plus interchangable- Easy to use, change and edit.- I haven't used it yet, but like the idea of Workshop content.Some areas for improvement:- The options for Objects is great, but still a bit limited. For example, there are no images of a statue, secret door, pits, etc. I get around this  by using the old school D&D symbols, which are included.- I can't figure out how to change the scale of the art tiles. You can easily change the scale of objects, which is awesome, but sometimes the terrain looks out of scale when making large maps.- Sometimes it is hard to find layers. It would be nice if I could doubleclick on a layer and it would snap right to it in the layer list.Anyway, love this product and can't wait to see what else Pyromancer has in store for us!"
76561198033602993,Recommended,592260,35038704,Posted: 17 September,all,Wash {♣},"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWWell I'm a bit more than 10 days of use time into this so I'm not exactly unbiased.  This software is very buggy, let's just start with that.  The more things you put into the map, the more tools start not working properly, and at times textures or effect filters just stop showing up.  I haven't lost anything important like that, and it will restore pretty close to before it crashes, but that is something you need to know.  A few of the controls are a bit hard to get used to such as scroll wheel sometimes not zooming out but flipping through object textures or grouping, but really I'd expect some amount of learning curve with any mapmaking program worthwhile.I get putting a negative review to anything with this many bugs, but despite all that it's still the most powerful mapmaking tool I have.  I would rather save frequently and use this by such a wide margin and for one very simple reason - availibility of mapping packs.  There's a few megapacks that round this out nicely, and just creating my own packs is simple.  I've gone through 2 or 3 ""free"" tools that have some complicated packmaking process and that killed them for me.  This one is just making a couple folders and dumping in stuff.  No size restrictions, no fancy list files, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hoops.  There's a few other things in its favor like the effects filter for changing tint, putting on shadows, bevels, and probably other stuff I havent explored.  That's nice for creatively repurposing assets.  The texture rotation, x and y offset, and zoom are pretty nice as well, along with decent size and rotation for objects.  There's probably more I just haven't needed to dig into yet.  There hasn't yet been a thing I wanted to map out and not had a way to do it.If you're a DM who's very picky about your maps, I'd say this is worth it in its current state.  You'll have to work around some frustrations, but I have not yet found a mapmaking tool that isn't drowning in frustrations.  Pyro, I like where this is going.  Please don't stop with the fixes.  Expand and polish this right and you could have the defining mapmaking tool."
76561197974965690,Recommended,592260,33720601,Posted: 22 July,all,Unhelpful Bot,"So when I laid down $15 for this software I kind of expected a typical budget tool that would be fine making the very specific types of maps you see in the video on Steam, but wouldn't be useful for much else.  Well...I was wrong.  I've just been fiddling with this tool for a day, but I must say, I'm ridiculously impressed.First, the drawing interface of the tool itself is both powerful and user friendly.  It provides some really simple things like drawing floors as squares on a grid, but it also provides more advanced functionality like drawing floors with n-sides polygons, and a terrain brush that is more like a paintbrush.  It has a special wall tool that makes it really simple to put walls down as well.Second, this tool heavily utilizes layers, which is great.  It gives you the power to put as many objects on top of something as you want, and in whatever order of occlusion you want.  It also allows you to add effects like shadows and such to layers, it even allows you to create your own custom effects!  Finally, it had some nice functionality with layer grouping so that you can easily group a bunch of layers and then do things like mass replace the floor texture with something else.Third, and here's where it starts to get really good, is the community content.  Sooo when I checked out the workshop, I thought I would see maybe a few intrepid users that made like 3 or 4 floor tiles or something.  Nope...there are GIGS of community content on there.  Basically, people used to post huge collections of dungeon mapping content on sharing sites, and some users have taken this content and provided it on the workshop.  I don't think I'll ever see every image I downloaded yet alone use all of them lol.Also, it allows you to use the Random Dungeon Generator from the donjon website and import that dungeon right into DPS for editing!  This is a pretty awesome feature, especially since you can easily mass select all the floors and just replace them with whatever texture you want.Fourth, and I think this is the best point, is the dev Pyromancer.  While I was playing around with this tool, at several points I wouldn't be able to find some feature I thought the tool should have so I would google it.  In most occasions I would find a thread where some user asks for a feature, and a few posts down Pyromancer says that he added it.  This is pretty amazing customer support.  Pyromancer seems really dedicated to making this app a winner, and I think he's on the right track.So finally, the downsides of the product.  I've noticed that it freezes sometimes, which is annoying.  Hopefully these crashes will get worked out soon.  Also, you can't resize the ""panes"" in the DPS window.  Like, you can't make the tile/object selection window larger.  This makes it a little difficult to pick a tile when you have one of those massive packs from the workshop.  Hopefully this will get added later.In conclusion, I highly recommend this tool.  For $15, it offers amazing functionality, and I don't see how it can be beat for the price."
,Not Recommended,592260,34513940,Posted: 26 August,all,FriendArtiste,"This tool is well on its way to being a real boon for game masters and wordbuilders everywhere, however if you're hoping to using this tool right away, I'd reccommend holding off, as it is nowhere near complete and in its current state it is frankly frustrating to use.  Various functionality issues currently plague its early release, including:* Objects randomly disappearing from the list, despite still being visible on the grid* completely nonsensical object placement (sometimes objects, walls, and floors appear at the top of the layers list, sometimes at the bottom, sometimes in the middle with no regularity).While designing a simple map, I had to quit and start over three times because the layers list kept glitching out.  On the fourth time, I finally started to make some progress, but that was hindered when objects began being placed below the floor on the visibility list, but because every. single. click. creates a new layer, I was unable to determine which of my objects or floors I needed to adjust to do this properly.  This is partially my own fault, as I should have been labeling and categorizing things as I went, but really, all I needed this tool to do was help me sketch up a dungeon I had already created and I honestly feel like I'll have it done quicker if I just re-sketch it on graph paper at this point.I fully expect that when this product leaves early access, it will be one of the best tools out there, and I look forward to using it in its completed state, and will revise my review accordingly, but I think that it is only fair that I'm honest in reccommending not to use this software during this early access."

Having said that, I'd give it 4-out-of-5 stars.The only other map-making software I own is Campaign Cartographer 3 (CC3+).  Compared to that,  DPS is far, far,  better suited to making quick battle maps, and about 1000 times less complex to use.    The ease of use for making quality battle maps is the best I've seen in any app or on-line solution to date.  And the export function is super-simple to use to create correctly-scaled maps you can directly upload toroll20.net.As a first release, I'm very impressed with the overall quality and stability of the program as well as the quality and amount of art work that is included with the package, especially for this low price-point (CC3+, while it is a true CAD program, is $40 for just the basic dungeon designer module).Other than a few UI suggestions (such as being able to zoom in/out with CTRL+mousewheel, or having the [Esc] key exit any mode you're in) I have no complaints on the program operation.  As for the included art work, it is very nice and there is a fair amount of it.  I do wish there were a few more ""standard"" interior objects included (e.g. fireplaces, interior stairways, more house-type furniture, etc.)Overall, this program is well-worth the price and very well suited for making role-playing battle maps that don't look like something your two-year-old drew."

I was familiar with Pyromancers website before finding this program but never really used it.What a little gem!Whilst this does not have all the options of a more complete map making program, it also has much less of a learning curve. It is quick a simple to do a great looking map (my first attempt took me about an hour, with no knowledge on how to use the program).You can upload your own objects and textures and the inclusion of Steam Workshop support is a godsend if you are using this in a non-professional capacity. There are mods which add literally THOUSANDS of new objects/textures to the program (though the user should be careful to ensure they have the correct license if intending to use for professional purposes).When saving or exporting maps options are provided for the main VTT software options in the market or as a simple graphic file if you prefer.Whilst still in early access I recommend this program.(Also recommended by me via theHeadache & Migraine Gaming Group)"

It is kinda annoying having to use a mouse for everything.There are 80 -100 keys on our keyboards, let us use them.Lacking in premade textures. You shouldnt leave it upto the community to fill out your texture content. I hope the final release has double the objects, walls, and ground textures.Lacking in a proper layers function. Why is every object, ground, and wall its own layer? Thats really not the point of a layer function, but rather to have things on the bottom, middle and top, and as many itterations as a designer wants there within, so it appears properly in the final product.I found my final product lacking certain objects, because they were hidden under flooring tiles, I decided to place in half way, and it took me a while to figure out exactly which flooring tiles were causing the issue.The simple fix, let us have proper layers.Lacking in a tutorial, or help menu.Yes I know there is the internet for answers, but what if I am on my laptop with no immediate access, and I 'need' a solution to a propblem.What it has, that is amazing?The ability to group objects, Walls, and Ground into their own groups.Does this properly replace the idea of being able to make layers? some people would say yes, I would say no.The ability to import from DonjonThe ability to add text easily.The ability to import custom art, and mods.Export to PDF!Would I recommend it to anyone I know, who likes to make maps, and the like.

,Recommended,592260,30931824,Posted: 3 April,all,The God Ghetto Holy,"SummaryGreat price for a decent tool!OverviewI accidentally stumbled upon this tool looking through Steam sections and had no idea this software was being made. Here it was for a meager 14.99$ and I thought to myself ""That's not too expensive to try out.""While it is still Early Access, it offers quite a bit of functionality that is point and click simple to use. I come from creating maps in Photoshop using a tablet, or in the ever expensive Pro Fantasy Campaign Cartographer and this tool was a refreshing change in a lot of ways.Firstly how easy layers and objects are to manage was wonderful. There is also a lot of objects and textures to start with which are actually very well drawn for creating the look and feel of dungeons. A feature I -truly- enjoy about it is when exporting to an image you pick the actual pixel per squares you want to export the image as. If anyone has used something like CC3 you know how annoying it can get to truly be exact with that option for importing into your virtual table top, that is not a problem in this tool.It really gives you that speed for quickly putting a dungeon together that you might need on short notice and for me that is a giant plus because I play RPGs quite often and have to stay ahead of the content my players are getting through week to week in multiple games.ProblemsOne major problem that made my face wrinkle was the terrain brush too. While this tool is a must have for smooth blending of terrain, the tool itself is not smooth with it's drawing. The drawing lags heavily behind the mouse and doesn't use pathing for the drawing. This means if you move your mouse faster than a few pixels per second you create dotted lines instead of a constant stream like you'd expect. It also is click on and click off instead of click and hold with release. Maybe this was intentional and preferred for some people but I would like to see that as a toggled option.

This version, however, is a lot better and offers more refined tools for moving objects and making tweaks to the map. It also includes tons of beautiful assets to use as well as workshop support for even more stuff available for mapmaking. It seems development is still underway fairly steadily, so this program is improving during early access. There are already tons of tools and assets, so even in its current state, this program is better than most anything that is free out there.The option to either export to a PNG compliant with popular VTT sizes is awesome as well as exporting to PDF's and choosing different scaling for the grid for printing.Overall this is an awesome tool that is both easy to pick up and powerful enought to get what you want out of it with smaller tweaks and precision placement.

Buy.In not so short...This is a fantastic piece of software with an excellent price point (especially compared to other, similar tile based mapping programs of which I've seen go as high as over $100 for a license.) It is still in early access, thus, it does lack some functionality I would like to see in the future (such as a brushed eraser function, or layer organization.) However, any missing tools does not detract from your ability to make fully fleshed out maps for any grid based rpg encounters you are looking to run. I have encountered some odd bugs involving dissapearing objects and strange layer placement, but most of these issues can be resolved in seconds by consulting the list of layers.I do enjoy making my own maps by hand, but this program saves me a lot of time. I balance it by making things like world maps by hand and using DP to make quick encounters and dungeons. This balance has worked well for me as I do think that DP is less useful for making atlases.I'd also like to make a quick note that the company was very forthright with their EULA. Each section is spelled out in layman's terms, so that comprehension is quick and straightforward. They also allow any content conceivable to be imported and exported from the program.Finally, and equally importantly, this product has fantastic (though small) community that has posted a number of high quality tile packs to be used by any user for free.Highly Reccomended."

The layout is not at all intuitive, the keyboard shortcuts are very poorly thought out (ctrl+A to use the line tool? Esc to use the move tool? Really?), the UI elements aren't scaleable, the menus are about as barebones as possible (the Save function is actually Save As, there's no File/Edit menus). The way the layers work is weird too - they're not at all like layers in Photoshop/GIMP/etc.; rather, every single object you place is a separate ""layer"" that you can then organize in folders (again, with an unintuitive process). It's also been crashing periodically, but it seems to make backups often enough that I've never actually lost anything, so points for the solid failsafe!Those gripes aside, I'm still willing to recommend this software overall; if you don't mind working around some weirdness, the results you end up with can be excellent, and the tilesets in the Workshop are well worth your time. Even the stock tilesets have a good breadth of options and are internally consistent, artistically speaking, so if that's your aesthetic, you're good to go. If they make the UI more intuitive and easy to use (if the devs are reading this: why not model it after existing software, like Photoshop?

Since I've atm just ""charged"" through the software I can't say much more for now. As others have mentioned, program needs more textures/objects. Great thing is that you can import your own stuff, but I hope it will be made easier in terms of categorizing and sorting things. For me this part is a bit messy. Also a help/tutorial would also be a nice add on imo. All in all a powerfull tool which I hope will only get better and better."

I love this program."
,Recommended,592260,30255598,Posted: 28 February,all,zergstarmaster,"This is a nice tool for creating small to medium sized maps. It currently lacks some required features for software of this nature, and could use quite a few more luxury features. However, what features are indeed already included feel very well polished. It feels much more like a graphic design software designed for RPG tabletop games rather than a computer aided design software specific for RPG’s. With more development, DPS could become an incredibly powerful and user friendly RPG design platform.Pros:-Allows for incredibly high quality of detail-Has been designed to be compatible with other resources-Allows for easy use of custom drawings and sprites-User interface is easy to navigateCons:-Missing some critical CAD functionality-Currently has relatively small included drawings and sprites-numerus signs of ‘early access’ bugs, with a couple of major bugsMy biggest issue with DPS is its lack of CAD functionality. There NEEDS to be keyboard integration. There need to be hotkeys for selecting every single tab, tool, function, anything you could possibly want to click, and they should be remappable. Right now, there is no use of the keyboard in this software, and it desperately needs it.The next most important CAD tool DPS needs is an easy way to move the screen. When building large maps, it is beyond tedious to use the mouse to click and drag the scroll bars on the side and bottom of the screen to move around, then drag the zoom slider to the desired zoom, then go back to the scroll bars because the change in zoom moved the frame. You need be able to hold down middle mouse button and move the mouse to pan, and scroll wheel to zoom, or something of this fashion.The Wall tool also need some CAD help. There are only a dismal two ways to create walls. A line, or a 3-point arc (point, point, tangent). There isn’t even a rotate tool! This makes it very difficult to make complex structures. If you want to line up an arc with a premade structure, or mirror another arc, unless you’re willing to make a ton of annoying temporary guide lines, you can’t.The grid tool can be visually toggled between square and hexagon, but hex is not supported in any way. You cannot snap to the hexagons, nor do the textures create hexagons. Snapping to the square grid can only be toggled between grid corners, or by snapping to .1 of a square (1.1, 1.2…1.9, 2.0). It does not allow for complete free hand control.Upon getting DPS, I endeavored on creating a giant fortress for my campaign. One thing I was immediately disappointed about this software was the blank area available was limited. Normally, the provided space would be more than adequate, but my design was massive, and would not fit the space. I changed my design to fit the work space, and set off. For the next 5 hours, I clicked like a mad man. My left hand was used more for supporting my head than for building. I’m a perfectionist, if my walls are the wrong texture, if my arcs are slightly off, if the terrain spills over to the other side of the wall, I have to fix it. But due to the lack of CAD functionality, walls randomly deciding to change textures, the polygon tool for ground breaking so enter doesn’t complete the shape, and other small issues, after 5 hours of clicking, I’d only completed maybe 5% of my vision for this fortress. Yes, I am very happy with what I have, and it looks fantastic, it’s just tedious.A major bug/feature that needs fixing the exporting. After 5 hours, I wanted to test out the exporting and see if there were any issues. I found out that yes, yes there are. First, I tried to export to PDF. After it did all of the encoding, it ended on a permeant loading screen. I went back and played with the very vague export settings, and finally one of them worked after a LONG wait at the loading screen after the encoding. I doubt my computer was the cause of the slowness, as I have a 6700k and a GTX 1070. I then tried the PNG exporter, and after the encoding, it instantly crashed and a Windows box popped up giving me error code 0x800F0900 “Windows couldn't complete the requested changes.”This same error repeated no matter what settings I chose.Closing, this is a really cool piece of software. I can see so much potential for it. I have given these criticisms because I want to help make it better, so it can live up to that potential. If I didn’t think it had this protentional, I would have given a 3 sentence review and gotten a refund, then searched for a different way to create my ideas."

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this PRODUCT!Only ONE CAVEAT during Early/Alpha Development: The program uses ADOBE AIR, and so, it's interface is VERY CLUNKY and has a TON of flaws, but if you can manage to somehow work your way around it, and figure out how to get your work done DESPITE the awkwardness of the interface (there are many bugs in it still) then it is still a GREAT product and i have been using it to draw (paint) amazing things for my dungeon creations and i am VERY HAPPY that this is still getting actively updated (just yesterday actually - what a nice surprise!). I have painted so many amazing things with this program! IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY -- ESPECIALLY with the low price of how it is set during Early Access!They should see what i am making with it!(Using a combo of AUTOCAD (exporting DWG to EPS). Then importing as layers toPAINT.NETfrom EPS format, for walls styles and textures.... And then i save as PNG, which i then import as Template to DPS and then do all my finishing touch ups and final object placement art (i do not like how this product draws walls - there is NO REAL PRECISION for CIRCULAR rooms or CURVES or POLYGONS or anything like that -- i need REAL PRECISE CAD for that... but  for everything else, this product is WONDERFUL!!!!)But PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE JUST FIX the interface. That is the ONLY HORRIBLE part of this program."

Some QoL changes I hope for in the future is that it would stop randomly placing layers. I would have the very first/top layer selected and when I put down an item or a wall it would appear somewhere in the middle of a sea of 100+ layers.Another thing I would hope to be added is a delete function.When I press the undo shortcut it jumps back a few steps instead of a single one. Adding the possibilty for deleting, too, would help with just putting down say a square and deciding ""oh, I wanna put a door here"". Instead of having to redo the entire thing just deleting the small bit would make it fantastic.Overall though, I am positively loving it!"
,Recommended,592260,34993679,Posted: 16 September,all,dema,"Currently has a relatively flexible library of assets and tiles that are useful for general dungeon design. Could use a little more variety, but I'm assuming that more will come since this is still in early access. That being said, DPS does support custom artwork, so it's possible to just grab a token off of google if need be.What really shines about DPS isn't the assets, but rather the series of tools used to place and manipulate various tiles. As someone who typically stays away from grid systems for my tabletop gaming, I've found the placement, rotation, and layering tools to be very succinct and easy to pick up. The lighting and effects tools are still very much a work in progress, though I'm frankly unsure how things like lighting dynamics would be integrated effectively in a system that exports battlemaps to image files.It certainly still has areas that need development, but Dungeon Painter Studio is still a highly-accessible dungeon mapping system with lots of promsie."
