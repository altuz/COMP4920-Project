Come on, judge the game or wait a little longer before giving a review.The game is excellent, it's fluid, agile, realistic. The difficulty is great, smart, it adapts mid game depending on how you play. I was a FIFA player since 2010 (before I always played PES). Last year I bought the PC version of PES 2017 and I loved the gameplay, even though the graphics were a lesser version of the PS4... But now, we received the same product and they gave us the best football experience so far.So please, wait a little longer before giving a bad review to say ""online won't work""...""it's not a finished product""... ""Refunded, no online"".. Please, refund and go play FIFA, get your♥♥♥♥♥ripped off with microtransactions and scripted gameplay and don't come back!"

(Maybe we should be allowed to add our own music just like PES 2009).- There are no German leagues (Bundesliga).- Limited pool to choose from when it comes to boots customization."

I have 3 problems with the game though....1. Replays non stop. After everything. Makes it not as fluid as FIFA2. THE COMMENTARY IS HORRIFIC. I cannot believe how bad it is. They talk nonsense half the time and you can hear how its been recorded in different studios, probably reusing old material but it does not fit in at all. It is really very bad.3. Still a lack of team Licenses although this is a minor thing as I will mod the correct teams and kits in.Apart from that it is a very fun game and much better than this years fifa"

,Recommended,592580,34979785,Posted: 15 September,all,0Bennyman,"Incredible game, if you're looking for a proper football game then this is it. Servers are the best they have been, no lag at all in any game's I've played. They slipped up Day One and people were understandably a bit annoyed like I was but they got them sorted.The first PES game I have pre-ordered and played from Day One, the only other PES game I played properly was 2016 and 2017 but I gave Fifa a chance with the pre-order purchase and 2017 was the last straw so 2018 had to be PES's year and it defiintely is.[Gameplay]The game is fast paced and Fun, you have a lot of control of how your team plays by messing with the tactics and of course Advanced Tactics which allow for more indepth play. E.g. Hate your defence leaving you exposed on the counter? Pull your defensive line back or use Deep Defensive line or even just tell 2 of your defenders to always stay back. Hate your striker getting tired from tracking back? Make him stay up. There is so much you can do.[MyClub]I missed last year of any Clubs mode because I just got bored of Fifa's handicap and I got PES 2017 too late in the year that there was no point. 2018 Is great fun however, the servers are impeccable and I have had no issues (1 minute is the longest I've waited but no lag at all).The best thing about MyClub is the Rewards and Challenges that get you Club Coins and GP that you can spend on Ball's without having to waste money or unreal amounts of time. They also do bonus's every now and then with special Ball's and extra login bonus's. The fact it doesn't feel like the game is forcing you to grind is what makes MyClub perfect.[Master League]I haven't played much of it yet (Only while the servers were offline) but it's what you expect but with a very nice UI and added features like Interviews, Locker Room scenes for big matches, Pre-Season and better transfer system. A great improvement over 2017 and I can't wait to get into it.[Other Modes]I don't really enjoy the COM cup's, find them pointless but if you want to play in the Champions League or Europa League then feel free to play against the AI in them.[Licenses]There's already a save file you can import to change team's and leagues and I expect modders to add in the Scoreboards and Presentation if you want it in the near future.[Referee's]My biggest complaint of 2017 was the awful decisions by ref's (Probably caused by being a 360/PS3 port) but there's none of that anymore, they have all been spot on so far.[Graphics]Proper PC Version with proper PC settings. 10/10[Conclusion]The best Football game this year by far, fluid, fun and just does everything right. 10/10"

,Recommended,592580,35000849,Posted: 16 September,all,Bottle,"Huge improvements in gameplay and graphics compared to last year. Ultrawidescreen support is a nice touch. Although I believe Konami have missed the opportunity to make PES2018 the best PES by not improving the AI.-AI is pretty much unplayable on higher difficulties. All you can do is to crowd your penalty area and hope they messed up their crossing.-Every single team AI controls have the same play style no matter their formation, quick passing to striker > throughball to wing > cross.-AI very rarely misses their pass (backpass, throughball, long ball) no matter who the player is.-Barely any fouls or cards in match.-Crossing is OP.I still recommend this if you often play offline with friends or online. Still miles better than Fifa gameplay in my opinion."

You can really get into the flow again and dominate every situation, if you show awareness. It's  also not too frustrating when you are defeated by a player who just shows better tactics or who is just taking advantage of your mistakes. The downside of this is that PES newbies will have some hard times until they get the twists of the gameplay.

,Recommended,592580,34949187,Posted: 14 September,all,eternalblue10,"I'm new here, and It's my first review on Steam, so first of all.... Hello to everyone!!!I am reviewing this game because, I love sports games especialy football, and I was playing across the years lots of them: FIFA (from '94 to '03 , and from '11 to '17)PES (from 5 to 2017).Pro Evolution Soccer 2018 this year, from my first impression is the best in the series right now and the best football videogame to date in terms of gameplay. Of course there are other aspects that have been improved and some of them not, and I will mention below a list with pros. and cons. for a better understanding.In terms of gameplay, because that is the most important for me when I play a football videogame, there are improvements in every aspect: better sensitive passes, better touches and ball control, a more accurate dribble system with the new touch sistem, a nice slow pace that makes the game more realistic, keepers are slightly improved, more animations to add more consistency and authenticity to the game, better set pieces system, better AI in offence and defence, making the game more challenging in every way and better.PROS:+ Improved Graphics+ Improved Characters Model+ Improved Gameplay (Especialy The Touch System)+ More And Better Animations+ Better Ball And Player Interactions+ Better And Realistic Game Pace And Ball PhysicsCONS:- Same Lazy Commentary- Same Dated Menu Interface- No Major Changes In Presentation- Actually No Online (Connection Error)- Same Offline Game Modes Without Major Changes- Few LicencesKonami this year didn't offer to us a new product or one that changes everything, or one that can be light years better than the last one. But is a more polished and improved product in terms of gameplay, better graphics (new gen for pc), and a nice foundation to make a better game every year. They need to improve the above mentioned CONS, because I don't want to hear another year the same commentary, the same menu interface with slightly different color palet, and the same boring BAL and ML, because we need more diversity in offline/online game modes, without broken servers from the first day.In conclusion, PES 2018 is the best game in the series, and the best footbal sim game to date, having lots of fun right now!!!  This is the only thing that a videogame needs: to be a very good polished and entertaining product, that can offer joy and fun !  PES offers both !!!Enjoy"

After never being a fan of FIFA I was astounded that I had actually come to prefer a FIFA game.I played the demo of 2016 and thought finally Konami had got back to their football glory days, only to once I had played a few matches realised it was not to the standard that they had achieved in their golden days and soon stopped playing.Well fast forward almost two years later and I decide to take a punt on 2018 and I am not disappointed at all.I have played in an international cup and have found myself wanting to keep going back for more just like I did back in the day, Konami should be pleased with themselves as they truly have made a game that football fans and football loving gamers will be proud to have in their collection.I have seen some people have been ♥♥♥♥♥ing because online servers ain't working properly, got news for you it has just launched and it happens with most games. too many people trying to log in at the same time and probably more than expected so cut them some slack and actually play against the computer and enjoy a tremendous game and prepare yourselves to play online.slap it on hardest difficulty and get good!There is only one thing that I consider a con so far the stadiums do not seem to have much of an atmosphere from the fans, something i hope a future update will resolve.For me I give the game 9/10."

The game also runs very smooth, the only problem now I found is that the difficulty of each level decreased because of the new engine and AI, majorly on how the AI react to 2 1 pass, yet it is harder to just use fast player to penetrate the defence line. Pass is the key element which the very classic type of player who runs slow but pass good seems to be very very strong now, such as Motta and Veratti, I like it a lot"

Rigid, clunky, even with full manual controls, the game just plays itself. There is no such thing as manual passing, and the game is cobbled together from unalterable cutscenes (e.g,, each pass is a pre-recorded cutscene that you trigger by pushing the ""pass"" button). You win when the AI wants you to win, you lose when it wants you to lose.That's it. If you want to pay $60-70 more dollars for cut scenes, get this game.

Like the old ones.+ Comes along with great PC graphics and no XBOX 360 port anylonger.Neutral things:+- We all now the topic with the licensing. I don´t play PES because of the license. Yes it would be great, but... that´s not PES. Never was, never will be. Also if you use patches later on, you have the same experience. So yes. FIFA does this a lot better. If you would compare. And if you would rate, this would be a down-rating. Not for me though. There are other things.......+- The online mode is not working at all. And I could blame now, how bad this is. But I am fine. It´s launch day. But.....Negative things:- ........ no communication about, that Konami is taking a look into it at all since the start of PES and several pages of user complains without any reaction.- No keybinding within the game. You have to change controls outside of PES without PES running.- No transfer window updates at all. I mean, the transfer window closed 14 days ago for the majority of the teams in PES. No updates (Dembele still with BvB Dortmund & Neymar still with Barcelona). And there are more, minor transfers also. But for this I at least would expect an patch. As of now, this did not happen (14thSeptember 11PM).So. I could now downgrade this game. But, in the end, it is a great PES. But it has it negative aspects and you should keep a look for this things if they changed, when you think of buying PES2018."

I play Master League only on Top Player difficulty, I couldn't care less about multiplayer.This year's PES is reworked from scratch. For me all the improvements are visual, the gameplay is ok, but less fun than last year's PES.Wait for a sale before purchase.Pros:- Graphics are finaly fixed- The crowd and the stadiums look amazing- Player faces are a generation ahead of Fifa- The player and ball physics are very realisticCons:- DENUVO!!! Why would Konami use this crap when it gets craked in few days?- The game is slowed down, more relaistics, but also more boring- Scoring feels like a relief instead of a satisfying reward- Defending against the COM is impossible, tackling is useless and COM strikers always outmuscle your defenders- Transfers are refreshed and you have more options, but in general they are still joke and the finances don't make sence- Player stats still don't matter. Eden Hazard bullies inform Lukaku off the ball- We all know about the licenses but that's not a big deal, there are plenty of PES patches out there- Playing with Man U in Champions League vs Steaua Bucharest away resulted in 0-3 by 20min and rage quit"

And now I'm refunding it.The game on the pitch is beautiful, player movement, passes, the flow.... all good. But everything else is very poorly made:The menu, in general, is poor. The pictures on the cards are taken from live shots.(most of the players have their mouth open as if they're shouting), team management screen is from 1996, the commentary is laughable and so much more. There are so many things I don't like.I simply don't like PES18 as a whole. Maybe it's because I used to play FIFA.I don't want to give this game a positive rating, just because they upgraded some things from the earlier versions and made it passable as a PC game. I give this game a negative rating because as a whole, PES18 disappointed me. And Konami is just a shait company. I'll wait for FIFA18."

Yes, it's great that Konami has finally made the PC version on par with the consoles but from what I've seen so far, PES 2018 is a major disappointment. The gameplay is horrid at higher levels. The CPU NEVER misses a pass, there is NO Midfield gameplay like in previous versions and sometimes you feel helpless while the CPU is just predterminted to score. I HATE it!Already got a refund from Steam. Thank you Steam! Perhaps if Konami patches this garbage gameplay and produces what might look like some form of realism on the pitch I may repurchase. In the meanime I will look elsewhere-FIFA 2018 or Football Manager 2018. Shame on you Konami!"

Shooting is still terrible, passing is decent, but oh my good lord do not get me started with defense. THE DEFENDING IN THIS GAME IS SO BAD. If you try to jokcey an opponent and just poke a foot in, nothing happens, or in a rare occasion they do lose the ball, but regain it right away. Now on the other end if an opponent does this to you, you have to go through an animation of losing the ball befroe u can go get it, and 9/10 times you can't. Back to defending, if you try a slide tackle you will either miss the ball and player entirely, or you'll just murder the opponent and get a card.

Congrats to Konami on giving a football game that I can't put down. There are sooo many ways to this game I just can't decide what to do next!!! The online battles are great, the Master League is waaaaay better than last year and tactics is where it is at now. Think you are winning, well a few tweaks and perhaps a sub or two and your lead will vanish. FIFA 18 may get all the officialness, but lets be honest that game aint much of a challenge. That game takes the fun and delight out a football game. PES always feels like an accomplishment when you win and a proper battle on the pitch!!Here is to the future that Konami get an offical licence or are allowed to create an official Option File on the side. Bring on the future as this football journey that Konami are on is going to win all the Trophies as always!!!!!!!!!"

,Recommended,592580,34954161,Posted: 14 September,all,Scott,"There’s a bunch of (understandably) negative reviews due to people being annoyed at ongoing server issues; but judging the game from as objective a standpoint as possible:Pros:- AI is exceptional, especially with regards to player movement off the ball; teams feel completely different to control depending on tactics and play style- ‘Game feel’ is spot-on – slow-paced but extremely deliberate, every time I’ve screwed up, it’s felt like my fault, and every time I’ve done well, it’s felt rewarding. Control feels extremely granular, and a great balance between realism and arcade-y moments.- For the first time, there’s a football game on PC that doesn’t look like an absolute trash fire. This game looks great in 4K with a few tweaks.- Master League is as good as it’s been for years (my favourite since the glory days of PES 4) – the added ‘Challenge’ difficulty is a welcome addition if you want a bit more realism in negotiations and squad management.Cons:- The commentary is shockingly awful. Like. Ridiculously awful.- Aforementioned online issues for pretty much the entirety of the first day of release, while not affecting the objective, long-term quality of the game that Konami have created, is still not a good look.- The menu design, UI, copywriting and general usability outside of gameplay is terrible, bordering on unusable in places.All-in-all, it’s a ‘proper’ PES, on PC, which people have wanted for a long time. Release was plagued by ongoing online issues, which are certainly important to point out, but the quality of gameplay goes _some_ way to alleviate those frustrations. Just turn the commentary off."
