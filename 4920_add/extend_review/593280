,Recommended,593280,34116175,Posted: 8 August,all,DaKatGod,"From playing it for about 4-5 hours, I've found it to be fun. The combat is smooth and easy to learn and get used to; while allowing skill in movement, timing, and attacks to actually play a large role in single-target fights, large-group fights, and even bosses.The story, of which I've gotten a little under halfway done, is great (though I get heavily distracted with side quests, which are pawsome!). And you're actually encouraged to complete side quests in order to level-up for the main storyline.The dungeons are relatively short between the level 1-35 range that I've entered and conquered. The dungeons do respawn with enemies and coins/xp pickups, though the chests do not; helps with the level grinding!All-in-all, from a first look the game is great."

I am not that far into the game, but I wanted to write something so people know that this is a fun and well thought out game.I am playing with keyboard and mouse and will try my PS4 wireless controller as soon as it charges. The gameplay is really fun!  If using keyboard and mouse, you melee attack with the left mouse button and can use number keys or the right mouse button to cast spells. You use WASD to move and you can roll using the spacebar.  Combat is really fun and I have no complaints in this department!  It feels like playing Diablo 3 using the keyboard & mouse. Great writing with a purrrfectly catastic story and great one-liner's!  It has made me laugh out load a few times!PROS+Great melee combat with dodge & spell casting+Can completely heal and save your game is towns+There are different schools of magic to learn+Huge game world with lots of dungeons to explore+Very cute (oops) graphics and good animations+Wonderful sound track and great sounds (meow!)+Polished game with fun references to kittens & cats+Well written dialog and fun storyline+Character sprite reflects weapons, armor & items equipped+Enemies respawn so you can grind if you want or not+Dungeons can be replayed again for more loot & experience+Ability to bypass or run away from battles (so far, lol)+Kittens, Cats & Dragons!!! Oh My!!! lolCONS-Cannot name your character-Only one save slot that I can see-Cannot rebind keys on keyboard-Characters HATE to be called cute! LOLNone of these cons matter at all in this game.  Everything has been thought out very well and the game seems very polished!  Try the demo if you want before purchasing!  For a three person development team, I think they did a superb job!

Then Cat Quest is for you. It's smooth and simplistic gameplay combined with low consequences for failure made this a fun game to play while catching up on podcasts.If you're looking for story, you won't find it here. The end makes a half hearted attempt at causing feels, but mostly sticks to the breezy, no greater impact tone from the rest of the game. Your actions are less about helping the 'peasants' and more about getting that next guiding arrow to appear. Which was rewarding in it's own way.Misc.*While you can complete the main quest with minimal grinding, my current attempt to 100% the game involved me going to the two lv99 caves over and over again.*The randomized leveling of equipment solved some of the problems RPGs have of never using a piece of armor again after finding something better, but there was still a bunch of stuff I never used.*Only once did I change my build. The gameplay neither encourages or discourages trying different spells or proficiencies."

,Recommended,593280,34237685,Posted: 14 August,all,ziroonderel,"There's one word that comes to my mind when playing Cat Quest - and it's ""delight"". The game is just perfectly lovely, with smooth controls, charming graphics, decent loot progression (that is, nearly everything you find is interesting/upgrade to a piece of gear you have and so on) and simple, but quite sweet plot. It's not a hard game; the playstyle really reminds me of simpler Crashlands, with enemies telegraphing their attack areas and top-down, 2d graphics. Neither is it very long or complex - Path of Exile with its myriad builds or Dark Souls with its Dark-Souls-ness it ain't, but frankly, the older I get the less time I have for gaming - and the more delightful such reasonably-sized gems are. If you'd like an ARPg that's perfect for a ten minute stint during a break, or you want to escape for a while to a charming, kitten-filled world, don't hesitate to buy Cat Quest."

Not very far in but haven't had any performance issues or bugs, and while the combat isn't exactly difficult it's not entirely passive.

I would definitely buy ""Dog Quest"" if it's ever a thing!Variety of spells, armour and weapons was great.What I disliked:Those thunder sheep enemies!!!Not much to do once you've completed the main story and quests.

Not very grindy, but the side quests are somewhat repetitive. The game is relatively short. You can finish up the main quest in 4 hours. Main + side quests will take about 6 to 7 hours. 100% the game (clearing all dungeons and getting all equipments plus all magic) probably takes about 10 to 12 hours. Appropriate for its price. Highly recommended."

It is very polished, and while the graphics are relatively simple  they are very smooth. The game is relatively relaxed and easy with some challenging enemies and bosses, especially in the later levels.I guess the only con might be that its too short, but not really. Its around 10+ hours without really grinding. With that said, grinding is NOT required. You can if you like to buff your character and items like I do, but definitely not needed.I recommend checking this game out if you like relaxing adventure games similar to classic Zelda games.Edit: I forgot to mention the cat puns. There are SOOO many cat puns. You will want to claw your eyes out, there are so many!"
76561198071587525,Recommended,593280,34507973,Posted: 26 August,all,arios,"Surprisingly good and fluent (although a little simplistic) combat in a world where cats rule - this time literally.Puns are more hit than miss, stories make sense (usually) and are a blast to go through, very rarely outstaying their welcome. Main story is well thought out and you might want to have a second playthrough to see if you spot some stuff that will make more sense.Inventory system is a little different -  duplicates level your existing items. This works well for the most part, although if you get a streak of 1 item dups, it gets a little too powerful.From difficutly perspective, game is definitely on the easier side of things, at least if you use the dodge-roll correctly.World is consistently built, with characters that just fit in it - from the random villager to main characters they feel a part of it.Overall it was much better than I expected. While some of the time was just on pause (paws) screen, the ~8 hours of relaxing gameplay was definitely worth the price.Becomes even more ameowzing if you play it with someone else, as the humour spreads rapidly.Definite recommendation if you look for a relaxing, yet surprisingly fluent little game. Cats are a bonus ;)"

Combat is a really simple matter but does require some thought. It isn't just rushing in to attack the monster (usually), but rather has an element of strategy and learning the patterns of some enemies' attacks while attacking them. Dodging is your best friend throughout the game and takes some learning on when to dodge and where. Overall I've enjoyed this game quite a lot and even finished the story in two days since I've bought it.Great game, definitely would recommend."
,Recommended,593280,34119492,Posted: 9 August,all,[NCE] Mykero,"Wasn't sure if i would like it because everything is fought in an overworld type map (except dungeons) however, i was delightfully surprised how much fun this game is. I sat down to only play 15 minutes just to get a feel for it and before i knew it i had been playing for over an hour. The combat is fluent and not too challenging but also not too easy, you need to time all your attacks and dodges because some enemys can do stupid damage (although if you get hit its only on you because the game gives you more than enough time to get out of the way of an attack). If you get this game for just one reason, get it because of the hillariously cute cat theme of the game.

I highly recommend it to everyone and have been annoying all my friends (well, used to be my friends) by recommending it and throwing cat puns into my conversation (hence the ""used to be""). Open World Action RPG filled with Cats and Punnery.Pros:- Combat controls feel good. You have a melee attack, a dodge roll, and spells you can assign to the shoulder buttons.- The main story and the side quests are well written.- The game is adorably drawn.- Good humor and excessive cat puns (that last might be a negative :)- Rewarding loot and gear leveling system.Cons:- Limited # of enemy types.- Systems aren't very deep. The combat and gear and leveling are great, imo, but some might find it lacking. For example, you have only 3 stats: health, attack, magic. Another, you have only melee, no ranged weapons (though spells provide some range).- It eventually ends, and that will make you sad."

I will split my review in two parts a more simple pros and cons part and another were I talk about each pro and con in depth.-Pros--Nice Colorful Graphic Style-Fluent Animations-Somewhat Large Open World To Discover-Lots of Items To collect-Plenty Of Dungeons To Delve-Many Side Quests-Unique Cast of Monsters-Well Thought Out Villian-Weapon/Spell Progression-Cat Puns-Cons--World Seems Very Small End Game-Very Little Post Final Boss Content-Most items are useless-Very Strait Forward Story-Ending?Now I will explain every pro and con in a bit more depth-Pros--The Graphics in this game are very colorful and meld very well with the world. They seem to make every part of the world blend together in a painting, but the painting is a open world RPG.-The Animations in this game are so nice. They are so fluent I am very happy that I didnt run into a single animation glich while playing through this game.-The World the out feeling very large and as long as you are still discovering new areas to explore. Although that all changes when you unlock flight.-Their all tons of items to collect. Some of which take special caves to find and collect, this includes facing a level 200 monster and wading through a pool of invisble traps). Also I thoughly enjoyed the chest opening consept of this game it not only helped level up and discover new gear, it also gave the game a little bit more depth to its currency system.-Their are tons of dungeons in this game to delve into and defeat the lurking monsters. None of them feel even mildly close to the same either.-Their are plenty of unique and fun side quests in this game to leveling you up, earn you some extra gear, or just to explore the open world. All the quests seemed very well thought out and well made. They did a very good job of avoiding extreme amounts of fetch quests and when fetch quests occures they even acknowledge it.-The monsters in this game all serve a meaning and balence the game very well.-The villian in this game changed alot during the course of the game. He starts out as the most steriotypical villian I have ever seen and by the end I was beyond sad for him. During the final battle while I was at the edge of victory I lost on to him just to see if their would be another ending if I lost. I didnt feel very good about winning in the end either. In all this villian when from bland to making me look bland.-The proggresion in this game may be strait forward but it works very well. It makes you stronger through the entire game and give you options to your playstyle.-Their are more cat puns then you will ever need-Cons--At the end of the game the world goes from a massive open area to a small area due to the flying abilty it lets you travel the world at insane speed compared to before. It may seem really cool at first but I think it takes alot away from the games feeling.-After you win the final battle their isnt to much to do. You can clean up any side quests you have left and go slay the hidden ocean boss but after that its really just grinding levels and chests to get stronger with no meaning.-Most items in this game are useless after you start getting gold chests. It just means the base items seem to all become crappy items and the gold chest gear is all you will use.-If you are looking for a game with a crazy good story this is not for you. I have to say the backstory is very good but the playable in game story in very bland.-The reason the ending is a con is because I dont think its complete but it may get DLC which would make this already amazing game 10x better."

,Recommended,593280,34135189,Posted: 9 August,all,Marlfox,"7/10I think Cat Quest is a good game. However let me start with the negative. I found it to be a bit repetitive in the sense that all of the quests have you running from one town(closer to an outpost than town fyi) back to the other as soon as you are finished with one quest(they are all very short)- and then it's on to the next one all over again. There isn't anything special about the different towns, nothing memorable to compare one from another, they all look identical. For that matter the quests are similar in nature as well, it feels that you do the same thing over and over.There are other things that bug me too. The dungeons show you the recommended level to enter but once you've cleared the floor there is no distinction to show you which dungeons you've completed. There are quite a few and they are randomly scattered all over the world so this does complicate an otherwise fast-flowing game. The game lacks some depth, complexity and systematization for sure. For my recommendation I factor in that this is an indie game afterall.Anyway, despite the issues that I found to affect my enjoyment the game is fun in a very casual way. Things progress very quickly and don't require a huge sacrifice of time to advance in-game. You are rewarded just as quickly as the quests complete. You can save very often as there are save points all over the map. Which means restarting is quick and pain-free for the most part. Combat is simple, clean and fun. No turn-based or trickery. The graphics look ""cute"" and the music is also decent. I'm overall impressed. As far as buying the game, I don't think I would buy any DLC and I definitely wouldn't pay more than $10 for this.*Tastes are subject to change.*"

Cats, dogs and mice rephrases would not make it into a very stimulated franchise.​Gameplay​The combat is the child friendly version of Dark Souls. You will be surprised and you will die some times. But it doesn't matter since you can save very close to your mission every single time. It's content with combos and the first skill you get is the wombo-combo starter. Nothing feels more satisfying in this game than to burn your foes and make them weaker with a ring of fire and then delivering your finishing moves.​There is a gear shop and a mage tower for skill upgrades. But this early on quest items would suffice well.​Story​There are two branches in the plot design. The main story and the side stories. The side stories are not hand me 9 copper ores and you will get a sack of coins. They are excellent made with follow ups and twists in between and in the end. To put it short, a chapter themselves.​The main story involves the cat hero himself and his catnapped sister. To save her sister, the main villain wants the cat hero to defeat three dragons in the world.And the peasants misfortune with his gone family member makes you feel downsy and afraid of what will happen next.​Graphics​2D vector and hand drawn graphics makes the game cute in a world of creepy stories. But does the graphic setting go well with the game? With the cast being cats in a fantasy world, it does. To least to say, it is kid friendly.​Sound​Very hypnotizing for the mind. Good sounds, good music. Makes you drawn into the games world more (except for the cat humor).​Final Score:​Gameplay: 7Story: 5Graphics: 5Sound : 7"

,Recommended,593280,34901169,Posted: 12 September,all,felixader,"Cat Quest is a simple but competently made, fun and charmingly designed Action RPG.The visual design is very cute and in some ways rather clever. There are only the overworld, that looks like you are constantly traversing a big map, and simple dungeonmaps you go in fight everything and the leave again.Some of the fun lies therein how the game plays with this aspect and uses it in humorous ways to lead the player around and from battle to battle, putting down lines and x and other symbols on it like it was drawn unto the world.The Gameplay is VERY simple, quests are super linear and the fun in following them comes mainly from how the game presents the little scenarios and stories in.The combat is quick and easy to understand, so easy in fact i wont go into details because after fighting just one enemy most people will have understood everything there is. HOWEVER that doesn't means the game can be beat by button mashing, not at all. Players who just mindlessly button mash and not pay attention to the warnings for incoming attacks will find themselves frequently and repeatedly dying.The Equipment system is actually a bit broken. You find equipment in form of hats/helmets, armor and weapons and if you have a specific item again said item will be upgraded. There are chests to find in the world but you can only find and loot them once. After that you need to rely on the smith. In the smithy the player can choose to purchase a small chest for 50 Gold or a big chest for 5000 gold. The Items out of that are randomly chosen and then upgrade their respective gear in your inventory.This sadly leads to some of the items being flat out useless although they might look better since you have a chance that they never are going to be better then the ones you got a the beginning and that you leveled up big time until then.Never has a game more needed a fashion slot more so that the players can equip the look they want while getting the stats from something better.The magic system is okay, nothing special but also usefull enougzh so that you constantly use it.Now, to be truthfull, the game is actually really repetetive when it comes to its gameplay.You pick up a quest, you follow the marker, kill a bunch of enemys and then follwo the next marker. That is all there is to it.That i still recommend it comes from the fun stories presented in the quests and main line and the light humor of its design overal.as well from the fact that it is rather short.After 13 hours i played trough the main quest, all sidequests and several quests you need to discover trough exploration.There are a few highlevel tasks still over as well as some REALLY Highlevel Dungeons that i feel are only there if your REALLY want to grind more in this combat.The game wont blow your mind.But Cat Quest doesn't outstay its wellcome and until its end is well made, well presented and fun to play."

Aside from the combat though, if you aren't killing something you are wasting time walking from one place to the other, and sometimes back again and again. If you don't like fetch quests this game is not for you. Story is fairly bare bones with twists at the end, the game is maybe funny but the humor felt kinda shallow and didn't really do anything for me. There were several parts I discovered that were very clearly ""to be continued"" so at least the developers have plans to add more.Marked as positive because I enjoyed it overall, but my standards are low and I'm easy to please."

,Recommended,593280,34923501,Posted: 13 September,all,marionette.cross,"Cat Quest is a fun little game, but is a bit light on content for the price. I had the main quest beaten in 6 hours, and had every achievment done by 8 hours. I would definitely recommend waiting until it was on sale before buying.That said, it was indeed a decent game. The controls are tight, the story is entertaining (albeit simple), the puns are decent (if occasionally over-used), and nothing ever felt like it was ""unfair"" to me. The only thing I disliked about it (other than how short it was) was that the devs made far too much use of hidden, unmarked paths in dungeons. It felt like I spent almost as much time walking into walls looking for secret paths as I did actually clearing dungeons. Not having to walk into walls constant would have probably shaved an hour off my playtime for the main quest, and upwards of two hours for the total playtime.Still, it was a fun game, although I do recommend waiting until it's on sale. The content would be good for an $7.50 game, but at $13, it feels a bit short and light on content."

If you don't try to dodge enemy attacks all the time, you will  get absolutely wrecked,  but fortunately every single enemy attack in the game comes with a big ring or hit area showing you where not to be (which, later on in the game, is anywhere close to the monster!)The progression in the game is also very well done, being mainly achieved through weapon and armor upgrades/unlocks found in chests throughout the world or randomly found in the blacksmith for a fee.Though it is extremely basic, it doesn't need to be anything more. Aside from a few small polish issues and a complete lack of a proper options/settings menu, the game a solid purchase even for the asking price - though it wouldn't hurt to let it go on sale first considering the game's length is generally going to be less than 10 hours."

,Recommended,593280,34171413,Posted: 11 August,all,@greg_gamer,"Cat Quest is a colorful breath of fresh air in the RPG genre. It pays homage to other classic titles, especially Zelda, and is filled with paw-some references. It's also filled - FILLED! - with cat-puns. Some of them are quite bad, like ""catfrontation"" (Clawfrontation was the obvious choice).The game is stunningly well-made, it is perhaps the cutest game out there, but in terms of art direction it's bright, colorful and uplifting, the animations and character designs are great as well. You control the protagonist, who has his sister kidnapped at the sea by a magical white cat. You are then accompanied by a Na'Vi-like guiding spirit that is as annoying as her who will help you on your quest to rescue your sister.Combat is in real-time, just like Zelda, in which you click to attack freely, and you must run around the map to dodge incoming attacks and spells. Some enemies can be quite challenging. While the game isn't linear, meaning you can go wherever you want to in any order you'd like to, areas are separated by level, which means you might need to get a few levels before advancing further. The world is pretty big and is filled with dozens of quests.Overall, the game is really fun, it's super cute, very entertaining, but unfortunately too short. It can be completed in less than eight hours, which is feeble compared to the staple of the RPG genre. But in-game the developers have inserted many meta jokes, like the wolves of the Lupus Empire will only appear if Cat Quest becomes popular enough. My guessis this version of the game is testing the waters, because it growls for more content and it has the pawtential of being a good classic of the genre - if given enough attention.You should definitely play this game if you love adventure, RPG and kittens."

76561198163241724,Recommended,593280,34228267,Posted: 13 August,all,DewwyDewott,"(Pros and Cons at the bottom)I have clocked in almost 7 hours into this game and completed the main story and I can safely say that I personally felt like I could have spent money wiser, yet, Im glad I spent the money to buy it.  The gameplay first off is a Real time RPG adventure,  where you level up and gain stats, along with magic and swordsmanship, thats... your whole arssenal of offensive weaponry. However, there are Body and Head wear that increase your Health,Attack,Armour, and Magic, however, some armor tend to take away stats instead of increase it. Leaving you 3 diffrent ways to play the game, and you can shift these weapons without worry, of having to grind more, you can shift playstyles as much as you'd like, and as often as you'd like. You also have the capability to roll, making you wanna make out with your space bar with how much you'll be rolling, it almost makes the game too easy, but if you tend to dodge into the wrong directions, (you can roll by pressing space and any direction on the arrow keys) you can take a hefty ammount of damage when up against the wrong enemy. The magic has really neat effects to help you, and to be able to combo into physical attacks, and can let you attack during a roll... yet, the magic can be really busted if used correctly, but the healing paw is the worst with how if costs so much mp, yet, it heals worth crap.Now, the story... honestly isnt something specactular, first off, you are sailing across the ocean when a white cat named Drakoth destroys your ship and takes away your sister. (Ala; LoZ Windwaker) So now you must head off with your guardian spirit Spirri to save your sister by defeating Drakoth's 4 dragons. The story is simple yet easy to follow, even doing the sidequests give more info into the inhabitants of the land of Felingard, even hinting at other species living off in the distance, however, the story quickly throws you for multiple loops at the end of the game, where it just throws plot twist after plot twist at you, where it seems like they tried to reveal the plot twists in impactful ways, however, they dont really succeed since they tell you these plot twists earlier on in the game if you do sidequests, which, the game wants you to do all of em, but, the most irritating thing about these sidequest storylines is that the lore you learn from it never really matters in the end, it seems like endless tagging on. And speaking of sidequests, 3 of them arent even lore related, these 3 are either ads, promises of seeing more races other than cats, and the game developers litterally ♥♥♥♥ing with you.Now, balancing is hard to do, and this game is proof of how hard it is, when you get armor or weapons for the first time, they are permanantly in your inventory, and if you collect them again, the weapon or armor levels up, and the stats increase. This can get very broken with a vast ammount of the weapons  and armors yeilding negative stats more so than the positives, and even then, it locks you out of being able to do both magic and weapons at their strongest unless they come from gold chests, which make it so easy to cheese the game, that its not even worth trying at somepoints,the final boss didnt even take 5 minuites to complete, its pathetically easy with how the balancing in this game is off.  and plus you can spend the most easy to obtain money in anything I played to buy random weapons, and to increase the strength of your magic,the Dialouge isnt the best, it seems forced most of the time, but the puns are nice, and it gave me a few chuckles. its amusing to say the least, but all of the characters seem to not have any personality, if they show it, its usually reversed a few sentances laterAnd lastly, the visual representation is beyond adorable... allbeit the obsessive use of ritual circles make it tiring to see them... the colors are bright and fun, but, some times, its just solid Red, White or black, and the dungeon themes keep coming back again and again with diffrent layouts, it gets old quickly.Pros:-The gameplay is fun, versitile, and can appeal to diffrent playstyles,-The Writing in humorus and Cat pun filled,-There are diffrent armor types to appeal to anyone.-The visuals are cute as ♥♥♥♥ (the mage cats are my favorite things ever)-There are 7 spells that assist you in battle, which helps you out immensly,Cons:-Its super easy to cheese the game, making the difficulty mind numbing-The characters arent too standoff-ish, I couldnt even remember the guardian spirit's name for the longest time,-The plot has been done before, but better,-There are times where the game gets bland and reppetivie in its design and dungeons,-The game devs seem to troll you with how much deception is going on in most cases,-The magic is unbalanced unless you pay to upgrade, making them your most powerful tools... a bit... too powerfulConclusion:I really like this game, I really do, but it doesnt seem like the game was tested for balancing purposes, Its incredibly easy, yet it punishes you by trolling you with various ways of being unfair to youFor 10 dollars, this does seem like a good game, but if you're looking for a story driven or exploration heavy game, this is not for you, its a relaxing game to play, but not get invested in.I reccomend it for its price,"

But I prefer the side quest to do levelling then a generic grind. A lot of backtracking but it's acceptable. The item management is maybe the weaker part...you get equipment but they just accumulate (also upgrade automatically) into your stock. Which makes a very large item list to switch to...to date I didn't find a way to sell or get rid of items. Otherwise this is a fun and light action RPG that pass the time.

Went fast and generally pretty easy, and I laughed at the cat puns and silliness. I enjoyed it right up till the last boss, which even after maxing out my spells, being 30+ levels higher than the walkthroughs I watched, and using the same skills, is still a 2-3 hit kill on me. I'm bummed I'm not able to finish this since I have no idea what else to do :/"

,Recommended,593280,34344947,Posted: 19 August,all,Niteonites,"This game is a hidden gem. The tone and artistic style are laid back and casual, a trait that is rare for RPGs, and the gameplay is more rewarding than the preview images imply. I think downloading the demo and giving it a shot is the best choice.The rest of this review is somewhat critical.The time you can put into this game is nowhere near 10 hours. You can get that much time if you are a completionist, but you will not get the kind of time if you are a normal, not achievement hunting gamer like me. My 6.4 hours is accurate of the entire time I played and enjoyed this game. You may not enjoy buying this game if you expect a dollar-to-hour enjoyed ratio.Cat Quest is fun, but it is way too short for its listed price."

,Recommended,593280,34384235,Posted: 20 August,all,Happywerido16,"Cat Quest is a cute RPG, Open world, game. If you are like me and like the types of games like Dragon Quest and Final Fanasty this is a game for you, it colourful cute and unqiue in it's style. I highly recommend it especially if you just finished an emoticanlly charged game. Cat Quest will make you feel relax.I know I sound like a copypasta strainght from the description box of a game but what I say is true. However I have a couple of cons:- I need more, it was too short for my liking. The game has lots of potential for lots more, I feel it could use a lot more of the elements for an open world RPG. For example more story, more equiment, more side quests to offer. That sort of thing. Now for the record as of the date I was writing this I have heard of no new updates for it, yes the game hints at more but currently I have heard of no updates.-The controls could be a bit better, if you are playing this I recommend playing with an controller instead of the mouse and arrow keys. I found it a lot more easier and adaptable with a controller.Other  than those cons. The game is a really fun, casual game to play to relax with and recomend playing it if you are into these types of games and if you have a strng tolerance for puns as the cat puns in this game are endless."
,Recommended,593280,34403515,Posted: 21 August,all,Pumaky,"A fun simple game. The quests and stories are interesting, short and catchy. The game is adorable and I love the fact you can change your specialty by changing your equipment which is really interesting and makes you able to try several playing styles, while discovering your favourite.It is funny when some special quests actually refers to you the player, and some quests really tests your ability to control your character and it is clear you actually have to do a few hit and run sometimes so it can be a bit challenging sometimes.I love the cuteness and playstyle. It is one of my favourite games currently."

It was clearly made for mobile because of it's simplistic graphics and touch icons, but it never stopped me from laughing at the side quest stories or subtracted from the simplistic but impactful combat.Only complaints are the dungeons are too simplistic, nothing to them but clear out monsters. Also the music gets a bit repetitive. Everything else from graphics, writing, and combat are all very much enjoyable at a very desirable price point!Looking forward to what comes next! =3"

,Recommended,593280,35338847,Posted: 30 September,all,Malix,"Joyful little adventure/rpg with massive tidalwave of cat puns.Every little upgrade feels like it is actually doing something, item upgrades stack (ie. there are no duplicate items per se, each duplicate found boosts existing item).The game took me about 9 hours to 100%, didn't feel like I was rushing either. So, yea, its a bit short. On the upside, it really didn't overstay it's welcome... Though, I wouldn't mind having some more content.Also, wouldn't mind if there were actual save slots. If you want to start a new game, it apparently overwrites previous one? I'd think this would be an issue to households with more than one player.Overall: puntastic, plays fine, looks & sounds nice, supports apparently high refresh rates (seemed to run 120fps, and my screen is at 120Hz). Recommended."

Short, but fun, with delightful, bright graphics, smooth play and a few challenges to your kiting skills. Nothing really heavy here in the story either, just a touch of melancholy at the end.Oh do I wish there was more, though. More world. More story. More ways to get the gear. The rats and dogs are hinted at as antagonists, but don't appear.  I really hope this gets enough play and word of mouth to let them expand so we can see both!"

,Recommended,593280,35396193,Posted: 1 October,all,DragonballMEOW,Definitely a casual RPG experience that is a little on the repetitive end. It's very easy to pick up and has about 12 hours of gameplay without 100 percent completion. The only thing it sort of suffer is that it appeals to younger children but the dialogue may be too mature.

When done the main quest I looked for all secrets and extras and even after that I'm going to just keep leveling up for fun.About a 7-8 hour play through as a completionist and I hope they add more content, though the pace you can mow it down would probably make it hard to keep up."
