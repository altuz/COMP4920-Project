As a result of this I cannot recommend this game and I would advise you do not purchase.**UPDATE** As is fairly predictable, the Developer has begun deleting discussion threads showcasing the video in an effort to limit the visibility of the issue."
,Recommended,593490,34481923,Posted: 25 August,all,Rafael M.,"Do you miss games like Caesar and Majesty? Would you like to play a more relaxing RTS? Then this game is for you.Empire Architectis a promising game with a lot of depth, with some features inspired by the grand strategy genre, and an always evolving gameplay, with a lot of updates and bugfixes made by a developer who really cares for his creation and the community.At the moment there are two modes available: custom game, which is a skirmish mode in heart, with four difficulty levels and procedurally generated maps; and campaign, which already has enough levels to teach you how to play and show you some strategies. The gameplay is based on keep your population happy by providing food, education, jobs, entertainment, religion and security, while you try to defeat your opponents with your army.Don’t worry, Empire Architect is a game where your APM (actions per minute) won't matter – you can play in your own time, and the units are independent, which means you don’t need to control them. This allows for a more strategic approach, where what matters are the choices you will make about what to build next based on what your population needs at the moment, what to research, and think about efficient ways to deal with logistics for an optimized city.It’s worth mentioning that the developer of this game is working hard to create a fun experience and fix occasional bugs, and I’ve seen a lot of bugs fixed on the same day the community reported them. Also, the game is already well optimized, with an almost nonexistent loading screen and no fps drops.To summarize, Empire Architect is worth playing if you’re a strategy lover and want some new ideas inspired by the relatively recent grand strategy genre. Your input can make a difference about features and mechanics, so if you want to help build the future of the game, join the community now on the Early Access phase and don’t be shy to share some ideas on theforums.Disclaimer: This review will be updated when the game exits Early Access"

Obviously this is still early days, but if you played the old civ builders, I think you'll get the nostalgic feeling you're looking for. The developer has been giving constant updates and is making a real effort to listen to the community – so I have high hopes, and for ten bucks, it's worth the investment."

Indeed, even at this early stage, this game has gotten more playtime out of me than have many other similar games, that were 'not' still in development. I have high expectations for the future.If you are the sort who like to support developers showing promise, and don't mind playing the role of tester, I highly recommend supporting this game."
,Recommended,593490,33886861,Posted: 29 July,all,CHIKUN [Eng/No/Swe],"cute game. entertaining little characters. Very much alike ceasar 3. so if youve played that you know this game.Unfortunately.....The game crashes a bit too frequently for it to be OK.There is very little information in the game on buildings and etc.Checking zone coverage only works for Religion and it is far too low in coverage.No explanation as to why area is undesirable.Trading menu really needs work, it is a guessing game 90% of the time so it must be dealt with in order for pleasant gaming.No option to play without AI.So you choose, buy now and hope it does not end like Clockwork Empires, or wait and see if it turns out good and then buy.My guess? I shouldve chosen the latter. But it is entertaining enough for me to recommend it."

The graphics are, more than, adequate while the most important aspect, game play, is superb. This is where it excels &, per the very engaged dev, will only get better.Looking forward to modding capabilites, where this game could be turned into a classic by a willing community.Multiplayer, ( especially lan ) would be the ""icing on the cake"" for me."

76561198000698735,Recommended,593490,32145358,Posted: 2 June,all,Last Knight Down,Game's still real rough; Long list of non-functioning features. There are some obvious flaws with the core of how the game is played that make it easy to cheese. I'd say this game is about 25% there. Long way to go. Definitely not a 10 dollar game yet.
,Recommended,593490,33106819,Posted: 1 July,all,Big Vamp,"Played this game on and off for a little over a month now, it is showing promise, with constant updates, fixing bugs and adding content. It has a ways to go but it is defiently improved greatly over the last month."

Maybe adjust the parameters on the conditions to win/lose so that I can really immerse myself in it for a longer period of time per session. Otherwise, it's a great start. Love these little games. Keep up the good work!"
76561198015319006,Recommended,593490,31980802,Posted: 26 May,all,Astral_Daamon,"I've been playing this game for the past week in short bursts. The game play itself is fairly short, each AI adds roughly 20-30 minutes to game and has this huge difficulty curve as soon as they get their armies going.It's not really fair to call this game a city builder, though it certainly has the early stages of those elements. It's more like an easy version of Age of Empires only with one unit type. I went in expecting Ceasar and though the game didn't measure up with my expectations of what i thought it was, I was pleasantly surprised with the game.The game is very much in it's early stages of development and the developper is actively fixing bugs and adding new content. Normally, I'd wait until the game is a bit more mature before purchasing an early access game, but I think this is one of those games that I will enjoy watching it grow."

,Recommended,593490,31984026,Posted: 26 May,all,Xenthyk,Finding the right build is something that is going to take many games played. There also seem to be a number of variables to keep you on your toes and each play has been very different.I am looking forward to see this game evolve. I have high expectations for the coming patches if it is anything like the other games from Batholith Entertainment. Keep up the good work!

I love still playing those classics but it is always tidious to deal with their quirks that you wished were fixed and balanced.A game headed in the right direction with an extremely active developer with a heart in this project."

With that said this is my personal opinion only so take it as you will.  I actually enjoyed the game...  The graphics are smooth, soft on your Gpu/Cpu, if the difficulty is turned up it can be challenging.  If you guys would like to buy this game,  check out my video below to get a quick jumpstart on the basics so you can fully enjoy the game.Youtube link belowEmpire Architect Overview with Ryan FrameThank you guys hope this was helpfull."

I know its only the 2nd day that the game has been in Early Access, and I am impressed by what is here so far. But it needs more.That being said I see 6 updates in about 2 weeks, and thats pretty darn good in my book. I look forward to what this game becomes!"

HOWEVER, if you are looking for a game that shows some promise, that you can support, and have some input in... Then this is a great one!"
76561197993872352,Recommended,593490,32013123,Posted: 27 May,all,D36class,"I've been playing for only minor minutes and sadly it crashed! However, I do see this going somewhere so long as it doesn't end up like Towns (No longer being worked on) this can be an even better game! A save option would be nice soon, possibly also an autosave. I bought this for two reasons: I love Towns and want to see the better version of it, and I felt like supporting this developer, because again, this game seems great."

The game is very playable even in the early state, and very enjoyable for city builder/Rome fans.  Still many bugs as expected, although the developer seems to fix them quickly.  You can see the future of the game while playing, and new features are being added frequently, so the game gets more and more playable every time I go back to it.  Lots of potential, keep up the great work!"

But a modern version.Yes, there are bugs & it's a long way short of a complete game.Developed by one guy. Who is completely devoted to pleasing his customers. And has got more things done in a few weeks than many teams of devs have done in a year !!This fellow needs all the support he can get to turn this into a great game.The potential here is awesome.I wholeheartedly recommend this venture.

I was hoping for a new, Caesar 3-esque builder, but it just isn't like that at all. I don't know how to describe it it's just... Different.EDIT: I honestly didn't take into account how early in the development cycle this is. If there was a way to mark my opinion as mixed, I would. I will be keeping an eye on this."

76561198073467953,Not Recommended,593490,34218561,Posted: 13 August,all,jeff.vaccaro,"I got this game for a simple civ builder.  For $10 I figured why not?  The game has potential, the edge to edge screen scrolling is a little wonky.  There is no tutorial (at least not that I've seen), so I don't really know what I'm doing exactly.  Right now by biggest issue is staying out of debt.The graphis are pretty bad.  I think they are going for old school but they are worse than some of the oldest games I can remember.I'm not sure I would currently recommend this game until I see some updates from the developers with this game.  It does have potential though."
