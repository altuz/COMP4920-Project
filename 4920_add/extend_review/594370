,Recommended,594370,30981448,Posted: 6 April,all,Part Timer Dom,"What can I say about Crazy Fishing? I can say that you'll have a good amount of fun playing it.Even though it is in its early stages, it is incredibly immersive. The minute I got into this game I felt relaxed - it's a lovely scene being on this lake.Then the fun begins. Every catch is comical and gave me a good chuckle. My first play session was a little over an hour, and I did a short video showing my first impression of the game.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMO6-tT67jIIf you are tired of playing fast-paced games in VR and just want to sit back, relax, and have a good laugh - Crazy Fishing delivers.GraphicsThe cartoon style of the game works well. The colors are vibrant and remind you of a sunny spring day down at the lake. Subtle features in certain areas (not going to spoil them) really give a nice ambience. Certain things could be improved, such as the waterfall, but overall the game is beautiful to experience.ControlsThere is little to no learning curve as far as the controls go. You can really figure out the mechanics of the game right off the bat. I never even saw a video of this game prior to playing and I figured it out without even trying - that, to me, is a sign of a well-made game.GameplayIt's a mixture of relaxing atmosphere and comedy. You're going to feel tranquil, but you're also going to laugh. It's exciting to catch a new fish, open a treasure chest, or discover a new secret. The progression of the game is simple: catch fish, exchange them for new bait types or for money. Money buys you the ability to go to new locations around the lake while new bait types allow you to catch different fish. It kept me engaged for my first play session and definitely intrigued me to come back and keep playing.DrawbacksI did encounter a few bugs (some are shown in my video) but they didn't ruin the experience - if anything they added to it. Some bugs are simple, such as the lighting with the flashlight. Some are larger, such as your line being cast underground. Either way, due to the comical nature of the game the bugs had me laughing, and after all it's still early access - bugs are to be expected.OverallI give this game a solid 9/10 for an early access release being that it is completely playable, very enjoyable, polished, and most of all: FUN. I can only hope that the developers build on the game, improve current features, and add new ones along the way. This game is shaping up to be a real winner, if it isn't already. I really can't wait to see what comes next. If you want to judge the game yourself before buying, just watch the above video. To me, it's definitely worth the money."

Fortunately this one delivers in most aspects. This is a fully fleshed out game that I can clearly play for hours, but the main sound loop is so repetitive it is almost maddening. I also desperately crave haptic pulses before a fish bites, to raise the tension and make it much more like the real thing. Normally you wait for the perfect nibble to set the hook, so that feels like a missed opportunity here.Seriously, with some better music I'd just sit for hours relaxing, and with some haptic nibbles you have a winner here."

Well done guys, can't wait to see all the new stuff that is coming with the updates."
,Recommended,594370,30988323,Posted: 6 April,all,Typical Titan,"Good game, but not a lot of content. Id love to see more of a item progression for things like better fishing rods or bait and stuff like that. The tablet in the game is a pain to use and really needs to be fixed. All of the content can be gotten through in maybe 4h max. That being said, this is an early access game and I would love to see what the developers do with it."
,Recommended,594370,31008204,Posted: 7 April,all,Immersia,"Awesome early access game, hopefully the developers add more content for the full version... the actual process of casting and reeling has a small learning curve but once you get the hang of it it's so much fun. Really cool art style and it's pretty fun to just explore the environment and search for easter eggs. Look forward to more content from these guys!"
76561198234149360,Recommended,594370,33107700,Posted: 1 July,all,xReconV2,"A solid game that has surprised me greatly. After talking to my girlfriend about fishing games we played when we were younger, she convinced me to pull the plug on Crazy Fishing (had been on my wishlist for some time now) so she could try it herself and we both wanted one that required the player to physically reel in fish. I have to say that I love the game so far. It's simple, but at the same feels necessary for a fishing game in VR. I do wish that there was slight feedback when I am just reeling an empty line in, but I understand that since it's utilized to determine wheter or not a fish is nibbling or biting that it's probably best not to. Still, I can wish. This is a solid title that deserves a lot more love so it can continue to get the updates to expand it. At the moment I have no regrets about my $11.99 purchase and believe it's more than worth it. I still can't figure out entirely what did it for me, maybe it's the boomerang fish saying, ""Aw, C'mon mate"" when I grind him up or just the thought gone into the crazy fish themselves, but expect to see my time with this game easily reach the double digits just for the relaxing factor. Still managed to break a sweat reeling them in though. If you're having trouble finding the tablet to buy upgrades just redo the tutorial (few seconds) and it will pop back up. Don't forget to look at the watch while holding different types of bait to see what fish it attracts. Really cool that the fish can range in size. First fish was a tiny radar screen fish and later on caught a pretty big one that took me by surprise. Definitely adds replayability. There are a few bugs I ran into but nothing seemed to get in tyhe way of my enjoyment."
,Not Recommended,594370,34075918,Posted: 6 August,all,Yeti,"Before saying what I'm about to I want to mention that I did enjoy Crazy Fishing, albeit for a short time. It's a good arcade fishing game and the fish design, progression and mechanics are solid and unique. There aren't many bugs, visuals are pretty and clear, it runs well and overall it's a well made game.The biggest issue I have with it, though, is content and replayability. Money is incredibly easy to come by and you end up affording the highest tier gear and bait within about an hour and a half. The rest of the gameplay is managing which bait you store, trying to unlock the rest of the fish and exploring. Exploring everything takes maybe another half hour. In about 3 hours I experienced pretty much everything there is to experience. There is treasure around the map as well as chests you can open with keys but in my experience they're entirely worthless after about an hour of playing.In the end it is a good game with promising concepts but suffers from a lack of content and replayability which left me unsatisfied with spending $20 on it. I personally wouldn't pay more than $10. If you're okay with only getting a few hours out of it or just really find fishing relaxing and enjoyable then it's probably worth it, otherwise I recommend you wait for a sale or pass."

,Recommended,594370,31325165,Posted: 23 April,all,PappyTaterABQ,"This game is simple, but a BLAST to play. It's very easy to get lost in it. The first time I put it on, I ended up in it for 3 hours before I realized it. I'm including two videos, both of our oldest son playing through between two days. We hope this helps others to decide to pick this one up. Day 1:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y8aSSpCdJYand Day 2:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHx1q8dLbIgWith the v1.2 Patch, this game became even more fun to play. With food effects, a working VR effect when you snag the helmet, more fish, and a few hidden surprises, it keeps us wanting more. We can't wait to see what v1.3 has in store. Here's our video showcasing some of what you'll find in v1.2 :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYFqsnd-Be4"
,Recommended,594370,33016300,Posted: 29 June,all,Fnord,"Purchased this game on a whim, on sale, after seeing a few gifs on some of the SteamVR communities, and I have to say, I'm really enjoying this.  Maybe it's from my days as a youth, fishing on the coast, hardly ever catching anything, but being able to stand and cast over and over, catching something on almost every cast is already a plus.  Also, the large number of strange fish, interesting locations, and tongue-in-cheek humor in this game gets a big thumbs up from me.I would suggest this game to anyone who has ever fished with a rod and reel, or thinks that the idea of standing around and fishing in your living room sounds fun."
76561198256886525,Recommended,594370,31005273,Posted: 7 April,all,Lord_Edmo,So far this game is pretty fun. The casting and reeling feels good. The locations are nice and visually apealing. I do a lot of fishing in the real world and while this is not really the simulator I hope to have some day it is quite fun. I can see myself spending a fair bit of time hunting down the rare and legendary fish. If you enjoy fishing you will enjoy this.

,Not Recommended,594370,33459546,Posted: 11 July,all,Martin,"I will Change this review to ""Recommended"" if the bait hook bug is ever fixed.Somehow during the tutorial it's possible to bug the game so you cannot bait the hook. You can even lose the hook and not get it back.as it's impossible to bait the hook the main portion of the game is unplayable. Shame as everything else looks fantastic. Just exploring the world is fun."

,Recommended,594370,33083242,Posted: 1 July,all,CheddaNinja,"I was part of the beta for this game.  I had about 7 -8 hours into the game at the time before the pushed out the full version. Another 1.2 hours since I purchased the game. It is a great addition to your library if you are looking for a slower paced fishing game. Not super slow, not super realistic....fun. There are about 20ish different kinds of wacky fish to catch. You wont get a bite everytime you cast, but 90% of the time I'd say.There are 8 different preset locations you can fish from with a range of environments, but you can also teleport around the lake to find your own spot to fish from. You can also take a raft out onto the lake and and fish from there.Again I like this as a relaxing game where I will get my beer next to my chair and spend and hour or 2 fishing and actually catching fish. Definately grab this one."
,Recommended,594370,33138087,Posted: 2 July,all,Moon,"Recommend: Open up OVRdrop, watch movie/tv series/stream/anime/whatever when fishing in your house. VR is not only a game, but also a life style."

,Recommended,594370,34652414,Posted: 31 August,all,🅿🆂🆈🅲🅷🅾,"Ok, let me start by saying this is a fun game. It really is. Its beautiful in VR, and runs smooth. Now, my problem with this game is that I don't believe there is much strategy in catching the fish. Seems like when I see a certain fish Id like to catch, I cast and if I land near it, the fish doesn't come near my hook. Now, I dont know if certain fish like certain bait, but there is nothing to tell you. The beginning tutorial is very short and basic. Doesn't tell you much. Also, I would like that if I quit the game on a certain part of the lake, that the next time I play im still there. Also, after about an hour of playtime, I do get a bit motion sick, and I don't really get motion sick. Only 2 other games have gotten me sick. One is Paranormal Activiity and Robinson the Journey. Now, do I recommend buying it? YES. Lots of fun, different fish, throphies, exploration, etc. Totally worth the money. Just hope they put a better explaination into things."
