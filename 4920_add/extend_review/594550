,Not Recommended,594550,31276025,Posted: 21 April,all,Rzulmisi,Game is awesome. But they shouldn't make us pay for one game twice. I bought Windows version so I should have automatically Linux version. It's not okay.
,Recommended,594550,30535218,Posted: 15 March,all,linuxpunk,"I got this game for 3 reasons:1To show devs and publishers that porting games to linux is profitable.2To show devs and publishers that there is a market for old, cult or classic games in linux.3To send Bohemia a message:Fully support ARMA III for linux.I really want to get that, but I won't spend my money in a experimental port that might be droped.Other than that, what can I say. This is a cult, genre defining game. I played Operation Flashpoint back in the day and loved it, ARMA is about the same. Gameplay wise is worth playing, but the game has aged and nowdays I've seen better textures in voxel games. Deffinitely worth a buy imo, if you like war simulators or retro games."

Had this already in my library and remember trying to run it on Wine, few years ago, with control and texture problems.This port looks good, tested few mins of the campaign, 120Hz @1080p CPU at 1/4 usage and GPU at 46 C.Enjoyed the intro with a big smile for the nth time :)Thank you Valve, thank you VP and thank you Bohemia."

I loved it, my friends not so much :)"

The performance is good.... and what other games allows you to fly the Hind or Apache??? :)PPS: Looking for a retro single-player FPS-experience I have not tested Multiplayer yet."

,Recommended,594550,30518847,Posted: 14 March,all,x_wing,"I remember playing this game with my old and beloved voodoo 2 (this game use to support glide!). About the game, well is just awesome in all levels:* Great Story (at least the vanilla version)* Complex combat simulation (but no so complex to be considered as a simulator)* Lots of vehicles (Russians/USSR helicopters!)* Excellent level editorIt works great in Linux with mesa driver 12.0.6 (default version in ubuntu 16.04). Ok, maybe there are some minor bugs, but they are the same that Windows has (be careful with the shadows, the object shadows activation freeze the game at startup. I remember having the same issue in Windows 7)"
,Recommended,594550,30518795,Posted: 14 March,all,HaMMeR_CZ,"THE BEST GAME OF ALL TIME now ported on Linux & Mac.The port seems to be well done, it even seems to improve some minor stuff from the windows version, like the scenes with people in some above ground house floors in CWC campaign look again as they should, and also this seems to be first official version, where aspect ratio settings finaly works, only current problem with it are weapon optics, which leave see-thru spaces on sides of widescreen.Another current minor problem is time acceleration, which on first look doesnt seem to be working, but when playing I realized the key for accelating time works, I just need to press it together with shift (not sure if badly mapped key or some problem with my system keyboard layout) Also after few minutes playing, the game seems to lose ability to take steam screenshots.And two questions for the developers: Why not include Czech language (with czech audio)? And also why this game doesnt have workshop already?"

It could have been worth it is they had actuall ported the damn game but instead they decided to package wine and the original windows exe.  Not worth your money, just run it through wine instead."

,Recommended,594550,31543132,Posted: 4 May,all,DasCapschen,"Great to see this game come to Mac and Linux :)It works great and just like on Windows, means it also has the same flaws.Every mod I tested so far worked and I don't see a reason why any mod shouldn't, just be aware that it currently does not seem to handle special characters like ä, ü, ö, é, í, ý, č, š. So remove those from any pbos you want to use and don't use them in your username.Mind all the negative reviews are complaining about having to buy this game again, because they apparently do not value work to be worth even 4 tiny Euros..."
