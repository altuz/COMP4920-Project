Then didn't even fit in the window it created for its self so I couldn't exit.  On top of that it does not show up as an application or a process in Task Manager so forced restart is the only way out then you have to manually fix your graphics.  I just paid 3 bucks to fix my computer of a problem it didnt have and never got to play the game because was the same result for round 2 and I'm not giving it a 3rd try.

I have over a hundred games in my catalog and this scratches a very particular itch that none of the others do. There are a few small improvements that can be made. But what really impressed me was at first I couldn't save without a crash. It didn't take the developer very long to fix that. I wouldn't have expected that quickness from a AAA title, let alone a small, inde like this.It can get repetitive. If you like RNG space trading games, though, you really have nothing to lose with this game. I paid more for my coffee this morning than I paid for this game. (And I'm enjoying this game far more than the coffee ;) )I'm hoping the developer will put in an unlimited mode in the future. Perhaps even a way to re-roll (progress) the planets. More options are always welcome. But right now the game is a hoot. Have certainly got my money's worth."

I found the relazing atmosphere a nice break from some of the huge 4x's and other typesof games I play. Decent graphics, interesting storyplay and a simple though tricky journey in developing your economy. Immersion is what you make it of course and sour brats need not apply. I had no difficulty in running this game nor its gameplay, but then thankfully I've been blessed with the ability to READ and was quite aware of the graphical issue IF you did meet the requirement (that being, adjust your fonts if you have them configured differently than required by this game). I found the negatve reviews quite distasteful in that regard and actually embarassing considering the very large and simple advisory on the storefront. I mean jeez people, try not to show your idiocy in such an obviuos manner. I had no crashes, nor issues that i could find in the whole time I played and browsed through the game and a quite enjoyable time. I enjoyed building up my character and felt right at home enjoying the gameplay.  Certainly worth having in yur library for a lazy intellectual playthrough."

Games like this were relatively common on old computers (I remember something very similar on my BBC model B).Is that a bad thing?  Absolutely not. I love this game, and I mean Love it! OK so it's simple, there isn't three thousand keyboard shortcuts to learn, the graphics are simple but effective. The rules, well I suppose it could be explained better but to be honest, the game is so straight forward that a single play-through will teach you everything you need to know.This game is fun, simple, pure, easy and, well fun. Yup I said it twice.I have had no issues running it (Win 7 x64, nvidia, triple head) but I know others have had problems. I have no idea why, I have not experienced one single crash.So, if you fancy playing something quick, easy (although sometimes tricky), and just for the laughs, then this should be in your library of top games.This is my goto game when I can't decide what to play from the massive choice I have.Recommended.... Big time!"

,Not Recommended,594720,30808700,Posted: 29 March,all,Sporkmonger,"Seriously, it's pretty bad. Even for a $3 game it's bad. I'm not sure I'd bother playing this if it were free. Really, it's not worth even a moment of your time. Ignore the random crashes and abysmal graphics, the gameplay is just completely inspid. I was completely bored after about 3 minutes. This barely rises above ""Your first video game!"" tutorial level. The negative reviews are well deserved. This should have been shown off to family and friends and then tossed aside as a indie game developer learning experience before trying again with something that was actually fun."
,Not Recommended,594720,30680826,Posted: 22 March,all,EndGameOmega,"Avoid.This game has some rather strange and unusual graphics issues that can't seem to be resolved. So far, I've been unable to actually play the game on either system I've installed it on even though both meet all the minimum requirements (by far).I'm assuming from the way the game is displayed that this is a port of something from the 90s. Regardless, it's not been properly debuged or vetted.Edit: Because I seem to be getting a lot of flak for it: Yes, I did check my display settings on both system. They are both set to Normal (100%)/96 DPI. The graphics issue I was dealing with appears to be unrelated.Given the reviews on other games by this same developer, it would seem other people have experienced similar issues with other game failing to display right. I have since asked Steam for a refund since the developer seems unwilling to take the issue seriously. Whether this game is cheap or not, I still expect it to work."

Not a lot of fancy visuals here but you aren't paying $60 either! I lost my first game, won the second so I'll keep this short because I need to see who wins game three."
76561198004803930,Recommended,594720,33257201,Posted: 4 July,all,Cranky,"The game works on a Windows 7 OS.  Purchased this game in spite of the ""Doesn't work"" posts.  Ignore those posts.I have started 3 games.  One is a mid game save.  The seoonc crashed to the desktop.  The third I finished the game trying to replicate the crash to the desktop.Aside from an unrepeatable CTD, the game is simple but fun. You move from planet to planet (you do not pilot your ship), any battles are auto resolved based off of the fleet strengths.Your choices involve Trading, Ship upgrades, investments and where to go next.There are multiple mini-games, but none of them require any thought.The game is very short, it could benefit from the addition of acheivements."
,Recommended,594720,30379828,Posted: 7 March,all,cmdo99,"A neat little game with very active devs. Quick and simple, with just enough complexity to keep me entertained.It was worth the sale price of 2.50 ish, but as it was just released does have many flaws:No ship customizabilityShip upgrades are very small (upgrades by 500 for storage and 1-2 ish for damage) This makes it crucial to start upgrading from the first turn as you wont be able to go very highLow investment cap/price, you can only get 10000 shares which are generally worth between $1 and $50 each... it is not an efficient way to gain money.The odds to randomly lose and  gain $100000-$200000 are extremely high... (especially when the bank gets robbed every hour or so)"

Played the frist game in 80 minutes, no bugs, no glitches and I rule the galaxy.  A story line with a narrative about the planets and what they produce and consume would be nice.  The comodities traded are almost tongue in cheek ..... ( Ties ??? ,.... must be the GQ of Galaxies) ......But for the price ( $3.29 ) the cost of a late' ....... It is fun,  Simple, random fun.   I have to give it a 4 out of 5Cheers"

76561198030975938,Recommended,594720,30699753,Posted: 23 March,all,bjdibbins,"Cheaper than a cup of coffee! I've been gaming since the early days of home computers - seriously, my first was a TRS-80, so take it from me I've seen and played a lot. I had a warm deja vu feeling in the gameplay, and there are certainly similar elements to games I used to play and enjoy like Taipan, and even some elements of Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio. I have over 500 games in my library, but when I come home from work I'm really not interested in something that is going to challenge my speed and reflexes. Instead I want a game I can relax and unwind with over a cup of coffee. Star Merchant is that sort of game. It isn't overly complex and you won't need to spend ages learning how to play. While it wouldn't hurt to make a few notes as you are playing, you can easily play it off the top of your head and do well. The developer has been adding a few features in the short time it's been released and tweakig some things based on feedback in the forums, so that's good as well. Just to wrap this up, I've noticed some negative feedback saying the game is broken - what a load of nonsense. People, take a look at the requirements for the game, as it is designed for a certain resolution and default font size. I'm running windows 10, and don't have any problems.  Seriously, it's less than a cup of coffee at the moment. I know I've already spent several hours playing it and have my money's worth."

76561198023781727,Not Recommended,594720,34997890,Posted: 16 September,all,charles.shuller,"The game is a bit too random for my taste, I also disslike the ""single use"" weapons in the ship upgrade center.Turn structure is also a bit problematic for me1)  Select Planet2)  Something Bad Happens, possibly just a deduction, but generally something that weakens you against pirates3)  Spend money for  defence against pirates, the more the better, all pirate defenses are temporary, even if they look permenant, they'll go away the next time you hit step (2).4)  Buy/Sell stuff, I didn't play long enough to figure out if this was just random prices or not, but it seems completely random.5)  Launch6)  Pirates (probably) attack with random strength, taking your cargo and some money when they win if you didn't spend enough in (3)7)  Goto 1"

I have a few hours on this game and it was much better, now not worth playing.  Developer you are wrong! Several weeks ago I would have given you a thumbs up... today not so!"

Run the game and it defaults your screen resolution to some wierd, out-sized settting.  No way to access setting once you start.  Go ahead and try to fumble your way through and you get a full computer lock causing you to have to reset.I flushed good money away on this POS, don't do the same."
