This is an experience on rails which will last you about half an hour (taking your time and making mistakes).  There are a few choices you can make, with the wrong choices getting you killed.I'm not sure if this game was meant to be bad on purpose to be funny, but I certainly laughed multiple times during gameplay.  The voice overs are in broken English (and slowed down), events which happen are comical (not going to spoil anything), and the one shooting mechanic is overdone and boring.  The intro says you will learn the story of far space, but really you learn nothing.  Who is attacking, why you have a random alien ally, and why there is a giant portal is never explained.An interesting experience for someone looking to spend about a buck fifty, but the game feels more like a demo then an actual game.  In addition, there are pictures in the steam store which do not show up in game.  Only buy if you want to support the developer, otherwise I'd say pass."
,Not Recommended,594730,31740467,Posted: 13 May,all,Zhuril,"Voice acting's pretty bad, the choices are confusing (What's the difference between escape and retreat?) there's segments in the game that go on WAAAY to long and you're left bored (Rail shooter fighting the same 3 enemies for 10-15 minutes anyone?). There are times in the game I thought it was bugged because it seemed like nothing was happening but rather it was just... waiting for something then the player just advances. Also, more of a minor complaint, in VR mode (HTC Vive anyways) i'm like the size of the hulk, why is my head so small? :cThe second I encountered a second rail shooter element I just turned it off and uninstalled, not sitting through pointing my ""cursor"" at enemies for another 15 minutes.Originally I was interested in the story concept, but the gameplay elements are really immersion-breaking and incredibally dull."
,Not Recommended,594730,31729746,Posted: 13 May,all,Kris.vdv,"So many positive reviews, these must be fake :)Anyway, this game is what I always imagine Gear VR games to be :  simple, non-positional tracking, and head-tracking for aiming so no controllers are required.  I don't know if I'm correct, but this sure feels like a (bad) Gear port!  Anyway, for Vive and Oculus owners, this is something which you better avoid, because it's basically a lousy 'interactive' 360 video :)."

Choose-your-own-adventure style gameplay where the wrong choice always kills you makes for a series of guessing games and frequent and unnecessary deaths.  This is interspersed with repetitive low effort view-controlled shooting sections that would be barely excusable on a mobile VR platform.  Also, this game does almost everything possible to make VR users nauseous, spinning you around constantly and forcing you to stare at weird angles just to maintain any sense of location whatsoever.Voice acting is bad, graphics are passable at best, menu looks like it was designed by Jackson Pollock (its all over the place)...  sorry to be so harsh, but even if this game was free, I would recommend not playing it.  If you are desperate for VR content and have a budget of $0 and have already played the 100 other free VR titles on steam: consider going for a walk instead of buying this game."

Can't be adults as the dialogue is so cheesy and childish (""get away you monsters!"" etc) that I'm left with scratching my head (or nodding a lot in VR to aim at the ""monsters"") alot at what this is trying to achieve. The graphics are ok but there are better demos out there that are longer. I completed this in 25 minutes and was left open mouthed thinking ""are you kidding me?"".

That is ok.There is some cringy voice acting and the game feels sluggish and slow. That is ok.Only one of the choices presented is right, all others are instant death for you. That is ok.The game is one dimensiona and the shooter segemnts are way to long. that is ok.What is not ok, is the way that VR is implemented. The ""Look at things"" control style is not very satisfying and the complet lack of usage for the controlers is pretty bad. Also if you get motion sick easly: Let this be a warning! There are some crazy scenes in this game that might make you very sick!The game is only couple of bucks, and if you enjoy these kind of games or are a fan of ""so bad, it's good"" material, then by any means, get it. I would not recomend it."
,Recommended,594730,33856798,Posted: 28 July,all,Spammals,"Far Space VR. - This game is a 30 min experience that gives the illusion of choice. It plays out like an interactive movie that from time to time gives you multiple choices. However, unlike a TellTale series where the story adapts to your choices here the options are simply a right or wrong choice. A wrong choice will kill you moments after.Pros.• The game visually looks stunning. The detailing of the space station is fantastic and the effects of laser beams and fire also look great. By no means has the developer been lazy it's very clear a lot of effort has been put into this.• The music is great.Cons.• The voice acting is terrible. I found myself mocking him everytime he spoke.• The Illusion of choice annoyed me. I'd have liked to see my choices make a difference.• The space combat was very boring and repetitive.• The ending was a massive WTF moment that feels extremely rushed and poorly written.• There was 2 moments where in VR the character was rolling around that really made me feel sick. And that's coming from a guy who's very experienced in VR and never gets motion sickness.I give the game a 5/10. It's a great start but needs a lot more work doing to it at it's core and not so much in the polish. Given the price of the game is very low one cant complain or expect anything more than is currently present so ultimately I'm happy with the game."

The graphics seemed awful 'big' that's the only way I can describe them. The gameplay was based on 'do this or do that' by looking at a number of icons for your decision. There was a brief rail shooting experience which was basic and repetitive. On the plus side the game was cheap, so I'll hang on to it, just in case of major updates."
,Recommended,594730,33645668,Posted: 18 July,all,FastLawyer,"So you just got a VR headset and don't want to spend a lot for good VR experiences?  This is the perfect game for that.  Don't listen to all the naysayers.  This game is $1.99 USD currently.  Yes, there are some great free VR games out there, no doubt.  However, in the under $3 category of VR gaming, this is one of the hidden gems.  Amazing visuals.  You're an astronaut in space, when alien life forms attack.Sure the game is on rails and is a scripted event and you can't walk/float about freely. Sure, the choice mechanic is questionable because the wrong choice will lead to death (don't worry, after death you are quickly back to where you were).  Yes, the voice acting is so terrible that it's actually funny.  And yes, the shooting quickly gets boring and may cause slight neck strain.But this game easily delivers a good experience in the ~25 minutes of gameplay for $1.99.  I recommend for the price, worth every penny.  Definitely doesn't deserve the mixed review status given it's better than most games rated positive (note: not saying it's better than those games rated overwhelmingly positive)."

IT'S NOT I REAPEAT NOT AN FPS GAME OF ANY KIND AS YOU MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED FROM THE SCREENSHOTS. IT IS A STEP BY STEP GAME WHERE YOU ARE PAUSED FROM TIME TO TIME TO MAKE DECISIONS. YOU DO NOT HAVE THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT. HENCE VR(?).
,Recommended,594730,32163816,Posted: 3 June,all,Spoiler Alert,"I had to give this one a try just based on reviews alone. For all of you that are saying how awful this game is, first let me remind you that this game is under $5 and, speaking from a development standpoint, is worth at least $10 as a token of telling the developer ""thank you"". So, at its current price point, I am going to assume this was released as a ""teaser"" of sorts to get more people noticing them as a VR developer. I took notice, and so have all of you. In this sense, this was a success.Now, onto the game itself. It's not horrible, but it's not good either. It looks more like an interactive technical demo. Yes, the scale is way off. Yes, the voice acting is terrible (Devs, if you are reading, I do voice acting I'd be happy to replace your voiceovers for free!) and the shooting segments are boring. But again, if you are complaining about a game that you just got for free or for less than the price of a cup of coffee, you should maybe look more into a new job or calm your sense of entitlement a little bit.This game is DEFINITELY worth a try and DEFINITELY worth $2!Also the description ""An interactive movie with a gripping story and elements of a shooter."" is accurate, minus the gripping story part, but most of the failed story is because of the voice acting and bad game script. I mean come on, ""get away from me, monsters"" isn't exactly gripping. It IS, however, an interactive movie with elements of a shooter.They did not misrepresent, but did not deliver the ""gripping"" element.The immersion is good, would be better if the scale was more accurate. If you want to experience yourself as a 12 foot tall titan, this game can do that for you. It's a very short play. Probably good for when a friend comes over and you want to introduce them to VR. The controls are very simple, so it would allow nearly anyone to experience VR.I just wanted to say give it a try. Making games isn't simple. They should not have released this yet in its current state, but they probably have another game coming out and wanted to push this out to put themselves on the radar.Developers are people too and they have to keep the lights on."

,Not Recommended,594730,31804527,Posted: 17 May,all,[RIP] SpaceBaldy,"Played on the Vive but has options for other mainstream VR HMDs and without VR which is becoming a good trend with developers.Far Space is interative movie rather than a game as it's very linear and waits for a selection of an option prior to triggering a set sequence. Impending doom? Go make a cup of tea whilst you think about it then select the option. Ah...'Death'...select the other option (after a slice of cake, walking the dog etc..). Even though the game is set in space in zero gravity everything moves with the speed of an ice age which removes the suspense of escaping from a space station.Selecting options is via the 'look method' rather than using the Vive controllers with usually only a single option (e.g. jump forward...or what?).On the plus side, graphics are generally good quality although selected options do lead to some crazy camera moves which are likely to be unpopular with those that don't yet have ther VR legs.The shoot 'em up sections comprises 'look targetting' the same three aliens over and over again like a deranged pigeon (especially during the loooong the first section). If I was to do the same in a spacesuit the inside of the faceplate would be coated in breakfast chunks.Voice acting contains all the emotion of wet concrete dosed with tranquillisers (its the same slow monotone voice for all the characters). Don't think I've laughed as hard in ages so worth the £0.95 / $1.20 to me just for that."

It's an Early Access game, so expect a short experience (20 minutes or so).  I did experience some mild vertigo in the game and had to take a break after the 3rd level.  But I was able to complete the rest of the game OK.  The visuals are definitely above average.  One of the better examples of a VR game allowing you to see most of your body and it looked realistic.  Gameplay is about as simple as it gets in VR with no controls -- you use only your head to point to story options and for some easy combat.  Essentially it's a choose-your-own-adventure, but it's a nice change from most VR games.  The story might be intruiging, but you'll have to use your imagination, since there's just a couple dozen lines of dialogue and not much exposition.  But it was worth the $1.19 I spent, because I like to support these kinds of early efforts.  Hopefully more will be added in the future."

,Not Recommended,594730,32491515,Posted: 16 June,all,Sho_36,This game was disoreinting beyond all time. This game had so little content i litteraly beat it in twenty minutes and almost threw up whislt playing it. I almost fell asleep on multiple occasions. very confusing with little no direction or backstory. this game could be something with a little work. not worth the 2 dollars i paid.

This game has some really impressive graphices unfortunitly has very little playability behind it there is to little driving the experiance though I hope they keep trying to make the game MORE becouse it could be better in time.  Although it made me laugh my A%% off playing the game???? and it gets a thumbs up for that Retro 60s Si Cerial Trailer feel...I will try it again just to laugh again!! HaHa Haaaaaaaaaa
