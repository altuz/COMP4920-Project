,Recommended,595140,32490515,Posted: 16 June,all,Ottomic,"Immortal Redneck is a curious beast. Behind a name that certainly evokes thoughts of shovelware or joke game one can find a pastiche of the best elements in otherwise disparate games and makes them work surprisingly well despite not bringing anything new to the table in and of itself.First, let's start with a pleasing presentation, with cartoonish graphics and enemies (sorta reminds me of Paladins), wherein the player needs to carve his way through a myriad of procedurally generated rooms, through mainly ranged combat. It is heavily reminiscent of Ziggurat in that sense, although the levels are, in my opinion better designed since they are more vertical, it relies less on melee enemies bumrushing the player, and the weapons make the combat more fast paced and, thanks to the ability to carry 3 to 4 weapons at the same time and the abundant drops the player will find room after room, more varied and tactical. The game is structured in three pyramids with 7 floors in each, the first ones being larger and as such having potentially more stuff than the latter ones, with a miniboss and a boss on each pyramid.On the sound side the music is a nice mixture of guitars and banjos and drums mixed with what we could call ""Egypt themed movie musical score"", and the protagonist easily stands out, commenting on many of the enemies and weapons with quips that make him pretty fun and likeable.There are several unlockable classes to the player's disposal, and each comes with a fixed loadout of weapons, a passive skill, and an active skill one can cast at no cost after a brief cooldown, some offensive and some defensive although imo of varying degrees of utility. On top of that there's the scrolls, which can contain power ups or power downs, some incredibly useful and some monumentally annoying. They are a point of contention along most reviews of the game, but overall they push the player to make the best of a given situation, and some of the good ones will cancel some of the bad ones so having a bad streak doesn't mean immediate death. But even if it was it's okay, because you're sort of meant to die anyway.IR features a progressive skill tree one unlocks through the money they have accrued in past runs, very similar to Rogue Legacy's, where the player will gain access to perks as well as new classes, complemented by a shop that, while not as extensive as RL's, will allow him to further purchase starter scrolls and medallions.What really makes Immortal Redneck a treat to play though, is a polished to a shine movement system, very reminiscent of the FPS games of yesteryear (or Doom '16), that will allow the player to zoom around the environment, ledge grabbing, double jumping and making the most out of every gun at their disposal, and their environments.There's a few negatives about it, though. I found the classes rather unbalanced and generic since most if not all of them use perks that can be gained through scrolls, and some feel much more effective than others. The game is also rather short and a bit repetitive, and it's not something one will dump hundreds of hours into unless they just play for the hell of it, because the pyramids themselves are on the easy side most of the time.Overall, I guess one could call IR a derivative game, but it's an example of why that term isn't necessarily bad. Albeit very few things about it are original, the game plays great, stays entertaining death after death and it's safe to assume one will easily get 15-20 hours out of it, easy, and every one of those hours will be thoroughly enjoyable. 8/10."

This is a really fun, smooth controlling and challenging shooting game. The only downside is that it relies a little bit too much on grinding gold to upgrade your players stats to simply survive later in the game.I can see it taking upwards of 20 or even 30 hours to complete the entire thing and unlock everything the game has on offer, so even with the small problems it has, that's good value.Full video review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHe0OBDCY1Q"
,Recommended,595140,31441583,Posted: 29 April,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Oh yeah,Immortal Redneckis great fun and definitely improves upon theZigguratformula.In my humble opinion, the FPS roguelite genre is severely lacking quality titles - andZigguratwas one of the few that got it right.Immortal Redneckis largely the same thing, with some better level design, and interesting enough theme, and super tight controls. The permanent upgrade system is exactly likeRogue Legacy, and the rewards are frequent enough to not feel too grindy yet offer plenty of high quality gaming hours.Pros:+Looks beautiful on my gaming rig, and plays really well on my low-end laptop+Super tight controls and great FPS gameplay+Rogue Legacy-inspired permanent upgrade system works well with frequent rewards to keep me hooked+Quite polished overallCons:-Yeah I give it points for an interesting and unique theme - but it is an odd choice if you ask me; rednecks in Egypt? At very first glance I thought of devs going diving into a bargain bin at the asset store-Music is decent, albeit forgettableThe price is high - but I definitely thing it's worth it if you enjoyedZiggurat."
,Recommended,595140,31364894,Posted: 25 April,all,「Mentle」ゴ,"Immortal Redneck is fast, fun, addictive, and hard. So very hard.A fine mixture of Ziggurat and Doom, it still stands well on its own, even without those games in mind.Each unlockable class has its own pros and cons and span across many playstyles, and each weapon has its own unique traits.The game runs amazingly, and is well optimized.This game is definitely worth the price tag."
,Recommended,595140,31453138,Posted: 29 April,all,JulianR94,"One thing straight away: I was very skeptical going into this, and having watched popular YouTube critic TotalBiscuit's video on the game made me even more skeptical. For those of you that did not watch it; he didn't like it very much, mainly because of the weak weapon feedback and too large rooms and floors. And, yes, I do agree with most of what he brought forward.However, and this is a message I would like to pass on to all of you reading my impressions here, you absolutely HAVE to form your own opinion on this. Don't just take even an opinion like TB's as literally ""god's word"". A rogue-lite FPS like this will be inherently divisive. Weapon feedback will be inherently divisive. I myself am totally fine with both the Doom approach where enemies come to pieces, but also this one here where the enemies simply fall without gore effects.So, if you are intrigued by the FPS/rogue-lite combo, try this game for two hours. If you don't like it by then, get a refund. Quick and easy.Me, though... Oh, I am totally having a blast with this! Actually am very surprised how much I enjoy the combat,when the gunplay especially feels so underwhelming.But, this aside, the actual combat itself, the way you jump around like an absolute motherf*cker as you shoot your enemies to dust with Flareguns, Rocket Launchers, Pistols, Assault Rifles, and so on, feels amazing! It actually gives me some Quake vibes, if you can believe it.And I think that, as soon as the devs will improve the gunplay (which they have promised to do and is planned to come soon), this game will be even more fun.The performance is brutal. Brutally good! And this is Unity! I know, right? Almost unbelievable to see something good made using that engine once in a while.I am seeing 300fps (minimum I had in combat was 120fps while broadcasting) on maximum settings at 1080p on my fairly high-end system (refer to my profile for specs), and the options are plentiful, also for sound and controls and HUD. FOV up to 140, 4k UI scaling... There is nothing left to be desired in the menus.The game itself really opens up as soon as you unlock the other classes. The main problem right now is that the class you start with, the standard Redneck, feels very subpar compared to the lightning-bladed class, the decoy & kill ninja class or the long-distance sniper class, or any of the other 5 classes there are (9 classes in total).Now, before each now run you will have to decide between two of all the classes you have unlocked, so there is a bit of RNG to it. Right now, you don't get to decide if you want to play as only a single class. But, generally speaking, this also means that every run is different in the way you fight, in addition to the semi-procedual nature of the environment. Though this also is a negative, as there are some classes that evidently struggle in the boss fights.I would have to go much deeper into the tiniest details to really convey to you what I think of this game, because it is by no means ""the best FPS ever"" or my ""favorite game"", but I am still having loads of fun with it. So here's a quick list of pros and cons, for now.+ performance is excellent, you should be able to run this at 60fps+ even on a laptop+ very colorful, great style (you would think pyramids were dusty and dark here, but they are full of colors and interesting enemies)+ extremely satisfying, fast-paced combat = good aiming is rewarded here+ the whole Redneck theme is so random and unfitting that it genuinely is funny+ some weapons actually feel great, like the electrocuting laser-pistol (Tesla Coil) that really hits hard and even has an AoE of sortsbut...-most guns lack punch, i.e. the Minigun and especially the Redneck class shotgun feel kinda awful at the moment(HEAVILY IMPROVED NOW)- rooms and floors sometimes really are too large for their own good, as in: enemies seem too sparsely placed there-Redneck class is in need of some serious buffing (first impressions, people! This is bloody important! You start with that class and are stuck with it for a few runs.)IMPROVED- some rooms quickly get repetitive. I have seen the room filled with acid at least once in every of my runs!-add to the last point, the enemies are always placed the same in the rooms, this takes away the surprise you are supposed to get when entering such a room(IMPROVED)- you need to tweak some game options. Turn off auto-weapon pickup, for example!-As mentioned above, boss fights can be extremely hard with the ""wrong"" class(IMPROVED, MORE WEAPON PICKUPS NOW)I'm sure I will have missed out on some things I would've liked to mention. And I'm sure the negatives seem to outweigh the positives, even though I consider the majority of them fixable and not impeding the fun there is to be had.But again, just try it for yourselves. At the very least, keep a good eye on this one! If you're really unsure, wait until the devs have worked a bit on this, then give it a shot. At around summer, I reckon, this game will have heavily improved.I hope this was helpful to you. If it was, consider rating it as such, or even visiting my curator page ""RaptorSpecter's Impressions"", where I will try to share my concise thoughts on a wide variety of games. :)UPDATEafter now 20 hours of recorded playtime:So then, I think in the time I invested into the title I made a couple more discoveries that I would like to share with you guys. I have not yet finished the game, but gotten to the first boss of the 3rd and (for now?) final pyramid. That means I have pretty much seen 90% of what the game has to offer now.And I still like it! In fact, perhaps even more so than before. Let me add a few more things to the bullet points from above.+ aesthetic, gets another plus point from me. The second and third pyramid feature some genuinely cool artstyles. Steampunk-ish and cyberpunk-ish, let's just say. I don't want to spoil anything more, but as weird as these two styles seem in combination with the egyptian theme, in my humble opinion it works out nicely.+ music. While, as other people already stated, the soundtrack is by no means worthy of an award, it still manages to sound cool, fitting to the scene and get you pumped in and in between the many room battles+ enemy variety. Some enemies will appear in all three pyramids, but especially in the 3rd you will encounter some really weird foes. And I think all of them are neat. Except one (two, but they only have different colors). These flying blockfaces á la Minecraft. Sounds weird to you? Will be even worse if you see them for yourselves. These dudes I find irritating and really unfitting.- some of the scrolls... Oh boy... Yeah, I really feel like there are a few utterly stupid ones. There is, of course, the scroll that makes you lose all but a single weapon, which can be infuriating, but is mostly not that horrible. What I found horrible was the scroll that turns the entire game font into hieroglyphs. Seriously, I am not kidding. That also goes for your ammo count, btw, which is a♥♥♥♥♥♥move in a first person shooter. I realize there is a bit of trolling involved, and it was funny for a few rooms, but as soon as you mess up your reloads because you cannot make out how much ammo you have left, overall and in your clip, that's where it starts to bug me immensely. I am of the belief that you should be compensated in at least a minor, clever way when picking up such a scroll.UPDATE:Scrolls have been improved, negatives are still punishing but they are more balanced and add challenge to the gameplay instead of fu**ing you over."

,Recommended,595140,35045169,Posted: 18 September,all,Chewyy,"If you look at the market for Rogue-like/lite FPS games there isn’t really a lot going on. There are classics like Ziggurat, Tower of Guns, Heavy Bullets and more recent attempts like Strafe. Overall this genre feels pretty niche though and that’s really a shame, because it can be so good if done right. And this is where Immortal Redneck comes in. It takes a lot of ideas of other games in the genre and manages to improve on them.After an incident, our protagonist from Kansas finds himself in the ancient Egypt. Luckily, he brought some guns with him to fight the enemies that wait there. At the beginning of a run you start at the bottom of a pyramid and fight your way through 7 floors until you reach the top. There are bosses, chest rooms, challenge rooms, everything you would expect a Rogue-like to have. In total there are 3 pyramids, each with their own unique design, rooms and enemies. They can also be seen as some sort of difficulty selection, since the pyramids get progressively harder. I love how each pyramid got its own unique feel. There was clearly a lot of work put into the interior design of each pyramid and they all look fantastic.A good Rogue-like also needs variety, would get boring if every run feels the same, right? To provide that, there are 9 characters to choose from, each with different abilities and stats, aswell as numerous weapons and scrolls you can find in the pyramid. The scrolls are the only pickup, next to weapons, that alter your gameplay. They can improve movement, change up your weapon stats or take your weapons away. It’s sort of a risk reward system. Should I take the scroll and maybe get an advantage? It could also be one that makes the run a lot more difficult.Now to another point why I love this game so much. The movement. Its fast paced (and by fast I mean really fast), tight and exactly how it should be. The fast movement speed combined with the ability to jump multiple times gives you a freedom of movement I only remember from older FPS games. For some reason jumping around rooms in sonic speed with some funky music in the background is insanely fun to me and that’s probably what makes this game so good.So, what do you get with Immortal Redneck after all? A polished game, with fantastic movement, beautiful artstyle and a bunch of replayability. At this time it’s by far my favorite contender in the genre and I would recommend it to anyone that likes some good, fast-paced FPS action."

The weapons are both creative and fun to use. The game itself is very beautiful and had no issues with frame rates.Honestly the only cons I have towards this game is the random element of the scrolls ingame can make a playthrough almost impossible and the game can feel a little grindy at times, but in all honesty I find its a good trade off compared to other AAA titles that are over in 4 to 6 hours that are nowhere near as enjoyable as Immortal Redneck."
,Recommended,595140,32834280,Posted: 26 June,all,UNIT 220 | tipofthehats.org,"First and foremost I'd like to establish that this is an amazing game. I've always been fond of roguelikes and rogue-lites, but spend the vast majority of my time in movement based shooters like UT, Quake, and most of all TF2. This game merges those two genres together to make, what feels like, something made uniquely just for me. Bouncing around the rooms quickly dispatching the enemies within feels great, and once you make it to the end of your run you can build your character to suit your playstyle better. At the time of this writing I am running a speed/cit build that makes a bunch of money each go, which is really fun and rewarding.This game also made me start streaming. Never before had I been interested in streaming my gameplay, but I (easily) set up the twitch integration for this game and I don’t see myself going back. My viewers get to vote on the scrolls (buffs and debuff) that drop on my during my run. This makes for a great “co-op” experience where your chat is helping you out, but I’ve also had all my friends and the randoms in chat turn on me by blinding my ability to see my crosshairs, hp, and prevented me from double jumping. It was one of my most fun runs! I was constantly having to adapt my playstyle to combat the debuffs being thrown my way, but I still made it very far! I say download OBS studio and join in on the fun!"

The result is Immortal Redneck, an admitedly oddly-named Rogue-Lite FPS that combines several of the best aspects of games to come before it, and is a praiseworthy first foray by its dev into non-mobile gaming. Take the brisk movement, combat and diverse loadouts of Ziggurat, combine it with the money-based persistent progression of Rogue Legacy, and sprinkle it with the bizarre sensibilities of Serious Sam and you have a recipe for a pretty good time."

I repent with my immediate purchase.I've spent a paltry few hours playing Immortal Redneck and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Immortal Redneck is incredibly well done and deserves some seriously positive recognition. Immortal Redneck isn't perfect, of course, but it's definitely the type of shooter that anyone wanting to make a shooter should look at and understand (not just copy). If you need a mashup summary of games, think Serious Sam + Redneck Rampage and all of the elements of Rogue Legacy except done well and not in the form of a boring grind.There are so many little things that the developer hit:The Redneck himself is funny and cocky, but not ear-gratingThere are so many crazy guns (some familiar, some not) that are all worth a damn to use, but there are still obvious upgradesThere's no intense struggle to get gold or ammunition at any point past the first few roomsHealth isjustscarce enough that it is legitimately possible to balance going rambo and playing smart depending on one's in-game situationMusic is greatThe shop isn't some one-off ""buy this thing once and never use it again"" gameplay aspectThe classes are actually cool and unique and not just separated by purely minute differences (i.e., each one has a variation on a singular ability, one can move faster than the others, etc)Death just makes you want to try again, there's never a layer of BS orartificial difficultysurrounding how the player diesThe scroll power ups/debuffs actually are creative and provide some much needed gamblingDifficulty progressively increases but the rewards and dropped ammo counts increase as wellOf course, the game isn't without its shortcomings:Movement is funky and air control when jumping/falling doesn't always feel right, but most shooters on Unity have this issueGun sounds aren't that great; while the weapons are fun, some don't have that auditory oomph, YMMVRedneck doesn't have a lot of unique one-liners but I guess them's the ropes on an indie budgetSome of the subtitles aren't right (I keep them on since I'll usually have my in-game sound lower after a while to hear friends on VOIP)Some of the rooms are large areas that are dead ends and kind of mess with your murder streak mojoSome of the enemy designs are lackingSome of the scrolls, mostly ones that limit/alter your weapons/weapon count, can kill your mood if the effect is negativeCo-op would honestly be cool for this game if it works like it does in Serious Sam; bump up the enemy count, 1 class/player, go wild.tl;dr - IT'S ACTUALLY FUN, no strings attached, no need to beware. Lots of varied guns, detailed environments, enemies to pour lead into, and even some secrets"
,Recommended,595140,31514270,Posted: 2 May,all,Torus,"What we have here is a first-person shooter rogue-lite thing with cartoony artstyle and some nosense excuse plot about a redneck who is captured by monsters and mummified while on vacation in Egypt, only to break out of his sarcophagus and go on a rampage through some pyramids.You go from room to room, clearing them of enemies and hunting for bonus chests, until you progress up the pyramid and eventually conquer it. Repeat 3 times for 3 different pyramids.I'm enjoying it a lot, it runs nice and smooth, and it gets it's fast-paced retro-insipred shooting done well. Total package is well worth the money in my opinion.Updates for version 1.2, since it includes significant changes:- Gripes about weapons are now mostly non-existant. Updates to sounds effects make them feel more unique (and more powerful where appropriate), updates visual feedback makes shooting the various monsters in the face feel better too.- Class randomization is out. You can now pick any unlocked class/favor at the game's central hub area, and favors that go unused eventually gain stat bonuses.- There are now leaderboards to chase for daily & weekly challenge runs. (These challeges do use the same seed for the randomizer, so everyone gets the same floor layout, scroll & weapon drops etc.)- Also, by now I've seen & beaten all 6 bosses, and only the 2nd boss in the 2nd pyramid is a bit weak. He looks cool, but he's really easy to beat compared to the others.Original more in-depth review below:If you're still reading, lets have a more in-depth look at what makes this tick:- There's a persistent skill tree where you can spend cash you earn during your runs. As nice touch, the tree visibly grows in the game world as you buy things from it. Outside of a bunch of basic stat boosts, and favors from gods (this game's class system) it doesnt' offer too much though, which is a bit of a shame. There's a double-jump ability, a shop where you can spend more cash, but not much beyond that.- Favors/classes do get randomized, and once you have more than 2 you'll get a choice of 2 at the start of each run. Each class has different starting weapons, and different passive and active abilities. It's  a pretty good mix, and forces mixing up playstyles. Unlocking a favor also means the weapons from it's loadout start dropping in the game- The game puts a heavy focus on movement, weaving and dodging as you whittle down the opposition and in some cases. There are also parts that are quite platforming-heavy which I'm normally not too fond of, but which this game particularly does well - largely due to an effective ledge-grabbing mechanism that ensures small missteps don't turn into big problems.It's the feel of this that makes me forgive the game's flaws really.- Weapons have a nice variety, but do fall within FPS stereotypes - pistols tend to be low-damage but accurate, shotgun types scatter, grenades bounce and go boom etc. Weapon drops during a run aren't too common, so you do want to get familiar with the various default loadouts of the different favors/classes. There are some gripes to be had here in the current version: a few weapons just feel off, like the heavy-looking Rusty Revolver, which sounds like the average light pistol.- Enemy design is varied enough both in mechanics and aestethics, and ranged enemies do not use hitscan weapons - anything that is being shot at you, you have a chance to dodge.Still, here too there is reason to gripe: Sometimes the AI falters and enemies fail to engage when you expect them to, and all enemies basically react the same to getting hit - a small bit of stagger and that's it. That feels about right for some of he bigger, tankier opponents, but for others you would expect more effect - such as being able to interrupt enemy attacks with a well-timed shot of your own, or being able to scatter a pack of smaller, weaker enemies if you don't kill them outright.- Scrolls are your main source of boosts, ranging from extra jumps and more defense, to being able to walk on lava without damage, big health boosts etc. and of course there's some weird ones (change gold drops into health drops - nice on the current run, not nice on the long term progression) and just awful ones (spend double ammo, lose all scrolls collected so far, get stuck with only a single weapon until you find new ones..). A bad scroll at an OK time you can usually survive but will still hurt. And a bad scroll at a bad time will make sure that ""you did not reach the apex.""I really do advise disabling automatic scroll pickups in the options, so you can decide if you want to take the risk or not.- Map randomization in this game is a bit basic - It's fixed rooms with mostly fixed enemy placement. And some speedrun/hazard dodging challenge rooms thrown in for variety. The individual rooms are mostly nicely-designed mini arenas though. On the downside, that does mean the surprise wears off relatively fast. But on the plus side, building familiarity is one way that makes advancing through the game easier.Another nice touch is that you travel from the bottom of the pyramid to the top, and floors get smaller as you go along. This also plays into bonuses granted for exploring whole floors, and makes farming the lower, easier floors for more drops a viable tactic.- There's also bosses - one at the halfway point of a pyramid, and one at the top.The 2 I've managed to reach and kill so far were pretty well designed.- Another plus is that the developers are active on the discussion forums, and are working hard to improve the game further. So there are probably a few patches in the future which will hopefully improve the game further."

,Recommended,595140,31411821,Posted: 28 April,all,Doktor Boney,"Immortal Redneck, a true diamond in the putrid disgusting rough that is Steam Greenlight, but oh what a diamond it is.Gameplay- Immortal Redneck does almost nothing new, this isn't a complaint becuase what it does do it does very well, the shooting takes a bit from the old-school fps' like your Dooms and your Wolfensteins, and a big old heaping helping of Serious Sam. Immortal Redneck also features Rogue-Like elements such as the Three pyramids being procedurally generated and the collecting gold to spend on upgrades, making yourself stronger with each death. Immortal Redneck boasts an impressive skill tree that has quite a few different things to upgrade and a lot of them can be upgraded A LOT, like 75 times you can upgrade certain things. The game has 9 classes which change your active ability, starting load-out, and passive ability, different passive abilites can also be obtained by collecting different scrolls throughout the pyramid, these can be both beneficial or detrimental. Shooting in Immortal Redneck often feels very good weapons sound good and shooting enemies feels very impactful, even if the actual death animation for the enemies is a bit weak. Immortal Redneck also contains a very large variety of different weapons and spells to use, at first i was rolling my eyes at the FPS box-standard, ""Pistol, Shotgun, Grenade, ayy Macarena!"" I was then promptly shut right up when the game started giving me Ankh's that shot other magic Ankh's, A electric pistol that bounced from enemy to enemy, and a sodding machine gun crossbow, A MACHINE GUN CROSSBOW!Sound- The sound design in this game is brilliant, Highly reccomend you pick up the soundtrack. The enemies all sound like they fit their design, the music can be both exciting and ambient all while keeping reminiscent of the Egyptian theme. My only real complaint in this department is the voice actor for our protagonist the Redneck, as somebody who grew up in the American south I can 100% say this guy sounds NOTHING like an actual redneck. That said some of the quips thrown out are very accurate, others not so much. Speaking of quips, a small nitpick I had is that sometimes this game falls to the ""Spider-man game"" problem in that the constantly quiping character gets a bit annoying, but this isn't as bad of an issue thanks to the sheer variety of quips. Another samll bug bear of mine is that soem of the subtitles don't match the audio, a quick patch should take care of this pretty easy.Graphics/Design- This is one of my favourite aspects of this game, the developers were very clearly going for a Serious Sam style desgin, and boy did they succeed. The mix of Egyptian style and Toony styles works very well, all the rooms look incredible, The weapons all look very unique going for a mix of styles, from wooden, almost hadn crafted looking weapons to futuristic lightining weapons. I'd like to give special mention to the enemy designs. All the enemies stand out and look very unique to each other. They almost all keep true to the Egyptian/Cartoon style and have almost a LoL and DOTA style to the design, and it works very well, once again highly reccomend picking up the artbook.Misc.- As with most Indie fully-3D projects this game isnt without bugs, a few times i found myself clipping beside or through platforms or in some scenery, nothing a quick patch can't fix however.Conclusion- Despite some slightly cringey lines and a few bugs here and there Immortal Redneck offers an addicting and satisfying old-school FPS wrapped in a nice Rogue-Lite package that can suplex you into next week and still have you coming back for more, all for 20 bucks.9/10 - Must Buy"

I'm really impressed this is apparently these devs' first PC game. They deserve recognition for this effort and I hope this game does well. This is totally worth the reasonable asking price. The whole thing just oozes care and the passion of the devs is obvious. Most importantly it's super fun to play.Everything just worked right away for me. 21:9 resolution? No problem. Loads up right the first try. Tons of options in the settings menu. Proper FOV slider with a wide range. Runs perfect on my system. Very smooth. Controls feel awesome. Just so slick. So why can't all games run this well?? ""AAA"" devs take note!In terms of gameplay, the game does a great job of conveying a certain retro feel of a really polished shooter with tight controls, quick movement and frantic action. Interesting 3 dimensional level design that interacts with enemy types in smart and sometimes surprising ways. And retro in the sense of lacking any pretense of 'serious' context. The story is so simple it may as well not be there. No dumb cutscenes, apart from the super short one that sets up the intro. Just a cool and surprisingly engaging premise that gets out of the way of the super fun gameplay. Reminds me of games I played in the 90s, not at all a feeling I get very often anymore. And yet it also feels modern with well executed colorful graphics and nice lighting.To be critical I'd say the guns sound and consequently feel a bit tinny, but honestly I don't really care when I'm having so much fun with the gameplay and exploring the levels. The progression system is engaging me so far and I'm interested to keep trying to get further in.Overall I like this way more than I expected and it's already one of my favorite games this year so far."

,Recommended,595140,34157109,Posted: 10 August,all,Melgoof,"This game is pretty good. Finished it numerous times over and over. I loved the sense of speed in this game. Unlike many other rogue-likes, going from point A to B is incredibly fast which gives insentive to keep going, giving it ""one or seven more tries"". The weapons in the game are fun to use and master but in the end of the day there will always be that one or two weapons that blows everything away. Enemies in the game vary from easy to damn annoying (just like any other game). Some of the boss fights are challenging but does not take too many tries to figure out the strategies to succeed. To help you through runs, a neat feature allows you to use medallions (side-perks?) which are unlocked when found in the pyramids. They either affect the character or the pyramid itself. This game has lots of replayablity and a fat skill tree. All in all, it was a great time killer and I enjoyed it thoroughly."

,Recommended,595140,31950538,Posted: 25 May,all,sodap,"Immortal Redneck is an FPS roguelite with superb platforming gameplay. The game starts slow but after warming up with your first runs you will be hooked by the frantic gameplay and the gorgeous visuals and atmosphere inside the pyramids, the crazy designs of the enemies, and a gameplay that demands some skills from the player beyond circle strafing.Unlike other games of this genre, Immortal Redneck requires a degree of good aiming and mobility, and it utilizes that to create a platforming gameplay that is among the best I've ever tried in any FPS game, with an element of verticality that really spices up everything.Random drops and different classes to play offer enough variety to keep you entertained every run, the game can be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times with the RNG, though, but it only adds to the fun. There's enough content to spend dozens of hours on this game, I have never felt tired of repetition, because learning the rooms and making new strategies to clear them adds another extra layer. Actually I think there might be too many challenge runs, because I almost never get to repeat and practice them so after playing 20~ hours I still sucked at solving those.The music is just incredible and pumps me up every single time, it's a perfect match to the fast gameplay and the great mood and visuals.On the negative side, I think the sound effects could be improved and maybe the game starts too slow, it gets much better after the first couple of hours.Last but not least, the developer Crema has been listening to the community and updating the game consistently since day1, improving on aspects that weren't that great at launch, but right now after a couple of revisions, the game is just amazing, even more for an $20 indie title.In other words I love this game and you should buy it."
,Recommended,595140,33501673,Posted: 13 July,all,sleepy_worm,"Anyone who has ever loved both Quake and Rogue Legacy should try Immortal Redneck.  This game is deep, competently designed, and extremely rewarding.  The controls are responsive and designed for movement-focused FPS gunplay.  It rewards situational awareness and some twitch ability over circle strafing and hiding behind cover, for the most part, but all of those skills are necessary to do well.If the theming or voice-acting puts you off, I highly encourage you to give it a shot and turn the voice volume down to zero.  This game is an absolute treasure and I am very happy I gave it a shot."
,Recommended,595140,31820754,Posted: 18 May,all,ArtificialRaven,"Immortal Redneck is a rogue-lite first person shooter along the lines of Ziggurat but with its own strengths and weaknesses. Keyboard & mouse are the preffered devices to play this with. I haven't tried it with a gamepad so I can't say how well it controls with that. Runs at a smooth 60fps with my current i5 & gtx 1060 rig in 1080p with settings on maximum. Probably will run pretty good on lower end systems too.  The music is a nice mix of southern themes mixed with egyptian ones with some metal thrown in there every now and then. It feels unique.You play as a Redneck who somehow got captured and mummified after he was knocked unconcious from a dune buggy accident in a desert. You'll wake up in the hub area, which has 3 pyramids, one of them you can enter for now. The pyramid layouts are procedurally generated  and arranged differently with each new attempt and have quite a decent sized variety of room layouts and types. Most of the rooms will be arenas where you have to kill all the enemies to unlock the doors and proceed to the next room. Occasionally you'll find treasure rooms that have a treasure chest or two or three or challenge rooms where certain requirements must be met to open the treasure chest at the goal, such as not taking damage or reach the chest within the time limit. When you want to progress to the next floor you need to find a room with an ascending staircase. If the room has something special in it like a challenge or staircase, it will be marked on your mini-map for easier reference later in case you want to explore the rest of the floor.  In the first pyramid, there are a total of 7 floors. On the 3rd floor is a mid-boss while on the 7th you will fight the end boss of the pyramid. I've recently beaten the game and all 3 pyramids have an entirely different aesthetic with all new room layouts and enemies.The Immortal Redneck gets plenty of help in this undertaking to clear the pyramids. There is an extensive literal skill tree that will look familiar if you've played Rogue Legacy. Every time you enter the pyramid you have to offer all your gold to the gods and go in empty. When you die you will bring the gold you earned back out to the hub and you can spend it on that skill tree to unlock stat upgrades, new Favors (classes), a merchant and other special abilities. Favors are class/playstyle oriented loadouts with their own positive/negative strengths and weaknesses, unique active and passive traits and starting weapons. An example, Apis, the God of Strength; high health and attack and comes with 4 powerful weapons and a temporary invincibility active skill. But he's slow and only able to jump once. Since there is a lot of verticality to the level design, you have to decide if his attack and beefiness are worth crippling your speed and mobility. There are plenty of classes that will fit your playstyle so hopefully you should find one that fits you. Once you start unlocking classes, at the start of each run you get to choose one of the 3 randomly selected classes you've unlocked, with the ability to reroll the choices if you unlocked the skill on the tree. The merchant you unlock sells medallions you can equip that have their own pros and cons however you need to find their blueprints within the pyramids first.There are over fifty different weapons and knowing when to use each weapon is crucial. As crucial as it is to always keep moving and remembering to use your active skills. But not only do you get those, you can randomly find Scrolls either dropped from enemies or from treasure chests. Scrolls make a HUGE difference in how your run will play out.  There are three different tiers of scrolls, bad, neutral and good. Bad would be a scroll that makes it so you're stuck with one weapon until it runs out of ammo. Neutral being something like...your weapons now have less max ammo but they do a lot more damage. Good being a scroll with no cons to it, like being able to take no damage from poison or lava hazards. Sure, if you get a bad scroll you can just die and move on to the next run. But I learned it was also fun to play around that disability and see how much more gold I could squeeze out by the end, even if I didn't think I'd make it to the end boss.The only negative thing I can say of this game is the gunplay needs some serious updating, which is currently being addressed by the devs. I've seen people complain that once you've played long enough, the room layouts can be repetetive but the way I see it, playing them enough to add to muscle memory just makes each run go that much smoother. But as I said, right now, the weapon sounds and animations don't pack that much of a punch. There is also much more being worked on and added which you can see in the Roadmap thread in the steam discussions for this game.This is currently one of my favorite rouge-lites and I haven't had this much fun playing one since Binding of Isaac and Rogue legacy. I highly recommend this game."

Alot of the same sort of enjoyment you'd get from Ziggurat and Unloved.Wide variety of enemies, weapons and tiles.The tiles (rooms) esspecially stand out, as they come in all shapes, sizes and layouts. Everything from squat, cramped corridors and vertical towers to large open multi-floored arenas. As far as I can tell the tiles have predetermined enemy spawns, so there's little RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Some rooms are clearly best dealt with in certain ways, which is a great change of pace from the typical - randomly generated X game - that mindlessly vomits any sort of monster pack into a space ill designed for should a cluster♥♥♥♥.Also with all the clutter, statues and nick-nacks strewn about the place make it a pleasant environment to blast apart monsters.

76561197974445385,Recommended,595140,31405944,Posted: 27 April,all,Betwixt,"First sitting and 3 hours in. I am loving this game. It takes the great things from it's obvious influences, and does it right. It's not perfect, but compared to it's seniors it does everything so well. Anyone who is a fan of the Rogue Like genre. While also enjoying the FPS Rogue Likes out there. You'll enjoy this one. If you're on the fence about FPS Rogue Like, give this one a shot.Most likely I will update my review around 20 hours or so if my feelings change._____________________________________________________________Early Post Edit: Just finished Total Biscuit's ""WTF is?"" review.This will be long as I want to give my opinion on what he's said. Some things I agree with, but most I don't agree with. Love TB and I've been enjoying his content for many years now. His reviews of most Rogue-Like games seem to always be coming from someone who doesn't enjoy the genre at all. So his opinion is fine, I just hope it doesn't hurt the sales of this game. Because of a few bad runs..._____________________________________________________________1 : ""Unfun/Anemic Gun Play""I partially agree with this. There are no decals, there is no blood, sometimes knowing if an enemy is indeed dead can take a second. These aren't a huge issue but true. However some of the weapons you aquire, as well as some scrolls, can drastically improve this. Just like Gungeon, there are guns that no one wants. But there are some really amazing and FUN ones you can find. The starting guns are under powered, but that's how it usually is...He talks about unlocking additional classes, and how the first few runs can feel difficult or un-fun. I was able to unlock the first class after my first run... So yeah... And the first class is not that bad. His active can make quick work of bosses and tight rooms._____________________________________________________________2: ""Scrolls and Weapon Lock Scroll. Makes it boring.""I disagree with this. There are some really aweful scrolls that can really challenge your awareness and make you change your playstyle. Like taking damage if you jump while in air (double jump, or falling off ledge and jumping.), or jars/breakables explode when destroyed. Even one that turns all gold into health drops, which honestly ISNT A GOOD THING!. But there are also some good to ♥♥♥♥ing awesome scrolls as well. From his tree I can tell he didn't play much... And he hasn't even beat the first boss. (how I know I will address further down.) So critiquing a rogue-like off of a few bad runs is a bit unfair._____________________________________________________________Most of these upcomming points are common in rogue-like games._____________________________________________________________3: ""Level Design: Never Rewarding.""There are rooms with ""secrets"" where you can find 1-2 chests hidden. I've found them in every floor. Which can grant you scrolls or weapons sometimes both. Making clearing and searching very rewarding._____________________________________________________________4: ""Never anything to point you in the right direction.""Being pointed in the right direction... What Rogue-like does... Seriously? There are items to point you in the right direction. Just like every other Rogue-Like..._____________________________________________________________5: ""Cannot leave area till enemies cleared, and mindless enemy A.I. Hard to seek out remaining mobs. Making you endlessly hunt the remaining enemies.""This one is just silly. Yet again, what Rogue-Like lets you leave the area before enemies are cleared...? However there are some A.I. that will mindlessly run away/around. But that number is very few. And just like Ziggurat after a duration of time the enemies appear Red.""_____________________________________________________________6: ""Rare Meaningful Drops after fights.""This one I completely disagree with. Every enemy seems to have a small chance to drop a scroll or weapon. Again, I just think TB had a few bad runs... Each run I get around 4-8 new weapons before the first boss, and plenty of scrolls._____________________________________________________________7: ""No variety in scrolls, and too many negatives.""I know I already addressed this a bit, but he states it a few times. There are many different scrolls that do more than boost stats. There are a lot of negatives. Most of them just shift your play-style. Making you adapt to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation. The game ""DESYNC"" Challenge Floors are like this but can be far worse._____________________________________________________________8: ""1 new gun per run.""Touched on this, but he states it a few times again. He had a few bad runs. Or he didn't explore. There are chest rooms with 1-3 chests in them. While also a few secret hidden chests on the map. I've had well over 15 different guns so far. Each completely different from the last._____________________________________________________________9: ""Challenges too rare.""I've have two challenge rooms on one floor. There seems to be at least on on every floor. Just like Ziggurat. Or just like seceret rooms in other games._____________________________________________________________(Near the end he gets Magic Hands and thinks they are cool.) Funny~_____________________________________________________________10: Skill Tree uninteresting?The skill tree is very much like Rogue Legacy. I sort of agree. With what I've currently unlocked in additional branches. It's a bit underwhelming and could use a bit more love. But that's to say I haven't even unlocked every branch. There could be a whole lot more that I haven't seen yet._____________________________________________________________11: ""Most of your time restarting your run. Seeing the same first level again, and again.""This is what told me he hasn't even beat the first boss (also he doesn't have the medal for it.) Once you get the medal you can start on the floor right after the first boss. If you don't care to run the first few floors over and over. I believe it also negates the negative/positive effects aquired on each floor. (not 100% sure thought)_____________________________________________________________To close I hope TB gives it a second look in the future. There are a few subjective opinions that he has, that will never change I am sure. But Immortal Redneck is genuinly a fun game."

Immortal Redneck strongly improves upon the roguelite FPS foundation that Ziggurat excelled at, featuring a wide variety of room types, enemies, and character classes (God Favours, as they are called). The game lightly draws upon some aspects of Egyptian Mythology when it comes to the Gods - not entirely a pure representation but still decent enough.Graphics are amazing but could be optimised better. Enemy design is amazing. Controls are responsive and handle damn well. I have to typically run the game in windowed at a lower resolution, though; my frame rate does not remain constantly at 60 FPS, at times struggling to hit that mark.Scrolls basically function like items inThe Binding of Isaac- they can either improve your stats, give you some additional effects/abilities, or can be negative drawbacks. Taking a scroll is equivalent to Curse of the Blind - you won't know what you're getting until you're stuck with it. (In mitigation, you seem to get more good ones than not - but the bad ones can range from mildly annoying to potentially run-ending.)I've had the most success with the game during Twitch mode, which takes the sting out of negative scrolls somewhat - especially if your most ardent fans/friends/viewers vote the positive ones for you (and for that, I'm grateful). Of course, it is also incredibly likely that you will be trolled with a negative scroll by your chat.The hieroglyph scroll is pretty hilarious.When to buyMight be steep, but there's some great replayability in there.

76561198008141314,Recommended,595140,31513828,Posted: 2 May,all,Nyarlathotep,"EDIT: fixed a typo and altered a sentence I didn't like (without changing the context)EDIT 2: not every floor will have 2 exitsThis game is basically FPS version of Rogue Legacy. You fight monsters and collect cash they drop, which you can then spend on upgrading yourself, unlocking new classes, etc. The money you don't spend is instantly removed upon starting new run, so it's advised to spend it all. What really caught my eye was the Egyptian setting, there isn't that many of first person shooters in this style. We need more.Like in every good rougelike you unlock classes, which require different playstyle. For example the Redneck is the basic class which serves as an introduction to the game. Once you've unlocked other ones there's no reason to play as him. The other classes include Apis, Seth, Thoth, etc. You get the idea, each one is stylized after an Egyptian god. Each one has different set of starting weapons and a unique active ability.If you watched the Totalbiscuit's video featuring this game, your opinion might have been a bit negatively colored by it. BUT, there were 2 patches since it's release, which resolve some of the issues he talked about- namely the drop rate of scrolls and weapons. Over the course of 5 hours I've seen about half of the items in this game, which I'd say is good ammount.Now I've mentioned scrolls- these are the spice of your gameplay- they might be good or bad and will turn the tides in your favour or doom your entire run. It's not just stats up, stats down. I'm talking skipping floors, unlimited ammunition, one weapon limit, inability to restore health with food, etc. Also if you're really lucky, you might get a scroll which grants you the option to reject bad scrolls, effectively removing the ""russian roulette"" nature of the scrolls.There is also plenty of creative weapons, which range from a basic redneck shotgun to more exotic stuff like electric flamethrower or a potato launcher. A crossbow machine gun is my favorite so far. The gunplay itself however is not too great, enemies don't turn into swiss cheese after being shot with hundreds of bullets, instead they flash white upon being hit and turn to sand when they die. But the guns will start to get more punch once you've upgraded a bit, so the gunplay actually gets better over time.The pyramid is broken down to several levels. They consist mostly of randomly assembled rooms- arenas, where you fight monsters, treasure rooms and challenge rooms and of course, boss rooms. Also there appear to be 2 exits at every floor, so you don't have to worry about backtracking. Not every floor ends with a boss by the way.In conclusion- it's not without it's share of flaws, but it's actually one of the better rougelike FPS games on the market."
,Recommended,595140,31598725,Posted: 7 May,all,Yaridovich,"9/10Immortal Redneck is definitely one of the best roguelite FPS games available, right up there with Tower of Guns and Ziggurat.How the game works is simple, but made complex by how random the game is. There are 3 pyramids that you have to beat in order and to beat a pyramid you have to traverse through multiple floors of the pyramid, fighting enemies and bosses on the way, along with finding chests and overcoming challenges in challenge rooms. Enemies and chests will drop new weapons or scrolls, which are mostly good, but sometimes also include neutral or bad effects. After you die or defeat a pyramid, you then go back to the outside where you can expend your money on new skills on the skill tree or buying things from the merchant.You start with no ""favours"", playing as the Redneck, who has average stats, an average set of starting weapons, receives more ammo from ammo boxes and can temporarily increase his fire rate. As you unlock new favours from the skill tree, you'll then have access to these favours which change your stats, starting weapons, passive ability and active ability.As mentioned, it's a simple premise, but due to the scrolls you'll find on your way, the game becomes a lot more complex and fun. Scrolls are mostly good and will give you varying benefits like an extra weapon slot, an instant ressurrect if you die, more HP, more max ammo or make you immune to environment damage, whereas neutral scrolls can replace your weapons with random ones or take half of your current HP to give you 2 other scrolls and bad scrolls will give you effects like removing your crosshair, making it so you never stop moving or taking fall damage.How successful a run will be depends not only on the player's skill and the benefits gotten from the skill tree, but also on the effects of said scrolls.But the thing is, even when you do get a bad scroll, it doesn't make the game any less fun - sometimes a single bad scroll can ruin your entire run, but it's still fun as hell to try to roll with the blows as your character never stops moving or has no crosshair to aim. Granted, there is some frustration level when you're doing well during a run and then suddenly that one bad scroll potentially ruins everything, but it doesn't make the game any less fun, specially when you keep on trying to go all the way up to defeat the boss at the top even while you have bad scrolls in effect. (actually, when I first defeated the first pyramid, I had two very bad scrolls in effect and still managed to do it anyway)As there are a lot of upgrades and medallions to buy from the skill tree and the merchant, there are a lot of ways to improve your character, so even if the game feels hard at first, soon it'll feel a lot easier as you get used to the game and improve your character. That is, at least, until you then go to the next pyramid, when you're introduced to new enemies and a higher level of challenge...As for the game's design, the interesting thing is that the three pyramids all look different from each other, each of them having their own style (or theme), so it doesn't feel like you're always seeing the same scenery. Not only that, but the two pyramids after the first one also include new rooms as well.One very interesting feature the game has is a Twitch feature. When it's turned on, enemies and chests will no longer drop scrolls, instead your audience will vote for which scroll you'll get next from a selection of 3 scrolls, so whether you'll do great or terrible will be up to whether your audience wants you to succeed or want to get a chuckle out of seeing you getting screwed. The only downside to this is that it only works if you have at least some audience. If no one votes, you'll automatically get a &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; scroll (doesn't do anything). Also, if the game loses connection to the Twitch servers, it'll automatically return you to the main menu.There is a lot of room for improvement and expansion in the game - more weapons, more pyramids with more enemies, new scroll effects, new favours... I'm really curious to see how the future of this game is going to be.100% recommended."

I dont really call myself a redneck, but then again i like guns, BBQ, hotsauce and i love to tinker on my ride. Then again i also quite like ancient egypt. I engraved my PC Case with Hieroglyphs (My ancient egypt(language aint very good though)) and a few nice motives. So theme wise i feel right at home. Gameplay wise aswell, I played Serious Sam, Doom, Duke Nukem (the good one) and Shadow Warrior 1 (the old one) and 2 (the new one). The movement is spot on, you jump, strafe and run quickly and accuratly. The Gunplay is what many criticise. I also have to say that the guns feel a bit Weak. If there could be an improvement it would be great. Anywhom, the Rogue Light aspect is great. After 9 hours i know most rooms but they are not boring since you learn what enemy types spawn where, and you gradually ""git guda"" The scrolls are a nice Lotto. They range from incremental perks to Crippling debuffs but then sometimes you just find such a Imba scroll combo the game really opens up. So long story short. I dont regret buying and i think i pump quite a few hours into it. Its Oldschool but not an Ultraviolent shooter, people with kids may appreciate that. Buy itAfter 25hrs and close to beating the Third Pyramid, i must say...it still holds up. I can jump in for 5 minutes and have a blast or i can play for 2-4 hrs straight and its not getting old. The new patch certainly improved the game alot and the dev keeps polishing the game as time goes on. Again, buy it!"

While there are plenty of scrolls that can drastically change the way a run goes, (introducing moon gravity or reloading your weapons for you when you switch away from them) quite a lot of the scrolls provide simple stat-ups which do little more than make your run a little easier. I'd like to see more ""game-changer"" scrolls, such as ones that grant entirely new special abilities beyond the ones granted by your chosen deity each run.A custom room generator for players to use and post up onto the Workshop would be fantastic and could provide a lot of extra variety.All told, it's a great game and for the price of a movie ticket and a drink, the 40+ hours of entertainment I got from the game as of the writing of this review are hard to beat."

But the gameplay is quite a bit different. Like any other rogueish games, you'll die...a lot. But, thankfully you can spend your dead currency on upgrades to a literal skill tree to make your next playthrough a bit easier. I found that every game I would play, I would kill about 10 more baddies...consistantly.I haven't made it to the ""apex"" just yet, so I'm not sure what happens then, but I'm workin' on it.If anyone says that the levels are procedurally generated, Imma punch em in the nuts...they are rooms put together randomly, so every game is different.So far I've only encountered a few more than a dozen different guns, but I have a feeling that there are a lot to discover, and they are pretty wacky. The game has fun humor as well; i'm sure this is obvious from watching the trailer.Good game."

After you play a bit you can level up your stats like hp or crit chance and even how much gold drops from the skill tree. Right now there are 3 pyramids with 7 floors and each pyramid has their own set of enemies. So far lots of fun has been had and only just gotten started.

,Recommended,595140,31603607,Posted: 7 May,all,Marcelo Sampaio,"I got myself in an odd position with this game. I watched the TotalBiscuit review, and felt like I had to avoid this game. At the same time, however, something in my head said I should give it a chance. Hell, I wanted a game like Ziggurat, but with guns, and this is exactly what this game is. So I decided to buy it anyways to test it myself. At first, I noticed that I disliked the gunplay a lot. Enemies have no reaction to your shots, most weapons are a bit weaker than they should, reloading takes forever, etc. I also disliked the scroll system at first, and noticed some other issues.I then thought about asking for a refund, but then I noticed something: I couldn't refund because I already played 3 hours of it at that point. 3 hours, but it felt like 5 minutes or so! It was then when I realized I was having so much fun, I just didn't feel the time passage. The flaws ARE there, and they ARE noticeable. But the thing is: the flaws just didn't bothered me as much as I thought they would. Heck, they feel VERY minor while buried below the huge pile of good qualities this game throws at us.And now I have to say it, and I'm gonna shout: THIS IS THE BEST INDIE ROGUELITE I HAVE PLAYED IN A WHILE! The game is just... too fun. It's challenging, frustrating at times. It DOES make me angry sometimes. But it's FUN. Just pure fun.Just like most games in this genre, every map is randomly generated. But this game feels... different. The rooms are usually well made and fun to travel. I'm sure they are a pack of handmade prefabs, but after playing for quite a while, I'm yet to see a map that felt too similar to a previous one. The game has some Rogue Legacy elements, like the progress being mostly related to the money, a limited choice of characters to choose between all the ones you unlocked, being forced to leave all your money behind when you enter the dungeon again (forcing you to ALWAYS do better in every run), and that pleased me a lot. ^^The gameplay is just great. Like I said, the gunplay is quite weak, but not gamebreaking. The areas you traverse are usually bigger than what we are used to ijn games like this, and feature lots of more vertical areas where platforming is needed. And just like the new Doom, you can grab on ledges and get yourself up when you jump, making the platform elements quite fun (instead of frustrating). And the controls are just perfect. It's easy to move around and go exactly where you want. If you fall on a pit of lava, it's due to your own mistakes, not due to the game's controls.The RNG aspect is strong in here. And yes, sometimes you get unlucky to the point you WILL die in a few minutes due to random traits. But a Roguelite without strong RNG is not a real Roguelite, right? The randomness in here never bothered me as much as I thought it would. I died because I got horrible weapons before, I died because of a string of horrible scrolls. But everything felt fun anyways. I just restarted and got better stuff. Luck plays a big part in here, but I don't think this is a bad thing.Lastly, the graphics are surprisingly good. There's nothing amazing looking in here, but the game IS pleasing on the eyes. The sand is beautiful, the reflexive tiles in some rooms are amazing, the weapons are... weird (in a good way, though) and very well animated. Enemies are weird and not very detailed, but are quite well animated. The first boss I fought, for example, has a VERY smooth animation and looks as menacing as a boss that's about to kick my♥♥♥♥♥should. There's nothing amazing-looking here, being an Indie game and all, but I also have nothing to complain about the graphics. And the game runs at a constant 60 FPS (at 1080p) in my not-so-good PC. I would say it's above average compared to other indies. The sound department leaves a bit to be desired, however. The musics are forgettable and there aren't many of them, and the sound effects are just... too quiet. Even a shotgun sounds more like a pea shooting gun in here. That's just a minor issue, but I hope they update it someday.In closing, this game is just amazing. It's flawed, yes, but it's one of those games where the flaws are actually forgotten after a while due to how much FUN the game is. This is one of the best games I've played this year, even when compared with some AAA titles. I HIGHLY recommend it for fans of Roguelite shooters. ^^EDIT: One thing that I also should mention is that this game is FAR from abandoned. It's clear that the developers are listening to the criticisms and patching the game surprisingly fast for an indie game. They REALLY deserve respect, and I'll GLADLY update this review acordingly."

The main character is a mummified redneck who gets lost on vacay or something, its not important, but it is pretty fun. Theres a slightly George W. Bush sounding V.O. that lent a good deal of comedic value to a script thats mainly gun/beer/death references with some Egyptian references for good measure. The gunplay isnt the greatest in the beginning, but you adjust to it. Decent weapon variety as well as a help/hinder system in the form of findable scrolls. Twitch streamers can have their audience vote on which scroll to give the player next. The skill tree is an actual tree, but is loaded with mainly incremental longer term upgrades on the typical statistics. This is also how you unlock the other classes, so pay attention to whats available.Its a very solidly made game that takes some of its cues from the likes of Ziggurat and Rogue Legacy, but has production values to spare in comparison. Unfortunately, better visuals and audio dont make it an automatically superior title to the other two named, but simply in their good company.

,Recommended,595140,31620561,Posted: 8 May,all,BrofessorScales,"Immortal Redneck Review: is it a great rogue like shooter to be compared with ziggurat and tower of guns or does it fall short?PresentationFirst I have to say that Immortal Redneck Looks great, the shaders really work to make the enemies and enviroments pop. The color choices I also find rather good looking and lively. The menu and HUD look really clean and simple which fits really well with the visual style of the rest of immortal redneck. The music sounds alright however there won't be any big standout songs, it does it's job and fits with the setting but it's not something you'd really listen to on it's own.The overall style of immortal redneck is very nice, it has a cartoony feel with it's animations, sound effects and music, but every bit of it's presentation also tie into the desert setting quite well.Technical Fidelitythis is the section I talk about frame rates, stutters and optimization. The game runs great on my ROG strix GL753VE laptop. I have all of the settings on the highest settings and I lower them/remove Vsync when streaming at 1080p60. I get the occasional framerate drop while streaming however when I'm not streaming my framerate never goes below 60 (what I have my FPS cap set at). With older computers you should be able to run this game on Medium-low settings without many issues at all, other than shaders there really isn't much plaguing the framerate at all. Very smooth gameGameplayThis game in my opinion is not one of the greatest Rogue-like shooters around (that would go to either tower of guns or Ziggurat), however this game does have many strong points. Firstly the level layouts are rather nice, with many possible entrances and exits in every room (Minumum of 4 possible exits). The gunplay isn't the best but it definitely works well and the aiming feels fluid and responsive. The god alignments was a neat idea to make character selection both random and interesting, good touch. and in Individual run you can feel a smooth difficultyHOWEVERthere is one sin in this game that holds it back from being the best rogue-like shooter on the market, it has a leveling system very similar to rogue legacy. you can increase stats with in game gold that you pick up on your runs. what this does is make the difficulty curve go downwards and effectively slowly remove challenges from immortal redneck. This heavily hinders the feeling of progression later on in the game when you level tree essentially nerfs everything in the game.  It makes the progression feel less ""earned"" than if there was a challenge based unlock system instead. Although mostly solid, there are a few big cons holding this game back from being absolutely amazing.FunI still had fun in Immortal redneck despite the one big problem I had with it. Immortal redneck gives me that ""one more run"" feeling I love from these rogue-like shooters. All of the levels feel greatly randomized and help the game feel fresh run after run. The different characters can also force you to make a choice in the beginning of your runs. with the amulets you get from getting blueprints, you can change how to your run progresses in interesting and impactful ways. However it's not perfect, I did have some burnout after some runs of Immortal redneck. the saminess that other rogue-likes struggle to lose is also present here, the downwards long term difficulty curve makes the challenge seem too little later on. But although flawed, I enjoyed my time with immortal redneck and will probably enjoy more time with it as well.ValueYou're not getting very much for what you're paying in comparison with other games in the genre. Rogue-likes are tricky to place a value on but I find it's best to do so by comparison. the two rogue-like (Ziggurat and Tower of Guns) shooters I mentioned earlier are cheeper than immortal redneck by a significant margin at 14.99 US Dollar each. They both have upwards difficulty curves and instead of improving stats, you're unlocking tools to make your runs more varied and in some cases better. this comes into play because someone like myself would be playing games with that unlock system more over something like immortal redneck and since all 3 games have similar playstyles and both TOG and ziggurat just execute it better for a cheaper price, it is reasonable to say you're getting more value with those games.BUTas a game in it's self you are getting about 20-40 hours of somewhat repititious gameplay for 20 dollars. most of those hours will be fun and you will get your money's worth. despite me prefering other games in both gameplay and value, immortal redneck does have a decent price on it.VERDICTImmortal redneck is a solid Rogue-like shooter with many elements of randomness and distinctness that makes each run feel fresh and fun, it has a great presentation that helps immortal redneck feel crisp and clean as well as drive home the desert setting of the game. it also runs beautifully on my gaming laptop. the FPS elements of immortal redneck feels great and fluid, with a wide variety of enemies to keep the rooms feel varied. However it is also hindered by both monotony after running the same pyramid over and over again as well as a backwards feeling unlock system that makes the games easier rather than giving you the tools to succeed on your own.PROSGreat visualsnice but not standout soundtrackgreatly optimizedwell functioning FPS elementsgreat level designCONSmonotony within each pyramid due to repetitious playthroughs.backwards feeling upgrade system that reverses the difficulty curveThe above bullet point is a really big conless value than similar Rogue like shooters[h2]SCORE 6.5/10 Light Recommend [/h2]this is a light recommend because it is simply plagued by a backwards reward/upgrade system and also because of the monotonous repeition of playthoughs. it is not recommended to those players who heavily value progression in their video games. however if you enjoy Rogue-likes like myself you will find some enjoyment out  of Immortal Redneck.If you enjoyed this review, hit that ""Helpful"" button on this review.

The clash of redneck dialogue in an ancient Egyptian setting works well. You don't really need a deep story, kill everything. All that said, the game is fun! I keep coming back to it to play more. I still have quite a bit to unlock and do, and already feel like I got my money's worth. Highly recommended."

,Recommended,595140,33356099,Posted: 7 July,all,Elvis II,"This game is a lot of fun.  Mix a little Doom, a little Serious Sam, throw in a skill tree and some Rogue-lite elements, and voila -  Immortal Redneck.At present time, the game consists of 3 pyramids with 7 levels and 2 bosses each.  Each level in a pyramid gets progressively harder and smaller as you go up.  Killing enemies allows you to collect gold to spend on upgrades in the skill tree or items in a basic shop.  After you defeat the boss of one pyramid, another opens up.  Pretty simple, really.  The gameplay is pure old-school FPS.  Quick movements, precise aim, and twitch reflexes are what you'll need.  And there's plenty of challenge here.  It's one of the harder FPS games I've played, especially with the permadeath mechanic.The only downside to this game, to me, are the scrolls that you collect throughout a run.  These scrolls generally act as temporary upgrades to your character that only last for your current run.  The problem is that some of these are detrimental and hinder you in some way.  And some of these scrolls are quite nasty.  For instance, one of them makes it to where you can't stand still and are constantly sliding all over the floor like it's wet ice.  When you get one of these things you're generally stuck with it for the whole run, which leads to some unfairly disappointing and frustrating moments.The scrolls are random, though, and there are quite a few of them, so the chances of you getting a particularly bad one are low, but certainly not insignificant.  I really hope they address this issue in the future.But that problem is certainly not enough to hold back my recommendation of this awesome game.  It's tons of fun."
,Recommended,595140,33742245,Posted: 23 July,all,Kara,"I hear they eat frog legs in Europe. No way.In all seriousness, while I was initially very skeptical of this title, the fact that it's so well-polished quickly won me over. Initially I only played roughly 30 minutes of it while going through a first impressions of my Steam Summer Sale titles, only to come back to it later when I had nothing else to play anymore. Now it seems that I've somehow managed to sink 19 hours - a number which will quickly rise I imagine - into this game.For the record, I despise anything that's procedurally generated. I despise roguelikes/roguelites. I think they are cheap substitutes for actual level design and difficulty. However, with Immortal Redneck, it's more that they have designed the levels very carefully, but with every playthrough, they shuffle it up for a not necessarily new, but also not necessarily aged experience. I've found I had grown to learn most if not all levels in the first pyramid, and so you do know where the enemies usually spawn, what kind of level it is, but because it's not in a set order, you're not necessarily kept on your toes, but it does feel new every time in a very weird way. And most importantly, I've never gone ""Ugh, it's /this/ level."" Nor have I ever felt cheapshotted solely off the level design.The gunplay, also, is very satisfying. It's quick, you feel like a maniac as you run about killing minions with some guns being blatantly better choices than others, but not being so bad that they sabotage your run. Quite frankly, that's what I found the most satisfying. Despite the amount of bad scrolls you might encounter - Scrolls being bonuses or negative status effects that effect your current and only your current run - I never felt like I was sabotaged. You can work around most of them, or even turn some of them to your benefit. It is evident that a lot of thought and effort has gone into balancing the guns, making everything feel satisfying, and just flat-out making it fun.Essentially, Immortal Redneck is what I thought STRAFE was going to be, except Immortal Redneck actually did it better than my expectations. And that's not even mentioning the sheer variety of guns and references to other games through them.If I have a complaint, it's that you need to die and accumulate gold through a few runs a couple of times to pad your stats and be effective in climbing the pyramid. But, considering you're going to do that anyway, that's not really a big complaint."

76561197971554732,Recommended,595140,31473062,Posted: 30 April,all,rav,"Surprisingly fun game!What I like:- Addictive Gameplay -It's one of those ""only one more run"" games. Every time you die in one of the three pyramids you get to spend your hard earned cash on upgrades for your character. You can unlock new classes, each with their unique playing style, increase your damage output and survivability or become faster and more agile. This spiral keeps you hooked and motivates you every time to try again, git gud and earn even more gold. Fun stuff indeed.- Nice Visuals And Music -The individual levels within the pyramids look good for the most part, offer intricate design and are accompanied by laid-back, melodic tunes that are well composed and never get boring.- Great Performance -Butter smooth gameplay with constant 144 fps and hardly any frame drops at all (tested on a GTX 970).- Difficulty Curve -Slow and easy beginning that gently turns into insane mayhem with absolutely no margin for error in later stages. Most of the time the game plays fair and doesn't rely on cheap traps or hit scanning enemies. Nothing to get frustrated about, which I like.- Good Value For Money -You can sink hours and hours into this game at a very reasonable price. No paywalls or anything like that.What I don't like:- Sound Design -Weapons do sound a bit weak. Turn up your subwoofer, enhance bass output, crank your headphones up to 11 and they still sound like cheap plastic toys. Sound design would benefit from a bit more punch.- FXAA -Looks laughably bad. Use TAA or turn AA off completely.- Scrolls (Buffs) -Scrolls are items that drop from enemies or chests and either buff or debuff your character. Most of them are good and make your current run easier, but there are some that can totally ruin your day. This element of chance may be very frustrating to some players.- Weapon Design -Most of them are neatly balanced and are neither over nor underpowered. But some of them are utterly useless and add insult to injury. But as you keep playing you will learn which ones are good and which ones should never be touched.Verdict:Immortal Redneck is a fun roguelite fps with nice visuals, addictive gameplay, cool music and a decent amount of challenge. People who enjoyed games like Rogue Legacy, Enter The Gungeon or Ziggurat will definitely appreciate it. A very solid 7.5/10."

,Recommended,595140,33212558,Posted: 3 July,all,Cream-of-Plenty,"SUMMARY:Immortal Redneck is a Roguelite FPS that, for all intents and purposes, is not only better than I ever expected it to be--it's one of my favorite games of 2017.  It boasts a wide (50+) variety of weapons, 9 player classes, and a random room-by-room level generation that emphasizes more verticality and frantic ""old school"" speed/shooting than any other Roguelite FPS I've played.  Enemies have distinct behaviors, shooting them feels good, zipping around maps feels good...in general, this game justfeels goodand will likely appeal to anybody who enjoyed Ziggurat, Tower of Guns, Killing Room, Heavy Bullets, or STRAFE (despite being better than virtually all of them).LONG REVIEW:  REFER to PROS & CONS at bottom for the gist!I have to admit:  Even after watchlisting this game months before its release, I ended up getting cold feet when I finally got the opportunity to purchase it.  At the top of my list of concerns was that the previews made the shooting look anemic and the enemies weightless--important factors when considering afirst person shooter.  These were the same complaints that haunted Ziggurat and STRAFE, so it was no surprise that another game in the genre would have the same problems.It wasn't until I saw the developer's patch notes on improved gunplay that I finally bought it and found a diamond in the rough.  Who would've thought that an unknown developer with ""hits"" like ""Oh My Goat"" and ""Ridiculous Triathalon"" could be capable of producing something thisgood?The game is broken down into 3 pyramids (worlds), although only the first is initially accessible.  Each pyramid is composed of 7 floors (with a boss in one of the rooms on Floor 3, and another boss on the final floor) that are procedurally generated by piecing together premade rooms--think Binding of Isaac, Ziggurat, or Enter the Gungeon.  Where Immortal Redneck distinguishes itself is in the sheer verticality of many of these rooms:  There is a huge emphasis on double- and triple-jumping, air control, speed, mantling, and Z-axis fighting.True to many roguelites, if you die before defeating the boss on the final floor of a pyramid, you start all over at the game's central hub.However, once you unlock subsequent pyramids, you can begin your run from the first floor of whichever pyramid you choose; these pyramids are treated as separate dungeons, and do not connect to each other on a single run.But whether you die or successfully escape a pyramid, you must spend whatever gold you've found on the merchant and skill tree between runs (anything extra will automatically be sacrified to the GODS on a new run).  The merchant will be your primary means of equipping ""medallions"" that can significantly change the mechanic of a run.  For example, the ""Plague"" medallion makes everything die in one hit--yourself included--while the ""Cursed"" medallion restricts you to a single weapon that randomly changes from room to room.  The skill tree will be your way of unlocking additional classes and abilities, as well as improving characters stats globally and granularly.In fact, the gradual growth of your skill tree is one of the only real forms of progression in the game.  While you can find new weapons to swap out and scrolls to modify your character, these only exist for a single run.  Additionally, while there is a huge arsenal (over 50 weapons), there's no obvious hierarchy.  Sure, some weapons are better than others...but in general they're all quite evenly matched.  Fortunately most of them are genuinely fun to use without feeling outclassed or redundant, whether they're bows, akimbo pistols, miniguns, magic staffs, or a box of angry bats.  If you'll fault Immortal Redneck for anything, it won't be for its eclectic mix of weapons.Similarly, while there are over 100 premade scroll effects, you don't get to choose which one you get and (by default)you can't refuse a scroll once you've read it.  So maybe that scroll will buff all of the weapons of your chosen ""god"" (re: class) or give you a small COH to turn an enemy into a harmless chicken...or maybe that scroll will randomly swap out all of your weapons, or change all of the in-game text to unreadable hieroglyphics?  There's a huge variety of creative effects that run that gamut from good to bad (and everything in-between) and create a real gamble whenever you examine a scroll.  Some players may be annoyed to spoil a run with a strange negative effect, but I often found it weirdly refreshing, and prevented gameplay ""ruts"".Along the way you will also unlock additional player classes, represented by gods with various strengths and weaknesses.  While slower and unable to double-jump, the bull-headed Apis can carry a 4th weapon, starts with a veritable arsenal, and has an active that briefly renders him invulnerable.  The elusive Amunet, by comparison, is relatively frail but can turn invisible while simultaneously dropping a decoy that enemies will fixate on.  Each class starts with their own specific weapons, but you have the chance to find and use the weapons of other gods while exploring the pyramids.Unfortunately, I didn't feel like the classes were as distinct as they could be:  Compared to something like FTL, Binding of Isaac, or even Nuclear Throne, I found each character ultimately played very similar by the end of the pyramid...such that selecting your character was mostly a choice of what weapons you wanted to start with (and which active ability you wanted).  That's not to say that the classes are unreasonably homogenous--the developers obviously put some effort into distinguishing them--it's simply that they didn't feel particularly unique either.But at the end of the day, Immortal Redneck strikes me as a game that came out of nowhere to usurp basically every other competitor in its subgenre.  It's polished, fun to play, and has a ton of personality; it excels where similar games have stumbled time and time again.  As a result, if you have a particular interest in FPS games and/or roguelites, Immortal Redneck is almost certainly a solid choice.PROS:+ Seems to be stable and well optimized:  In 40+ hours I had only one CTD, and framerates were rock-solid.+ Fantastic variety of enemies that look and behave differently, and encourage different strategies for disposing of them+ Each boss has its own ruleset for defeating them+ Room design injects some variety into the flow of each fight:  Some rooms are simple and flat, some are covered with obstacles, some are extremely vertical, etc.+ Over 50 weapons that are satisfying to use and span everything from revolvers to hand grenades, magic staffs, tranquilizer pistols, and electic flamethrowers.+ Huge number of scroll effects that can radically alter the way a run plays (both positively and negatively)CONS:- Compared to many other Roguelites, it doesn'tfeellike there's a significant difference between how the 9 (currently) available classes play.- A signifcant portion of player progression is in the long-term, granular investment of gold into the player skill tree, rather than a player getting increasingly powerful over a single run.- For some players, a few of the aforementioned scroll effects may be considered instant ""run enders""- Despite a large selection of rooms per pyramid, you'll eventually see them all"

The gunplay feels great, the scroll system for random buffs/debuffs adds a nice twist to how you play the game, room by room. The difficulty is deceivingly hard even with some decent guns and upgrades.I've played about 20 hours with about 50/50 normal style and twitch integration style. Both are fun but the twitch chat throwing every single bad scroll onto you makes the game the most fun IMO.Right now I'd say the game is a solid 8.5/10. What I think is missing would be some more ""challenges"" like a certain quest you need to complete before leaving the next floor or something similar. It would also be cool with maybe an endless dungeon where you can keep going untill you die. Beating 7 floors can be hard but I want to see how far I can make it if I have a good build. (I also noticed that when you reach the scroll cap the next scroll you pick up will 100% remove all your scrolls so that could make longer runs even more interesting and challenging)"

,Recommended,595140,31454420,Posted: 29 April,all,PerfectPencil,"This was the first time I watched a youtube ""lets play"" and decided to buy a game from it. You can thank Jim Sterling for that one. That said, Immortal redneck brings something really unique to the table. It brings some respectable rogue-like gameplay while splashing in just a hint of comedy to break the tension while playing. When I originally watched the trailer for this game it didn't really register for me. When I saw it in action it started to make more sense. A lot of games shoot for a specific mood (be it horror, action, comedy etc) but tend to stick to that start to finish. Games like TF2 use comedy quite a bit, but succeffuly allow you to forget about the comedy while playing. And as I am sure CS:GO players can attest to, online shooters are stressful. Although Immortal Redneck is a single player game, it suffers from the same stress that any single player shooter tends to, but unlike most others, splashes in just a little bit of comedy to prevent you from getting worn out by the combat. This is what TF2 accomplishes so well in a multiplayer space, and I am happy to find that here in a single player space.Overall my time playing this game have been really good. Sure I have some small things I would want added, but over all the game feels very solid. I enjoy being able to sit down and play for 30minutes and make progress for the next run. This progress is persistent over time and slowly you find the game fitting your play style more and more as you level up (even if you are starting the pyramid crawl fresh each run).I would definitely recommend this game if you are looking for something light that you can pick up and put down when the time arrives. It doesn't work to well if you attempt to sit and play for a few hours like most other games, but it fills a nice ""stress relieving"" niche that I am happy to experience. Its not a serious game, but it is quite fun. I think sometimes that is what matters most."

I feel like he should have other voices but I guess it's kinda like he occupies others minds?? I hated how there are so many rooms with absolutely nothing in them but bad guys..and to get nothing after a fight..is tiring. All and all its pretty easy to get the hang of. The bad guys aren't too tough. I like the random passive scrolls. Weapons can sometimes drop off bad guys which is cool. It rarely happens but it does from time to time.

I therefore am giving it now a positive review."
,Not Recommended,595140,31655466,Posted: 9 May,all,Vyth,"At it's current state, I can't really recommend this game (personaly!) because I simply don't feel like I got my money worth of content.SPOILERS AHEAD:It took me 11 hours to finish all of the 3 pyramids and in the end I had 3 deaths in total. ( Mostly silly deaths while testing game mechanics)On my very first run I managed to complete the first pyramid without much effort at all, so I decided ( after spending some points on the skill tree) to continue to the second pyramid. For some reason, second pyramid actually felt much easier than the first one so after completing it, I naturally went to the third one (last) in hopes of it being a bigger challenge than the two previous ones. I will admit, it was more difficult than the previous two, but still pretty much a walk in the park (for me).Now maybe it is because I have some experience in these types of games and I tend to play a lot of fps games (hence above average aim), but it all just felt very underwhelming once I was done with all the 3 pyramids. In terms of ""end-game"" there isn't much that the game offers CURRENTLY. All you can do pretty much is farm the same ""random generated"" pyramids for gold to spend on your skill tree or try to find all the blueprints for the shop so you can buy items at the start of your fresh run.I did few re-runs and pretty much just by seeing the room layout I already knew what enemies there would be, which made the replayability (for me again) drop drastically. Now I know the game calls itself ""rogue-like"" but honestly after few runs I'm not really feeling it that much.I tend to stay with the given default god guns, except if I lack a good Area of effect gun then I might switch out one of my starter guns since the default guns perform well in my opinion. (I finished the whole game with redneck default weapons)I've also notice a lot of people complaining about now getting enough ammo, while I've not really had this issue so far. As long as you rotate between your guns and hit more than half of your shots you should be fine.The reason why I am not recommending the game in it's current state is purely because I don't find it challenging and/or it doesn't seem to be fully rogue-like for me. There is not enough reason for me to use other than the default weapons and the rooms are predictable enemy spawn wise once you have done few runs in the pyramids. On top of that, the skill points just make it even bigger of a joke difficulty wise than it already is.Currently I feel like the worth of this game is around 9.99€ TILL they add some sort of new game + or more randomized enemies in the room etc etc so the game feels like it's worth replaying. Don't get me wrong,I really liked the game when I first started playing and I was hoping it would  get more difficult on the way, but as I went from one pyramid to another it just didn't increase enough to be challenging... The negative scrolls, while apparently being more rare than the good scrolls, still didn't really hinder my gameplay since you can easily adjust to the negative side-effects like explosive vessels and air is lava effects or fall damage.So if you are looking for rogue-like shooter with good re-play value, I would recommend waiting a bit and see what will make it from the roadmap to the actual live game or just wait for a sale. Again, this has all been my personal opinions of the game and I will change the review if the issues I've mentioned get resolved in any good way."

Enemy variety is also lacking, and the narrative and character come far short of compensating for the game's glaring shortcomings. It would be generous to say that this game is worth even $5."
,Not Recommended,595140,31419487,Posted: 28 April,all,Erecto Expecto,"So I've gotten about 5 hours into immortal redneck and I'm not going further.When you first start you're given the default class of Redneck, it's got the worst startup weapons out of them all and it's abilities are alright but don't quite make up for the notoriously bad shotgun and pistol. It may be the first class and meant to teach you the game but it's in serious need of a buff to it's abilites and the shotgun.The shotgun fires a burst of pellets with the same damage as the pistol shots, but it's super spread out right from the start, if you want to do any damage with it you need to be point blank to your target because it's insane spread makes it useless from any other distance. And for a lot of targets getting point blank means getting hit, so if you want to use the shotgun you're setting yourself up to get hit.The starting class isn't the worst part of this game though, the class system is the worst part of this game.As soon as you unlock your third class and start a new run the game slaps you in the face and gives you two random options for classes, and if you don't like them then too bad for you because you're stuck with them. What makes it worse is you have to pay about 8000 gold to unlock a re-roll on this stupid mechanic. And from what I've seen you still have a chance to get the exact same classes.Now, there's a lot of good things about this game, the artstyle and music are amazing and by far my favourite thing about this game, when I first played I wasn't listening to music on the side or anything but instead listening to the game's soundtrack which is amazing.The redneck's constant one liners actually don't really get annoying, they're not common and he tends to not really repeat himself. I infact really enjoyed the voice of the redneck. He actually managed to make rednecks sound badass with the opening line ""Yeah you may kill me, but folks like me don't stay dead for long""I'd say don't buy this game, but don't forget about it. Because I have trust in the devs. And I can see it getting fixed in the future."

The gunplay and levleing up system are really well done but the combination of stupid enemies and badly desigined levels sadly kills it. This style game really needs constant fast paced action and the need to hunt down the last few enemies in the pretty but crowded and hard to navigate rooms is tedious almost immeidatly.This is the only working game I've ever refunded on steam.

Good for killing time as well as monsters.The controls are simple, old school type FPS, without a ton of button binds, and feel nice, and if you want to alter from defaults, it'll let you.The art style is cartoony, but it works with the general theme of the game, where you're a mummified redneck from Kansas shooting monsters inside a pyrimid. (Yup, that's just pretty much the whole story I've seen so far, maybe as you progress you'll find out why they wanted to mummify you and make you shoot monsters...)As you shoot monsters, they may drop ammo, meat which heals you, one even dropped some nice throwing knives, but they also drop gold. You want to get as much gold as you can, it's how you gain upgrades.Like lost castle (also on steam and fun) dying is not just starting over, but a chance to upgrade by spending that gold. As you spend, more upgrades and other benifits are unlocked for you to spend even more gold on. An important note: Spend as much gold as you can! When you re-enter the dungeon, they will make you give up remaining gold as an enterance fee!This is not an easy game, some of the AI has good aim (at least as AI goes) and you'll be facing many diffrent foes at once, so avoiding damage is sometimes impossible. Still, knowing I could improve myself was a comfort as that last shread of HP was drained by a tiny anubis-like critter with a crossbow.Overall, this game may not have much depth of story, and the character is a cartoon redneck, but it's fun for those times you want to just kill monsters while a familiar movie plays on your tablet/smart phone."

This game is super fluid, fast paced, and has unbelievable replay value. Some of the weapons are a real HOOT! When you find a combination of weapons that fit your playstyle, you can't help but appreciate the flow of the game.It's also worth noting that this game probably has the best twitch integration of any game out. The game is balanced with that in mind. One major con: without spoiling, there are some negative scrolls than can instantly end a run's success. No skill level can turn it around due to potential to run out of ammo and no way to get it back. This does not ruin the fun for me because you can generally avoid it due to the huge selection of items!I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed games like Binding of Isaac, Cluster Truck, Choice Chamber, Ziggurat, Doom, etc!Hope you enjoy the game, should you decide to Redneck!"

The weapons are all fun and feel different to use with few exceptions. The protagonist's commentary is pretty funny for the most part but it gets repetitive after awhile.

The problem is that it's a bit expensive and I have to sacrifice a lot of money that I could otherwise be using on upgrades. In all honesty, I'm not exactly sure how they could fix this. It is a problem with all roguelites. Hopefully they can come up with some creative ways around this problem. My upgrades are quickly becoming very expensive and slow to progress so I think that maybe they should start with a small bump in the currency drop rate, but I'm sure there are other ways too.All in all this is a fun game with a few things that could use some attention but I would recommend it."

If you're a big fan of progressive based rogue-lites ala Rogue Legacy where you get upgrades that escalate to make you better, it's the game for you.Only problem I find is that in the end, some of the runs you have to play with can be denied by how unlucky you are due to some of the scrolls you get from any of your runs. Other than that, it's a good game to buy if you have money to spare. Not a must buy but it's a game you may consider getting."
76561198019216815,Recommended,595140,34104826,Posted: 8 August,all,Crebmen,"Immortal Redneck is a FPS-Roguelite similar to games like Ziggurat, Rogue Legacy, and Tower of Guns. As a rogue-lite, Immortal Redneck isn't much different than its contemporaries, but it combines the various mechanics from other games in its genre to create a fun and well-refined experience.The basis of the game is to kill every enemy in each room in order to proceed to the next. Eventually you'll encounter a stair-way leading to the next floor. The game is devided into three pyramids which act as the game's three ""worlds"" or ""acts"". Each pyramid has a mid-point and final boss, and upon beating each final boss you unlock the next pyramid.One problem I have with the game's level design is that it's not randomly generated enough. Room designs are consistant with enemy and hazard placement, the only thing random are loot drops and how rooms are connected together. Once you've played enough of this game you're able to recognize rooms, their enemy layouts, where possibly exits are, all within seconds. Great for speed-running, not so great for replayability.After dying or beating a pyramid, you're able to spend any gold you've collected during your previous run on upgrades from the literal ""Skill Tree"" with-in the game's central hub. It's here where you can increase your stats to make progressing through the game easier, as well as unlocking new ""characters"" to play as. Anyone who has played Rogue Legacy would recognize this mechanic, and it functions essentially the same. You can also buy tokens that massively affect your next run, for example; one of the tokens limits you to only having one gun that has infinite ammo, but the gun randomly swaps itself out for another gun when you enter a new room. These tokens really help spice up the gameplay, but they can also just be basic stat-boosts if you need a little help beating the game.While I enjoy the inclusion of the permanent stat-boosts, I can see it being a massive detriment to the enjoyment of higher-skill players. For people who have a harder time with the game I can see it being something they'd want to buy into, but for me I found myself ignoring the upgrades because they were making the game too easy.On top of your own personal play-through, you have daily and weekly challenge runs that pit players against each other on an even playing ground. I'm glad the game has these leader-board challenges, but because of this game's smaller player-base, there isn't much of a competition.From a technical stand-point this game functions very well with little bugs, I just think the main problem is that it just doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's a very standard, albeit a very POLISHED rogue-lite shooter; but in a market that's highly concentrated with rogue-lites, Immortal Redneck has little new to offer that'll grab new players' attentions. That's why I feel the player-base is to small, and without sales or massive updates I don't see this game being relevant or played for very long.PROS:- Very polished gameplay.- Guns are fun to use.- Movement mechanics are smooth and offer enjoyable platforming.- Visual design is well done.CONS:- Level design gets very repetitive.- Small player-base makes the daily challenge leader-boards a ghost-town.- Scrolls (in-game upgrades) make or break runs.- Not enough post-endgame content to keep higher-skill players invested.SCORE: 8/10Still a great game that I recommend. I certainly got my money's worth out of it, but I don't think I'll be returning to it again any time soon."

This game is done extremely well, outside of some of the balance.The best part of this game style is that the difficulty balances to your skill level. You can progress farther if you are more skilled, and if you are less skilled you can get upgrades and simply progress once the game is at a reasonable level for your skill. You have a lot of control over how hard the game is for you.My only problem with that system in this game, is the grind is too long. If you try to make up for that time with skill, the bosses in the third pyramid will invalidate most weapons and characters, by having very large health pools. You will need to have an infinite ammo weapon, or you'll have to avoid bullets for 5-15 minutes while you collect ammo, depending on character and weapons.You can only lock the pyramid layout once, so you only get 2 tries on any given boss for each pyramid clear, and the monsters respawn, so you basically get 2 attempts on bosses every hour of play time, which is very slow. This means that learning the boss as you fight is very important. While I learn very fast, I still found myself checking the recording to see exactly what went wrong, since I'd have to waste another 30-45 minutes of my life to go get another attempt.The upgrade tree, and other equipment is very limited. Unless you're in the top 99.9%+ of players, you're probably going to want to ignore everything and only upgrade gold, then a mix of attack, health, defense, regen. The grind and difficulty of the game is too high to justify getting anything before the gold upgrades, as you will almost for sure have to grind upgrades during your play. As for equipment, equip the medallion that lets you skip the midboss, or if you aren't there in any given pyramid yet, use the +attack&def medallion.If there was a reward for beating the bosses, like if the next pyramid dropped gold at a significantly higher rate, you could justify not getting gold upgrades first. Instead, the only thing you get is a new area that drops almost identical amounts of gold, at a significantly harder difficulty. There'sWhile the long grind with very small rewards hinders the feeling of progression, the game is overall very solid, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes shooters and roguelikes."

The levels are challenging and really fun. If you liked Ziggurat, then you will love this upgrade.The only complaint I really have about the game is that the redneck doesn't sound redneck enough. Also, the voice acting doesn't always match up with the subtitles.But that's really nitpicking and still this game is awesome.10/10"
