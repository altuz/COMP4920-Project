,Recommended,595280,35478194,Posted: 4 October,all,Portponky,"This is a convoluted social deduction game where you have to make daring leaps of logic to figure out who to execute or pardon. Be the good guys, tell the truth and get executed. Be the bad guys, make up stories and get executed. Be neutral, get executed and win the game.The devs are attentive and the game is being constantly improved. Highly recommended if you're into deceiving strangers on the internet."
,Recommended,595280,35430328,Posted: 2 October,all,BreakOfDawn,"A great social deduction game (the best as far as I know about) that is only going to get better!I played a lot of Town of Salem, so heres what I see as the pros and cons between the two:Throne of Lies Pros:* More fun roles. Almost (if not all) roles seem to have more than 1 skill you can use. For example, Medium is pretty useless in ToS, but in ToL the Priest can talk to the dead AND ressurect a person so its basically Medium+Retri combined. There are also a LOT of skills that some roles can use during the daytime as well.* It doesn't tell you which faction killed someone during the night, and theres no role list, so its harder to figure out the roles in your particular game.* The evil faction can convert people to their side. Someone who was good one night can be evil the next. This also makes it much more difficult for the good side.* Less trolls/throwerss. Since it's not free you aren't going to see people do this stuff since they will just get banned and have to pay another $9.* It's 3D! Cool animations, and detailed room backgrounds during the night* The developers are active and really seem to care! (No micro transactions yet)Cons:* it just came out so it can take a few mins to get a game going sometimes (especially at night) but I am hoping in a few weeks this will be less of an issue as more people buy it.  I'll update my review and remove this comment if this ever changes.* Can't really think of anything else. I definitely prefer it over ToS."

76561198085819114,Recommended,595280,35463115,Posted: 3 October,all,Gyro's Steel Ball,"Fun game with much more depth than TOS. Fun Community as well.Not much ""meta-gaming"" like there was in TOS where the game is easily broken down into a series of ""say your role's objective in jail, put your name in will to stop disguisors, spy check your spies, etc""With the addition of conversions, and kings, as well as the fact that every single role has more than 2 abilities(unlike in TOS where half the roles have 1 boring ability), this game is always moving and feels fast and refreshing."
76561198008554393,Recommended,595280,35436659,Posted: 2 October,all,Mindbender,"Throne of Lies is a fun party game based on the classic games Mafia and Werewolf. Coming from a person who has hundreds of hours on Town of Salem I gotta say that this game is actually really good and a bit of an improvement over ToS in many ways.Pros- Every single role feels meaningful and has an impact on the game because most have not only multiple night time skills, but day time skills as well- Lots of roles, we are talking about 41 roles in the game currently, which is impressive since they all have purpose and meaning- The Conversion system is unique and interesting, every Blue Dragon role has an evil version to it essentially and they can be converted over the Unseen faction, while still having the same abilities- It is 3D! Sure the graphics aren't great, but hey its still nicer than a still unmoving 2D screen- For me the fantasy theme is a big plus, I have an addiction to everything fantasy- When someone dies, you are not told which faction the murderer belonged to which makes you think a bit more on your toes as you really cannot tell who did it- You can draw deathnotes!!!- Since the game is not free and has a pricetag, plus it is new, there are not as many trolls in game- Extremely active devs who have made a discord to communicate with their players and so players can meet other players and find games, or chat and hangoutCons- Small population of players currently, but I expect to see the number of players rise dramatically over the next little while- Of course since the game is in its early stages you should expect bugs, glitches, and whatnot. If you come across those just report them in the bug report part of their Discord!Suggestions- Steam Achievements would be awesome- Trading Cards, I love crafting badges of games I play a lot and like to play- More customization options for my characterAll in all, its a fun game that just needs a bigger playerbase to gain some traction and really start moving along. I recommend this game highly"

76561198067618818,Recommended,595280,35495997,Posted: 5 October,all,Billy12510,"Played 3 games, died Night 1 in two of them. 10/10 would die again.In all seriousness, this is a fairly compelling, very deduction focused Mafia/Werewolves style of game, similar to how Town of Salem plays. There's a ""Good"" faction (The Blue Dragons) and a ""Bad"" faction (The Unseen) (As well as a Cult faction but you won't run into them when starting) and the goals your trying to accomplish depend on your factions role. The Blue Dragons are trying to out all the Unseen and vice versa for the Unseen members. The twist is the Unseen know who members of their faction are at all times while the Blue Dragons are forced to figure it out through conversation and investigation. There's also a handful of Neutral roles thrown in to spice it up (some are trying to kill everyone else, some are trying to solely survive for example) There's also the King role, which starts Neutral but can be ""Converted"" onto the Unseen's side (Or the Cult's).I did say ""Converted"" and that's another key feature of Throne of Lies, The Unseen start with a Mastermind and an Assassian, and the Mastermind can convert almost any role into an ""evil"" version of it, but there's always a limit of 3 members in the Unseen at any time. I use Town of Salem as a natural comparison for this style of game since it was the first Werewolves/Mafia game I got heavily interested in, but ToS requires a much smaller level of deductive reasoning required as it's really easy to whip up a mob mentality. In Throne of Lies, the role list of the game is completely hidden, and the only roles that are always there are King, Prince, (and for games with Unseen) Mastermind, and Assassain. Not knowing what could possibly exist means that there's more room for doubt when it comes to potential for claiming, and you have to be almost certain you know the person you're going to send to trial is guilty or not.Although I haven't ""Played"" much of Throne of Lies at the time of writing this (That joke at the top wasn't just a joke.) I still see the potential this game has to offer for people who enjoy investigative deception style games like this or ToS, and if you've played ToS before you'd feel right at home with it. And although the community for it is small right now (It DID just launch) it's a very committed one who are willing to help new players along at learning the game. Because if you haven't played something like this before, there is a bit of a learning curve, and I have no idea how the Cult roles will play differently to the Unseen when I get a chance to play games with those enabled. My one concern is just the community size is small and it can take a while for games to start (I had a 10 minute queue time for my third game), so it isn't a sort of ""Pick up and play"" Like how ToS would be. But that's something that can be fixed with time and more players (The game supports a Minimum of 8 Players and a Max of 16, which is just the right amount for this type of game). I look forward to jumping back in to more sessions of this with my friends and the loyal group of players this game has already accrued, and I think if you enjoy a good session of Mafia/Werewolves this is your style of game."

I think it's even stopping my Overwatch addiction, which I can't say about most games.The community's small but dedicated, which would be an issue for finding matches but not when the devs have created a Discord to help with that. I'm sure that the community will multiply within the next few months. The medieval setting is fun, makes for a lot of Game of Thrones references and most roles are really enjoyable. I love that you can convert players to the Unseen so there's still hope if you end up part of the Blue Dragon.Overall, the game's a lot of fun and I can't stop playing it.

The game itself is sooooo fun! There is a good amount of classes in the game that makes it to where most games don’t have exactly the same classes each time & you have to figure out what roles are in the game and how many of them there are. It’s an amazing time to use your deduction skills and win the game for everybody.This game does take a few games to grasp what’s going on, but once you get a little bit of it you’re golden.

,Recommended,595280,35510058,Posted: 5 October,all,Cuthun,"It's a very good game and interesting game with many aspects of indie survival strategy such as Town of Salem and Mafia. You start out as a person (of course) in a faction. Blue Dragons, Unseen, Cult, or Natural. Each faction/class has a goal to complete, once you complete it you will succeed in the game. You can do this by killing other people by your abilities or cast them up for treason, sometimes in specific classes, you have to do something else. You will not know the roles people have or the kinds of roles in the game, this makes it so that you can claim as many roles as you want (as long as it's not contradictory) in the game. Death animations are available and instead of being in one place the entire time you switch places at night depending on your faction and/or role. Graphics on this game is better than most (such as Town of Salem) and has an interesting atmosphere to it making it very realistic in terms of its genre. The best thing about this game is the community, there is a discord channel with very helpful people if you are ever stuck and awesome devs who actually try to make a good game and in the meanwhile are helping and taking suggestions from their fans. Admitting that this only came out a few days ago makes it seem like the game can aspire more with enough dedication and courage. I cannot wait to see what this game has to offer in later times as I see this game as a small baby with a bright future ahead of it. Keep it up Devs!"
