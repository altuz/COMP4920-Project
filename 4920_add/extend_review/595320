,Not Recommended,595320,30111876,Posted: 22 February,all,SidAlpha,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h96pC6EV8UUPolterheist is, as a game, a complete and utter waste of both time and money. From the complete and utter lack of any form of legitimate gameplay mechanics to having most of your game so dark that you can't even see anything on your screen to BLINKING MECHANICS to a persistent ""cover your mouth while you cough"" mechanic... Because that's apparently a thing.This game looked promising from it's graphics and the overall premise. The problem with the graphics is that you can't even see them for most of the time in the game. The premise was the poorest execution in a game that I have seen in a while. In yet another slap in the face, the control schemes outside of simple WASD for moving are completely not standard and you are given absolutely NO indiciation as to what you need to press to do anything. And did I mention that if you go past the white fence you fall off the edge of the map?1/10 - Would not even recommend if it were free."
,Not Recommended,595320,30110356,Posted: 22 February,all,KL8N187,"Not much to spoil but I hid it anyway so you could decide. The game is worth maybe $1 if that.Your character has a cough and you must mouse click left or right which ever it shows to quiet the cough. Which attracts the ghost ending in a black screen. You basically have to find six items and hold F to carry each one, one by one back to the van. Without coughing or walking right into the ghost, which is on a pretty much fixed path of walking up stairs and downstairs."

,Not Recommended,595320,31611754,Posted: 7 May,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Since there's literally zero information on the developer/publisher, Kiddy, and this is their first game on Steam, let's just jump right into the gargantuan waste of effort that's known as Polterheist, or Poltergeist, depending on where you're looking. Yes, it's this name mix-up business that should be your first clue that the developer literally gives zero ♥♥♥♥s about their product; while the store page says Polterheist, as does the artwork for it, the purchase button says Poltergeist.Anyway, you play as an asthmatic burglar with a blinking problem who wants to rob this house that he has visited before. I say that because this game has a coughing mechanic, where you must click either the left or right mouse button at the right time to stop from coughing, and the character blinks... a lot. Seeing as he has been to the house previously, the idiot should know that it's haunted but for some reason he just decides to go back anyway... just roll with it. You are then tasked with stealing six items from the tiny crapshack of a house, but good luck getting past the second one before the ghost that roams the hallways kills you. You'll be inside the house, looking for the items on your robbery list, and the lights will cut out; OoOooOOOoo, spoopy. If you notice a flickering glitch near you, that's the ghost; it touches you, you die, you go back to the beginning of the game.There's zero information provided by the developer on how to actually play this game; good luck guessing and figuring out what to do and the controls in which to do it. There's zero activity from the developer in the forums, despite numerous threads asking for even the slightest bit of help. There's zero signs that this developer wants to take the criticism from the community and make their game a better one. In fact, since Polterheist's release in February 2017, the only communication from the developer is when this title went -90% off. The gameplay lasts for 2-3 minutes at best, and the environment is made to feel larger than it really is by the inclusion of faux-buildings that have no purpose, yet the normal price for this title is $5.49 CAD, even at $0.54 the game feels like a major rip off. Avoid entirely, and do not support such lousy developer practices....It's also entirely convenient that nearly every English written review is negative, but all other language reviews are positive. The developer's first language is not English.Rating:0.5/5.0- Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"
,Not Recommended,595320,31386303,Posted: 26 April,all,tlj24,"This game was clearly made as carelessly made as possible. It is completely unplayable and it takes FOREVER to interact with in-game objects, such as doors, the flashlight, etc. When I finally found out how to get into the house, which was by jumping throught the CLOSED ♥♥♥♥ing window, I died instantly. The game gives you no totorials, and has no backstory to it. This is, by FAR, the worst game I've ever played in my entire life."

,Not Recommended,595320,31602883,Posted: 7 May,all,CorvusCorax,"I have to admit I was glad to be able to read a synopsis in proper English. Some point out the typos in the text; either I have much lower standards or the developer made some corrections following the initial publishing.I like the concept of the game: you play as a burglar and your job is to steal half a dozen items from a house which is, apparently, haunted by an apparition. Your gameplay consists of walking downstairs and upstairs looking for the items shown in your notebook. Occasionally, your protagonist is about to cough - you need to press either the left or the right mouse button to conceal your cough. Call it the indie game version of the so-called QTEs (quick time event)!This earned the title the ""coughing simulator"" and other such names. I found the concept refreshing, though. And what happens if you do not press the button on time? The ghost roaming the house hears you and catches you. This is practically the gameover unless you manage to run outside. This is, of course, impossible if you are upstairs.Sadly, this is pretty much all the good that can be told about Polterheist (I also appreciate the pun in the title). While the graphics are decent (I hate the strong white colours, though, that look like as if they were emitting light) the ghost is barely visible. It is difficult to know where it is - we hear footsteps and occasionally a flash of light but that's it. It is as if it teleported between the two floors - you have to somehow notice it is already downstairs so that you can finally use the stairs.The menu looks decent but there is no control options. You have to figure out the controls yourself. If you are an FPS veteran you find out eventually that F is responsible for the interaction and your mouse wheel brings up the inventory items. Once you find a a desired object you have to press and hold F - this allows you to pick it up and take it to the back of your van. It is ridiculous to see this menu is missing and there's no option to change the key bindings.You get bored if you invest 15 or so minutes into Polterheist. It has a great concept but a terrible execution. Also, the developer called ""Kiddy"" might have slightly changed his name - this is an oddly similar name to the one who released Grizzly Valley (an equally weak title with a great idea)."

,Not Recommended,595320,30203072,Posted: 26 February,all,GasMask,"At fist i looked at this game and thought it was a nice idea. The graphics was also nice. So i started the game three times and two of them i died right when i entered the house. I didn't understand sh*t.On the third time i explored the outside first and found a flashlight that didn't illuminated anything. At first i thought it was out of batteries, then i realized that only the shadows get lit. So i entered the house and died again.So i quit the game and thought i might be missing something, so read the game description again but there was anything useful. So came here to read the reviews then started to REALLY learn about the game. At first i thought my spec wasn't enough for the game because the screen was constantly flickering, later i discovered it was intentional! It's some kind of blinking system.And then i learned that the character has tuberculosis or something like that and you have to cover your cough to don't wake the spirit or something.So, for now i'll just put the game aside and see if my faith get restored later (A.K.A get polished)."
,Not Recommended,595320,31453859,Posted: 29 April,all,MoonDoggie82,"Stay away from this game. Not worth the mere .50 cents. No info on control scheme or what you need to do, if you manage to pull up the list of items you need to steal you still can't find anything because you died in like 20 seconds. I still haven't even made it to the 2nd floor.I made a Let's Play video so you can see it without wasting your own money:https://youtu.be/zwZxEJ4GrjkI had hopes it was good becuase it looked interesting, played for awhile while recording and it was okay continued to play after the video to figure out the game better before the next video and I couldn't even get to the 2nd floor. The first time you play it's a little creepy but it quickly loses its appeal. Just avoid."

This game just throws you into the front of the house not knowing what to do. I found out what to do, by reading the ""ABOUT THIS GAME"" info. It does have some work built into the game along with a nice atomsphere but the game just fails. The cough and blink mechanics just makes the game even worst, Also too dark causing you to just say F it!"

,Not Recommended,595320,34759282,Posted: 5 September,all,Gary the Prophet,"I honestly hate giving bad reviews but I felt like I didn't have a choice for this one. I think the overall concept of the game was okay but how the developers executed this concept was just flat out awful! You know a game is pretty bad if you feel like you got ripped off after paying not even a DOLLAR for it!First of all, you can't see what's killing you so you have to just hope and pray that the invisible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is not near you. Even if you hear it downstairs and you're upstairs, it's 100% of the time upstairs right next to you. Also did anyone have the hardest time just trying to get into the freaking house?Second of all, why in the BLOODY HELL is this guy going into a haunted house with a killer ghost inside in the middle of nowhere to steal everyday objects? The thief couldn't find a non-haunted house to steal these items from? If the thief was stealing very rare gems, paintings, or items of the sort, that would be a somewhat legit reason to steal from that house.THIRD of all, why didn't the guy wait to rob this place until his whooping cough went away? So much for being a thief when you're literally coughing every five seconds and it's so FREAKING LOUD! I understand that the developers were trying to make some sort of mechanic that would make the game some what challenging, but why did they make it IMPOSSIBLE?I'm not going to say REMOVE THIS GAME FROM STEAM, because I believe that the developers can fix this game if they really put their minds to it. But until that day, I'm sticking with my thoughts on this game. Also Steam wouldn't let me refund this game because I didn't play until a month after I bought the game.0/10 would refund again."

I get the flashlight, I head into the haunted house, and I instantly die?! I mean, I can't enter this house without some random ghost killing me right off the bat! I don't think I can even go into the house without being chased straight away. I mean, how am I supposed to rob this house, if I just die? 6/10 just because of the creepy noises, but that's about it for the review. If there was some way I can enter that house and get the stuff I need, before the ghost gets me?  That would be a bit for fair, but if I just die? What's the point of entering this house?! Game isn't really fair when it comes to just dying straight off. I have no chance of winning. NONE!"

76561198045627918,Not Recommended,595320,35279155,Posted: 28 September,all,Yerczeys,"I try not to review games unless I feel like I've really experienced them but this one doesn't seem to deserve that kind of time investment.  Plot and atmosphere will often drag me into a game and this one isn't very strong in either.  Sure it's creepy, but 'house in the middle of nowhere at night' isn't exactly unique or inspired and as far as I can tell the plot is 'you're a burglar, there's a haunted house, burgle the haunted house'.I'm unsure why, but it ran terribly on my machine which is pretty decent.  So my guess is it's poorly optimized or something like that.  I had to lower the resolution to about 1280 and turn down the graphics to get it to move without chugging.  That complaint out of the way, we'll get on to the meat of my complaints.Tracking the sole ghost I experience in the game seems to consist of listening to it stomping around this house and trying to not get it's attention.  Problem is, the ghost is so heavy-footed that half the time it feels like it could be anywhere in the immediate vicintiy and the house feels so small that you're never very far from it.  And (again maybe it just hated my machine) when it would get me all I saw was a static square blip in front of me armed with a scream.Speaking of screaming, that cough function was just a terrible idea.  Your professional burglar of a character seems to have a nasty cold or some of the most sensitive lungs around, and that minor and randomized QTE to not cough only distracts from anything else going on.  A purely obnoxious function thrown in to try to add more gameplay depth and challenge and I hated every second of it.That's it, that's my experience.  Didn't manage to nab any items, didn't manage to survive for more than a moment or two in the house.  I get it a 2/10 for a spoopy atmosphere.  That was the sole high point."
