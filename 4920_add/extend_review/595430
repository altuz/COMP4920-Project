,Recommended,595430,33829237,Posted: 27 July,all,RusCorp,"Perfect game between flights in BMS or DCS to get that dangerzone-feeling! I was in the alpha and can attest to a nice dev cycle with updates, both bug fixes and added features.Very fun with a few friends, the tactical aspect grows as you understand the different phases and applications of different aircraft.Recommended! :)"
,Recommended,595430,33942787,Posted: 31 July,all,veruszetec,"I was sucked into this game pretty quickly. It has a lot to offer:- Great soundtrack that (likely very deliberately) evokes the Top Gun soundtrack- Fun but simple gameplay and controls- Action that keeps you on the edge of your seat- A fun upgrade system- Customizable nose and tail art for your planes- Quick and easy matchmaking- Turn-and-burn dogfighting- More strategy than you'd think- 4v4 multiplayer- A low freaking price!Pick this up, you won't regret it."

76561198123961322,Recommended,595430,34042858,Posted: 5 August,all,Pyro Shark,"This game is a gem, I normally hate MOBAs because of how bland I feel they are but this one obviously is action packed and very fast paced and the community isn't toxic, I haven't been insulted for forgetting to buy boots at the start of the game. I found this game from PhlyDaily on youtube and within 5 minutes I owned the game, I was instantly in love with this game. It can be a little annoying with the current spawn times because of how easily the game can flip around when even one person gets shot down but thats a small issue. Another thing is there were many things I did not learn from the tutorial such as manuvers, flares, and upgrading mid game, basically only the very basic things were covered which should be fixed. I would still greatly recommend this if you like War Thunder or other games like it or if you love modern jet fighters.See you in the skies pilots!"

,Recommended,595430,33832123,Posted: 27 July,all,Robin,"An awesome little game by a super dedicated dev! Wouldn't believe it's made by one person, it's so polished!The closest thing I could call it is like an airplane dogfight moba but with airplane controls instead of using your mouse and clicking, but that doesn't do it justice as it is very unique, try it out! I mean, it even has vertical movement which as far as I've seen no moba-like or battle arena ever has had.The community also has a discord server linked directly in the game, so there are ppl to show you the ropes if needed.Played during the closed beta."
76561197992836868,Recommended,595430,34380921,Posted: 20 August,all,Fries (DEZ),"DCS and Falcon BMS player here. This is a good game for people that like flying games. Its simple yet fun and very polished for EA. If this is the state at EA, I'm excited to see where this game will go. You can choose your role (fighter, air to ground, multirole) and if one doesn't support the other than the team will crumble. It's definitely encourages you to watch out for your teammates."

,Recommended,595430,34054252,Posted: 6 August,all,Hawkie,"I loved the visual style of the game immediately upon seeing it. The gameplay is compelling, and the developer's attention to detail (mechanics, community feedback and visual style) is amazing. It is well polished - moreso than other early access games I personally played.I'm entirely new to the genre owed to having accessibility needs, but this I can play without any headaches owed to good menu contrasts and the game's overall style (reddish brown, no obtrusive bright flashes), and I am hopeful that I will be able to further improve on my flying skills as I progress."
,Recommended,595430,33921607,Posted: 30 July,all,TheGamingInvestor.com,"Whenever I had a 10-30 min slot and had the itch to play something fun and challenging my goto used to be Rocket League but now it is Sky Knights. I love the simplified Moba style and the game is very rewarding for increased skill.It is also really cool to stay in spectator mode between deaths and observe the game in 3D.The developer being a fighter jet nerd shines through with the use of g-force, upgrades, etc."
76561198018990949,Recommended,595430,33834559,Posted: 27 July,all,gwellmyn,"I played it during alpha, and it have come a long way since then. If you like a quick multiplayergame, where a session doesn´t take more than maby 15-20 minutes, then this is perfect. The urge to play ""just one more match"" is there the whole time. The only thing i hope for is that there will be more planes to choose from in the future.Two thumbs up!"
,Recommended,595430,33994873,Posted: 3 August,all,Guardian_Angel,"A pretty good game for its price: an arcade MOBA in the dangerzone. Has a nice feel attached to it and plays keenly with viable mechanics to knock off.But as any other undistinguished indie-project, this game suffers from unexistent playerbase. The highest player peak I've seen here was at 8 players logged-in, and most of them are 40+ level nerds that leave you no chance with all the unlocks and experience they have.This game WILL be worth playing when the actual online count rises, but right now it's just a tumbleweed."
,Recommended,595430,34034689,Posted: 5 August,all,Sniperski,"Great 4 on 4 top down air combat battler with surprising depth.It takes only minutes to get going the first time and you can hotjoin almost any match, once in the air you will quickly realize that the game is all about skill and teamwork.I can see myself casually coming back to this game for a long time not only for a very enjoyable dose of 80ies top gun nostalgia but also for a fix of concentration and well executed skill."

Great pace and the level and rank system gives you some real incentive to keep playing.The only problem I have is that 727 that just went up underneath us... it haunts me... Is it behind us?

I've had no problem finding other people to play against, and thus far the community has been really friendly.You also don't need to be a fighter pilot whiz to enjoy it as it's one of those ""easy to learn, tricky to master"" type of games."
76561198068023692,Recommended,595430,34255850,Posted: 15 August,all,=SEALS= Saybro,"A very fun game that doesn't go for a (full) sim experience but actually gets flight dynamics / mechanics pretty spot on. I can tell from personal experience that the dev is very involved with the community (most likely due to the community being pretty small as of right now which is kind of a con to the game). All in all a fun game that's (pretty) balanced with an involved dev and that doesn't scream full sim / hardcore experience. For anybody having doubts about the game or anybody wanting to write a negative review of this game I want you to realize that this game still is in early acces and that Bankler is a sole dev behind this game as of right now, he's working very hard on improving the game and adding content to it, if you have any questions or suggestions he's open to them (he created a suggestions forum/thread on Steam) and for questions you can approach him on the game's discord server."

It's easy to learn, but there's so much to master. There are so few buttons, but so much control!4v4 PvP dogfighting has never been this much fun. It's got really nice graphics, satisfying physics and fun mechanics.A game lasts for between 5-15 minutes, so it's easy to just pick it up and then put it down again if you don't have time for an all-nighter.If I have anything negative to say, it's that it's only got the one map right now (Battlegrounds only has one map, and millions still play it. Just sayin'), and only one game mode. But seriously, for this price, you can't pass it up.TLDR;Buy it. Seriously."
,Recommended,595430,34541483,Posted: 27 August,all,[MBF] WrathOfAthens,"This is the only MOBA I've really given a chance and oh boy do I not regret it. The amount of potential for a game taking this new stance on Aviation games is wonderful. Definitely has a more arcade feel, but in a good way. This game can be quite competitive too when squaring off against good players. I definitely recommend this almost everyone. It's not expensive, pick it up."

Atmosphere and music are A+, the whole minutes to learn, longer to master thing holds true here. You can blow bots out of the sky from the start, but player v player encounters are very much skill-based to an enjoyable degree. This is a great game to kill a couple hours with if you've got some friends as well. Speaking of which, if you do pick it up, bring your friends with. The playbase seems unfortunately small, which is the first of my only two complaints. Here's the second: it is an indisputable scientific fact that the world will be forever lesser as long as there's no F-14 available to fly in this game."
