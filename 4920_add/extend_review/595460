,Recommended,595460,34086476,Posted: 7 August,all,machinehuntress,"This was a nice, little game and has had surpringly much content. You play through five episodes of (awkward) dates and through a choice-based system you try to find the right answer/action, to not look like an idiot at the end of your date. Almost like real life, haha.The mini games were kinda annoying, same for the loud level of what should be background music, but overall its style and writing is quite good and competently made. Especially if you consider that this game just cost you ONE lousy buck. It is definitely a steal for that price."

The dialogue choices are really obvious as to which one you should choose if you want to succeed (hint: just dont be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and you win), and really most of them focus on minigames over dialogue choices anyway, which is disappointing since I think the real fun is in the choice. But, it's simple, it's fairly funny and it's cheap. If you just wanna kill a bit of time or maybe grab some footage for a quick Let's Play or something, it's a pretty good choice."

,Recommended,595460,31333722,Posted: 23 April,all,Ronald Gunderson,Flix and Chill is a short quirky dating simulator for 99 cents. I thoroughly enjoyed the 68 minutes it took me to complete the game. It has a good sense of humor and will make you smile.
,Recommended,595460,31264373,Posted: 20 April,all,RipWitch,"Flix and Chill is a dating sim where you play in 5 dates, 4 new dates and the original one, wher you try to hook up with the other person. Each date is not that long as you chat with your date and play minigames, depending on which date it is. The choices you make will decide whether or not you will successfully take the other person to another date. This may be choosing an option or doing a minigame.Though I did find some of them having really shallow reasons to go out with you. Such as the first one only dating you if you give out money. If you do not give a tip out or give a homeless looking man money (which he chimes in even if you have no money). Though I did find it funny that you can get drunk and understandably make the girl mad and another one is based on your attitude throughout the date. All the dates do mirror what dates would actually be (one is arguably not a date but a lead up to one). The only thing I had a problem with, beside some glitchy animations I ran into, was that some minigames did not register a click which made it hard to get an achievement for beating your date in all the games.For $1, Flix and Chill will be able to pass the time. Any computer would be able to run this game with no problem. Each date does not take more than 30 minutes or so, but if you want to get all the achievements it can take up to 4 hours. I certainly recommend it."
,Recommended,595460,30694469,Posted: 23 March,all,Voidsword,"An interesting, visual-novel sort of game with some interactive puzzles, where choices determine your ending. The diversity of characters and settings make the game remarkably true to life for being otherwise so minimalistic, and fun to play even if only to investigate all the different choices and outcomes.This is not to say I don't have qualms with some of the choices; for instance, giving money to an unknown transient fishing for cash, inside a business where soliciting is prohibited, after having witnessed him take money from others, meaning his intentions are less than honest, and especially in this day and age where transients are popularly substance abusers, supposedly this paramounts to attractive behaviour while on a date..... yeah no.Still, the game developer concedes in his own credits that the game and its choiced are based on his own collective experiences, and those differ between individuals enough to justify some... unusual design choices."

,Not Recommended,595460,30390310,Posted: 8 March,all,Zed Clampet,"I would give this a ""meh"" if I could. I'll leave it as negative since I don't intend to play it anymore after .4 hours.The thing is that there doesn't seem to be any logic behind what choices progress you. It's just random, which leaves you replaying a level over and over again to try to hit the ""right"" formula, which isn't fun for me. Basically everything I pick seems to have a positive response on my date, but she still leaves after 30 minutes anyway.If you don't mind just going back and forth and trying every option until you get it right, you may enjoy this game. The writing is pretty solid, after all. Just feels like a waste of my time to play something so arbitrary."

But this one has an extra touch to it, it's an indie arcade game of a sort! Let's break it down.Graphics: 0/10, Come on, it's an indie game. Alright, fine. 5/10. Considering the characters don't have faces to tell their reaction is quite a let down. Everything in the game is basic, as expected from an indie game.Gameplay: 4/10, The gameplay is not repetitive, each of the four stories are different and I am sure they will be expanding this game. But here's the flaws of it. This game is extremely short, as you can see, it took me about 45 minutes to beat the whole thing. As I said, quite a let down. Each story requires you to pick the right decision for your ""crush"" to like you. And if you do everything right, they will. That's really about it.Addiction: 2/10, I never want to play this game again, but if I was told to play it, I would.Sounds: No real sounds.Music: 8/10, Music fits the atmosphere of what's going on. I'm a fan.Lag: None, it's an indie game.Overall, Not a big fan, gameplay is short and boring, not to mention how easy it is. This game shouldn't be for teenagers 13+, it should be for either really old people or people that have a taste of entertainment as a cat. I'd give this a 3/10 overall. Depressing."
