,Not Recommended,596560,30985468,Posted: 6 April,all,[RIP] SpaceBaldy,Sorry Devs.This is nothing more than a tech demo of about 5 minutes gameplay.Graphics look great but needs optimising as it stuttered on my i7 with GTX1070 and I couldn't hear any sound.Will give this another try if it gets some content as it has got potential for a good 'on rails' shooter.
,Not Recommended,596560,31059392,Posted: 10 April,all,Stormtiger,"Let me just summarize the experience I had for the last 5 minutes:I started the game, stood on some kind of D-Dayish scene defending some bunker against hordes of really ugly robots. It was fun for like 3 seconds but then it got annoying. After 1-2 minutes that scene was over and another completely random scene popped up where I had to fly on hover-skateboards with a premade route through some tunnels while being chased by flying drones, which also were really ugly. In the end I was standing on an elevator and had to defend myself against aliens that didn´t even match the other 3D Assets in the game and were completely random and full of bugs. That was it. The whole game of really bad looking enemies, blurry scenes, crappy special effects and an environment that even my 4 year old smartphone would be capable to render took me nearly 5 minutes to finish.Look Devs, I paid actual money for this game. It wasn´t much after all, but I would have gotten a nice cup of coffee for that money so the next time I think about buying one of your games I will certainly go with a Café Crema."

This is pretty much the best wave shooter I've ever seen,  don't worry about the language, just buy it go ahead and play. It only lasts about five minutes but damn, this is the game to show off to your friends and impress him with the capabilities of VR. I am honestly not a big fan of web shooters, preferring to be able to use locomotion to move across environments. But I can make an exception for this one, and I hope they develop it into a full-fledged experience soon. If they can add locomotion of course, that would be just too cool."

,Recommended,596560,31054804,Posted: 9 April,all,SparkyMcSparks,"It's a 5 minute demo of what feels like a proof of concept for a bigger game. This being something they've made either for funding or internal greenlight, but boy is it fun!If you like scripted cinematic FPS campaigns from games like Call of Duty or Battlefield and are looking for what those would not just feel like in VR, but designed for VR from the ground up, Mars VR is worth the cup of coffee admission to play!It's not perfect, groundbreaking, or long enough to stand on its own as a game, but what it does do it does well in providing a sampler of FPS mechanics that show promise of what a FPS VR game should feel like."
,Not Recommended,596560,31208592,Posted: 17 April,all,Cyphersphere,"Shovelware, failed proof of concept, no options - It's just bad.  There is no damage or cover system and you can't die. Pass on this."

,Recommended,596560,31085974,Posted: 11 April,all,Ross,Very cool experience for the price. Almost feels like the arcade shooters time crisis.
,Recommended,596560,31064777,Posted: 10 April,all,edgecrush3r,"A very great looking rail shooter. A bit short, but for this price a great demo of what hopefully will become an full game."
,Recommended,596560,30976187,Posted: 6 April,all,Kris.vdv,"If you like VR Rail Shooters, you will probably be impressed by this very polished, action-filled and visually outstanding shooter! Mechanics work really well, music is good, environments are great, animatons are high quality,  I can't really say anything bad about it, except maybe that currently everything feels completely scripted and I'm not sure if your actions really matter. :)  At this moment, this is only a short demo or prologue and will not take more than 5 minutes, but if you want to support the developers, you could consider buying it.  Looking forward to a full game."
,Recommended,596560,31013743,Posted: 8 April,all,Rafport,"Great quality, the super low price could be misleading. It's a multi event shooter than I suppose is a sort of prologue of a real full game (I would buy it for sure) you can beat it in minutes. But the graphics is sharp and detailed, ton of stuff on screen, it looks also very good for the aliasing (it's Unreal based) and run smooth with my 970. This is the quality everyone is waiting for."

76561197998361780,Recommended,596560,31001213,Posted: 7 April,all,Shooter[SK],"It's a short demo but boy it's fun. Rail shooter with amazing graphics and design, smooth and fun gameplay. Great ride. Love the mechs and all. This is how I imagine fun game for VR. Make it at least 6 hours long, and we have a serious winner!  Can't wait for the full game. Thank you."
,Recommended,596560,30996076,Posted: 7 April,all,ChazClout,"Ok, this is short. Very short but man, is it polished.Controls are simple, trigger to shoot, push on the large circle pad to fire rockets when they charge. Zero issues with a language barrier because everything is pretty self explanatory.A good showcase of what VR could be, I'd love to see it developed into a full VR title."

,Recommended,596560,30984618,Posted: 6 April,all,hiandthemoon,"Woah!! Graphics are amazing. If they added some free mobility options of some kind, this game would be mindblowing. As it is, totally worth the $2 I paid. So much fun."
,Recommended,596560,31615240,Posted: 7 May,all,Game Cooker US Rocks VR,My specs: 16 Gigs RAM/ GTX 1070/ Intel Core i7-7700k/ HTC VIVECheap demo that cost money unfortunately but I do like what I have played. For now this is something great to buy to show off your VR to people. If you are looking for a full experience then pass this. It is a very short game preview. It has tons of potential and looks and feels great to play. It ends right when you were hoping for more. But the game does look stunning. A number rating would be 5/10 simply because it is not a game but a demo of some kind. It crashes often but after a few tries I made it to the end with no issues. I really hope the dev makes this a full game.The last video in my medley is Mars VR. Fats forward to it or watch all th eotehrs if interested. Enjoy.https://youtu.be/3IBZ_VHyCiE
,Recommended,596560,31758384,Posted: 14 May,all,Diversian,"I was sooooo upset!!! I've been going through my list of games I've never played and thought, this must've been a free game. Then I saw that it wasn't, and decided I needed to play it. It was seriously one of the best wave shooters so far.... and then it ended. It killed me. I went back to look at reviews, and sure enough it's only 5 minutes long. These guys need to finish this game by charging another $35USD or so, adding about 5 hours of content, and even though you don't really need it to be in English that would be a nice touch. Then, as a bonus after release add the ability to play the game with your friends since there's already two NPC's to either side of you. This game will sell tons, but the tech demo is cool and leaves you wanting more.Pros- Looks amazing- Feels amazing- Leaves you wanting moreCons- Short and not labeled ""demo"" or Early Access- Sounds could be a little better- Leaves you wanting moreNeutral- How do you feel about paying for a tech demo that you'll only go through once, maybe twice"
,Recommended,596560,33287440,Posted: 5 July,all,andybak,Incredibly polished and graphically impressive. I haven't played long enough to have an opinion on reply value but at this price - just buy it. Even if you play it once and keep it around to impress VR noobs - it's worth it.
