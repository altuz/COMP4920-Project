76561198147337725,Not Recommended,596910,30589162,Posted: 18 March,all,Soldier of Mercy 76,"Alright, after playing it for several replays I can finally write this review.First of all, the pacing of this game/story is so damn fast. Like, all the characters you met, even all the love interest you can have, feel so damn flat. You'll have almost no love to anyone one of them, and if they die you wont feel any sadness at all. Character interactions is limited, with the game focusing more on the 'Events' of the whole thing, and not in the good way. Character development is limited, barely one at all. You can become evil and good with almost no consequences whatsoever, though I need to look this up more for more assurance.It has the same 'Make your MC friends yourself' type of setting. It can be interesting, but the fact that all the characters you made have no sense of a human being at all. Or, more specifically, the story did not focus on interaction and choose on quick, large event spot light. And it's not interesting at all.All in all, it's a barely passable story. However, I won't give it a recommendation. It needs works, and too damn short for my taste. As someone who had played a lot of games like this, I give it a 6.5/10, with 1 being worse and 10 being perfect."

Yes, you can expect to live 80 years of your life within an hour or two, which often amounts to each decision moving you one year further in life.Yes, you won't find captivating characters, unique story or catchy prose here, but the game accomplishes several important things which makes me recommend it:You have a lot of choice, and it always matters. Most of your decisions will be carried for the whole duration of the game, while some early choices unlocking branches in endgame storyline;It's short, engaging, and you won't ever be bored reading long passages with nothing happening;Most importantly, you really get to feel as a badass wizard. Each storylet has options that makes you feel awesome and powerful (if you trained the necessary skills or have the relevant items).Get this game if you:Get bored with other CYOA books and prefer short-and-to-the-point prose;Enjoy choice and consequence above all else;Prefer games with huge amount of character customization and creating a hero that you can really feel as your own;Want to feel what it's like to be amazing and powerful wizard."

TL;DR - you go through 80 years of ""your"" life in less than an hour, and the pacing reflects it."
76561198033999305,Recommended,596910,30598756,Posted: 18 March,all,Calm down,"Bought it for 3 dollars or so. Decent game (around 2-3 hrs), had replayablility if you wanted to try out other builds and choices.However, it was quite simplistic and honestly i gave no ♥♥♥♥♥ about all the other character. Whomever they were (other than myself of course).If you want to waste a few hours, you could consider getting this game. Otherwise i think there is no real point to it. It's not bad, so i would not ""not recommend"" it, but its not great either."
76561198052386020,Recommended,596910,30679392,Posted: 22 March,all,warpig107,"this is a fun story, it actually had me reading and thinking what should i do, and just the slightest change can cause massive upsets. it is awesome to just go over and over, see if you can bring the kingdom into a golden age or slay the dragon, (which i have yet to do X0) being diffrent races and doing diffent things in each senario though the story progresses the same, there are like 6 branch off stories that require you to meet certin criteria inorder to do, I suggest aiming to do each one in diffrent stories, you should be able to do 3 i think doing all 6 is the challenge. you have to pick the right things to train and know. and it is worth the cost and i would buy the other stories as well"

76561198150068649,Recommended,596910,31413762,Posted: 28 April,all,Acacia,This is a great little game. It is relatively quick to run through but is full of humour and interesting choices to make. It is fun to play and well written. :)

,Not Recommended,596910,34364451,Posted: 19 August,all,Jigsaw,"There has never been a choice of game I didn't like until this one. I couldn't even finish it, it was so bland. There was barely any story, it was just a series of questions. All relationships felt dry and boring and the I found myself just spam clicking to see where it went.Overall: 4/10"

If you love making important decisions and really feeling the weight behind them later, or seeing a smart move you made pay off later. then this type of game, and more specifically, this game, is for you."

,Recommended,596910,30589410,Posted: 18 March,all,Jon873,"A variety of choices, skills and companion selection make this a delightful game.While I may praise the game, there are some problems though like how the game is designed to make a particular skillset better than most. There's actually a guide for that and that with your companion selection, you'd want a dwarf as your warrior instead of like say, an elf because dwarfs give bonuses while elves do not. Kind of unfair, don't you think?But aside from that, the story does proceed in a typical save-the-kingdom-become-the-hero-never-marry-the-princess kind of fashion. Anything more? Nope."
,Recommended,596910,30594421,Posted: 18 March,all,Mosaic Dream,"Best game ever for wizards like me. Very nice usage of Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying system. Short enough to play the whole night and good enough to replay multiple times.10/10, classic text RPG."

76561198037101281,Recommended,596910,31192761,Posted: 16 April,all,lord wolfhunt,"The game has some narrative but it feels mostly sandbox.This game is really fun to just play and mess around with what you can do as a wizard. It is silly at times, really fun at others. You have so many options in terms of Race, Familiars, friends, magic styles, knowledge styles, and romances. The romances tend to feel the same no matter what you do but that is fine. Different events are given to you depending on your decisions and circumstances. Is your character a goblin? He will meet up with some later in the game. Did your wizard learn to fight with his fists? He has a chance to fight as a gladiator later in the game. Did you steal a crystal ball? It can be used as an alternative to other choices. The special goals you can go for are also generally pretty difficult, making achieving them feel like a puzzle, but with many, many different ways of achieving it.All in all, I really like this game. It's different from most games in this format. Very enjoyable."
76561198199248203,Recommended,596910,31653393,Posted: 9 May,all,Sadieam,"A very good game :) Well written and worth replaying, my only 'complaint' I would have is I wish there were more romance options and perhaps background music, just to help you get into the 'role' more. However music from Youtube can help with that last part XDOtherwise I would reccomend this to anyone who loves indepth RPGs and the wizarding theme."

76561198092116784,Recommended,596910,32400109,Posted: 13 June,all,Meep,"If you happen to love old pen and paper rpgs, but don't have the time or can't find a group this kind of game is ideal. Very short, but extremely replayable. This makes it a very good time killer once you've figured the game out, and need to fill a half hour or so.It's really not kidding when it says you can be anything, while you have to be an arcane magic user of some definition the story doesn't restrict you from being anything else. Along the well worn set path of the classic three part story arc you may find a particularly dastardly player character can lecture highwaymen on their job preformance or a noble's child might get special treatment. You could try dabbling in divine magics or leaning heavily on physical attributes or talking out problems whenever possible. Your every act ripples out into the story and after nearly fifty hours of this thing I'm still finding new options and new ways to live a wizards life.So, yeah, this is cool. :)"
