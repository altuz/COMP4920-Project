,Recommended,597170,30590166,Posted: 18 March,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"So I've followed this title on the top-seller list onItch.iofor a loooong time. Now that it's onSteamI had to see what all the fuss was about.---Clone Drone in the Danger Zonelikely gained popularity primarly fromTwitchstreamers, which automatically puts it in a fringe category thats not my usual jam.By 'fringe' I suppose I am loosely referring to games that get lots of knee-slap laughs and are quick and relatively lite. There is a even an option in-game to play withTwitchviewers interaction. I was also surprised to find that this title is only single player.Essentially, this is an 'arena' game where you fight wave-after-wave of enemies of increasing difficulty.There is a small but digestible skill tree of upgrades you choose from between each wave. You can get things like a jetpack, a fire sword, the ability to kick, more energy, etc. The choices are small, but they are potent which is all that matters. There are bosses and slightly different level layouts. The controls are fun and work well. Another interesting aspect is that there are robot commentators that say all kinds of semi-random and fun stuff that keep it fresh. This part probably did well with the streamers.Well, overall I found it enjoyable. I definitely see the appeal and will keep it, for sure. It's definitely something you play in short bursts. For instance, I've played for a mere 30-40 minutes before writing this, and that felt like a long time. That was over probably 6 play sessions. I enjoyed them all, but tire quickly after a burst.The one thing that I have to say is that it probably isn't worth $15. Yeah, it is well done and it isfun, but I think a $10 tag would sit better with me. I think the content is kind of slim for $15. The skill tree is quite limited, and the combat is relatively simple. There is no controller support, either.Pros:+It is fun. In fact, I think the trailer doesn't capture it well enough. You have to try this to actuallygetthe draw (or at least I did).+While there isn't much content, what is there is high quality. For example the skill tree is small, but the choices all make for interesting strategies and all change how you play the game.+Controls are good.+Robot commentators are both funny and a nice addition. Interesting and novel idea for this kind of game.Cons:-While it is well done, I think the price point is a tad high for the content offered. I think I'd like to see a bigger skill tree, different kinds of playable robots, and controller support.It's fun.If you find yourself on the fence, I bet you'd be glad you picked it up."

The game also has a challenge mode and an endless mode. It also has a variety of upgrades that give you a chance of what is to come. The annoucers are pretty unique and the enemies are even more unique.The developer actually helped me with a crash that I was having.Only problem is that it has a unity engine, which my computer hates.yeet son."

,Recommended,597170,34492686,Posted: 25 August,all,Water Soluble Raincoat,"If you are a fan of perma-death, upgrades and robot jokes, look no further. Clone Drone is very well made (with a few issues) and can soak up your time. Be warned, however, you will be frustrated during your journey into this game, but not due to any glitches or technical issues.Your human-bot is fragile.Any significant damage to your head will kill you.Lost both arms and have no kick? Dead.Take an arrow to the wrong area of your chest? Dead.Shot an arrow at a level 3 sword-bot at too close a distance? D-e-a-d.Lost a leg to some jetpack-bots and can't move far? Might as well be dead.Some people hate that kind of thing, but I'm a glutton for punishment, so I loved it.The next thing you should know is that there are several ways to play; there is the Story Mode, the 'classis' Endless Mode and the Challenge Modes.Story Mode is unfinished as of this review, but the developers are currently working on it, and it is a great way to introduce yourself to the concepts of the game.Endless Mode is just that, endless. Each of your human-bots are pitted against an endless supply of more and more difficult arenas that you have to survive (or die and use a clone to survive).Challenge Modes will put you through a set amount of arenas with restrictions, such as bow-only, hammer-only and kick-only. There is also Steam Workshop support, so if you're into creating challenges to torture others, you can, or if you're a masochist like me you can take on those challenges.The gameplay starts simple but complicates in varying degrees. You start with a lazer sword and the movement speed of a Jazzercising grandmother, but each successfully completed level grants you one upgrade. You can choose to make your sword a fire sword which gradually burns away bits of your enemies for a bleed-like effect, or give yourself a bow, which gives you a slow-moving but effective projectile at dispatching enemy archers and flame raptors (No, that's not a typo).Alternatively you can use the upgrade points to create 'clones' of your human-bot. These serve as your extra lives, and you are limited to 5 total per run. Period. Recently the developers added a 'repair' function as well that you can spend your well-earned point on.The upgrade point system is where some will get frustrated, and others intrigued. For example, do I risk not having a clone for the start of the Gold-difficuty levels and buy the booster-style jetpack, or do I play it safe in case I get ambushed in the next level and die? The wrong choice could end your run, but then again, your personal skill will do you in just as quickly.Since this game is Early Access, I can only imagine that things will expand and get better as time moves on. There aren't many gamebreaking glitches to speak of, so the real make-or-break factor for this title is taste: The concept and gameplay of this game is a love-or-hate ordeal, so watch the gameplay before you buy."
76561198173175151,Recommended,597170,32664810,Posted: 22 June,all,Kepler68,"this is an amazing and at times unforgiving game :Ddespite being unfinished, the game has a huge amount of polish and few, if any, bugs. furthermore there is a large variety of both enemies and levels.the game itself eases the player in with the story levels but it quickly becomes apparent the game is unforgiving. however, it feels fair and every enemy has a weakness or strategy that they simply cannot defend against.and the game is still being developed! an amazing game that will keep you occupied for hours!9/10 :D"
76561198211628756,Recommended,597170,30742224,Posted: 25 March,all,Darkshadow981,"I just love this game. It has funny dialogue, a decent combat system, and a pretty large variety of upgrades. Each robot human has their own occupation, age, and favorite color, which may not seem like anything important, but still adds diversity to the game.The controls work after getting used to them. You can lose almost every body part and still keeping working.(losing limbs may provide disadvantages.) One thing that I found out about this game is the strategies. They change based on your experience in the game, until you form the most efficient techniques. I love how rage inducing and comedic this game can be. To explain my feelings toward this game, I will divide my text into four sections.(Useful info: the arena has five tiers, which are bronze, silver, gold, diamond, and titanium.) (Also, if you hate long text, then stop reading.)Story Mode- (without spoilers) This mode is a good introduction to the game. It contains an adequate difficulty curve and the story serves its purpose to make you continue. The basic rundown is that humans are being harvested, humans are being used for gladitorial entertainment, and you can not escape. Until they update this even more (I know the game is early acces) it will not contain the most playtime in the game. (but still check it out)Twitch Mode- Beforehand, let me notify you that I am not a twitch streamer. This mode is the most multiplayer esc mode. One person will livestream this and the viewers can bet on the streamers death, spawn enemies, and can make the crowd put out emojis. (the different robots sitting in the arena have emojis over their head) Also, the viewers can give the streamer clones.(max five) They can also bet on which tier they die on. This is a jam packed mode, but the viewers can be relentless. The streamer will almost always die before gold tier. This may need some balancing, but please note that I haven't done this mode.Endless mode- Probably the best mode. (This or challenge mode) This is an endless gamemode (hence the name) that will progress you through the 5 tiers. The titanium tier will go on forever until you die. Each level you beat gives you one upgrade. (As goes everymode, I forgot to say this) Endless mode contains a fair difficulty curve, until you reach titanium. When you reach titanium, the game doesn't get any harder, which kinda sucks. This doesn't matter because titanium still is really difficult. You can test out strategies, mess around, or get serious and aim for a pb. (Mine is titanium 44, I beat 43 with one missing leg and another VERY small stub leg, oh, and a missing arm, quite a formidable score.) I spent probably the second most amount of time on this mode. (This will change because I will always go back to this mode). I highly recommend getting this game just for this mode.Challenge mode- I LOVED this. The challenges had variety and I would love more. Challenge mode currently contains four challenges. 1. The Inferno Challenge- In order to obtain (one of the best perks) flame breath, you must go through 10 stages of fierceful, flaming enemies that give you no room for error. This challenge was exciting and pretty difficult. For me this was the easiest, but for others, this seemed like the second hardest. 2.Random Upgrade Challenge- This one is all on the RNG and can be very rage inducing. I personally felt that this challenge was the hardest and took me the longest. I  decided to watch a video of someone trying it and laugh at them. (They beat it in their second try :(   ) This just gives you a trophy and is necessary for all of those completionists, so good luck ;). 3. Bow only Challenge- This challenge is self explanatory, you can only use a bow. Bow only is one of the most gamechanging challeges because some bots can block arrows.(you will find out how to kill those) The general opinion seems to be that this is the hardest challenge and I can agree. You will develop new strategies and manage to (not) make it to the top. Beating this gives you flame arrows, probably the worst of the 3 unlockable upgrades.(It isn't a bad upgrade, just the worst of the 3) 4. Hammer Challenge- As expected, one may only use a hammer. This was a pretty easy challenge after getting the hammer controls down. The Hammer Challenge unlocks a flaming hammer, which is fun to go around and crush people with. Note:All of these challenges give you trophies that will be next to your upgrade station.All in all, this game has the already great content and even better potential. I thank the developers and urge them to continue updating this masterpiece. (My apologies for any missed information and scattered thoughts.) Oh, and by the way, I know this is unexpected, but I recommend this game. ""Such robot diversity"""

The story is interesting and has a good concept, the gameplay is awesome, you get to play as a human with the body of a robot and you're in an arena where you have to battle robots in order to survive, you get to use a multitude of weapons including a hammer, a sword, and a bow, but you can also kick other robots, use a jetpack, breathe fire! There are three modes so far: story which I already mentioned, endless mode which is fun and very hard, and twitch mode where viewers can spawn enemy robots to kill you, viewers also have coins which they can use to bet on if you survive a certain round or die and if they think you'll die what they think will kill you.Honestly i think you should buy this game."

Really easy to pick up. No tutorial needed because you learn as you go. Hilarious commentary by the commentators. Totally worth the money even if it just remained in its current state forever. The fact that it's still being developed means you should definitely pick it up if you enjoy a relatively mindless sword, hammer and arrow bash."

It also has a great decapitation mechanic, so there's no bothersome health bars or a number that you have to pay attention to to see how much life you have left. This means that you could potentially one-hit the most powerful boss in the game, and the tiniest little minion robot could in turn one-shot you. It's also got two commentators who are hilarious and have the funny text-to-speech voices. It is an awesome game and you should play it."

76561198082578567,Recommended,597170,31798905,Posted: 16 May,all,Tommy the Cat,"This is one of those games where, if you practice enough to get good, you can make a lot of progress. Then, you inevitably lose to something foolish. finally, when you start back at the beginning, the enemies at this point are so different in regards to how accurate they are and how fast they can attack. it's almost impossible to go from the silver tier back down to bronze and make any progress after. So basically, unless you are already in a good mood or have infinite patience, this game will be fun-right up until you make the smallest error. Then you lose a limb, which takes away any upgrades that you've already purchased that utilize that limb. If you survive that round, then to get your limbs and upgrades back you must forfeit your next upgrade to purchase a clone.These are just issues I've noticed playing. It seems to me that too much emphasis is placed on the importance of purchasing clones, rather than upgrades that you can then learn to use to survive longer. My recommendation to the programming team; maybe repair the player's robot between matches? or maybe just replace 1 missing limb?I very much like how balanced the gameplay is and that the game runs very smoothly, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes arena-style gameplay; just make sure that you're in a good mood, because every mistake is punished severely..."

The controls and gameplay are simple enough to understand quickly while allowing the difficulty to ramp up with numbers and more difficult bots.

It's such an ingenious system and I'd love to see more games implement systems like it.Is it perfect? Of course not.

I saw gameplay of it from some Youtubers and althought it looked like fun, $15 was almost too much. But i am so glad I bought it and its worth every cent. Very difficult to master and the challenges make for more fun and force you to use different tactics. It has just started to lag a little bit for me, but other than that I have had no problems with the game."

Anyways, this game has more pros then cons and I would highly recommend this game for anyone who likes Hack 'n slash, arena, or voxel games. The damage system is also quite fun. :D"

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

Its not like The Elder Scrolls where once your fully upgrade everything is easy. Its always a challenge. You can upgrade diffrently every time. If your bored then download a workshop challenge! I do have some recomendations though! 1st. They should make the robots not jump alot because if your up aginst a level 3 hammer bot they jump and swing to the side. The Hammer is so big you cant dodge it! 2nd. I think they sound make a pvp arena and teamwork mode. 3rd it would also be really cool if they made a championship. 4th. When your testing out a level and you die it needs to make it where your restart by the upgrade bot because I can make a Dimond level then get sent back out there with nothing

If Mark 3 or 4 sword robots are spawned you wouldn't be able to kill them without the kick upgrade because they just deflect all of your arrows. Even if you do have the kick upgrade, it's still risky getting close enough to a high ranking robot such as a Mark 3 or 4 robot to kick them down. Even when you kick the robot down, it's still difficult to land a killing blow with an arrow because the Mark 3 and 4 robots get up very quickly.But overall, I really recommend this game to people who are fans of arena fighting games."

You can between every level upgrade your gear/abilaty or make a clone (hint in tittle) so if you die in the arena you can return and don´t need to start all over again... couse that´s what´s gonna happen if you don´t. Spolier shown in the trailer.PLAYSTYLE:At the moment you have a few different categories of playstyles to chose from:Story:Playing through levels of differnet difficulties and somewhere find a story (not like AAA kind of story but a understandeble story).SPOILERS: The story isn´t completed yet.Chalenges:Playing through levels of different difficulties but with at twist depending on what chalenge you chose. Most of them are for a specific weapon which will unlock cool abileties conected to that weapon after completed the whole series of levels (10 - 14 levels).Twitch mode:Pretty obvious, but in simple terms; you play with your stream and the viewers can chose which enemis will come next or choose your upgrades (never trust your viewers in this mode >:D).HOW IT FEELS PLAYINGIt feels pretty solid but has a few bugs that are sometimes funny to experience. It has a few frame drops at certain placese but that might just be my pc (a high preformence pc...)CONCLUSION:It´s a good blocky-indie-fighting-game with funny comentary by robots who can´t be killed (yes I have tried) and has it´s charm when playing.I do deffenetly recomend this game at full price when it´s completed...But at the moment the game is in the summer sale with a 33% off so you could save some bucks on it now as well.Still your choise and not mine but I think you should if you like what you see in those trailers above this review. they are showing real gameplay.Can you save humanity from beeing harvested and put into robots to only fight against other robots for someones plesure which we don´t really know who it is?If you buy this game you can..."

The first levels are easy enough on campaign, but aren't really a tutorial.Having to invest skill points into extra lives on the challenges. You're either so good at the game that you don't need extra lives for the challenges or you're not and you lose valuable upgrade points to gimp yourself for the next fight because of buying clones.

For anyone who wants a game with solid melee mechanics, I wholeheartedly recommend this one.Pros:♥ Very challenging at times. You will need to make the correct decisions about upgrading in the challenge modes♥ Some funny dialogue from the commentators♥ Fun upgrades, particularly for the sword and bow♥ A lot of fun enemies to fight♥ Great and reliable combat systemCons:♥ The story mode gets a bit repetetive. I get that's the point, but going through the early levels again & again is a bit tiresome. To be clear, once you clear a certain number, you do get a ""checkpoint,"" so no need to go through the WHOLE game again.♥ Some upgrades feel more viable than others, which tend to just go ignored. For example - the hammer, despite its cool ability, feels supremely inferior to the sword.♥ Some higher level enemies (such as the raptor or hammer bots) don't feel very challenging. Probably dependent on playstyle though.♥ A bit more music variety would be nice, as the combat track does get somewhat repetetive after a while.All in all, well worth the money, in my opinion."

76561198008446101,Recommended,597170,33780580,Posted: 24 July,all,Menteser,"Deffinetly worth it.The game is about fighting different kinds of robots in various arenas.After each won round you get an upgrade point to put into a skill or weapon and their upgrades - so far sword, hammer and bow. But you can also use jetpacks, kicks, flame breath... That being said, you can defeat any level without a single upgrade, in theory.Upgrades help, add to your tactics (some weapons are better against some opponents), but you can use just a basic sword and environment to your advantage - sawblades, spikes, lava... Having Kick ability can be very handy in that regard. But the environment can be used against you, too.Everything is voxel based, so you can dismember (and be dismembered) during fights. It's cute to see those huge hammer bots skipping after you after you cut off one of their legs. And it's oddly satisfactory to cut off legs of spider bots bit by bit.Completing challenges unlocks additional weapon upgrades (fiery weapons), which at first look just like a visual improvement, but in fact make them much more powerful.Also, Steam workshop levels added, brings in some freshness to the game.In short: buy it, try it, you won't regret it.One thing it lacks - multiplayer. Devs, please add multiplayer, would be awesome."

This here is the ""robot fighting combat arena of fire and death."" or the actual official title of the game. This game is one of those titles where it's easy to learn, but hard to master. Loads of upgrades, tons of different enemies to fight, and many battle arenas.Even at early access this game is pretty enjoyable to play. I spent many hours cutting, smashing, and shooting my way through many robotic foes to survive as long as possible. I rate this wonderful gem a 10/10.So are you up for the challange to face the danger zone?"

Also the workshop creations are great.

,Recommended,597170,35184637,Posted: 24 September,all,Lewis,"Review made on the 24th september 2017The short Version:It's a great casual game that has a lot of potential and is worth the money.The in-depth version:Clone drone in the danger zone is a indie fighting game where you play as humans who's minds are put into robot bodys. There are 4 modes to this game.There is story mode where you fight robots and try to escape the arena.There is also the endless mode where you fight robots till you die. There is also a variation of endless where there are challenges set and if you finish them you get trophies and some special abilitys.The final mode requires a twitch account, in this mode you play endless and the audience (people on twitch) vote on how you will die.The main reason you should buy this game is for what is to come as there is great potential for this game and they are adding new features on the 29th of september (2017)"

76561198078552894,Recommended,597170,34456924,Posted: 24 August,all,Letoo,"Guess its time to write down my review of the game.I played the living hell out of it, managed to beat every challenge and a lot of community challenges aswell.Before i get started, everyone who doesnt enjoy reading, i recorded every single bit of it and uploaded my commentary to YT here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY9H_jsai9M&list=PLMYAv8aq_acHxs1KqrC4XtubjMjoNmoV5Now lets get started shall we?Pros:-Quirky and charming graphic-Pretty good combat system, with great ""slice"" physics-Engaging storyline (only 2 chapters at the moment unfortunately)-Pretty funny commentators-Great level builder-A lot of different enemy types that require different strategiesCons:-Updates tend to be a bit slow, not enough communication from the developers-Commentators are a lot of fun at the beginning, but it gets repetitive and annoying-Combat animations are still a bit bugged from time to time, so you can get hit when you shouldnt-Missing a robot customization, but that is a personal preference-AI tends to be a bit stupid, jumping into the lava. I beat levels without doing a single hitConclusion:The game offers a lot of potential, with the good combat system that allows you to slice enemys apart and cripple them, you might have a lot of fun. The levels are well designed, and some challenges are really hard to beat so you have to make up a good strategy. Thanks to the level editor and the workshop, you get an infinite flow of challenges to beat. Unfortunately, i've been waiting for the third story chapter quite a while now... and there isnt any sign of it coming soon. That is the only reason why i have mixed feelings about this game. After all, it was worth the 20 bucks and i had a great time.TL;DR:Freaking jedi robots and flame spitting robot dinosaurs!"

Or, you can burn them to crisps!The music and sound affects are pretty decent!The graphics are pretty good.The gameplay is quite fun!Multiplayer is planned in the future.Level editor, and steam workshop to share levels and challenges!Has a work in progress story mode, 3 chapters so far that tell a quite interesting story!Twitch mode, letting your viewers spawn enemies to kill you, and letting them bet on what you'll die to, and letting them give you extra clones, things like that.I give this game a 9+/10."
