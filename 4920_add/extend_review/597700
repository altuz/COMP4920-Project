Really worth a grab, especially on sale.The GoodEfficient game with simple yet original mechanics.Impressive visual design for such a simple game, again very efficient.Difficulty is quite reasonable, you will struggle if you are bad at gaming like me but nothing to keep you from progressing for a significant amount of time.Frequent checkpoints that make it so you don't come too far back when you 'die'.Tutorials available in the first level but the help is not obnoxious and lets you figure out things yourself.Supports both WASD and arrow controls, allowing for versatility.Awesome and calm music.The NeutralIt's a casual game. Your only enemies are spikes in the decor, and your own clumsiness.It's in black and white, and only black or white. You like it or you don't.The progress in difficulty is very subtle, nothing too challenging overall.The BadThe levels are very linear. This means, yes, that you can't really get 'lost' in a level, but it also means low replayability.It's quite a short game. I'm not at the end of it yet but I don't think I will get more than a couple of hours out of it, considering that I already have roughly 1/3 of the achievements unlocked and I've played for an hour so far.If you like simple puzzle platformers with innovative yet simple mechanics, such as Pixeljunk Eden or Thomas Was Alone, this game is for you."

And here came OVIVO - the perfect helper for my little escapism desire.Plain and simple, but very fascinating, the game drags you into hypnotic and enchanting journey and drugs you by its lovely athmospheric music and art.Tbh, during the first part of the game, I was thinking that I'll be bored by monotonous gameplay. I was wrong. I hate spoilers so I can only tell that there are a lot more in this game than it looks like on the beginning.It's a piece of art so play it wisely, when you have a spare time and nothing disturbs you. I was disrupted in the middle of the game and that really sucked. I wish I could've relished it without interruptions.OVIVO is a nice product for any age, gender or language.Liked it."

Some levels have difficult (in a good way) moments, so this game can give you a challenge.Visuals are stunning and what is more important - they have sense, not just beautiful black and white pictures but a pure art.This game is a hidden gem. Don't miss it!"
76561198046564108,Recommended,597700,31729898,Posted: 13 May,all,Raven,"Quite an unusual game, fantastic visual design! It feels like half a post modern art installation and half a puzzle-platformer.Although the core gameplay mechanic is very simple(you switch between two colors) they've managed to build surprisingly rich set of different gameplay elements with it.Art design is definitely something. The amount of hidden references and allusions is just mind blowing and I definitely haven't spotted all of them.Special praise for the soundtrack, it goes perfectly with both the general feel of the game and specifics of each level.There are definitely a few rough edges like uneven difficulty of levels: some places just felt unproportionally hard even to the point of frustration and my fingers started to hurt quite a bit(although I'm not very good with platformers tbh). I really liked the way it played at the beginning when everything was easy and playing it felt like going through a smooth flow especially with the kind of music they have there - this soft and chill electronics. Really liked it.. until I started dying 10 times in a row. lol. Buut at the end it worth it.And I felt like the duration is perfect: takes slightly more that 2 hours to finish. Enough to be a complete experience and not too long to get bored.Overall definitely highly recommend to try it out."

Absolutely *amazing* soundtrack. I did a small game by myself, and boy I know how hard it is to come up with a background music! OVIVO's soundtrack is not only beautiful by itself, but uniquely matching to the gameWell done, IZHARD! It's a pleasure to play OVIVO!"

Simple rules, yet hard levels.My mind literally blew up several times - when the music started at second level,  when upon completing the first level the camera moved away and showed the vast world around your path.Also, I cannot stop feeling that there are a lot of hint and allusions behind its innuendo. Cryptic messages you receive upon getting achievement give you a hint about the old world - now destroyed and forgotten, with only symbols left."

It's about exploring beautiful hand-drawn artwork first-and-foremost, using a fun and unique movement mechanic. The black+white switching is fun, intuitive and fluid.The game isn't very hard since death usually only sets you back a few seconds. The ""platforming"" requires some thought and uses the mechanics to good effect, but anyone should be able to beat it with little trouble.Basically, if you saw the trailer and thought ""That looks cool"", the game will be exactly what you were hoping for."

,Recommended,597700,31744655,Posted: 14 May,all,sorakoto,"One BGM per level, Only 3 Keys are used, Black and White, No Hints, Atmospheric and abstract ... All of these looks fatal to a traditional game.BUT when they all come together, the chemical reaction took place. Impressive, graceful and prefect, these are words I use to describe this game.Thank you staff. You've made a great game."
,Recommended,597700,31733872,Posted: 13 May,all,zmish93,This is very good game. Artstyle and music are astonishing! And even gameplay is very interesting (though at the beginning it may seems that it will be boring and monotonous then you're realizing that almost each 'chapter' there is new gameplay mechanic). Game is easy and relatively short (it took 2.5 hours to finish it and get all achievements) but in my opinion short game is better than big long game with the same mechanic each level.
,Recommended,597700,33563473,Posted: 15 July,all,Dravvad,"A very simple game that is relaxing to play. It may take you a little bit to get used to the mechanics of the game, but for the most part, it will not be that difficult for you. OVIVO is a platformer that is quite different from others, in that it seems grounded in metaphysics.All of the game's visuals are in the colors of black or white. You control a little ball (named as OVO) that has what could look like an antenna coming from the top of its head. You only have 2 actions to perform: move left or right with the arrow keys, or perform a color switch with the spacebar.When you press the spacebar, OVO will alternate to the opposite color of what it currently is, and this will also alternate the direction of gravity. The gravity will make you stop when OVO hits an object of the same color as itself. Otherwise, OVO will simply fall forever (or fly upwards forever) through the opposite color's background. If you fall out of bounds, OVO will eventually respawn.Doing these color changes and reversal of gravity allow you to actually perform jumps and other mechanics, because you can fall through hills and come back up through even larger hills, for instance.There is an introduction level to the game, as well as 9 other levels. Each new level tends to add new mechanics to the game, such as black hole objects which will suck you in and then shoot you back out, or other obstacles that will make you respawn.Note that the game is not that difficult because there is a large amount of checkpoints throughout the game, so you are not sent far back through the level whenever you respawn. Further, the levels are mostly linear, except for some collectibles which will be addressed shortly.As can be seen in screenshots or videos, the levels are very artistically-designed. There are many different types of objects you can encounter, many of which are hidden out of the way or are somewhat difficult to recognize because of the game's use of only black and white.Lastly, the game has some collectibles for you to find, which are not extremely difficult. Each level has 3 symbols that you can find, as well as an arbitrary number of dots. When you are in a level, you can look at the Pause screen and see the number of dots that are in the level. As you collect the dots, they will grow larger on the Pause screen, going from left to right, and will color themselves as black or white. Once all of them are larger than the initial size, then you will know you have collected all for the level.The only detail I can say about the collectibles is to pay attention to them - take a little bit of time to think about them and what the game tells you when you find them.Overall, OVIVO was a very interesting game to play. While it was only a few hours to fully complete, I enjoyed it very much, and hope that more will come to it in the future."
,Recommended,597700,33266051,Posted: 5 July,all,Sloria,"Very addictive, minimalist and artistic game. Every level was created with special focus on the beauty of the design, it's worth buying when you want to have a time killer and an artwork at the same time."
,Recommended,597700,31785545,Posted: 16 May,all,ホースラヴァー,"Simple, relaxing and pleasant to your eyes and ears. While early levels are rather simple and won't pose almost any challenge, a few dozens of minutes later the game gets mildly challenging at times without getting frustrating or boring. The graphics and audio are rather minimalistic, but they're used wisely and never fill your screen with unnecessary clutter, so navigating through levels feels natural and chances of getting stuck are extremely low.Tech-wise, this game works nicely even on integrated GPUs without any noticeable framerate drops/slowdown, but sometimes I get screen tearing on my rig, so forcing VSync through the GPU drivers is a good idea."
76561198007821207,Recommended,597700,31715589,Posted: 12 May,all,IntoTheSky,"Played for about an hour and I love this game. I've been following it since Gamescom (or maybe PAX?) last summer and I'm really happy with the way it turned out. Controls feels great, fluid, and simple. The level design and artwork are one in the same and spectacular, even though the game is only black and white. No tutorials or dialog, but the ""tutorial"" is incredibly well executed and the difficulty ramps up at a nice rate. Good, challenging, and fun."
,Recommended,597700,33552884,Posted: 14 July,all,Frey,"Very cool game. Everything is well-though around the main gameplay principle. Feels minimalistic but the graphics, audio and ambience are quite sophisticated. It was a pleasure going through all levels, with new gameplay mechanics introduced throughout the game. Only con: it's a bit short, I want more!"

Yet you'll be surprised how much more challenging it becomes in further levels. The music will blow your mind! Each level presents you with an unique soundtrack, which all alter overall feel of the game in most mesmerizing ways. One of the best experience I've ever had playing an arcade game. Like really.. EVER."
76561198040882512,Recommended,597700,33046366,Posted: 30 June,all,Act,"Providing empirical evidence that I am not simply a curmudgeon who hates artsy puzzle games, OVIVO! Its bold, minimalist, black-and-white visual style was really evocative, its music was just right, and the level design was excellent. Its simple premise -- switch the gravity of the black-and-white world by pressing the spacebar -- evolved in such interesting ways, skillfully building on itself as time went on. I liked that it was flush with checkpoints, letting me do crazy things with the gravity without having to worry about being sent back to the start, and the symbols were cleverly hidden but findable. It's almost miraculous to have a game where I can find everything without a walkthrough that explains you have to hold your computer out a window while counting backward from 10 and sacrificing a chicken to get the last gem, but here we are: actual competent game design. OVIVO definitely isn't for anyone, but if visual interest and clever mechanics are up your alley, and you don't mind the artsiness of it, this is one to check out."
,Recommended,597700,33567191,Posted: 15 July,all,Joey,Really relaxing yet challenging platformer with unique and fluid mechanics and incredible minimalistic designYou have about 12 levels where you basically play in a huge intricate black and white painting which is revealed to you after completeing said level. Which blew my mind more often than not. I often just sat there for minutes looking at the amazing art after finishing a level.It even has basic 21 by 9 resolution support! Besides some minor pop-in and menu cutting everything works perfectly! Nothing game breaking at all.Please check out at least the demo if it seems interesting! You have nothing to lose!

,Recommended,597700,33233493,Posted: 4 July,all,Vinrafel,"Video Reviewhttps://youtu.be/6OgxVyoiIcMQuick InfoOVIVOis a really interesting piece when you look at the level design and aesthetics. The melding of art and level is a textbook case of good level design and the gameplay, although not revolutionary in any way, succeeds at engaging for the entirety of the game. While there are problems with the visuals throughout the actual gameplay, it is not a deal-breaker for this game. The usual price tag of eight dollars should put off most who aren’t looking towards the artistic side of this game, but it is justifiable to those who really want to see what this game has to offer. If it’s on sale then there is no excuse to not give this game a look.OVIVOis worth the playtime.For more info see the review above.Or, read the full review at:Vinrafel"

,Recommended,597700,34957915,Posted: 14 September,all,Snivets,"My goodness this game is simply stunning. The visual style speaks for itself; if you're interested in this almost sort of Native American or tribal white-on-black starkness, you know this game is for you already and you should play it. The mechanics feel just like they should and there's only one annoying bit where left and right get reversed (I raged a little bit). The music is great but they are fixed songs on loops, not responsive to your actions or the progression of the level as in 140 for example. Still, excellent compositions that fit the game's mood perfectly.I'll use this space to recommend a few similar things that are adjacently awesome:140 is a game by one of the Playdead guys that has a similarly stark art style but with a simply amazing synthesizer soundtrack.ibb & obb has a similar sense of reversable momentum, except designed around co-op and with the exact opposite color palatte (which is to say, lots of colors and gradients)PixelJunk Eden is a similarly bouncy platformer with tons of vector-based graphics on stark color palattesAbsolute Drift if you want a stark game but with drifty car mechanics for some reason"
