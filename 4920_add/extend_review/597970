Other people have described it well, so I'll just point out how stupid it is to complain that unlocking cards is a grind.  You unlock cards by PLAYING THE GAME.  This is a good thing.  You want to play the game because it is super good.  Since the cards are added as you earn gold by winning, the game is constantly changing.  WoW is a grind because you do something unrelated and stupid to be able to get to the endgame that is the point of playing.  Here you are PLAYING THE GAME."

I love how there are so many equally viable strategies and success is determined by whomever can best adapt to the given situation than who has the biggest card collection.I also love how the devs have gone to great lengths to making their cute little freemium game a real premium one by taking out all IAPs and making it much easier to earn gold for boosters."
76561198167396387,Recommended,597970,31943947,Posted: 24 May,all,Nasst,"I fell in love with this little game. Let me explain why.First of all, this is no CCG. The game is pretty much a virtual board game, with some unlocks to try to keep things simple at the beggining. No in-app purcheases means that everything is unlocked very quickly, since there's no incentive for the developers to make you grind.The game is quick yet highly complex mechanically. Expect some moments where you're left wondering what happened after some interactions of cards. And there are some mechanics that you'll only find out about by reading the in-game rulebook (which is short, but very informative). I found no bugs so far, which is fairly impressive given the mechanical depth.Luck seems really important at first, when you're still learning about the game. As your skill improves, it becomes clear that this game is first and foremost a skill game. The implementation of randomness makes every game feel unique.At the moment matchmaking is *very* quick (15 to 20 seconds). The hard AI is also quite competent if you'd rather play singleplayer."

It's kind of like a head-to-head collectible card game version of Civilization, and for those who like that sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they like!"
,Recommended,597970,33465078,Posted: 11 July,all,Manbeast,Surprisingly deep card game. A lot of the randomness is off-set by a clever economic system that favors making use of discounts from resources over a flat increase in income and by the excellent four-round system that allows for both rushing and long-term strategies.Ran into a few bugs but these were all patched out within 48 hours of me reporting them.Lots of negative reviews complain about having to unlock cards. I don't think this is an issue as you never get duplicates and there's no P2W aspect as you cannot buy packs with real money. As long as you keep completing quests you should have all cards and Rivals unlocked in no time at all. And  starting this game with only some basic cards also prevents new players from getting overwhelmed with tactical options.Highly recommended.
76561198035303509,Recommended,597970,31350377,Posted: 24 April,all,rod-,"Age of Rivals is a very clean drafting game that feels like a 2-player version of 7 Wonders.There are always some decisions to make, although just like most drafting games, there aren't always multiple good options.The balance of strategic decisions and tactical decisions can be a lot of fun -- would you rather build your economy or attack your opponent's?  Is it better to take the card that copies your opponent's choice or the one that negates it?Being able to see your opponent's draft options [and occasionally being passed their leftovers] makes for some nice next-level metagaming, as well.  Overall the card design is engaging, although there are in my opinion the balance of economic vs non-economic cards gets worse as you unlock more and more cards [very few of which are economic].Overall very recommended, well worth the admission price.  As of now I have unlocked all of the content but am failing to finish the campaign mode due to a very unbalanced mission that requires some amazing luck to finish.  It might keep me coming back, or i might be done for now, but either way, 14h for $10 is a steal."
,Recommended,597970,30783417,Posted: 27 March,all,peasant,"Simple, quick and fun. You can try it for free at Kongregate and the game is AFAIK nearly identical. It's a drafting game, games are quick and there is a nice mix of short time tactics and long term strategy. There is a good amount of skill to be had, I tried playing this when I was tired and got pwned. It's easy to get a game against a human, but the AI is strong too. There is a collection aspect to the game that I'm a little unsure of, but apparently this is much less grindy on the steam version than on the original kongregate game. This comes very highly recommended!"

I suppose it would be classified as a deck building game, but the way it plays out is very unique (from what I have played) and the mechanics fit the theme of a clash of two civilizations. At the moment I am finding games in multiplayer with very little waiting.One downside is that there isn't much card art as all of the cards in each of the 9 or so categories have the same picture. The art that is there is good though."

,Recommended,597970,30681437,Posted: 23 March,all,Fake Squid,"I bought this game at full price right after a sale ended, but I'm not even mad- it's absolutely worth the asking price!What we have here is a really well-crafted card game, with a board game feel and some wonderful design work. Each game feels quite unique due to the cards that come into play making reappearances later on- I think it is fun to imagine a story to go along with each game and strategic play, as towers crumble to angry mobs, trade routes form and gain monopoly on desired resources, and empires resort to thieving and over-taxation out of desperation.I did want to touch on something a lot of people have talked about, though. There are complaints out there that this game is ""too random"". In certain gaming circles, ""random"" is pretty much a dirty word- people want their games to be entirely deterministic, but I believe this should not always be the case. Chance is a big factor in many famous games, both videogames and otherwise, and there is nothing wrong with using randomness as an element of your game's design *if* it is balanced well. If it isn't, it's extremely frustrating and pointless, but when it is, it can be an integral and fun game mechanic *while still feeling fair*.The game does utilize some randomness, especially in the drafting mechanic, but it uses that to it's advantage. Instead of being a card game where you have to painstakingly handcraft your deck and worry about being countered by someone else's and losing before you've even started playing, in this game you are building your deck as you play- building your deck *is the game*. The interesting twist on this title from other deckbuilders is that you have to work with what the game gives you. You'll end up playing quite interesting strategies sometimes due to the cards that come into play, and you also are given a lot of chances to try and counter the opponents deck as they are building it (though they might try to do the same to you!).There's also an element of risk-management in the element of chance in some card's effects, but you are meant to either use probability to your advantage (e.g. playing only one card of a type to guarantee it receives a certain buff), or take the chance of a negative outcome as the cost of playing a certain (usually more greedy) way- there has obviously been a lot of thought into the balance of when a little randomness could both help the card's balance and add some interesting strategic plays and moments to the game. I understand that gamers see all randomness as a horrible force of evil, but it can have some very interesting design implications, and if well tested and balanced the results can be a game that's even more balanced, replayable, and fun than a game that is entirely deterministic.This all comes down to personal taste, of course, but you can't deny that the devs have cared a lot about making each card feel fair to the game, and the synergies between them are where this game really shines.The only complaint I have about this game is that each card lacks a bit of personality- this is because each card as the same type-based artwork which, while quite pretty and identifiable, doesn't help make the cards stand out from one another or feel unique. I also think it would be neat if the cards each had a little flavor text, or even a fact from history, to give them even more flair (and give you something to look at while you're opponents make their move. I have asked the devs about this, and they are on board with the idea of adding flavor text in the future, and haven't ruled at doing individual card art at a later date, so I don't think this should be a dealbreaker, especially given the continuous dedication to the game the devs have shown.In conclusion, this game is absolutely worth a buy, especially if you enjoy deckbuilding games and want to try an interesting twist, or want to try a really well designed one out for your first foray into the genre :)"

And oddly no freemium mechanic, i was surprised at first when i saw i needed gold to unlock in game stuff... and then PLEASANTLY surprised when i saw you couldn't spend money on gold! It all comes from playing the game, challenges, online, AI, etc. Back to the good old days of when you had to play instead of pay for more in game content.Solid online multiplayer experience too, enjoying it so far"
76561197983547079,Recommended,597970,31630398,Posted: 8 May,all,desync,"This is a really fun card game that I highly recommend. From what I gather this is like 7 Wonders meets Magic The Gathering where it takes the concept of blockers and allows the defender to determine what structure/cards takes damage.Pros:- Really easy to unlock new cards- Very good matchmaking- Can play against hard AI to earn gold or actual players- Will earn gold even if you lose (hard ai/player) if you do not concede. This is very nice feature because you do not feel like you have wasted time like with many other CCGs- Has Booster packs but the game only gives you cards that you actually need (you might see the same rival card more than once but its actually unlocking new slots that you need!)- I love that this game features 'simulatenous turns'. So both players play at the same time. Lot less downtime then competition!!- Really deep strategy and it allows you to pick guaranteed cards (so you don't technically build a deck but you have some minor control over certain cards appearing and if you don't buy it the opponent can!! LOL Brilliant!)- Has daily quests but they do not feel punishing in the least or tedious. You are never forced to play an awful quest from what I can tellCons (I really cant think of anything I dislike):- Make more fancy audio/vfx (but it is still very, very good work here; just lacking intro animations)- I have trouble connecting from work (need to contact the dev about this-- I really blame my company for this)- There are some RNG effectsThis is a really awesome game that I would love to see get more exposure so we can get even more content in the future. I really can't praise this game enough."

I play mostly 4x and Grand Strategy type games, but I also enjoy quite a bit of Overwatch and Hearthstone. Off the screen, I play a lot of tabletop card and board games.This here Age of Rivals is really really good. Especially if you already play Hearthstone, Magic the Gathering, or other CCG type games, you will fit right into this. (Especially Hearthstone--this game, like that one, has effects that couldn't really be carried out in a non-online game, like cards morphing into other cards etc. Also, heroes with special cards. And this one adds an aspect of cards being permanently altered even when returned to the deck.)The game is intuitive, invites deep gameplay, makes thematic sense, offers multiple paths to victory. And it plays quick!I would like more people to buy this game please."

The basics of the game are easy to understand, yet there are always a number of different cards in play that could significantly alter the game and affect how you play, so it really requires some finesse.  Not only do you build out your own board, but you can hamper your opponent by blocking cards for them or destroying their combos.I haven't seen a game quite like Age of Rivals before and I'm enjoying it.  The devs are also quite helpful and are continuing to update the game and add more cards.  It's nice to know that the game will continue to evolve."

,Recommended,597970,33453607,Posted: 11 July,all,DarkChaplain,"I was looking forward to picking this one up ever since seeing Jesse Cox's Fan Friday on the game. Playing it myself, I got even more impressed by the game's mechanics and variety. There's a lot of interaction between the cards that makes it work on a vastly different level from other card games out there.Even Gwent with its 2-3 rounds per match and different rows doesn't reach Age of Rivals' complexity. However, the game remains extremely simple and intuitive despite it all. Card texts are crystal clear and after the first two rounds you'll already have the hang of the basic rules and design intentions, if not the finer strategical details. Go big on cash generation, excessive culture output or just keep the opponent down with devastating attacker cards? There are many ways to win and enough flexibility to adapt on the fly, due to it being a deck builder game. Synergies have to be planned for in advance to succeed in the later rounds, which is oddly satisfying to pull off.It feels inviting while offering a lot of strategic considerations that could make this game successful on a competitive level. For the time being though, I'm just happy being able to play it a couple of times a day for leisure. I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds for Age of Rivals."
,Recommended,597970,30765874,Posted: 26 March,all,FluffyMikeB,"Age of Rivals is a strategy card game. There is no play to win, in fact once you buy the game there isn't even an option to spend money on cards. You gain additional cards simply by playing the game. I love this feature, and wish more collective card games followed this structure.So how is the gameplay? It's very easy to learn, the tutorial is very hand holdy but perfectly explains everything there is to do with the game. And I strongly advise you do the tutorial as you get enough in game gold to buy your first couple card packs.That being said, this is a game that's deep as the Grand Canyon. There are several different ways to win a game. Decks can be influenced to be culture points oriented. Culture points are the easiest way to win, as you will get more of those by volume than anything else. You can be attack oriented, this works because you get points for the 'conquer' stage where attack matters. You also have a chance to knockout all your opponents cards before they have a chance to score. There are also so many support cards that add or subtract points, attack, defense, etc. Cards that influence your gold, cards that allow you to pick other like cards. Cards that synergize with each other to make greatest gains than they would alone. The strategy is seemingly endless.This game has both normal and hard difficulties for Single Player play. The AI is smart, even on normal. There are also challanges that allow you to get rare cards. The AI in challanges are purporsely well above even the 'hard' AI and will punish every little mistake you make.There is also muliplayer. You can play against a friend, or you can play a random person online. Playing online allows you to gain bonuses to your gold if you are in a faction. There is also a monthly leaderboard that rewards gold for people that dominate it.I have 32 hours in the game as I'm writing this and I just now unlocked every card available. There is plenty of bang for the buck. This is a highly recommended game for me."

76561197992929303,Recommended,597970,31583350,Posted: 6 May,all,dmeister,"Solid game that unfortunately might not get much attention because of the mediocre graphics and generic sounding name. It feels a bit like a two player version of 7 Wonders but mechanically plays very differently. As in 7 Wonders you are drafting and passing cards to your opponent over the course of the game, building your deck for the final fourth round to try and construct an impressive set of eight cards out of everything you've drafted previously. Also as in 7 Wonder the cost of cards is a mix of gold and resources and owning those resources makes it easier for you to buy related cards and earns you taxes from your opponent if they have to buy those resources from you. And like 7 Wonders the cards you draft become more powerful and expensive as the game progresses and can synergize well with each other with good planning.That's basically where the similarities to 7 Wonders ends. Age of Rivals is a much more confrontational two player game. Military cards directly attack your opponent's cards with defeated cards earning no points at the end of that round and at least one defeated card each round being permanently ruined (ie turned into a useless waste card in the deck). This gives the game a much more aggressive feel as the opposing armies directly pound each other and capture neutral cities for bonus points. It also makes warfare much more interesting in that you have to decide battle to battle which cards will absorb incoming damage and which cards you are willing to potentially lose.The game has a large variety of cards and Rivals (aka your avatars each of which plays slightly differently). Multiplayer and challenges are included as well although personally I enjoy just playing against the computer for quick games. If you are a fan of 7 Wonders and are looking for a relatively reasonably priced computer game that might scratch that itch this is definitely worth a look."
76561198009549233,Recommended,597970,30907655,Posted: 2 April,all,Allend,"This is a very nice tactical game. You have to pay close attention not only to your own plan, but also to the cards available and to what your opponent is doing. Even if you start a game with a certain strategy in mind, chances are you will have to adapt it as the match goes on. As a result, you are always engaged, trying to combo your cards and counter your opponent. I find it very fun, and recommend it for players who like complex, interacting mechanics and engine-building games.I think i would like the game more if the elements of it that are down to sheer luck were a bit reduced, but that's is just my personal opinion. Sometimes it just seems like the computer always has first dibs on the resource you need, or always ruins your best card. Anyway, great game for players who like a mental challenge! =)"

It has a few flaws, but these could be easily fixed via updates. fx you should be able to exclude SOME cards from being in the game, it feels arbitrarily forcing to always have to play with all the cards in your collection, even those you don't like, and if you prefer a certain kind of cards over others, you have no control over what you get except for what cards you pick ingame. fx I would like to have more underworld cards and fewer culture cards getting chosen from. Being able to exclude a certain fraction (like 1/3) of your cards for each cardtype would greatly improve this.The other thing is that it would be nice if the 4 cards you are forced to have in round 2 and 3 were not just random, but you picked from the other cards, fx 2 cards shown, you pick 1, as them being random is too RNG imo.Other than that, I really like this game, and it has great potential if these flaws get ot fixed, which should be very possible."

You take turns drafting cards to build an empire and then, when all 8 slots are filled for the turn, you squabble for neutral settlements, wage war on each other directly, and then score points based on the cultural value of what you've built. Since you can never know what cards are going to be available for you to draft, you have to carefully balance your economy, unit types, war capability, and cultural value.The end result is an engrossing card drafting duel game that has massive replayability and plenty of opportunities for inventive strategies. I highly recommend it.If you don't want to pay money for the game, try the free version hosted at Kongregate and see if you like it. The only difference between the web version and this paid version is that the web version has slower progression.IF YOU LIKE DIGITAL BOARD GAMES: Get this, you won't regret it.IF YOU LIKE STRATEGY (or 4X) GAMES: Try the web version, see if you like it.IF YOU DON'T LIKE CARD GAMES, BOARD GAMES CIVILIZATION THEMED GAMES, OR SHORT GAMES: Try the web version anyways, honestly, you've got nothing to lose.I've been playing this game for 60+ hours (web and steam versions) and I've barely scratched the surface of the game.

I've played so many matches where they just ""happen"" to get the optimal cards chosen in the next rounds.

So with the above comments it's been impossible to move on.Highly frustrating and probably going to refund. :/ I'm no strategy master, but I'm fairly regular player of similar logic board games and strategy games so I would expect to win at least once in normal mode (there are only two modes: normal and hard. Can't imagine what hard is like)"

Never seen so many bad cards to play in my life in several games. Hardly any culture cards 1's and 2's while AI gets 3' to 6's or more. If I do get one like a 10 culture guess what it gets? Destroy highest culture card. Two games in a row it did this right after I got the 10 culture card.I refunded it nearly as fast as I bought it. I MIGHT get it when they implement multiplayer but not before.

The difficulty in the game lies in keeping an overview of both your own and your enemies options, however, I wouldn't call it a mostly skill-based game, because the randomness of the choices you're offered for card selection play a big part in you gameplay. It's hard to have a gameplan beforehand, mostly it depends on your ability to adapt to what is offered to you.Good:+ Engaging gameplay+ Nice combination of card game/city builderNeeds improvement:- The UI is not great- Deckbuilding- The pack-opening is kind of irrelevant, card-collection kind of feels irrelevant, it makes you wonder why they don't immediately give all the cards.- Card special abilities are not always worded clearly enough. I find myself often surprised to discover a card does something very different than what I imagened from reading the card text. In extention of this, it is not always clear in what order special abilities are performed.Though I list a few serious items that could use improvement, I still recommend the game, because these items are not gamebreaking. For its price this game offers enough content and enjoyment, just don't expect the perfect game."

The artwork didn't draw me in at all, but I gave it a shot anyways, and I'm so glad I did.This game is not difficult to understand. It's not overly complex, even with all the iconography. However, this game is very deep! There's a lot to consider in between each turn and it's open-faced drafting system.Each round you'll 'buy' eight cards, but from round 1's cards, your next rounds' first four cards are chosen randomly from the eight cards you just finished using in the previous round. So you need to adapt a strategy every round. Any resources you build become future discounts for you while they also become taxes against opponent, if they take a card aligned with those resources.Some cards combo specifically with the next card you buy, and your opponent will know and see it. Do you bluff the next buy? Do you instead choose the card you think your opponent will want, or do you choose the card that gives you an edge in combat? Maybe that victory point card is too good to pass up?Ah, so good!!!"

And like all these games, you actually play it for 3 hours (the addictive ""another one"" syndrom :') )It's a perfect draft game where luck is not the key (maybe something like 20% of the game, when something affect a card but it wasn't the one you wanted to), and it will totally satisfy the board-gamers. Concept is well-known, realisation is perfect.I'm not sur about the 10.- price, but to support the creator, could be a good way to show him, nevertheless try to grab it during deal time (and if you have a smartphone, it's on it, actually paid twice, doesn't regret)"
