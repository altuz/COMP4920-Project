Ofc you shouldn't expect too much. It still has the principle to have certain spawnpoints which you can destroy. After this you can enter a new level over the by green arrow marked green spawn. Which each level the HP of your oppenents gets higher. On the 3rd level there is then this ridiculous boss ""Dungeon Overlord"" with a wide open Spellbook in his hand.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=893729417The game lacks also of a reponsive movement and variety of leveldesign. It's just the same obstacles on each floor. Tho you have 4 types of mana it's just for the effects. Somehow you cannot die of enemy attacks unless the game decides it's ""game over"". And your score is invisible until the game is finally over. The purpose of playing seems *again* to wait 10 minutes until each of the achievements pops up."

,Not Recommended,598470,31063839,Posted: 10 April,all,A.,"Oh boy, everything about this game is bad. so lets talk about it.- The gameplay is horrible, you can't gain any sort of health, the control is very sloppy, there is only 1 boss, and everything just so wrong. You are a guy, that have 4 powers and has a ""health"" system, I call it as a timer I guess that will go down until it reaches 0, it's game over. Your objective is to find the exit 2 times, and then fight the boss, kill it and go to the next exit and then repeat until the health reaches 0. It's repetitive and very boring.- There is no option button, so you can't do anything about it. I had to mute the game manually because it's very annoying.- Ah, the achievements. There are 500 achievements and you can get it very easily. Everytime you kill a monster, you get an achievement... and thats it. You kill 500 monsters, you get all the achievement. What I do isstand at a cornerand spam the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it until you get all the achievements. Rougly 10 minutes, you will get all the achievements, and sadly, all of the icons of the achievements is the same, there is no effort at all. For achievement hunters, rejoice I guess.- At least it has trading card right??? Thats goood right??? Am I right guys???

You wander around shooting constantly spawning enemies and occassionally the object they're spawning out of.Not only is this game nothing but a score attack mode where you fight waves of enemies to get a ""high score"" but the controls feel very clunky and when I tried using a controller I couldn't change what direction I was shooting in.Aside from being the 500 easiest Steam Achievements you will ever get and trading cards there is no reason to purchase this game at any price. I remember in my Xbox 360 days there was a game called Avatar: The Burning Earth that was notorious for how easy it was to 100%, but while you could get all the achievements in the tutorial in that, at least it actually had a story for people to play through."

Every second your health drops.  Pick up treasure to boost your score, chicken to boost your health, and mana balls for some pretty minor powers (I only liked the water mana one).Enemies will spawn out of generators until the generators are destroyed.  Find the portal to get to the next floor and more enemies.  Every few floors face off against a giant boss.Overall the game tries to work on sensation overload.  And it isn't terrible, although the sluggish controls got annoying.  Still, for the price, I enjoyed my time with it.  Just remember you are getting a poor man's guantlet clone.... for cheap!"

Are you ready for anewgame from thegeniusminds who brought you theincredibleblockbusters like Pain Train!? ME NEITHER!Dungeon Creepster is a rip off of Gauntlet, a top-down shooter spawning masses of enemies. Just like in Pain Train, the GUI is similar, the main menu is the same..what's this? A new developer? NOPE. It's just the Pain Train developer operating under a new dev name because they know their games suck and they're desperately trying to run away from the bad hype by creating a ""new developer"" to develop the same game, just with a top down perspective...wait a minute you guys are really bad at this whole ""we are totally not the Pain Train guys""!Dungeon Creepster is by no means a good game. Controls will wonk out on you, there is no objective (you don't even have to kill enemies until you get to bosses if you don't want to), bosses are just the same enemies you fight - just bigger, enemies walk through walls, you have no clue how to use your ""special skills"", sometimes you'll get something out of a treasure chest and other times you get literally nothing, which is dumb because treasure chests are already hard to find as it is. This game is one giant troll and you're getting trolled every achievement you get until you get to 500 and then hate yourself for putting a buck into this horrible♥♥♥♥♥♥train headed for sewer station.

,Not Recommended,598470,32400908,Posted: 13 June,all,Rhutrax,"Ok, so I'm writing this review less than 10 minutes into the game, so there's that.I got a 90% OFF coupon for this game. It was pretty cheap already, and it had trading cards, so I figured ""Well, why the heck not?""Before actually buying it, I took a peek into the existing reviews, mostly negative and 'non-recommended' ones, which makes sense.I saw a lot of reviews from people that got the game the exact same way I was about to, and most of them agreed it was a nice way to get some trading cards since the game was so cheap.I quickly understood the concept of a ''Achievement Spamming game'' even though I had never actually seen one.I was pretty sure the game was no GOTY stuff based on the reviews, but part of me really wanted to try it out, since so many times I bought games hated by the public and really enjoyed them...Then I download the game, and launched.''WTF'' was my reaction.That thing's weird. It feel as though I'm playing some kind of prototype test software from a 10 year old blind drunk kid who just got unity game maker or some sh*t. Can barely understand what's going on in the screen, there's a constant male moan (supposedly from your character) who sounds like Obi-Wan 0rgasming while hanging upside down. The enemies are spiders and ogres... And some kind of retared caterpillar. You run around (Or stand still, for all I care) while you shoot colorful magic balls. You're supposed to collect colorful orbs that float around the dungeon to get power ups and throw other kinds of colorfur spells into the few enemies that soon become a trillion and reduce your FPS, which is already most likely low since the game runs like crap.This game feels like it should be on an alternative dimension AVGN episode, not on steam for 2 dollars.In case you actually wanna play, instead of just farming the cards, enjoy getting your 500 achievements that have the exact same name."

(unsure if game will add more)It ran smoothly and you can play in either windowed or fullscreen.  This is a basic top down shooter clearly made as yet another achievement hunter game.In all honesty this game actually has some decent lighting and character design, the shooting mechanics are simple.  If the game added more mana pickups and maybe some health pickups across the stages, I'd probably go back and play it more.I recommend this for achievement hunters, or people wanting to add an easy complete game to their library, but not anyone else.*I really don't have a problem with these types of games, but for those of you who hate this trend, I simply say this, get over yourself, games like this aren't hurting anyone...just maybe your ego.  If you don't want to support the trend, then don't buy the games.  There is no reason for you to troll and spew your disapproval on games / reviews for games so clearly made for quick achievements.  For all we know these simple games could help an aspiring Indie Dev get a budget to create a future high quality game.  ;)Also, yeah, I'm sure this review will get a ton of thumbs down just like any other review that recommends quick achievement games.

,Recommended,598470,31378374,Posted: 26 April,all,Bhard the Tryhard,"I'm gonna keep this short and simple: it's a pretty good game for the 10 cents I paid. Sure, I only played it for 14 or 15 minutes, but it wasn't that bad for the price.The game entails walking around shooting monsters, while looking for the portal to defeat the dungeon's boss over and over again, all while getting mana to use your four abilities. The graphics are alright in my opinion, I have no complaints about them. The movement feels a bit slow at first but I also got used to that after a few minutes. Overall I felt no real challenge, but it was satisfying obliterating a ton of monsters at once using one of my abilities. Basically I'm saying it's an alright 4-5/10 game, but it doesn't really hold your interest for long. I suppose it doesn't have to though, it was only 10 cents (after using a coupon) after all.Not to mention, there are 500 easily attainable achievements you get by killing monsters, I got them all in the 15 minutes I played. If you like achievements then you'll like this game. Personally I found it to be a bit annoying to have them popping up the whole time I was playing. There's also trading cards. so you could sell them and get more than you paid if you bought this game on sale or with a coupon."

There weren't. It was total garbage.However, if you enjoy achievements... it's your lucky damn day.500 achievements in under 10 minutes. LITERALLY! I have it on tape! 9 MINUTES!All you have to do is kill an enemy for ONE achievement, and guess how many of the same achievment there are? ;)...I'm waiting...Oh. Wait! YOU GET AN ACHIEVMENT EVERY TIME YOU KILL AN ENEMY! AND YOU KILL ONE EVERY GOD DAMN SECOND!Moral of the story is:Bad GAME, Ez PZ Achievements.... Steam really needs to nurf this game."
