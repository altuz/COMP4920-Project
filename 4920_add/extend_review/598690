You'd say that its ugly and that the gameplay mechanics are nothing special...and boring.And, yeah, thats basicly right...and also the models arent good, voice acting is annnoying and there are only a few sound samples that repeat all the time.However, in VR it works. Yeah, I have to admit that this is the first VR game that actually felt like a real game. It's fun...and even though it has its shortcomings its pretty enjoyable. I only played for 90 minutes straight, but I plan to finish this. I want to give the developer my money cause I think hes on the right path to get a good product done... but it definetly needs a lot of polish... oh, and it also needs background music :P"
76561198020445786,Not Recommended,598690,32187601,Posted: 4 June,all,M1ng0J1ng0,"6.7 out of 10This is a good game otherwise flawed by poor enemy, both in their visuals and poor AI (it's not smart at all). Take this out the equation and you have a great looking game with a decent assortment of weapons which have a great feel and function in VR. The level design and overall intuitive feel within this fantasy world is top notch.Back to the bad bits. A lot of the aliens aren't very unimagitive, stiffly animated but worse is the pathfinding. Aliens are triggered by your close proximity, they are quite dumb, some you can see in the distance remain as statues until you're in range. Then run or fly at you in straight lines, they clip through each other and sometimes the scenary or can get stuck on the scenary. The combat isn't terrible or completely broken but you see these issues often so you can consider this a weak part of the game.Otherall it's still a fun game, the large alien planet is an enjoyable place to explore but a game is the sum of it's parts and it's not solid throughout. So in light of this it's not a game I would fully recommend at this point. I'll certainly update this review once it's out of early access."
76561198123581839,Not Recommended,598690,33050012,Posted: 30 June,all,vidledoux,"If you prefer teleportation, then my critique does not apply to you. the smooth locomotion in this game is horrible. It only allows you to move at like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, turtle speeds. Like 2mph. With no ability to sprint? This is just terrible design and feels like nobody actually tested it. And if they got some guy to test it, he was completely unaware of successful vr fps's like Pavlov, BAM, Doom 3, Seroius Sam tfe (hell, even Onward lets you move faster, and even lets you sprint). For a game of this price, this is unacceptable. Because this is an easy fix, a no-brainer. Devs can learn from other games, in which there is a speed slider for smooth motion, allowing players to choose what works for them. But as it is now, it's game-breakingly slow. Like a 20$ joke.Also, it forces you to complete a tutorial and to achieve some kind of minimim score with each weapon. This is bad game design too (just like in Ahros the One Chronicle). Don't make us take test if we don't want to. Let us play the dam game if we want to.Sniping rifle is bugged; almost impossible to♥♥♥♥♥♥it, making it impossible to pass out of the tutorial...This game has lots of potential, but until they fix the locomotion (which would require miminim dev time, which is why this glaring error is so hard to fathom for this price point), I will not recommend it."
,Recommended,598690,30582191,Posted: 17 March,all,Pootie,This game is very fun. I'm not going to repeat what's in everyone else's reviews. I'll just summuraize. Great game needs more content and polishing. Definitely worth the money. I hope the developers followthrough with the proper updates.
,Recommended,598690,31132229,Posted: 14 April,all,Stodgy,"The weapon handling/reloading is the right balance of fun and realism.Movement in smooth mode is just about perfect and there's also teleport mode for those that prefer it.There's a good variety of enemies that require different tactics to defeat.On the downsides it could do with a better voice actor, WHY DO YOU SHOUT ALL THE TIME, some of the normal enemies are a bit too easy while the bosses are too much of a bullet sponge.Overall this is the best single player shooter I've played on the Vive so far."

I thought it would be a little demo for a long developing game, but no. This game has a pretty long story. I am happy to bought this game.

76561198310170915,Recommended,598690,30420343,Posted: 9 March,all,TheBlueSilhouette,"This game is phenominal for a VR game, currently there is nothing like it. I see a lot of people comparing it to arizona sunshine, but I can genuinely say this game is 100x better than arizona sunshine. Even the greatest of games have a lot of kinks to work through though, and this one has quite a few. It is, however, in early access so I'm sure a lot of this will be fixed in time.First we will start with the good:1. Great variety of weapons which are all highly useable except the bow, the bow is fun but very difficult to aim naturally because it'll make you accidentally hit your headset.2.There is actually a story, there are so few vr games with a story. I do think the story is a bit corny at times with some awkward dialogue, but it's still a great touch.3. The graphics are AMAZING for a vr game. The first two levels kinda feel like there's something missing in the enviroment like more plantlife and such but after that the game feels very real, so real you'll actually start to get really scared of the bullets flying at you.4. Smart Ai is such an important thing to have, however, same as the last comment, the ai in the first two levels is a lot dumber than the ai in the later levels, the human ai is very good.5. A thorough and helpful tutorial.6. The enemies are extremely diverse, I've only played 4 levels but I've seen so many enemies from bugs to demons to humans.7. The movement actually moves you to where you point, instead of teleporting you, so for anyone who gets sick from vr games that make you teleport, this is the game for you.8. Some enemies actually say intelligent things, which is awesome.9. The price is LESS THAN HALF of what I think the game is worth, so yes, buy it.10. I love the idea of looking around the enviroment for the passcodes, it adds a lot more depth to the gameplay.11. I LOVE THE WRISTMAP. When you look at your wrist asnd see a holographic map pop up, it doesn't only look aswesome but it makes you feel awesome.Now for the negatives, this game is great but there are a lot of things that the game is lacking.1. Doors take SEVERAL explosive charges before they actually explode, this honestly drives me crazy and I'm not sure if it's supposed to be there or if it's a bug.2. Some of the enemies are really outlandish looking and it makes it kind of silly, the demon monsters and the alien looking creatures (from alien vs. predator) are bright strange colors, honestly this isn't really that bad, I'm not sure why but it takes me out of the game.3. The only way I've seen so far to put items in your inventory so far is by DROPPING YOUR PISTOL so you can pick it up, and then you have to pick your pistol back up, this is a HUGE problem especially when you're trying to loot while you're shooting. (This has been fixed)4. Some of the ai is really bland, most of them are pretty good, but a wider range of noises, dialogue, and having creatures that have more than one attack would be great. The human ai also only shoots two bullets at a time, which I find really predictable, it would be nice if the human ai could shoot a different amount of bullets from time to time. The ai of the female who shows you around in the turorial is also a little janky, her movements are awkward but honestly for early access this is fine.5. The fact that you have to wait for the ability to move to recharge is a little obnoxious, it's not too bad but being stuck and unable to move is a little ridiculous, a recharging sprint would be a lot more reasonable.6. In the beginning I had no idea that the pistol had infinite ammo, so when I ran out of my first clip I started running around being chased by bugs for 20 minutes, it would be nice if there was an infinity sign where the pistol ammunition availability number is.7. When you're fighting the human enemies they all breath EXACTLY like darth vader, it's funny and all, but this game is very very good and the obvious emmulation of the darth vader breathing noises makes it seem a little ridiculous8. There are A LOT of grammar errors, there's a log that says ""I hided myself in the gate and sealed"" It should say hid and not hided, there is plenty more examples of grammar mistakes, which could easily be fixed by asking someone to help you fix the mistakes (I'd be glad to help).Other minor things include-buggy textures-no music-Screen sometimes fades to black for no reasonThere is also many things that could be added to make this game better, these are some of my personal suggestions.1. Weapon upgrades and xp. Having a system where you could level up and get perks or find upgrades for your weapons would make the character want to explore more. It would also add to the replayibility and would be PERFECT for this game.2. The skeletons all look exactly the same and are always found next to the logs, Instead of skeletons, dead troopers positioned uniquely would really sell the atmosphere better.3. Scavenging ammo off dead soldiers would also add more depth to the game, though obviously this is not a big deal.4. Having online play would really sell this game for me, so far the is the only game on VR I have played where the combat was solid, so multiplayer gameplay would be extremely fun.5. Add more story and more lore, give the main character and the girl they are with a backstory, maybe even integrate the training into the game to make the gameplay more seamless.6. Add more to the enviroment, the enviroment looks amazing and unique but it could use more to make it seem realistic.Conclusion: This is the best game on VR BY FAR right now, it has an actual long story with intense combat and great game mechanics, this game gets a solid 9/10 from me, if the things mentioned above are all fixed/added, I would genuinely give this a 10/10. BUY. THIS. GAME.edit: Since I've made this review the game has been MASSIVELY improved, the devs are very hard working."
76561197970977717,Recommended,598690,31450303,Posted: 29 April,all,4forciers,"I completely agree with BlaXun's review.  It has lots of faults, video quality, voice/sound track, it crashes, and spoiler alert there is no real ending you either get a mission accomplished notice or it crashes... but... it the first VR game I've played that felt like a real game.Took me about 5 hours to play through, so not long on content but what was there was a lot of fun.  Now I know what a FPS might look like in VR.  I've played others that are more arena based, move from one arena to the next fight waves of enemies but this felt like true progression, moving from room to room, figuring out how to get through the locked doors.I am left with a lot of questions on the story line as well as a hunger for more.Best VR Game in my library"
76561197983311384,Recommended,598690,31127431,Posted: 13 April,all,Maximum James,"I beat this game after fighting my evil self at the end and I am pretty sure it took longer than 5 hours. I was offline I guess.It is a simple basic first person shooter, but it has patience for you to use all the VR controls such as picking stuff up and throwing it in your backpack as well as loading and cocking the guns. Reloading your gun is now fun and so is pulling the pin and tossing the grenade.It kind of lets you enjoy an early first person VR game and lets you get used to the new controls as well.I am left handed and I enjoyed tossing the gun up and catching it with my other hand when shooting left and right from behind cover. If the enemies were too aggressive I would not have had the time to figure that out.All in all it is a lot of fun and then you can speed around in Serious Sam after and feel comfortable with the movement (I see no need for teleportation and I think teleportation is lame)."
,Recommended,598690,30454554,Posted: 11 March,all,Scooter,"It's one of those games that's hard to give a rate, because it is early access and much of the problems could be fixed for final release. That's why I also would wait for final release and see. Some of the problems are no background music/ambience, some sounds are really bad like when you shot something at close range with shotgun, the game crashed after a while, there's some really anoying sounds repeated all the time like ""game saved"" and it saves a lot. Also when moving ""movement depleated"" all the time. Some enemies just keep spawning and charging you from the same spot in such a way I started to believe there was a infinity number of enemies, and to me the colors are a bit funky. However, it's fun when it works. I would say it's not a to bad game for the price if they fix the flaws, but not a game of the year title."
76561197988089003,Recommended,598690,30454001,Posted: 11 March,all,DMelT,Wow this game does a lot of things right.  The environments and the immersion are really there.  I felt like I was on an alien planet inhabited by deadly creatures.The enemies are also quite varied. You don’t feel as if the developer made a couple enemy types and then just changed the look a bit and buffed their stats to make different versions.Its early access and a lot will depend on the speed at which the developer updates and improves the missing elements that will truly make this a polished game but so far they have nailed everything that has been implemented aside from the inventory system. That part is still pretty rough.  He also needs to make it a bit easier to grab ammo clips from your side but overall its minor stuff that needs to be fixed.Oh… &PLEASE ADD TOUCHPAD LOCOMOTIONThat is all…. Great game though!
,Not Recommended,598690,31199331,Posted: 17 April,all,Ronny,"This game does a lot of things the right way (graphics are OK, nice handling of inventory and guns, story based) but its ridden with bugs and some really bad design choices:1,) Movement is restricted. You can only teleport a few times before you have to stop and stay around waiting for teleport to recharge (or use a recharger item). This is very annoying!2.)  Some enemies can go though solid structures (like mountains) and suddenly appear next to you.3.) Multiple flying enemies suddenly appears on top of you and is almost impossible to see/shoot.4.) Lip-sync and animations are sub-pair. Story is very bland. Voice acting is so and so.5.) Battles are not very challenging and requires no tactics."

One of the best if not the best of all VR games I own.Have to compare it to serious sam but this time you are free to move around (using teleport which works great) and progress through the stages.The tension and immersion is real when you move forward cautiously and when you are swarmed with enemies you scramble to get more clips, load and shoot them as fast as you can.Loads of fun and this is not a rail shooter so props for that.Had some difficulties in getting the clips from my backpack sometimes but nothing too difficult in the end. Maybe it could be tweaked to work a bit better.Would recommend to buy."

Everything works as intended, and the mechanics of the game feel very natural (inventory, shooting, reloading, healing, etc). Sure, sometimes the A.I. can be fooled by putting a solid object between you and the enemy, but being EA I'm sure they will work on that over time. Everything looks beautiful and it runs buttery smooth (GTX 1070). This is the kind of VR game I had in mind when I purchased the Vive. Very immersive, very easy to pick up and play, and very satisfying to progress around the maps."

Had to D/C before figuring out how to finish her off.  This feels like a polished AAA title, great graphics, nice weapon mechanics, bow and arrow funtion as accurately as The Lab version, you have to pull the clip from your back to reload and pull the levers on rifles or pump for shotguns.  though I stil have not figured out the gist of using spell casting correctly, it feels right when I have managed a couple of fireballs.

76561198122657925,Recommended,598690,30511284,Posted: 14 March,all,Rook's Empire,"Sorry Reality, I belong to Dark Legion now.TL;DR - This game is worth much more than the asking price.  Fantastic weapon handling in a Sci-Fi atmosphere.I think I have put enough time into the game to finally give it a review.  I wanted to hold off just in case this game was too good to be true.  Its true.  Its good.Think Mass Effect mixed with Crisis and a little splash of Starship Troopers.  The game is no wave shooter.  There are objectives to complete and places to go and explore.  Movement is done with short, fast, dashes that work fairly well.  Hopefully they add more options for locomotion.The strongest aspect is defintely the weapons handling.  Pistol, Shotgun, Assault Rifle, Sniper Rifle, Bazooka, they are all here and they are spectacular.  Reloading and actually pulling back the bolt handle before taking my next shot is incredibly satisfying.  Oh and did I mention you also get a Lazer Compound Bow and magic?Now this game isnt perfect: There are some bugs, some physics issues (some enemies go flying 20' after being shot for some reason), and I have had to restart the game a couple times.  But the game itself makes me easily overlook these minor flaws.   Probably the worst part of the game is your annoying sidekick.  She could use a bit more animation so her mouth moves with her dialogue.All in all, I would have paid double for this game.  I keep referring to myself as Commander Shepard through habit alone, because thats who I feel like.I cannot wait to see what this team brings to the final product.  I really really like where its headed already.  This is easily my favorite VR game, hands down.  Because thats what it feels like, a game.  Not a demo, or a wave shooter, or a half-baked idea that may work out.  This is a full game and its fantastic!Pro Tip - Hold your pinky out on your right hand when reloading the handgun.  This lets me butt the other controller to it when Im reloading instead of smashing the controllers again.Oh, and watch overhead clearances - I gave my projector an overhead serve while throwing a grenade."

But, From what I Played This is Probably The Best One I have Played so Far in VR....I liked Raw Data, Island 359, Arizona Sunshine, Dead Effect 2, Onward, etc... These Titles are Great as Well...But, This is One Here is My Favorite So Far...Things I Like:- Graphics Are Beautiful!- Gameplay is Smooth as Butter Everything Works and Works Well...(My Rig is a i7-6700 16gb DDR4 GTX 1070)- The Controls Are My Favorite to date...For Movement, You have a option between ''Teleport or Smooth'' which, Smooth is what I Recommend, it is Touch Pad locomotion with Wrapping which is the Best I have Used So Far! you can't Run!  but, you don't need too...When you can 'Wrap' around like a 'Ninja'...for example: I had a Rocket coming straight for me almost hitting my face and I simply Wrapped to the side to avoid it...Awesome! The Coolest Pick Up Mechanics No Bending Over everytime to pick something up just move Green hand icon over the item and hit Trigger...Awesome!- Very Fun- Advice always look behind you and have a Magazine in hand ready to load because it gets intense pretty quick! you'll need all the bulklets you can get...Note: I haven't played too long but what I did Play is Great! I Highly Recommend you get this!Things I Dislike:- Dying.... Because, if you don't kill em quick, they'll gang bang your A**...lolother than that, I'm actually ReallyHappy with it...No Dislikes...Great Game! Way Better Than Expected!"

There's a fair amount of exploration, and the only movement option is teleportation, which by itself isn't that bad, but when you can't move more than 6 times without needing to either wait for your movement bar to fill up, or open your inventory so you can inject yourself with movement juice. That whole mechanic is terrible and should be scrapped. I'm left handed and there's no option to swap dominant hands, which makes everything the game wants you to do just a little bit more annoying. Holding a machine gun with your left hand? Hope you don't mind having to reach across it with your right hand to get it ready to fire after you pull ammo out from behind you. Oh, and all of the different health/movement injectors have a tooltip that isn't in english for the english version."

There is action, atmosphere, and adventure.  It is rough around the edges, but surprisingly few real issues have popped up so far.  The Devs went to a lot of trouble to anticipate tips and guidance as you progress. The graphics are above average for an inexpensive game.  The monsters can be very unsettling, and the different weapons cover all types.  Very worth the money!"

It feels like I'm holding two maneqquin  arms. I tried looking past it, because the game seemed like it could be enjoyable. Unfortunately, it just can't be ignored.Until the hand/wrist models are fixed, I would not recommend this game."

It is a cool looking environment and it has lots of promise but at the moment it lacks any polish and is just not fun. Some suggestions to make the game more enjoyable; Improve the bow aiming and arrow loading mechanics, give me a shotgun that I don’t have to♥♥♥♥♥♥every 2 rounds, improve the hit boxes on the AI players, IMPROVE THE IA(seriously, it is really bad), improve the way baddies spawn in the environment (there is nothing fun about having a ton of the same baddie spawn in the same spot over and over and over again, and then just walk at you). After another few months in the oven, this may be a fun game, but it is not right now."

Game looks pretty decent, but an annoying thing is that when you plant the explosives it doesn't destroy the door/rock wall on the first charge? takes several it seems. I went back scrounging around for another explosive for about 5 minutes. This is because the movement system is screwed up in this game also. Teleport or locamotion doesn't really matter to me, but the idea that I have to literally wait for 30 seconds for my energy meter to get to full for any type of movement blows♥♥♥♥♥♥ Take out the restriction on movement. Noone wants to play a game where you have to wait around for a third of it to be able to move. Also, make it to where you can inject the syringes anywhere and not one particular arm. If i'm shooting with my right. I stop to grab a syringe from a crate then I realize its my left arm that needs to be injected, I have to stop...drop my gun from my right hand and drop the syringe that's in my left hand and grab it off the ground. inject my left arm in the correct spot, then grab my pistol....that's some majorly annoying game mechanics for a setting that should give you more freedom...not load you down with annoying bs. Just my humble opinion"
,Recommended,598690,31549571,Posted: 4 May,all,Game Cooker US Rocks VR,My Specs: 16 Gigs RAM/ GTX 1070/ Intel Core i7-7700k/ HTC VIVEI have no idea why this game got negative reviews. The game looks good and I saw no noticable problems. It has teleport and sliding trackpad movement. Some were complaining about having stamina so you can't run around forever away from enemies. Really? As a casual gamer I want an easy VR experience but I won't even complain about that. This is a VR action adventure shooter with a variety of enemies that attack. Everything is explained at the beginning if you listem instead of staring at the pilot/1st officer the whole time and missing key points like I did. Heh. It isn't revolutionary but it is something we need in VR instead of dopey wave shooters and pvp sims which I rarely play. This game you can roam around which I love. Kind of like a dungeon crawler but in a sci-fi theme and it has a bosses. I only fought one so far. I think this is a good buy for a nice Virtual Reality experience. Graphics = beautiful. Pilot Model= hot. Shooting fairly easy but fun too. Monsters = variety. Feeling of being in another time and place = yes. Boss = has at least one. Variety of weapons = yes. Buy this. If I was to give a number rating it would be 7/10 simply because I am not sure how long it is yet but what I have played so far I like.Part 2 4k video no commentary. Will be ready in a few hours in SD then HD tomorrow. Enjoy.https://youtu.be/RnpIUFSxo3sFirst play part 1 4k video ready below and edited to be shorter and I took out some scenes that were not so cool for kids to see. It is rated for all now. Thanks and enjoy.https://youtu.be/gLCcKm1BJLc

After a pretty average tutorial the first level it's a joke.- Tens of dumb mob generators every inchs which oblige you to move back.- The fun part it's the skybox with a planet saturn which has the size of a beach balloon, very immersive.Sorry about that but this game frustrated me."

The environments are well done and the shooting requires some thought, based on been swamped and died may times due to dropping or miss timing reloads, but it is not frustrating, just my lack of coordination and timing. The smooth movement added recently is nice in that you can move slowly and then at a press on the edge to telaport. I'm enjoying it a lot even if I'm dieing a lot. I've only played 2 hours so it is a limited experience so far and I'm looking forward to more."
