,Recommended,599100,31976923,Posted: 26 May,all,Easy Target,Casual platformer with lots of achievements.Pros:+ Visual Style+ Achievements for beating levels (not for jump/shoot as some trash games do)Cons:- Music- You cant change controls6/10
,Recommended,599100,31980844,Posted: 26 May,all,6aPoH_91,The game is really a very complex platformer. I liked randomly generated platforms. It was very difficult to pass the level. A lot of achievements in the game - this is a plus.

You need to hurry up and jump from the disappearing platform all the way over to the other ( from block to block before they disappear).I do find think it's a pretty hard game, but I really like the dynamic.This kind of dynamic gameplay was new to me. I recommend you to play this exciting game!"

,Recommended,599100,32018168,Posted: 28 May,all,nd,"another interesting hardcore platformer where blocks you are running and jumping on are generated randomly, so you often do not see what comes next and have limited time for desicion making, and you have enemies, bullets, traps, mines, to shoot to avoid - all everything at once :)cheap, properly done, i can recommend."

,Recommended,599100,32003838,Posted: 27 May,all,Karapyzzz,"A very interesting 8-bit game. The soundtrack in this game is actually real nice, and gameplay is really quirky. Lack of tutorial options or even a general idea of what to do next makes the game significantly more difficult as you die a few times trying to figure out what to do."
