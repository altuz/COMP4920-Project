You gain materials by sending your Staff members on adventures, which you then use to craft equipment. Every crafting ""table"" uses a different stat. For example, the forge, where you make ingots, uses the Vitality stat. Vitality increases your character's melee defense stat. Using the Forge will increase you Strength, Crafting Table increases Dexterity, and Enchanting Table, Intelligence.The higher your stats are on a Staff member, the better gear they will craft using these ""tables"", which means they'll be worth more money. There are several quests/objectives to complete. There seems to be two types I've encountered so far, static quests and timed quests. The timed quests give you a nice amount of money, while the static quests seem to always unlock new recipes.With all that said, the game is quite grindy, at least in the beginning, because you need to constantly send your Staff on adventures to grab resources, then craft a few things, sell, and repeat. It takes a bit of time to progress through the game at first, but it seems to be taking off now that I'm getting higher stats (50+) on one of my adventurers, he comes back with a full inventory on most adventures.Also, I believe this game is translated from Chinese and, quite frankly, there are a LOT of typos in there. I personally don't mind it, but there definitely is a lot of work to put into correcting all of them. And it's not just typos, there is a lot of information/speech that is simply not written properly, sentences that make no sense. You get a good idea of what the developpers mean, but it's really poorly written.Besides that, I haven't encountered any bugs, and I've had fun with the game so far! I'm excited to see what the devs have planned for the future!"

Graphics are old fashioned which I like not being a Intense use of a graphics card. It probably can run on some older PCs.The hardest part for me is figuring out what to focus each of my employees. I found somtimes you may want them battle trained skills but may need to focus some on one crafting skill each. This was the part I wasn't sure what to do.I did like the UI and having choices with how to play. There seems to be no wrong way to progress. There just seems more effecient ways to pogress.The tutorial seemed fairly easy to understand but when i first tried to restart it seemed i almost needed to run the tutorial every time.This game I give 7/10. I think I will run through the game again when i have time. For the price it seems worth what i paid.One dislike was the timed missions seemed random and most the time I couldn't complete them in time given.

,Recommended,599460,30789033,Posted: 28 March,all,F4T4L,"An impulse purchase I don't regret one bit.It's hard to categorize this game... It's sort of like one part ""Clicker"" but not really, and the one part ""RPG"" but not really, and one part ""business sim"" but not really.While it's jack of all trades and master of none, that is hardly a drawback to this delightful gem.  A quick rundown of the game without delving into the story is you run an item shop, and doing side-quests which are typically ""character wants X amount of certain item"", and meeting these goals will result in gold or unlocking more staff or recipes.It could end there and I'd still give this game a passing grade, but instead the recipes you acquire need materials, and the only way to acquire said materials is sending your staff out to gather said materials.  It's all automated but you get to watch their progress.  They'll chop down trees, mine ore, and attack monsters.  The beauty of it is the very items you craft in your shop you have the option of selling, or outfitting your staff with to boost their abilities.  Your staff will also level up their stats over time which not only help them out in the field attacking monsters, but also aid in their crafting abilities in the item shop.All in all, for the price I'd say this game is a steal and is definitely one of the purchases I've made on Steam with little regret afterwards."
76561198025345269,Recommended,599460,33037022,Posted: 30 June,all,Flipadelphiia,"Definitely recommend for those who enjoy casually grinding out mats, crafting, and character stat boosting. There is no WSAD movement or character movement of any sort; its all mouse clicks. When you send characters on an adventure, they control themselves. You control their effectiveness by the quality and type of armour, weapons and accessories you craft and equip onto them. Many different adventurers to unlock and chose from all with unique perks, and tons of things to craft. Also features a lot of automation so you can run your sweat shop while your AFKI would say that this game is more of a crafting game than a shop keepe game. You dont set prices on the things you craft, or have a store front where NPCs come and browse your wares; essentially there is no economy that you adhere by. If you want to sell something you crafted, you just hit sell and its sold immediately. The sell price of the items is determined by its quality and enchantments, all of which is determined by the stats of whichever character you have at that specific crafting station that crafted it. You do have quests and subquests that you can do though, which revolve around a person wanting X amount of Y for a set price. Unlocking new recipes and characters is done through the quests and subquests as well. The overall goal is to earn enough money to pay someone back, but there is no end to the game"

At less than 10 bucks it's a pretty good deal if you're in the mood for some lighthearted grinding. I have 4 hours clocked in and barely scraped the surface of a deep skill/stat system. Basically you collect stuff to make equipment, then send your guys to get better stuff. As the manager you have to drag staff around, equip them properly, make sure they have balanced growth...etc.The translation is serviceable. You have to ""Pull Out"" before a treasure mimic eats your adventurer lol.My only two gripes with the game is the slow start and early crisis with shortage of staff. You have 3 dudes in the beginning and you need them for everything, and they're good at nothing. The viking hat guy has good str to make weapons but is also the only choice for sending out (the other two skinny guys get instagibbed by an octopus). You got one good spear in the whole shop and reluctantly you can't sell it for money because your adventurers need it. You're reduced to selling sharpened sticks and board shields until you get 500G to get another horse. Etc etc. The weapon shop has a pretty humble and poverty start."

I got it on sale for like 5 bucks I think....holy man what a gem.Cons: Clearly written by someone whom which English is not the primary language. Spelling errors in quite a few places and some of the sentences just really do not make any sense. The story is uh...interestingly funny and a way to move things forward, but doesn't necessarily make sense hah. But....thats literally the end of the list of cons...Pros: HOLY DAMN! What a fun little game. For starters, its the first game I've ever been able to move to ANY monitor of my 3 monitor setup and alt+enter it and it full screens to whichever monitor without much work, so I can play this and any other game or watch a movie at the same time SUPER easy. Why does that matter you ask? Well, as fun as the game is, it is a lot of waiting once you get a bit further in, but not long waits, like 40 second ones. This game is PERFECT for people like me who just can't do one thing at a time and need to be doing a few things to keep them busy.  It takes maybe 3 hours to get to a point where you can start having the most basic materials ""auto build"" and the amount of characters and little bit of item and skill customization (skills operate like FF7 skills where you ""master"" the skill on a piece of equipment and are then able to use the skill without wearing said equipment) really help to keep things feeling fresh.TLDR: If you have 5 bucks and love the idea of micro managing a burgeoning Weapon and Armor crafting enterprise in which you hire and send out staff members to retrieve you shiny bits to make into other shiny bits, or if you just really like to help further the agenda of vampires, then this is the game for you."

76561198264335255,Recommended,599460,31452124,Posted: 29 April,all,squeakandme,"I would like to see a neutral rating.  This is a simple, decent game.  The concept is simple and straightforward.  I actually enjoy playing it, but I am a patient and slow moving person.  If you are looking for action or excitement, this isn't your game.  The grind for certain items can be long and boring.  Running the same area more than 30 times to get 3 drops for a quest seems a tad excessive.  I gathered a hint of that before buying the game, so I am not going to give this a negative rating.  That wouldn't be decent or fair.  So for the sake of those who actually read reviews and inform themselves, here are a few of the 'meh' things I find in the game.Abilities:  They don't seem to do what they say.  Protection?  Before casting, 157 damage.  After casting, 152 damage.  Really?  3%?  How is that even worth the time it took to cast the spell?Mobs:  Same boss, 2 runs in a row.  First time, killed him in 3 rounds.  He hit me, I hit him, repeat until death cometh to one party or the other.  Second time, he got to hit me 4 times in a row, I died.  I had no negative status to explain why I didn't get a turn, he had no positive status to explain why he got to just keep hitting me until I died.Mechanics: You have to pay your people more the higher their level is.  But their crafting fails if their level is too low.  Basically forces you into paying more than the item is worth to get a decent quality.Information:  Recipes will tell you what mob drops a certain item, but not where that mob is.  Or it will tell you it can be found in the 'normal' run of an area, but not how to unlock the normal area.  You are stuck on easy.Chest Monsters:  They are hard to kill, and you would expect to get at least decent materials from them once you are strong enough to actually kill one, but nope.OK, now the things I enjoy in the game.Easter Eggs:  Having your character find a pineapple on the ground named 'ApplePen'.  My daughter giggle-snorted at that one.Short runs:  The areas have a set length and you can back arrow out of the adventure screen to do some crafting or check current quests while your adventurers auto run the area.  not sure why some people say they are stuck staring at their screen with nothing to do.  I have not seen where that is an issue yet.  If nothing else, you can spam click your pet for gold.   Always something to do.No death penalty:  If you die in an area quest, you lose the materials you gathered, sure, BUT you get to keep the exp from any mobs you successfully killed.  So even if you aren't strong enough to clear the area, you can get stronger, even from retreat or failures.No 'formula':  by this, I mean you aren't locked into one right way to play it in order to proceed.  You aren't going to lose out if you don't do 'this quest at this level with this person'.  It is no stress.Graphics and music don't have any impact on the actual mechanics of the game, so I don't think it should be a negative or a positive in a review, but it reminds me of the older Dragon Warrior/Final Fantasy style on both counts, which personally, I enjoyed. All in all, I still find the game enjoyable and I will continue to play it.  Mostly because I am stubborn and I have a high tolerance for slow development, but if you do not, please don't buy the game and then complain that it doesn't have enough action or RPG for you.  Read a few reviews and make an informed purchase, and give the developer credit for putting together a pretty good, though maybe not outstanding, little game.  Buy it on sale if you aren't sure, but even with only a mediocre rating, I can safely say I have spent far more on games I enjoyed far less and I don't regret purchasing this one."

76561197985573260,Not Recommended,599460,34765561,Posted: 5 September,all,Hade,"Micro-management to death game!How the game goes is you get a mission to craft something in a certain amount of time or you're stuck with it. In order to craft that item you have to be able to find the resources from sending your heroes out to gather them. Then at the end of every month you must pay back your debt to infinity. You don't even need to hire anyone, your staff is just given to you. Your heroes are also your staff.Want to craft 20 bars of something, sorry, you can't queue it up, you have to click the button wait for it to get done, then do it again 20 times over. Same for all the other crafting. Oh, btw, you can only have one window open at a time.Now look at one of the images for this game, the one with the 16 work stations, now imagine have to manually tell each one of those to create one item at a time. That means, open window, click once to create, wait, close window, and repeat over and over and over.Want to at the same time send your heroes out on a quest. Sorry, you have to micro-manage that to death also since you have to watch their progress, click everything to pick it up and then most of the time you have to run away from battle. I think I was able to complete maybe 2 quests out of 20? (honestly I lost count (and don't really care), happens when you're bored)....Had I known it was the micro-management from hell game, I would have never bought it. I was mislead by the positive raiting for this game.Was reading in the forums somewhere that automatic exploring is end game. WTF, why even add it then.I played for almost 2 hrs, I doubt I'll ever play this game again. I was pretty bored of the click, wait for for it to get done, then click again, etc etc etc etc etc.But if you love micro-managing everything to death, waiting a lot, grinding for gold, and time based missions then this game is for you!"

76561198214989148,Recommended,599460,34314778,Posted: 17 August,all,icc.jpciii,"This is a very hard game to pick a positive/negative review upon.  More so due to RNG elements within the game and trying to 100% complete it rather than anything wrong in the actual game.In and of itsself the cons of this game are very small compared to how utterly addicting this game is.  But the couple of cons could have easily been play tested and altered to create a far more enjoyable experience.  Since at its core this is a crafting game in the same vein of 'holy potatoes it's a weapon shop'.  Which I also enjoyed but have not beat as of yet.The pros are primarily that the game is incredibly addictive trying to build the perfect equipment or complete a quest, or get enough money for the next goal is so insanely addictive.There are several small cons though:The music is incredibly repetitive (sure it fits but when going for 30-60 hours and only having a total of like 5 or 6 tracks is a bit dissapointing)There are two lines of 'failure' achievements, one for crafting 'inferior' grade equipment which you will get pretty easily, but the other is for running from adventures the sheer amount of times they want you to run from an adventure is silly I was less than 5% of the way to the final achievement in this category when I 100% everything else.There is a 'clicker' based achievement strand for clicking on your pet, the amount of money required for this if you do not use an auto clicker makes this achievement strand is PAINFUL, I only got the first and the other two I used an achievement unlocker to obtain.The true final boss can actually be easily cheesed.  However to do so requires you to idle the game for around 42 minutes (and yes I timed it).  If you don't this requires you to grind your characters to darn near max stats.  Including health.You have to play through the game 3 times.  This is actually my smallest problem with this game since this game after beating the true finale on impossible is in all honesty rather short.  It took me less than 20 hours to complete my last 2 playthroughs.Overall despite my criticisms the gameplay for this FAR more makes up for it.  The only unfortunate this is mouse control only no controllers allowed :("

It's a very active shop simulator with automated mini-adventures which you must watch as well or your adventurers will die. This is by no means an idle game. You craft stuff to sell to make money to make better things to make even more money. The bad translation mixed with the humor actually makes it even better. Highly recommended if you are into this sort of game or want to try something new.
,Recommended,599460,30918170,Posted: 3 April,all,Boxtacular,"Is this a freemium game? It feels like one, with the freemium $$ aspects removed. Nonetheless it's not a terrible game, and though the weapon shop idea has been done to death, this one is comparably alright. It doesn't stand out particularly, but it's also not trash-tier.Pros:- Gameplay itself is solid. Send employees out to collect/hunt, make stuff, sell stuff- There's an anti-stuck feature in your pet, which gives you a bit of gold if you spam click it, to  prevent yourself from soft-locking if you run out of gold- Lightweight game, and cheap. Good way to kill a few hours.Cons:- Progress is really slow. At some point I threw it into CE to see how fast you could progress, and it was still pretty damn slow. This is the reason I think it used to be a freemium game or was intended to be one- Menus can feel clunky, especially the lack of a quest box or something from the main screens. The screen itself feels really really cramped, and I think they could've made much better use of the spaceOther:- The translations can be off-putting at times, though I thought it was alright and amusing, if not funny.- Storyline is pretty mediocre, but it's interesting in that there's an actual conflict going on in the world and you're not a part of it (apart from supplying both sides with weapons!)Verdict:It's not a masterpiece, but it's well worth its price if you're into small-scale indie games. It's not going to blow your mind, but it might give you a chuckle here and there."

Interestingly, both have a lot of Final Fantasy references. It's only 6 dollars and I have not completed it yet, but I can already tell there's enough play value to justify the 6 dollars. Merchant RPG lacked a story and animated battle sequences, so this feels like a strict upgrade.It's a sim game where you manage a group of adventurers who craft weapons, equip weapons, and collect resources. It has a very comical story and feel to it. The adventurers are 'staff' and you gain more of them as you complete quests. They have their own unique abilities and you equip them with more abilities. Their stats that they gain as they level-up improve how they craft as well. So it's very fun to try to maximise your returns. It distills JRPG gaming down to the core of what makes it fun.My only gripe with the game is the clunky user interface. I feel like it takes the retro look and feel to an extreme that is unnecessary when instead it should look retro, but play/feel like a modern game. Even a simple 'next worker' option would make a huge difference. Instead, the player has to X out of the window, then open the window of the next worker. It's not that it affects gameplay, per se, it just feels very clunky. But it is not that big of a deal.I do recommend this game if you enjoy JRPGs and/or sim games. Again, I have not beat it yet, but I feel safe recommending the game based on just my first couple of hours in. I cannot imagine anything coming up that would ruin the game at this point, but if it does, I will change my review."

,Recommended,599460,30402017,Posted: 8 March,all,dubesor,"Surprisingly good for the small price. Main quest line took me roughly 25 hours and I still have plenty to unlock from the looks of it. The core gameplay is fairly simplistic - grind resources, use resources to upgrade/equip your adventures, grind more/better areas, craft better items, sell, profit, repeat. The early game is VERY grindy. Skills get learned by equipping certain items and the combination of certain skills can lead to powerful combos so there is also a pretty cool strategic aspect to the game. Overall the game exceeded my expectations even though there are a lot of areas that could be improved still.Don't expect this to be a 2D Recettear as there is no haggling or shoppers in the game, it's an incremental grinder with RPG elements. There are Quests and a fairly funny story line though. Overall, thumbs up for this."
,Recommended,599460,30261766,Posted: 1 March,all,Higuchi,"When I first started up the game, seeing the poorly translated dialogue scrolling up my screen gave me that sense of dread one gets when they spent their money on a bad product, and you're not sure you can get it back. The tutorial was peculiar; it scrolled too fast and I had no idea what it was trying to tell me half the time.But I didn't give this game a thumbs up because I'm a masochist.The dialogue is genuinely funny, and by the small movements and attention to personality in not only the main characters but the staff as well shows a lot of love went into this game. There's a lot of variety put into everything, from zones to fight in to upgrades to characters; and in an industry where devs tend to just re-color existing sprites, this attention to detail is quite refreshing.And then there's the all-important game play. This is definitely a time-management game, and you have to be ready to keep your eyes on just about everything; you can't jut set and forget the staff you send out, or they'll die; but you have to pay attention to the quality of items the rest of the staff churn out as well.And then there's the goal system. I expected all quests to be achieveable from the get-go, easily accomplished to move on to the next one. This is hardly the case; while some are instant satisfaction, there are many you have to genuinely work towards to accomplish, giving the player long term goals and lengthening gameplay.When I finally came out of my weapon-making stupor, three hours had passed without my notice and my hand was screaming from the carpal tunnel I hadn't noticed creeping up the wrist. I enjoyed playing immensely, and I look forward to playing until I pay back that pesky 5 million."

You tell your staff what to do and they churn out trickets or go on short quests to bring back raw materials.

Each item has a skill to learn and once you master it your adventurers can keep using it even if the item is no longer equipped.The interaction is semi-idle as the adventurers do their fighting without you interacting with it, but there's still a lot of meaningful choice in which characters are chosen as adventurers or crafters, how you outfit them, which goodies to farm and what to craft."

,Not Recommended,599460,30419854,Posted: 9 March,all,⎝Stevepunk⎠,"The UI is bad. Everything requires 2 or 3x as many clicks as necessary.Time continues during story events so you get stuck in dialogue and meanwhile your adventurers die and drop all their loot.Its easy to get stuck in the tutorial - if you close a dialogue box you will stop getting directions, but if you don't close it it blocks the stuff you need to read or click on.I'm a fast reader but the dialogue automatically sent to the next page too many times and if you try to go back it will keep automatically advancing and you'll get further behind.It's impossible to automate workers and impossible to give them orders from the main screen. You have to select the worker then open a menu then click each individual item you want to make, but you can't see which items you need for quests or your inventory - everything is shown in different screens/menus - too many menus - too little info per screen - every interaction requires at least 2 menus deep - it's terribly designed.Its not a clicker because there are too many menus required.It's not an idle game because you can't automate anything.It's not a store game because you just click 'Deliver' to sell an item; no one is ever browsing your store; there is no way to attract patrons; there are no world events influencing prices.Actually to hand in any quest (including those with no items involved), you click 'Deliver' which is weird.It feels like it's designed for an iphone as there's too many buttons and too many deep menus and too little info per screen. Even to move a character you need to click the move button then drag them to a new location then lock them in place. I can imagine accidentally dragging people on an iphone so the lock ability is good for that, but on PC people generally know how to click the mouse without moving it.Also, you can't interact with people when the move mode is active, which FORCES you to switch between move and lock modes even if you don't need them.Seems like a shoddy port of an unfinished mobile game.Not as good as Recettear.Not as good as Game Dev Story or any of Kairosofts games (even though they are designed for mobile!!).Not as good as Game Dev Tycoon on PC.Not as good as any other business game really."
