76561198032373589,Not Recommended,599900,30702899,Posted: 24 March,all,Alpha ☑  Beta ☒,"A poor man's Kingdom Rush with much less features.I think the opening level even uses same soundtrack.The description is missleading, says there are 3 unique heroes but they are all the same in that they have no abilities and just stand there doing the same melee attack."
76561198009907235,Not Recommended,599900,30750294,Posted: 26 March,all,Elvest,TD:FLTG is a classical tower defense game. Not necessarily a bad game but...after just 15 minutes of playing I could easily see what a diluted version of Kingdom Rush this game is.The game itself is not too bad but it's a clear copy of Kingdom Rush. Even the battle music is identical!Would not recommend because of the copycat stuff alone.

From graphics to interface to balancing, everthing is just clunky. I should have read the reviews first but since it was only five  dollars, I thought I couldn't go wrong. I would probably have had more fun trying to give myself a paper cut with that fiver than playing this uninspired, amateurish piece of fail. I've requested a refund."

There is nothing new here that compels me to spend a lot of time trying to beat each level.  Typical type towers with no imagination.  The levels are basic in that they require almost no thought into where to put the 'splash' tower, 'ice' tower, and quick 'arrows'.  Same same same.  This was a nice attempt at Ironhides great TD games.  I'm only happy to say I bought this on sale."
,Not Recommended,599900,30681123,Posted: 23 March,all,Bogus,Ok this is a new released TD game and i did first 3 zones and its still dumpster ive played most TD's  every things clunky in this its kind of pathetic you expect a decent TD but ya dont... like strategy really? u can only put towers in like 5 spots a map.. this is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ i dont even know how that deluded description of this game came into existance.   hopefully it refunds. this is junk. its 2017;
76561198118196602,Not Recommended,599900,30691427,Posted: 23 March,all,Yara,I think I'm nearly at the end of the game (in less than four hours mind you) and I really don't know what to think. The game itself is one of the easier tds. What really sucks is that these big icons during a level cover a lot of the map and sometimes even spots where you can build towers ... often the popup panels ingame are a bit too big too and you end up clicking blind to try and catch the buttons that are off the screen. I had all my upgrades really early on because they are so cheap and I don't feel the need to complete the game at this state. I probably will do so anyway because I like tower defense games a lot but if you are in search for a good one like kingdom rush/kr frontiers go look somewhere else.
,Recommended,599900,30796986,Posted: 28 March,all,Easy Target,"A bit more difficult than other TD games but its a similar to Kingdom Rush when it comes to choose the best towers to defend. There isnt enough diversity of levels & heroes. I enjoyed it overall, but i'd like to see achievements here.6/10"
,Recommended,599900,30682611,Posted: 23 March,all,DuGGa,"I wish it was even cheaper, got it at $2.99, it's good but at 1.99$ was even better. You have 3 heroes to play with, some waves are really hard though, but overall it's okay balanced and I recommend it,it feels like a decent game."
,Recommended,599900,30682648,Posted: 23 March,all,VL プラス,"Tweak the game with some more towers, more upgrade, more spells, more heroes and of course more levels, it only has 30 levels & you can play either on easy mode or hardcore mode in which you have like 3 lives,it's like insanely hard..."
,Recommended,599900,32294668,Posted: 9 June,all,GreyGuts,Your basic stars based TD.  Fun but repetitive.
,Recommended,599900,30670333,Posted: 22 March,all,vittoria,"i love tower defence games and i think i've already played them a lot... maybe most on mobile, but i still can't help buying another one on steam, especially that is done properly - and this one was no exclusion.Too stressful to be a true defense game, you don't have time to watch, especially if you press the fast forward button, the game is very fast and you have to build towers and the hero fast!Levels feel like a chore to do. Also,I need 10 minutes to play a level from start to finish, which is a lot."

,Recommended,599900,30760391,Posted: 26 March,all,RETRIX,"Unfortunately you don't get much at the start to help you get going. I do love this sort of game, especially the heroes side.Would you just give some more food in the first few levels to get you into the flow of the game?"
76561198340609665,Recommended,599900,30687210,Posted: 23 March,all,Alyx,"Come on devs, it's all that you can do?It's a great td game so far, no microtransactions sadly & no DLC... Add these and it'll be more fun & easy to pass..."
,Recommended,599900,30688391,Posted: 23 March,all,mr.WiK,"With minor improvements, more spellz, better map design and more polished cartoonish aesthetics, could get this TD game above others, but for now it's an okay clone of castle defense or bloons td..."
,Recommended,599900,30695038,Posted: 23 March,all,Karapyzzz,"It's more of the same tower defense games again, but that's really no bad thing at all. I can play kingdom rush all over again now :))"
,Recommended,599900,30698643,Posted: 23 March,all,tridognight,"I love tower defense game and I'm very picky on games in this genre, it's a decent one with 30 levels, passed 17 levels in less than 5 hours, so it's a little bit short on levels... But I've also bought it on a sale, so I don't regret it."
,Recommended,599900,30671780,Posted: 22 March,all,sergej110,"Well,well,another tower defense game, now with graphics copied from castle defense & kingdom rush. Wise choice devs, many gamers love this kind of game and me including."

76561198259218875,Recommended,599900,30669317,Posted: 22 March,all,Lucifer,"The Tower td is okay so far... It isn't strategic and gorgeous as kingdom rush is,but it was way more engaging.It lacks some of the features that kingdom rush has, but for this price, it's a bargain."
,Recommended,599900,30668745,Posted: 22 March,all,meowstudios,Solid Tower Defense game! Reminds me of the TDs i used to play when i was a kid. Graphics are cartoony but nice. Difficulty is quite challenging. I will continue playing to discover more
76561198008289670,Not Recommended,599900,34415836,Posted: 22 August,all,m_ikirt,"First, the game is glitchy as hell.  It will move to the background mid-game, forcing you to constantly re start levels.  Also. And this is a big one.  It's a generic Kingdom Rush, and not a good one.  The towers suck, the upgrades suck.  The game sucks more than a White House intern....."
