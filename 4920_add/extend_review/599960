,Not Recommended,599960,32652727,Posted: 22 June,all,Undyne-Requiem-『OVER HEAVEN』,"EDIT: My original claim that the graphics were stolen from other games was corrected by the game's designer in the comments of this review. The sprites were apparently NOT stolen from other games, and were simply an artistic direction the designer decided to go with, albeit one that I cannot understand.========================================================================Finished the game in 60 minutes. It's pretty bad I must say. What people are calling ""a weird art-style"" just means that the art direction was all over the place and wasn't sure of where to go next. I don't know if the designer didn't at some point just give up and steal random sprites from the internet, as most of the art in the game is made with fluid vectorized graphics but then ocasionally you see random out-of-place sprites that seem clearly from other games. There are graphic glitches everywhere, the character movement is full of bugs, and although I finished the game, I'm very dissapointed as I was expecting a decent adventure game, and instead was served a horrible early 2000's flash game.What pisses me off the most is how the screenshots in the steam library litteraly show off all the decent art that exists in this game, because everything else in the game besides what you see in those screenshots are completely out of place.For those praising this game: I have no idea what game you played, it was definitely not the same game as me.PS: I have no idea what was up with the anime girls in this game. They seem like they were taken from random internet imageboards and just placed on this game, as they have no connection to anything else and nothing shows the same artstyle as them."

It promised to be similar to ""Another World"" but it misses the mark. Every screen has some glaring fault in it that wouldn't even be so hard to fix.The most annoying part of playing the game was trying to control the hero in any section that had momentum. When the player presses a direction, they start speeding up, and when they press a different direction, they instantly change to be going in that new direction, so by quickly alternating between left+right or up+down, the hero will jitter in place, this makes it very difficult to slow down properly.I was initially impressed at the death animations, some of them were quite clever and funny, but there was only a few, once I got past those, I would just instantly respawn at the beginning of the screen. This instant respawn was very nice when at any particularly difficult room, but sometimes, when you die, the last checkpoint was 3 screens ago and they were all difficult. This created a few spikes in difficulty seperated by long stretches of monotany.The graphics are barely coordinated. Most of the time it goes for a look similar to Another World, but other times it's more like a generic adobe flash player game. The game often completely breaks the style by inserting anime style illustrations of girls, and it's only girls. The main character gets a few close-ups and he is not in the same style at all.The control layout is atrocious, the default setup being arrow keys for movement, Ctrl for jumping. But when you pick up a weapon, Ctrl stops jumping and is then Fire. Shift/Spacebar is used for a brief moment, but then never used again. Seemingly random letters on the keyboard are used to confirm whether you want to quit the game.The controls should have been WASD+Spacebar for movement and jump, then Ctrl/Mouse Click for the gun and the 1 screen when you use Shift.The ending of the game is just terrible, it kinda hints at some fanservice, but then the game just ends. It gives the player a chance to play a low res version of one of the screens from earlier, but it's not any better.I say if you are feeling nostalgic and you want something like Another World, go play something on this listhttps://www.giantbomb.com/out-of-this-world/3030-17483/similar-games/"
,Recommended,599960,30187391,Posted: 25 February,all,DarkFalzX,"This game is such a bizarre combination of amazing, WTF and terrible, I have no idea what it's going for, but it's mesmerizing nonetheless.The story is nonsensical - a mishmash of every pulp sci-fi idea out there! Amnesiac earth scientist on an alien planet, girls with giant... mechs, evil biomancer cult, visions of godesses... And none of it takes itself serious even for a second, with a wildly shifting tone and tense situations interrupted by dumb goofs.The art is weird. Most of the time it's a slightly amateurish replication of a mix between Another World and Shadow of the Beast with not-so-subtle sexual elements, but every now and again there are very cleanly drawn big-breasted anime girls that just don't fit in at all....And I have no problem with any of the above. What I DO have an issue with, is just how shoddily put together this game is. Assets are combined regardless of scale, animations glitch and jump around, controls are imprecise and just don't feel right (jump repeats if you hold it down, sometimes you walk up and down the stairs by just walking, other times the game asks you to press a button), collision is weird and inconsistent, scenes transition super abruptly, and the whole time it feels like it's held together with spit and duct tape (par for the course for Constructon a sloppy side for a Multimedia Fusion 2 game).As it is, not everyone will find this game an acceptable waste of $4-$5. It really, really needs more polish. But if you can tolerate the amateurish presentation and enjoy creative weirdness punctuated by anime boоbs and dumb humor, definitely give this game a try!"
,Recommended,599960,30326392,Posted: 4 March,all,Spike,"A true love/hate relationship... but worth it if you're patient and appreciate surreal art.Love:The art is incredible and it is evident that the devs are VERY creative minds. Give Salvador Dali a ton of acid, let him watch some Dr. Seuss, and give him a canvas - there is your art direction. The writing is cute and funny without being too much of a meme (has some typos/grammar issues though.) The soundtrack quality is right up there with the visual art; great chiptunes, awesome ambience, and a lot of nostalgic arcade jams. It feels like each song was crafted specifically for the environment in which it plays. Also, anime girls. Everyone can appreciate that.Hate:The controls and keybinds are gross and my controller wouldn't work in any capacity. They are fine for exploring all the cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ but horrible for actual gameplay. The gameplay has platforming, really tight timing levels, and bullet-hell aspects but with messy controls it is SUPER frustrating. A lot of false difficulty, in the sense that it doesn't take skill or thought but is just difficult by circumstance. They give you multiple paths labled easier or harder, but they all suck in the end and don't seem to give you more of a benefit for opting to take the harder route.Overall:I think that it was a really worthwhile experience based solely upon the artistic direction. If you don't appreciate that sort of thing and prefer mechanical polish instead or are just really impatient with BS gameplay elements then I would recommend passing on Dogolrax."
,Not Recommended,599960,32697896,Posted: 23 June,all,Scythe,"It's a weird adventure game that wastes your time with a bunch of mechanically terrible segments and cheap deaths and still only takes you a couple hours to almost fully complete (you will miss bonus stages 6 through 8.  Not even God knows where they are, but it's not like they're fun).  Hastily made; many obvious and easy fixes to glitches are missed.  The few worthwhile moments are early and missable, though pretty funny.No steam overlay support.No configuration options of any kind.  Runs only in fullscreen in what I assume is 1024x720.Some achievements fail to unlock sometimes because of programmer error."

,Not Recommended,599960,33141166,Posted: 2 July,all,Chowster,"I went into Dogolrax hoping for another interesting and fun concept like the old games Another World (Out of this World) and Flashback. However, what you end up getting is a frustrating to control mess of a game. I don't mind that the game jumps around to different types of gameplay. That keeps things varied and keeps the player from being bored, but all of the games seem to control badly.I really wanted to enjoy this game because of the art style and some of the ideas, but I had to stop after about the 100th time of being killed from out of no where and/or because of the controls were limiting.This is the only time I have asked for a refund for a game and I hope that says something."

76561198046184992,Recommended,599960,32753981,Posted: 24 June,all,BadFeungShui,"What the hell did I just subject myself to?I'd describe Dogolrax as kind of like alternating shots of Wario Ware and Out Of This World until you're falling-down drunk, then building a game out of the resulting hangover. It's cosmetically like Out Of This World and Heart of The Alien, but switches rapidly through different gameplay mechanics every two to five minutes like it's on a massive sugar high. The different game modes are pretty varied; some puzzles, mazes, and platforming segments, and toward the end a number of auto-scrolling shooter levels.Regardless of which game mode, though, the hit detection is an absolute garbage taco with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t sauce.It's not a bad experience overall, but it is a confusing one. It made me uncertain if there isn't more going on than it looks like at surface level, with the vague storytelling and the weird plot. Then the game throws an anime-style pinup of a chick with pink hair on screen, and I was like, ""Well never ♥♥♥♥ing mind.""It only kept me busy for about an hour and a half, but it's weird enough to justify a recommendation."

,Recommended,599960,31554858,Posted: 5 May,all,mounrou,"This, game, is, WEIRD. Like Rocky Horror Picture Show kinda weird.Not in a bad way though. Pretty much using the overall framework of Another World to host a handful of lighter game modes of days of yore used by Megaman, R-type, Flabby bird, Yee-Ar Kung Fu, Arkanoids, Mario's underwater stage and so on. With only Left, Right, and Ctrl keys used the control isn't really that hard, the hard bits are all in the retro style controllings and stage designs, with options to skip if you really can't deal of that particular bit. The musics are not annoying at least and you should be able to ignore it after a while. Visuals are Another World-type pixels plus a bit of Japanese Anime PG-13 girls and LOTS and LOTS of gore.This definitely isn't an AAA title, and might be mor niche than good. For 5 bucks though, I'd say its delivered enough contents in an alright enough way to worth its own price. At least didn't make me feel I just wasted the last 95 minutes or so. Still, wait for discount isn't a bad idea either as this is lkely not most people's cup of teas.If there's a sequel I'd play that too I guess. (Not those ones before this game though.)"

Female boobs,that is.There are little mini games in it, there is a nice horror, gore feel to it, with the odd WTF moment. In a nice way.To the devs i say...SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY.

76561198046751087,Not Recommended,599960,33789894,Posted: 25 July,all,Maokasholajuradomako,"Do NOT spend your money on this. It doesn't play well, it's not fun so even if it did play well you'd still not enjoy it, and any game that resorts to pointless anime girls like this is clearly desperate and grasping for any sort of appealing content. In which case, it backfires because of how misplaced it is. Story is unclear, but you know they were attempting something deep and artsy that many other games such as Journey or Silent Hill does. Unfortunately, it was done so poorly all it did was make it more pretentious and well, uninteresting. It was so hard for me to get invested in it, which is sad because the demo video of it looked right up my alley in terms of what it seemed like .Sort of a throwback to Out of this World. But unfortunately the only good thing I can say about this game is that it's got well crafted creatures but if that's what appealed to you in the first place like it did for me, don't let it fool you. This game is HORRIBLE and doesn't deserve to cost any money. It was sooo cheap and yet I feel significantly ripped off."

,Not Recommended,599960,32755254,Posted: 24 June,all,o0TheATeam0o or something,"Pros:-Very creative-Great art styleCons:-Poor Controls, slip and slide everywhere (personal nitpick of mine is the character constantly jumps when holding jump button, making the tight platforming extra frustrating as you jump on to the narrow moving ledge and then jump again to your death over and over.  Taking my finger off the button after every jump felt unnatural).-No Options.  Nothing to change the sound level or controls (ctrl is jump... and arrows are used.  Minor complaint but why not WASD and space?)-Poor hitboxes, prepare to replay sections over and over as you somehow hit spikes nowhere near you especially in the scrolling sections-Scrolling sections with slippery controls and poor hitboxes were extremely frustrating-Boring minigame Breakout clone required to play 3 times to beat game-The hidden games where you dodge the balls had none of the level of attention put towards it art-wise as the rest of the game.  Dodge balls in a rectangular room with a slighly transparent 1 color background with the extra ""lore"" you get from beating it seen through behind it.  A missed opportunity-Very short game, 60 minutes picking the easy routes.With some polish and more content this game could be great.*I don't mind the anime girls tranposed throughout the game, I agree they conflict with the rest of the art but I think that's part of the charm of this game*"
