Picked it up for the summer sale, its cheap price tag and the achievement pool. Actually have to earn them in this game. Reply maps up to 3 times, actually need to advance through gameplay, cant idle this to 100% boys and girls, which is a nice change of pace. Give me incentive to beat your little game.Destroy turrets to progress levels. Collect weapon power-ups from fallen foes (power-ups have a limited time to be used) but ammo is infinate so stay on the kite. Melee and ranged foes alike exist to be fought, and turrets come in many forms to keep the action at a brisk pace. The user has 5 hits to death, so be careful where you step and play with savvy.Achievements as stated above, card badge progression for 600 steam XP, its a get."

,Recommended,600340,31515690,Posted: 2 May,all,ItsLeAshton,"Turret Terminator is a fun, and somewhat challenging game that consists of 80 Levels, and many different types of turrets and monsters to kill, and tons of cool weapons to loot! Was a fun run! Recommended to Achievement Hunters, or Anyone looking for a couple hours of fun. :D"
,Recommended,600340,32197299,Posted: 5 June,all,Mataeus,"TL;DR™ Volume 3I bought Turret Terminator for the achievements, back when 300+ was still a ridiculous amount (It still is, but other titles have taken itwaybeyond).I expected a functional achievement spammer, but Ididn'texpect to have such a blast playing it!It's nothing revolutionary: A twin stick shooter with bought assetts, where you play through 80 stages avoiding and killing enemies and blowing up the turrets which are scattered around each stage. The game is fairly well polished for such a simple experience, however: The music is great, the game always runs super smooth, and the control scheme works flawlessly on an Xbox One pad straight out of the box. Ihighlyrecommend using a controller: I really struggled with the mouse set up, but the smooth, rounded control scheme when using a joypad is perfect.It's cheap, it's entertaining, there's a steady flow of cheevs for completing the levels, picking up different weapons and killing different enemies. If you're looking for something to bolster your achievements without resorting to spammy rubbish, you can do much worse than Turret Terminator.~M~"
76561198035285721,Recommended,600340,32305750,Posted: 9 June,all,bigh  🌊 🌋 🌴,"""Kiting for your life""Surprisingly funmaking 3D arena survival shooter. Each of the 80 levels is challenging but not too big. You will be chased by bugs, aliens, troopers and enemy drones. In the meanwhile you have to shootdown all of the existing turrets to complete the level. You have to dodge a lot from enemy bullets and special turret type shots. Best strategy is to find a route and weaken in a first round all turrets to half energy and finish them in a second round. There are also powerup weapons, but which are hard to pickup because they spawn always in the middle of mobs. The electronic soundtrack is pretty good. But I'm missing some more atmospheric background sound effects. Also the game is somekind of achievement popper game. Have to replay each of the levels for 3 times unneccessarly."

76561197999498546,Recommended,600340,31904510,Posted: 22 May,all,SirTubesALot,"Turret Terminator is an Arena based Twin-Stick Shooter.The game has 80 different Arenas with increasing difficulty and different settings.Your goal is always the same: Destroy every turret and move on to the next Arena.While you're chasing your goal the game spawns an endless amount of other enemys, but always in a fair number. They can drop special powerfull weapons you can collect and use for a short amount of time. And of course they also get harder aswell over the course of the game.As simple as it sounds, as much fun the game is. The Arenas are all different and require their own tactics. The gameplay is fast and fluent, and if you die, you can make your next try within seconds. For the little price the game costs, if offers a lot of gameplay.If you like Twin-Stick Shooters I can fully recommend Turret Terminator to you.I personally had a lot of fun with the game."

Made fun to play through and unlock all ~ 400 achievements.I like that Power/Weapon-Up, but those weapons are hard to get without losing lifes. Anyway, enjoyed + therefore recommend this - especially for this price, cards + ach.!8/10"

76561198079076461,Recommended,600340,32708912,Posted: 23 June,all,Hedgehog797,"A thoroughly enjoyable strategy game disguised as a shoot-em-up. As the title suggests, the object of each level is to destroy all of the turrets without dying. The unusual part is that there is no score, other than the level clear time, which means that killing more grunts has no direct advantage, and often *not* killing them is more beneficial, as grunt respawns are random, and can spawn next to you. In addition, the grunts -and some turrets- always know where you are, and constantly follow you. The strategy that seems to be most effective isto string along the grunts and lead them on a long path, in order to keep them behind you and out of your way.A wonderful game with 80 levels increasing in difficulty.I initially failed to mention the soundtrack, which is pleasantly fast paced, and also syncs perfectly to your gun sounds. Super satisfying to hear."
,Recommended,600340,31768477,Posted: 15 May,all,Conga,"Overall Turret Terminator is a fun and easy to complete indie game. Good for easy achievements if you are into that, although you do have to replay all 80 levels 3 times which is a bit of a waste of time especially if you complete the first playthrough nearly flawlessly. The monsters are fairly easy to navigate around and are only there as a hindrance rather than as enemies. You will be focusing all firepower into the turrets, as the only drops you get from enemies are upgraded guns which last a limited amount of time. The problem with this is that the monsters ""clump"" together making it hard to pick up the drop as they disappear very quickly if they aren't picked up soon."
,Recommended,600340,32207494,Posted: 5 June,all,boyband6666,"Very fun little twin stick shooter. Not perfect (hard to pick up weapons since the enemies continuously swarm), but a chilled evening for sure.Also, extremely cheap, for fun for money ratio is outstanding. Thumbs up from me."

,Recommended,600340,30402157,Posted: 8 March,all,DCircuit,This is my review of the game in a nutshellhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekSz6nsNQM8&t=10sit's very enjoyable for what it's worth. ($2.19)The game starts out slow for people who have played games of this genre before.However it gets increasingly more difficult as you go along. So far I have experienced no bugs.Overall impression is that it is very enjoyable for the price. You won't feel cheated out of your money like other games.
,Recommended,600340,32036457,Posted: 28 May,all,Pacha,"I can't say anything negitive about Turret Terminator..Some might say it gets repetitive after a while but I would disagree, about every 5-10 lvl's they add new Turret's and Monsters(There are 80 lvl's). I also got it for 50¢ and put in a good 3.5 hours. I didn't even encounter any bugs throughout the whole game! It grows on you for sure."
,Recommended,600340,32060746,Posted: 30 May,all,Hope,Great game. You have to keep moving while you aim for the turret. Worth for the money.

It is a top down shooter that is mindless, and for such a cheap price, it certainly delivers what is sets out to do....which is move, aim, shoot.  And as a sucker for mindless simple top down shooter, I need to recommend this game."

76561198073648775,Recommended,600340,33770647,Posted: 24 July,all,Suma,"The game is fun.  Basically you have to destroy some turrets and avoid the enemies trying to kill you at the same time.  As soon as you destroy the turrets, the level ends regardless of how many enemies are left on screen.  Even if you kill all the enemies, they just keep respawning, so just strafe kill the turrets and avoid the enemies!  Easier said than done sometimes! lol You get caught up on the environment, so you need to be careful when running around.There are only 80 levels which go quick! In my short time of playing I already beat 10% of the game. Levels only last about 1 or 2 minutes, but the gameplay could be more exciting.  You run faster than the enemies and the turret's shots, so if you die, it's usually because you got caught on a wall or some other part of the environment. It could use some more polish, but again, it's fun.If you like twin-stick shooters (TSS) and have a fairly good computer, you may like this, but there are much better TSS out there.  Recommended to TSS fans with a decent computer.  As other reviews have stated, the game needs optimizing because it really heats up your computer!!!EDIT: The game crashed occasionally when quitting.  I let the developer know and he fixed it super fast! Great support!!! :-)"
