,Recommended,600370,31227972,Posted: 18 April,all,Populus,"This is a gem chiseled by someone who deeply understands his craft. Possibly the best point&click adventure game I have ever played.It does what the old game of this type did back in the day - combines the humor and zeitgeist of the era it was made in with a completely surreal setting and surreal set of characters. It's that perfect blend, spiced up with a bit of disturbing, sometimes grotesque imagery, that was a staple of great point and clicks. The art is beautiful, the moody synth music is just honey on the ears, the locations are gorgeous as far as a post apocalyptic soviet country goes and the puzzles never feel too hard or too easy. And you want more, just more of it.It's truly a passion project, and it deserves only the highest praise.Hold off from buying whatever franchise telltale has grabbed its paws on, and buy Paradigm. Then buy it for your friends, as they deserve to experience those phat♥♥♥♥♥beatsies."

,Recommended,600370,30976183,Posted: 6 April,all,LittleRigLarrys,HILARIOUS! First time I've bothered to rate a game on steam.What I really enjoyed was the directors narration; in every scene you can hit the 'J' key to reveal Jacob's commentary on what the creative process was for each scene. It just added a level of detail that really made this game stand out. I really appreciate the love and attention given to this game.

Character designs are detailed and varied. The dialogue is hilarious and very well written. But the thing that blew my mind was the sheer amount of voice acting done by the Paradigm VA and supporting cast.

,Recommended,600370,30995959,Posted: 7 April,all,Lucky,"Having played and replayed the demo for this game multiple times, I can say that this is exactly what I was hoping for. A point and click game with mountains of meta-humour and amazing art, some of which the creator made in live streams which bring me a great deal excitement when I see one of those objects in the game. It's like seeing your friend's new born baby 9 months after watching them have sex, truly emotional stuff. The gameplay is nothing particularly special. You have 4 ways of interacting with nearly every object in a scene, and half the fun in this game comes from using every one of those interactions on the individual objects and characters just to hear Paradigm say something funny. The jokes don't always hit, but when they don't I can quickly click on the object again and hear Paradigm use a pick-up line on a literal crack in a giant metal butt. As you can see I don't have too much time in this game yet, that is mostly because I played the demo so much, which lets you fully explore the first 2 areas of the game; the inside and outside of Paradigm's room, that I went as fast as possible to the new areas. Most of my play time after that has been devoted to interacting with every tiny, unimportant object because I cannot get enough of Paradigm's sexy pickup lines.After two years of waiting for this game to be released, I can safely say this is everything promised to me and I love it. Here's hoping that the next game explores the tragic backstory of The Cone in much greater detail."

Unique and really likeable characters, fantastic humour (a lot of references, but just as many own jokes and of course dope memes), a marvelous soundtrack (soon available, can't wait!), brilliant voice acting and really rock solid gameplay.Nothing that made older titles a hassle to play, no pixel searching but instead a helpful tumour that points you in the right direction if lost, no crappy oops you died screens. It left out everything that wasn't fun and instead filled it with more funny dialogues, observations of the maincharacter, item combinations that aren't too bizarre, really interesting characters and phat beatsies.Haven't had that much fun with a game of that genre in ages, neither have I laughed as much, just fantastic.

As if LucasArts some how came back to life and gave disney and star wars a mighty middle finger to them!Point and click through the bizarre Jacob Janerka's masterpiece, as you play as the lovable creature Paradigm.  A chararter whose looks could rival that of Clint Howard and john c reilly. As you go on heroic to save the world! while trying to make time for Phat Beatsies.Some of the best things about this game:1. The sense of Humour (one of the few games that try to BE funny and actually made me laugh a couple of times)2. The voice acting, some of the things the characters say in this game so convincingly just adds to the layer of humour it has.3. The game's art style. This game looks amazing with each scene always making me top and look at the detail put into them.4. Funny and lovable chararcters,5. A neat journey that comes together at the end and I loved every moment I was playing it.I think this game is worth anyone's time and money, it deserve attention to the point where it has too many sequels and we all hate how they have ruined the original's staus.Merchandise to the point where you see pencil tops and bumper stickter of Paradigm and hopefully many many dirty Fanfics where once you are done, not even by the 20th bar of soap can you feel clean again after reading it.So please give Paradigm a chance as it's worth a play through just to see Paradigm's strange behaviour through the game.10 out of 10!

I can't say I expected much several years ago, when the original trailer showed off its gloriously greasy artwork, a style that mixes Salvador Dali with the too-close-for-comfort close-ups ofSpongeboborRen & Stimpy; some things are just too good to get in quantity.  The game, however, pulls it all off and more, lacing its ten hours of painstaking graphical work with awesome humor, clever (but never ball-breaking) puzzles, smooth electronica that would be right at home in a 1970's informational reel, and countless unique ideas.Saturatedis almost what you'd call it -- there's something to look at, or laugh at, or play with tamped into every crevice.Believe it or not, there's something more inParadigm:  a kind of wholesome affirmation about the value of life, even when that life is none too pleasing to the eye.  In this and many other ways, it was an adventure that kept me surprised and engaged through the very end."

There was a moment I thought the game was going to shift to a more emotional narrative given the background of Paradigms character (no spoilers) but still stayed on the more whimisical track.Paradigm is full of unique characters, sometimes you find that come out of nowhere, but feel they just fit nonetheless (Personally I have a soft spot for Igorski the voka-drinking mutant dog, he's so ugly he's cute) the voice cast is steller, and the puzzles moderate in challenge.

Every little detail simultaneously marries together the consistent theme, while also being memorable and unique at the same time.

I needed to use the Dev's walkthrough guide numerous times to advance the story. I think some of the things you need to do are very random and I would have had no chance in ever solving them without the guide.In saying that the guide is very well written and easy to access when using the steam overlay.I only needed it a few times and everything else was straight forward or solvable with a little bit of thinking.I would strongly recommend this game.

All the voice acting and content and storyline is superbly well thought out. Full of hearty details in the character designs. The highlight for me is the random ARTISTIC marquee and the speech pattern of tumour. Mainly because I am an introverted Prodigy child with a legit arts degree. Neat."

The second being the length of the game. I took my time and still beat Paradigm in only 6 hours. While that 6 hours were great fun and totally worth the price of admission, I really wanted to continue the story and play more in the world the creator had made.Its surprising Paradigm isn't being talked about more on the internet.If you're a fan of adventure games, you won't be disappointed with Paradigm."

As the game progresses, the solutions get more complex and less obvious. I completed it in a day without hints. This was mildly amusing.The thing that makes this game stand apart from other point and click games is its sense of humor. I apreciate the usual exotic solutions to problems, but in this gameeverythingis absurd. The dialogue, the scenes, the characters and the events are absurd. If it wouldn't have been possible to just click past long meaningless but ""funny"" dialogues about self-loathing and sexual needs, my stamina would not have been enough to complete it.In order to apreciate this game, you have to find the following hilarious:A beatboxing eggplant that rides a small electric car.A missile silo shaped like a butt.East-european accent.Things I did enjoy:Satire on post modern art and cultureSatire on ITProblem solving and progression paceAudioI am a 35 year old swedish male with a fond memory of Monkey Island.

Some of the puzzles took quite some time to think about, but its fully possible to beat the game on hard mode, without consulting a guide.

I absolutely shudder to think at the man hours put into getting the flow and pacing of this game right.Which leads to the next huge positive, there is a shocking amount of attention to detail and effort put into this game and when taking into account the dev team size it's incredible how much is in this for you to prod at. Whenever i thought the game was surely out of surprises another one just comes out of nowhere, the ""multiple endings"" in particular had me in tears, i always wanted a bad fan fiction ending for Paradigm and doug.The characters are all incredibly memorable and you're never with one particular character for a long period of time which further illustrates just how well designed they are, your few minute interaction with them sticks with you and the end result is memorable characters done without taking 10 hours of RPG journeying to like them.The animation i think was done wonderfully, it was done with limited manpower and never feels cheap in the way a LOT of small indie game animation can feel, it has that magic about it that's both visually cohesive despite the massively contrasting situations and it has that timeless feel to it, this game will look great 10 years ago or 10 years from now.My complaints are simply: i want more, i want a sequel that just gives more puzzles and intricacy, more character interactions and more paradigm. If the (mild spoilers) bit at the end of the game was teasing a road trip sequel i'm down, i was almost disappointed that it didn't become a surprise act 3. (Also the sassy japanese robot not being a character made me sad, a man needs his cute japanese robot sass)So in summary: Buy this, it is consistently funny and interesting, the puzzles won't break the brain but they let the game maintain a really comfortable pace and you will always find something to poke at that will surprise you. This game flat out requires a sequel in my mind, the world and characters are too interesting to not keep exploring and a road trip with a beatboxing electronic hip hop trio is an idea too good to pass up in paradigms world.The ending credit beat was indeed very dope, buy this game brosiphinos."

Paradigm is the first game in years that's made me laugh anywhere near as hard as the old classics. And unlike those classics, the puzzles in Paradigm don't make me want to throw my computer out a window.It's a beautiful labor of love, with fantastic and hilarious art. Hell, even the music is funny!I love this game, and if you like adventure games, funny games, or humor in general, you will love it too."

I only got to review it now because I got reminded by a tweet to review games you loved a lot.The jokes are completely in my humour so I was laughing so much with those. The gameplay on itself makes me go back to the old days of Pajama Sam, Freddie Fish & Putt Putt, so I could feel like a child again while the story is for more mature people.It has such a great replay value but I didn't get to replaying yet because other games I wanted to play a lot. Also I'm impressed how the dev almost immediately helped out when there was a bug in my game. I came near the end of the game & couldn't progress more, so I tweeted him about it & he helped me out in the DMs while I helped him out by sending him my savefiles so he could investigate what went wrong to solve it in a patch.Overall for the support on the game: 10/10For the game itself I'd give a 8/10 since it had those few gamebreaking bugs that are hopefully solved already. Without those I'd give a 9/10."

With multiple references to Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island, and more, this game still deliver's its own bizare story that is worth the trip. The art is beautiful (and varied which is refreshingly unexpected) and plays on many pop culture references for added LoL's.While it may seem odd at first, the story in all is quite solid. The puzzles complicated, but not to any unsolvable degree (I was able to complete it without needing to look up a walk through - just decent dedication to problem solving). The characters are fantasic (especially the mutated pharmasutical octopus Steph).If there was one complaint I'd make, its that its in a 2 Act Structure opposed to a hopeful 3 Act story. This can leave the player a little disapointed when the ending suddenly appears, but not to any degree you feel cheated. Some people may be turned off by the inuendo and drug-use-based comedy, but past that hurdle is a great adventure that is worth taking.All in all I do recomend the game. I even spoke to its creator and he's a great guy who loves feedback on his work. This is an indi designer who should be supported. So please do so if able and enjoy the good times :)"

76561198095242865,Recommended,600370,33728023,Posted: 22 July,all,eazar001,"This is a great game that taps into the nostalgic side of the brain of any of the classic point-and-click adventure gamers. The humor is obviously twisted (which I enjoyed, and found quite refreshing), but also finds its way into many tech-pop culture allusions. Paradigm finds a way to make clever social commentary about intelligence, status, and social value; however, it manages to do all this without taking itself seriously.The puzzles are challenging enough, but not to the point where they get in the way of progress or enjoyment. There was one puzzle near the end of the game that I found quite awkward and difficult to solve; besides that one hitch, the consistency of the puzzle challenges was well thought out. The atmosphere was great, and was extremely effective at giving you an 80's synth/retro throwback ambience.Overall, Paradigm is a game that stays faithful to the character of classic adventure games that people like me love, however it manages to bring something completely new to the table with its unique sense of twisted humor, graphics, and refreshing brand of story-telling.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who's looking to have some fun and laugh while they're at it (regardless of genre preference)."

Money well spent.I couldn't contain my excitement when Paradigm popped up in my reccommendations list and had a spot on the Steam homepage. After seeing videos of the demo 3-ish years ago, it's always been in the back of my head; so when I saw it was released, I knew I had to buy it. The story and dialogue are hilarious, the characters are eccentric, quirky, and well designed, the artwork and music are extraordinary, and the voice acting is amazing. I give props to Jacob for the tedious work he put into Paradigm over the last 3 years of its development. I'm glad Paradigm was so well recieved, you deserve it! Thanks for the 10+ hours of material for me to ugly-laugh to. It's nice to see that there are more people out there with the same sense of humor I have.(Also, if you do see this Jacob, I'm sorry if I was weird or awkward when I sent an e-mail regarding the ingame issues I had. I really didn't know it would be you personally dealing with everything yourself. I remember I said something like, ""Oh I can't wait for you and yourcompanyto release a game in the future!"" It was after I clicked send that I realized it's one guy, not a company. As stupid as it is to worry about something like that, it really bugs me even to this day. Also, I wanted to say theIt Was All a Dreamending was my favorite alternative ending. It looked like fun rolling down the sand dunes.)"
