,Not Recommended,600720,32525966,Posted: 17 June,all,Andrew,"I'm giving this game a negative review for the way it updates, I don't understand why they have the need to update the game through maniaplanet which is 100 times slower than steam... The purpose of steam was to always have your games up to date, but after a long day of work I want to relax with some trackmania and I get hit with a mania planet update and it goes so slow I just end up playing something else.Why is there a need to overcomplicate things these days... reminds me of battlefield's battlelog, and we all know how that ended up going.,"
,Recommended,600720,31938753,Posted: 24 May,all,lol?,"Been playing the game a week before release during the closed beta. From what I've experienced, it's exactly the same as all the other TM games; easy to pick up, hard to master, and very, very, very addictive.Environment looks beautiful. It's a unique looking and feeling environment and really adds well to the series.As for the track editor blocks, there's a good selection and they look great. My only gripe is that there needs to be more transitional blocks; i.e, platforms with small lips and shallow changes in height or camber.The car physics are great. For you TM fans out there, imagine a mix of Island and Bay from United, but with drift physics of Canyon. That is literally what this car feels like... and I love it.Graphics are beautiful, so you video editors (and myself) will have a ball doing scenery or action videos due to the great environment, and the car physics make stunts very easy :)If you have never played a TM game before and are interested in picking this up, go for it. It's tons of fun and I can fully recommend. If you are a die hard Trackmania fan, then why are you reading this? Go buy it now!"

This game is not only a BLAST to play, but the music is pretty awesome as well. Trying to get all the golds in the levels is quite a fun challenge, and reminds me of games from my childhood like Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing, lol.If you guys wanna see an example of the gameplay, heres my video on it. I just stuck to the first few races for now however:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmKOiuJ2PXc"

The handling model of the car requires some learning but once you know how to control the car well, the game is awesome. Just like any other Trackmania game. I love it! :)"

,Not Recommended,600720,32834443,Posted: 26 June,all,Motanum,"Game is just not worthed.I own the original Trackmania United. I played a lot of Stadium. I loved Canyon and I loved TM2 Stadium. I also enjoyed Turno.Lagoon is just not good enough of a Trackmania title. The visuals are too similar to Turbo.The handling of the car is not my favorite. It feels to sticky and super responsive for a car of the size it is modeled. I was hoping for something more in line with TM Island, which is different from Stadium, but very fun to play at full speed and to drift on corners.But the worst, the absolute worst that made me ask for a refund, is the performance. It will randomly stutter, at times during a turn, so you will get screwed of a good lap time because of the game performance, which just becomes frustrating."

The Trackmania 2 series was the first set of games I bought on PC and the franchise is still delivering amazing experiences!Pros:+Great new grip system and handling for this run of cars!+Amazing graphics as usual!+Beautiful world! I mean it. This is the most visualling appealing title so far!+Track editor is fully loaded with amazing pieces!Neutral:~Steering is tough and hard to control, as it is vastly more responsive than any of the other titles.Negative:-Sand. I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."

The update for the Mania Planet interface in general is huge though. Nice to see they fixed the issue with not being able to switch environments without a restart in the Steam version."

76561198032360788,Recommended,600720,33177586,Posted: 3 July,all,Catalyst,"I am not a new player of Trackmania, a long time ago I had played United Forever and I was absolutely found of this game.Recently, I just heard that there was a new Trackmania which was going to be released, I hadn't heared about Turbo and I was so happy to be able to replay a serie that I thought was dead.So yeah I really enjoyed this game and I'm gonna make a review of what my experience was like :So, first, I'm tired of these peoples complaining ""The interface sucks, it's ugly as hell"" . This argument is just false because this is just a question about personal tastes. They are also complaining about the fact that it is difficult to understand, where I do not agree simply because I hadn't any problems understanding it.Second, the difficulty, yeah, I agree the game is really easy until red tracks, but I do not think it is that bad, It makes the game way better for new players because it gives them the time to adapt to the controls until the finally get to the hard tracks. So the difficulty curve should need a higher difficulty overall, I totally agree on that point but it makes the game good for newcomers, which is why I think it is good enough.Third, the editor, I absolutely need to find a way to play united again because I hear that Lagoon's editor is not as good as the one from United, but from what I remember, the editor was really good in united but I can't see in any ways why it is better than the one in Lagoon. The one in Lagoon even has mixmapping and airmapping which are both awesome features that weren't in United Forever.Fourth, the game lacks community. YEAAH, cannot say anything against that, it is rare to find a server with at least one person in. So yeah :| Lagoon definitely lacks a communityFifth, Lack of split screen, no, the game doesn't lack split screen, it just lacks the campaign maps, you can still play on your own maps. Because of the kind of recent Maniaplanet 4 update, the campaign tracks are lacking in splitscreen, so, yeah, huge bad fact about the game, but It's not like you can't play split screen, you can still play in your own maps, wich I loved to show to my friends.So yeah I hoped this review helped you and I really do hope you will enjoy the game"

,Recommended,600720,31927522,Posted: 23 May,all,Syreio,The exact same as every other TM game ever created.Unbelievably fun.
,Recommended,600720,32024886,Posted: 28 May,all,eyebo,"One of best titles of the TrackMania 2 series! The mixture of varied driving surfaces, tropical atmosphere, and extensive map creation tools means this game will give endless hours of fun. I mostly play the non-Steam version, so my hours don't reflect just how much I love this game. But I highly recommend it to everyone, but especially those who enjoyed the old Island, Snow, and Bay environments in old TrackMania. It's a little something for everyone."
,Recommended,600720,34113199,Posted: 8 August,all,Dark_Lover,"Huge fan of Trackmania, but would recommend Canyon instead of Lagoon and Valley.Lagoon is basically Bay². (The city cars from united forever). So if you like sharp corners and a really intense reaction time, then you can go buy this game.Still fun tho."
76561198025331540,Recommended,600720,33152876,Posted: 2 July,all,SneakyTT,"Been hearing about this Trackmania series for years, and finally decided to check it out.The game, at its heart, is a series of time trials on short courses, with very appealing visuals, sounds, and physics. I love how it strips away all the usual racing game elements - like story, dialogue, car choices, tuning, etc. It's just a pure racing experience, which is a joy to play.However, Trackmania 2 Lagoon is one part of a larger game ""system"" called Maniaplanet, which is very confusing at first - though once you wrap your mind around it, it all kind of makes sense.Besides Lagoon, there are a number of other racing environments, such as Stadium, Canyon, and Valley - each of which you need to buy separately - bu they're all kind of mixed together on Maniaplanet. There's also a first-person shooting game system mixed in as well.I started off with the demo, which I eventually discovered was a free version of all the games, where you can only play one ""channel"" at a time. But, this means you can play Trackmania for free as long as you want, but just one channel at a time. So you may need to wait awhile before Lagoon comes up.You can design your own courses. And there are public server where you can race online with others on a series of player-designed courses. The more I play, the more I am discovering about this whole system.But anyway, just the solo time trial mode in Lagoon is well worth the price.Don't let all the complications of the interface keep you away... the game itself is pure addictive video game pleasure."

I remember playing the original game back in the days. I would have thought newer releases would have gotten better in quality, that the franchise would have polished their interface (that menu is not intuitive to navigate through). Once originally installed, the whole thing started updating content for the next hour before I could play, taking over everything (could have been updating in the background and let me play other games while waiting.. but no, that cheap cloud screensaver with loading bars is meant to give a better experience ?) asking for refund now."

,Recommended,600720,32282608,Posted: 8 June,all,grimsreapr,"By the time I realized I had only purchased Lagoon, NOT Canyon, Shootmania, etc., it was too late to refund it towards TMU. That being said, today they patched the handling so the game feels a little more fluid now, whereas TMNF felt stable. You can still access the other additions, without the ability to chat (and a pleasant reminder you did not in fact purchase what you thought). I'll continue to play it, only because I'm mad that I spent the $20."
,Not Recommended,600720,33938574,Posted: 31 July,all,PhafaeL -夢現-,"Ah, Lagoon. I saw the trailers and was amazed by what I saw. It looks great, like a remake of the Bay environment from TrackMania Sunrise and United. Then I bought it, only to regret instantly after. The game sure looks and sounds great, but the car physics ruin it completely for me. The cars are literally undriveable. The steering is too sensitive and for a game like TrackMania, this is terrible. A mere touch on a wall and your time is garbage. And this happens way too many times on Lagoon. Canyon was perfect; Stadium was great; Valley was good; Lagoon is... disappointing.I'll wait for the upcoming updates to see if they can make the game feel better. If something like that happens, I will edit this review."

,Not Recommended,600720,31957636,Posted: 25 May,all,Darth Gumballs,"It's okay. The handling is hard getting used to and not quite what I expected. If you want a silly arcade racer, this might be for you, but at the same time all you do is race the same laps over and over with a bunch of inivisible other players, so there's no real interaction besides chat and the time leaderboard. The tracks get repetitive, and some are stupid difficult for no apparent reason.It runs relatively well and looks nice at least as far as the tracks go. A lot of the textures outside of the track are pretty bad. I can say it's crashed a few times on me, but everything loads quick enough so it's not a huge pain to get back into."

With >8k hours on TM2 stadium, this one didn't really appeal to me as much, even on paper.But first impressions are even worse than I expected.Astonishingly twitchy controls, tracks that seem to go for 'wow' factor above drivability, absolutely terrible choice of camera angles, no ability to select my monitor's resolution in-game (I had to use the launcher) and a (solo) ranking system that broke after only 3 tracks.I'm still going to recommend it, because if you liked Turbo more than the TM2 games, this is quite probably for you. It lacks some of the 'console gen' irksomeness of Turbo, while at the same time including envionment/controls and track blocks much more like that title.Probably back to TM2 Stadium for me, though."
