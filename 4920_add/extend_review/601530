I feel like the developers have played a lot of hidden object games themselves, took everything good about those games and made their own beautiful game.It's a Collector Edition HOG, you get a Main Story and then a shorter bonus chapter. It has a wide variety of puzzles, even the HO scenes have variety. It has an in game guide if you need it. Lots of extras, gorgeous artwork & Plenty of achievements. Again you really couldn't ask for more."

,Recommended,601530,33101897,Posted: 1 July,all,Carathis,"Recently, I've become a fan of HOG and Darkarta is one of those games that caught my attention and provided me to get into this genre. The aim in the game can be familiar but the storytelling and the way of blending it with Indian mythology is noticeable. The puzzles and mini games are enjoyable, relevant to the story and there is not repetition. After you finish the game, there is also a small extension of the story that you can play.The character design, concept art and graphics are obvious that they were created detailed enough. The cinematics are OK; but they could be livelier. The music and soundtrtack are well-designed. The voice acting is good; however there are some moments that the protagonist's voice doesn't have the exact emotion and her tone is irrelevant. There is an extra section on the menu that you can find a comic book about the story, soundtrack, wallpapers and all the puzzles and mini games that you passed before. You can play them again.So, I recommend Darkarta both to the fans of this genre and those who want to get into this genre."

,Not Recommended,601530,35180600,Posted: 24 September,all,caubert,"For casual player I would not recommend this game for 6 euros, with 90% coupon - it's ok. Hard-core HOP fans, yeah you can cope with all the bad things this game has - bad translation, annoying kid factor, bad character artwork (scenery is beautiful and colorful, but chars not), very bad narrative, OK VO I guess, music is quite good. Puzzles are a bit annoying, but not hard.So if you don't play Hidden Object Games often I would not recommend this game to you."
76561197970585058,Recommended,601530,30996699,Posted: 7 April,all,Varkster,"Pretty sure this is the best HO game I've played. Cost more than I usually pay for them, but I don't regret it at all. I really didn't want it to end. In fact, the only thing which is stopping me starting over immediately is that I want to forget it a bit before starting again.Some people watch TV while they eat. I often play HOPs instead. Because they are not time-dependant, are pretty relaxing, and you can usually just pick one up, play a bit, then leave it for another time. I'm almost reluctant to call them 'puzzles' actually, as most don't really require much brain-power or logic to solve. They're 'puzzles' in the jigsaw sense. It's mostly time-filler. But relaxing and entertaining still, if you like that kind of thing.But with Darkarta I found myself enjoying it so much I pretty-much didn't stop playing until it was finished.I felt the story starts off pretty generic and a bit naff, although it does get better towards the end. But the story isn't why I play HOPs.The puzzles here are really very good. Not hard; not even mind-blowingly original. But clever and very well put-together. Even the cookie-cutter HOP staples have been added to, or have extra twists which make them feel fresh. I played through as much in anticipation of what they'd come up with next as enjoying the puzzles themselves.Works nice in HD (which many don't) and graphics are beautifully done. (The cut-scenes are a bit rough around the edges, but I can live with that. I actually find it pretty amazing that in-game GFX can actually bebetternow than pre-rendered sequences.)Oh; and one other thing I really liked. It's never made any sense at all to me why someone in the middle of such an adventure as this should discard an obviously useful item like a knife or a box of matches after only one use. Only to have to solve a similar problem later. (Or why they can't simply return to where they left them and pick them up again, for that matter.) In Darkarta, you occasionally get to use an item multiple times for different things. It's still not quite true-to-life, but it's a solid step in the right direction.From a new developer this is a fantastic achievement. I suspect that when you start off in something like this you actually think a bit more carefully about what you are doing, rather than churning out endless slight variations on the same theme. If that is the case, thenpleasecontinue with more of the thinking, less of the churning! :)Edit: it seems since I got it, it's dropped considerably in price. So now definitely worth picking up."

76561198096573822,Recommended,601530,33314250,Posted: 6 July,all,Revised,"One of the best hidden object games I've played and a steal at the sale price of three dollars. The puzzles are interesting and fun, if a bit easy, and the game doesn't load you down with too many fetch quests or filler, it's perfectly balanced and everything is relevant to the plot. Also, all objects have a logical use not like some games where objects do ridiculous things that you would never guess without a hint or just clicking everything until something works. The art is beautiful too, and the story is interesting and moves forward at a good pace. I suppose the game is a bit short, I finished it in nine hours, but it's fun and inexpensive with a regular price of six dollars."
76561198209546307,Recommended,601530,30400150,Posted: 8 March,all,leapfrog0202,"I purchase approximately 50 hidden object/puzzle games a year (on a different game site as I found Steam not long ago) and have done for the last 10 years. I'm also on Pond Friends in case any of you are curious. That's how I found out about this game. Out of all those games I can state that Darkarta is absolutely the best I have played.Graphics are just amazing. The colors used, the location and setting, the detail...I could go on for days. Every single scene had so many things to look at and admire.Hidden Object scenes - wonderful and multi-layered.Puzzles - some puzzles are similar to what other developers are doing, but above and beyond. Many are unique and unlike other puzzles I've seen before. Absolutely great fun and they really made me think.Setting - India with all its grandeur, beauty and lushness is explored in this game. I loved the setting and really didn't want to quit playing when I had to.Storyline - different than other games I've played recently. Interesting take on the story of a child taken from her parents.Collectibles - different as well. These pertain to the taken child and are fun to look for.Game play - smooth and enjoyable.Music - absolutely fits the setting and is peaceful and enjoyable."
76561198077378264,Recommended,601530,33366378,Posted: 8 July,all,Sorenn,Recently I have been playing a bunch of hidden object games.  There are a lot of very good things about this game.  The artwork for the backgrounds and puzzles is top notch.  The puzzles are challenging and interesting except for a few of the pair matching games were a bit tedious.  I really liked the Indian theme to the game - all of the environments and objects seemed very true to the theme.  Based on that alone I do recommend this game and I will definitely look for other games by this group of developers.I did not like the cut scenes or the back story.  The animation is well drawn but I found the whiny four year old to be really annoying. I missed out on one of the achievements because I just skipped past the cut scenes.   Maybe I'm just a grumpy old guy with no maternal instinct?I would give this game 9 out of 10 for the puzzles and artwork but I have to deduct 2 out of 10 for the annoying child so 7 out of 10 is my final rating.
,Recommended,601530,34508595,Posted: 26 August,all,janner66,This is the best HOG I have played so far. There are probably more puzzle games than hidden object games which is a good thing. The puzzles are varied and interesting. Quite often I would see a puzzle that I had not encountered before in other HOGs so I was impressed with the imagination of the game. You can tell straight away that this game is a superior game to many others of its type. The production values are high and the voice acting is superb. The story keeps you interested throughout.I really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games or hidden objects games.P.S The devs are amazing. They are so helpful and impliment updates and improvements all the time. I made a suggestion and they replied immediately saying they would impliment this within 2 weeks. Wow!
76561197970635339,Recommended,601530,34538433,Posted: 27 August,all,Mort,"Great artwork and cutscenes. Puzzles often too easy (especially the HOP). Worst part is the story, so soppy, full of bad clichés and predictable that it borders on annoying. Voice acting is mixed, some good, some bad. Music is unremarkable but also unobstrusive and relaxing. In all, not really up there with the best (say, Artifex Mundi) but still good enough to be worth the asking price."

I'm not sure if the backstory is based on real-world legends or a completely made up tale, but there are hints of... something there.You play as Mary, who is returning to the place she grew up after the death of her parents. It seems something supernatural has decided to intervene, and has kidnapped your daughter. Now you need to catch up to a strange man on a flying buffalo.Anyway, I would recommend this to those who like such games."

Beautiful graphics, awesome and amazing voice-overs (which for me can make or break a game), and a very unique and engaging story line.

We are led into Indian mythology this time,  away from the rules of our known world.On the surface we have Mary on her search for her kidnapped child, step by step we see the whole picture: in her past life in India centuries ago she committed a deadly sin. So loosing her child now is payment for her deed as the princess, she then was.A powerful game, reminding me a bit of a Bollywood movie, a good one!"

An intriguing storyline, a different mythology and innovative puzzles make this game a cut above the rest. Have some snacks on hand, because you will want to play this one straight through. As a hardened game player, I didn't expect the few 'tugs at the heartstrings' I encountered.( Don't worry, everything turns out OK). Lots of 'extras' including an excellent comic book which explains the events leading up to where the game starts. Beautiful graphics which reflect the rich  Indian heritage,  wonderful music and interesting characters, make this a game you will want to replay. Tutti-frutti are a developer to watch out for, I'm already looking forward to their next production!"
76561198280396592,Recommended,601530,30399130,Posted: 8 March,all,sunnyglow,"This is truly a beautiful game, a tribute to the Indian culture by an up-and-coming new developer, tuttifrutti.  Based upon an ancient folktale, it blends that story with a modern-day tale about a mother in search of her daughter. The story behind the game is and emotional adventure - a heart-wrenching trek for a mother who all obstacles to locate her kidnapped daughter. It also helps her to come to grips with her own nightmares from the  past.  The graphics are amazingly beautiful and well-depict the lush Indian landscape.  The background contains a musical score reflecting the exotic melody of India.  The HOP scenes demonstrate the genius of this developer.  They are thematic and include some new concepts in portraying HOP scenes.  In one example, there is a scene in which you locate fragments on a crystalline ball. The puzzles are varied in difficulty and variety and are thematic as well.  In one example, you choose the correct hand positions to create a shadow animal.  The game explores a new concept not common in most HOP games, namely reincarnation.  This game is a must-have for serious casual game lovers.  It is truly a work of art and is truly a tribute to not only the country of India but the great love of this developer for their rich heritage."

I have seen lots of games but this one actually took my breath away. Beautiful story, voice overs were fantastic and realistic and the graphics in this game is absolutely amazing.Filled with puzzles and lots to do.. fun and creative HO in many variaties. I was not bored one single time through out the game.. just eager to see what was coming next and each time I was not disappointed. This mother goes through so much to be with her little girl and as for myself being a father I could easily feel what the mother was feeling – then when you add the little girls crying words for her mother is sometimes very heartbreaking and very touching.The extras were super cool.. and I really appreciated the memory room and the comic book.And of course, the music were spot on.Congratulations and well done, you guys are amazing!I’m eager to play the continuation... :)"

The eyes are too big, and something is very off about the mouth.  Instead of wanting to rescue her, I just want her off the screen and to never see her again.  Additionally, every voice actor pronounced the names differently.  I really wish they'd received some sort of note on how to pronounce things so they wouldn't all be winging it."

And this game has it. Tuttifutti scored a perfect 10.I am avid player of this kind of game genre and have tons of games. Lately alot of games of been very dark and gloomy...down right depressing. Well, this Darkarta is far from this. Though the title at first appears to be gloomy, the game is far from it. I can say after playing the game from start to end...it's beautiful in many ways. (Sorry, no spoilers here!)  I just can say if you like this kind of genre/game you have to play this.  It is one of those games that makes you ache for more after you're finished and touches you in ways that are just to human."

The story, the graphics, the VO's, and the cutscenes brilliantly done.  The cutscenes are the best I have seen in a long time.  You do have collectibles which are memories and morphing objects.  There is also a walkthrough in the book which is very well done.  Don't know how they did it, but what ever scene you are in the game, the walkthrough is there.  I've never seen that done and I love it.  It also shows you the hidden object scenes and where the items are.  Kudos to who did the walkthrough.  Now Darkarta is eye candy for the ladies, but evil evil evil.Story:  You, your hubby and your daughter were enjoying a lovely time in a boat when out of the blue an evil entity came out of nowhere and reeked havoc on you and your family kidnapping your daughter.  The evil dude of course was Darkarta.  The reason for it is he wants your daughter's soul and because he is thinking your another woman by the name of Nagin and he wants revenge.  Naturally you have no idea what the heck is happening.  All you want to do is to save your daughter's life and get the heck out of dodge.  So now you're on a journey to save your daughter and kill Darkarta.  Even though your grandfather said not to, what kind of mom would you be if you didn't put your life in jeopardy to save your baby.  And the story goes.Graphics:  Absolutely gorgeous.  The kind where you like to just stop and look a moment before continuing.Music:  Beautiful music.  A lot of voice.  Very nice to listen to whilst playing the game.MIni games:  Except for the slider puzzle, all the mini games are different.  I never played them before.  And I have except for three games all CE's known to man lol.  Very nice variety.HOGS:  They have a match 3 game if you don't want to do the HOG.  One word list had to where you could hover over the word and see a silhouette of it.  They had silhouettes, use one item to use on the scene, and find symbols.  Also they mini games in the HOGS, and what I noticed is that I couldn't complete the mini game, but instead of skipping it, I did the match 3 instead and didn't get a count for skipping.  It seemed to count it as part of the HOG.Hint:  I didn't use it in the HOG, but on the outside it was awesome.  Told you what exactly you had to, what items to use and where to go.Map:  It has the exclamation points telling you you have something to do there.  Also it tells you if you have a collectible yet to get.  And yes it's a jump map.Kudos to the team on a very superb done game.  I highly recommend this game.  Free to try, and $8.99 to buy.  Can't beat that price.  :-)"

Negatives:  Quick play, which was kind of disappointing -- didn't want it to end so soon.  Male in the animation is kind of creepy and too feminine.  Story was weak.
