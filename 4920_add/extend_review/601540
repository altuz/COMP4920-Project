Leaving poor user reviews, to the point where fewer customers try it out, and the developer lose heart.Developer, if you do read the reviews here, don't get crushed by those instant gratification junkies.You got something really good here, and it will surely be legendary if you stick with it."

,Recommended,601540,32166255,Posted: 3 June,all,Bogtrotter,"**THE DEV UPDATES THE GAME MULTIPLE TIMES A WEEK**Basicly the game is a lovechild between mount and blade warband and(any)generic top down medival strategy warfare game. Seiges are fun battles are fun, what isnotfun however is the world map, but as the dev has stated multiple times it is just a placeholder. Animations(in the world map)are not fun to watch, the bar next to units on the world map(the ones that indicate how many soilders belong to said unit)are uncalled for.Game is fun if you have the patience for it.StillV.E.R.Yearly in developnment but i feel like this is a gem waiting to shine. Despite the bugs, loading times, and frustration, i really really love this game."
,Recommended,601540,31547295,Posted: 4 May,all,D-Jake,First words for people complaining and giving thumbs down: its early access.. what do you expect? of course it will be full of bugs... but you know what? theres one man standing behind it and hes working hard on this game while listening and responding to the community. by giving it bad reviews you may slowdown or even stop the development of this piece. it needs a lot of fixes and improvements at the time i write this review but he also needs some support to carry on with challenging the problems one by one. thats why even though for now i stopped playing as its not that enjoyable and it doesnt have much to offer for my personal entertainment i believe one day it will so im leaving the thumbs up and will come back in some time to check on the progress. good rating is very important here and £10 is a really fair price so i recommend this game and hope to see it grow as well as dev's team.
76561198027117855,Recommended,601540,33600807,Posted: 16 July,all,Clint Eastwood,"I believe that there is great potential in this game. I've seen people comparing it to total war, and while it may initially seem similar in ways I feel that this is an unfair comparison, apples to oranges if you will. The important thing that sets this game apart is that you create YOUR faction, the way you want it to be. As a fiction writer, I am thrilled to have the opportunity to create factions with specific uniforms and a leader from my stories. That being said, I do wish that the faction customization was more expansive, and I wish that there was a way to rename cities. Other than that, this is a perma-death game, which has its pros and cons. I love the thrill of risking my leader's life at times, yet when I am in over my head and he gets killed I am not always prepared to deal with that. For some reason, some aspects of this game remind me of Kenshi, another game on Steam that I love. This is a major compliment because Kenshi is one of very few games that has such great potential and appeal while in early access. Veil of Crows has a ways to go, but I am interested in seeing how things turn out. I think we all would like a rework of the overworld map, among other things. As of right now I would give the game a 7.5/10, docking a few points for the few issues that irk me. The rating would be lower if this were a less original idea, but I like the concept and I think it can go far. I also appreciate that the devs update the game VERY frequently, which is something to be respected. Things I'd like to see added: diplomacy improvements, more faction aesthetic customization, city/town customization (other than upgrades/buildings), the allowance of group creation in battle (prefered over the current numeric organization system, but that may just be something I need to get more acquainted with), and greater hero customization among other things. While total war and civ games excel at history, this game caters more to those wishing to create their own faction. I like starting out in sandbox mode, as I can start with an abundance of resources and soldiers. Even still, it is rather difficult to win battles and get by. I will update my review as I go, and I look forward to seeing if the devs manage to unlock the true potential hidden in this gem of a game.TLDR: 7.5/10, great for those who wish to create their own faction and conquer the lands, lots of potential."

I can safely say I highly recommend it! The primary dev is highly active in discussions and a major part of the community behind the game and that more then makes this game recommendible!The major pros for this game:Stronghold meets mount and Blade, meets total war.Made with Unity game engine. :DBugs die quickly!If you want a decent game that changes a lot and often, I recommend this one.. Especially at 15 bucks!"

76561198164653112,Recommended,601540,34472174,Posted: 24 August,all,No2morrow07,"Given all of the shortcomings of being an early access game,  I must say that I am pleasantly surprised. While there are still bugs aplenty and many of the game mechanics not fully implemented, I got an immediate sense of the game's spirit and the direction it was headed.Like most people already know there is a clear resembleance to Mount & Blade.  However where it sets itself apart is in its strong focus on economy and trade, larger variety of settlement types (Forts, Farms, Quarrys, Gold Mines, Ranches, Lumber Mills etc.), and the ability to customize and upgrade those you own in a much more meaningful way.The other comparison often made is to Total War, though I did not see this quite as much.  When engaging an enemy in combat, you are able to place your troops and defenses (if in a fort battle) and move the camera around much like in Total War, but thats where the similarities end in my opinion.  For me, the combat felt more like a ""throw everything at the enemy and hope for the best"" kind of deal.  Controlling troops, and sorting out troop types once combat begins is quite difficult, as the two armies tend to turn into a swirling mosh pit of death.  This of course can be chalked up to the phase of development the game is in.All in all, I am glad I picked the game up.  This title has immense potential, the updates are VERY frequent, the developer is engaged, very responsive to feedback and addressing problems and bugs.  That is a quality that you cant put a price tag on.  Give it a try."

Some of the mechanics and gameplay are a little clinky, but this is EARLY ACCESS. It's not perfect, however I do feel it has great potential. For $15, it's not bad."

Devs are very active with the community and I'm sure this will help to develop a great game, there is a great potential in this title.it reminds M&B in the look ofc, but has a different gameplay. I'm still on the surface, keep on dying too soon, but the world in development is an interesting feature and I'm curious to see what happens after some time. It's already funny to play, but still an early access, so lot of work to do. Fingers crossed"
,Recommended,601540,31436196,Posted: 29 April,all,Mana,"So i thought i'd buy this on a whim..regardless of the fact that my graphics card is garbage..I'd recommend if you've played Mount and Blade, and other standard RTS games, good blend of both, with the exception of non 3rd person fights ( due to it using the standard RTS camera )This could be the new Spellforce 2 v2.0 (if i'm remembering the name correctly)Props to the Dev and keep up the good work, and +5 Stars for listening to the community, I look forward to more improves, bug fixes and polish as time goes on."
,Recommended,601540,33707467,Posted: 21 July,all,mitchelljacobs,"So I've put some time into this game, not as much as I would like to, mostly due to real life things.  With that being said, the game is not in the best of shape.  It  has it's bugs, some more irrating than others.  While there is no argueing that, I do have to point out in the short period the game has been released, there have been many updates that significantly increase the playability of this game and the overall enjoyment.  I've seen some of the other reviews and don't feel it does this game justice.  Is the game rough at the edges? Yes.  Are they being polished? Absolutely and the response of the developer is quite amazing.  In the couple of months the game has been out, the content has significantly increased, and the quality of the game has increased as well.  This is not the most coherient of reviews, but I do feel like this is a good game and is going in a great direction.  I would and do recommend this to my friends, and do to you as well."
,Recommended,601540,31587013,Posted: 6 May,all,bnanapowr,"This is one of the most sincerely made early access games I have ever played. It is rough, unpolished, and sometimes confusing, but the good stuff is really good. Most importantly, it is fun. In the first week of a game being on steam, I never seen such a responsive and active developer, you truly do get the feel he is passionate about this project and feels a responsibility to his new customers.If you read the rest of this review and like what you hear, PLEASE CONSIDER SUPPORING THIS DEVELOPER AND GAME. Veil of Crows is modestly priced, and already has more fun and replayability than many rts games.Fans of Total War, Mount & Blade, and even Stronghold will appreciate the fusion of some of the best features of all games. Focusing on adding more freedom (on the battlefield and world map), and the sense that you are actually affecting and changing the world as you grow your small faction is truly what makes Veil of Crows stand out.There is still far to go, but there is so much potential here for the developer to take the features and concepts to the next level and the next. I can't recommend it to casual RTS fans in its current state, again it is very rough, but I personally love it, and all the potential it has.To survive early access hell, the game needs its 2 core concepts to be expanded:1. More freedom given to the player to do whatever the heck they want to, and2. A deeper dynamic world of competing and cooperating factions.(of course bug fixes, UI, balances and optimizations go without saying.)"
,Recommended,601540,31429545,Posted: 28 April,all,CruelAmen,"Love the game so far!Minor bugs here and there but updates rolling out as soon as someone find and report them. Dev seems really interactive with the playerbase and improvements have already been made faster than any other early release I have encountered, some fixes aim to optimize controls and general issues people have found.Overall a great early release which shows unlimited potential.Recommend trying it out and supporting the dev"
,Recommended,601540,31511634,Posted: 2 May,all,Papa Optical,"Been waiting for a long time to have a game that shows gritty medieval battles off well. Projectiles, bodies, blood and destruction all stay throughout the battle. Now mix that ""total war-esk"" game with M&B sandbox, you got yourself a winner. As of right now I have crashed twice and fps is pretty choppy at times. I would also like if the camera was able to look up but I love how close you can get to the ground, to check out the aftermath of a battle. All in all im very excited to see how this game does, really hitting my good spots of what I have wanted from these types of games. Perfect description would to call this a diamond in the rough as one other reviewr stated."
,Recommended,601540,31581903,Posted: 6 May,all,therynator,"Omg it is sooo basic, the combat, the characters, the UI, gets occasionally big fps drops, there is no story line so you have to make one on your own which this game cannot offer you since the content for stories is too little..... All this was discovered in barely a few hours.What surprising is though... for a game which is being made by 1 person (I think there is an extra programmer now, not sure) at the moment, it feels good and satisfying. The developer is active (who knows in future) and updates very fast. As people said, it's like ""MBW"" and ""TW"" combined and I absolutely adore this kind of gameplay.For once I actually think that a game is too cheap cause I really hope that if with more income for the developer. He will be able to ""expand"" the game greatly.So for now I'd give the game a 6/10 for almost everything except for creativity which gets 10/10..... Let's help the developer make this game to what he wants it to be."

I highly recommend this game to people who likes strategic medieval games. Here are the pros and cons:+Nice graphics+Good price+Diffrent  levels of difficulties+Developing your character skills+Awesome sieges and battles+Archers friendly fire so you have to put them in front of melee units like in real medieval warfare+Developers active on disscusions who are open for suggestions-Lame camera controls (you can't move camera by putting mouse arrow on the edge of you screen)-Parties getting stuck on sea shores-Enemies may stay in one place for whole battle-Other minor glitches and bugs

The gorey, yet simple graphics perfectly portray the medieval setting this game recreates. The fighting mechanics both in skirmishes and sieges are wonderful, although a bit clunky control-wise.Cons/SUGGESTIONS: -Bigger HUD/UI, it's so hard to read anything rn.-Not a big fan of not seing the entire map, or at least pressing M and having a bigger map that shows the places you've discovered-The game needs to have a bit of a story at start so that it kicks the player in a certain direction. With the plethora of factions the game offers, it's confusing to pick a side as there aren't any lines drawn between them(all of this compared to mount and blade, as it stands at the pinnacle of this genre)-A pause button during battles(maybe i havent seen it yet)-The village/town options are also confusing, they should be clearly delimited to smth like 'Go to the marketplace//Search for volunteers to join your party//Talk to the village's elder)) but that's just me haha.Great game, told a few friends about it already,7/10 for the state it's in now. I'll sink a few more hours in it tonight:D"

I can sit down and play for hours building up my empire and then be salty as i have to build a new one because my hero died to a falling log. This game has its moments, and i feel like it's gonna be even greater in the future.The developer is also very active, there's a new update every day, and you can see the game progress."

The game is very much EA but it is recieving constant updates. The game gets updates every so many days or a week to two weeks at most if you look at dates provided on the store page.That being said, the game is still very playable in it's current state and is quite enjoyable on top of that.

Factions randomly declare war. A faction declare war on me for no reason we even had a positive relationship. I had been hunting bandits for them and suddenly they declared war on me attacked and killed my level 1 character a rather annoying bug. 2. After some fights my hero's avatar diesappers from the screen and i can only see the red army strengh bar. He will reappear after a fight sometimes. 3. The gold counter at the top of the screen never seems to work. I have to click on my hero to see my gold. The disappearing avatar and the gold couter are not as important as the random war bug. Please focus on that in your next update, if you are a developer reading this. I do have a question if anyone knows do the bandits have a random strengh modifier? It seems sometimes they die very quickly and other times they have 4-5 guys that destroy my army of 25."

(I know I don't have enough time on this YET, to make a FULL opinion but...)Frist off, this game is awesome. It is literally a mix of ""Mount & Blade and Total War"".You start by chosing a character, name appearance, coat of arms, name of your clan and your profession. Then whatever starting position you chose you join the world map. I have only explored one starting profession/position, and that was called ""deserter"". In this case everyone on the map is your enemy, except for roaming deserters. You start with a small Army of around 25 Soldiers. Now you can attack others traveling around the world map, capture and occupy cities and villages, bribe bandits and deserts to join your ranks or just plainly raid and pillage the country side. The options are endless, and I really enjoyed the hour I played this game.The reason why I am saying its a mix of the two games mentioned above is, because the map and traveling, resource management and city upgrading is literally exactly like Mount & Blade. But when you get into battle, you are not actually controlling your Heroe/Character, you are not in Thrid Person fighting the battle, but it switches to a Total War/Age of Empires sort of strategy bird view. You can then control your Army, a la RTS, and fight out the battle. (which you can also auto resolve, hence the Total War mention).Of course this game has bugs, of course its clunky in a certain way, but it is fun and has TONS of potential. So for now this game gets a big thumbs up, until I play some more and explore some more."

Not much in the way of guidance to get you started as a newbie and lots of the overworld textures are a blatant rip off of mount and blade.

I'd also like to point out that this game has an enormous amount of potential, and I could see it potentially rivaling Bannerlord in the far future - If you have the cash to spare and are wanting to support the project, I wholeheartedly encourage you to buy this and I most definitely recommend it.For those of you, however, that are currently looking for an enjoyable gameplay experience in which to spend time, I can't put my backing behind this in its current stage. While the screenshots on the store page do look nice, the current combat setup, recuitment method, and general feel of the gameplay is very cold and distant. It doesn't grip or motivate you, and while you've got a vested (gold) interest in seeing your troops victorious in battle, that isn't currently something that you can truly affect.I will say that I really *really* like their world developemnt over time. I'd like to eventually see some sort of succession system put into the game (ala Sunless Sea's prodigy system) in an attempt to create longer lasting lines of nobility (or ignobility!).I plan to keep an eye on Veil of Crows in the long term. Future content updates will be genuinely exciting, and while I've got some systems that I'd love to see added in the long term, I'm definitely excited for it to feel like more of a hands on game."

I enjoy the Fog of Warwith the 15+ factions, but the lack of a map makes getting around reallly hard for quests. Also the city/town/village system is more in depth than Mount & Blade, so training soliders can take longer because of the peasant system. I think though the thing I dislike most in the game is combat. Now I like that if you hit auto-resolve and then mid battle take live control of your troops with a button. But the lack of troop icons has lead me to sending my character into the melee without realizing hes on the frontline in a battle."

,Not Recommended,601540,31476782,Posted: 30 April,all,K.A.N.E.4.0,"The game has many flaws to it, however it has a great concept behind it. Acouple times i had my army duplicate after a crash, and many times I had to restart from just the overwhelming bugs that ruined my game. The controls are just horrendously laid out, you have to hold left alt to get your men to man your siege equipment and your men to attack with left control, which isnt all that bad but i had it bug out a few times, and they have a very hard time targeting enemy troops which is hugely distracting when you are busy trying to do multiple things at a time, which leaves you virtually unable to keep up with the battle. Whenever you auto resolve a battle, most of the time your quest arrow bugs out, which sucks because if you had to chase a bandit party across the map, you better hope to god you remember how to get back to the quest completion, otherwise you are pretty much SOL. Overall I'd say this game is not worth the money at the moment, but if all the bugs and other issues are sorted out then this game would definitely be worth the buy.

This is neither. The graphics are awesome the look is authentic the gameplay is fun the game is an on paper winner. So why a thumbs down ? Its complicated. Im not talking difficult marriage complicated. Oh no. Its worse. Im talking hold left alt and left click whilst holding right control tapping left control, doing a raindance and boxing over an enemy complicated. Its good but unnecessarily complicated. Why not select your unit, attatch them to catapult then right click on enemy wall to bombard ? Now i admit. It is mildly hilarious to watch 8 engineers run across a highly detailed field where men take arrows to the face (no joke) only to reach a wall and stand there going 'oh s@&t' BUT it sort of ruined my strategy. Now as i said i played all strategy games and many games with less potential than this have covered the same ground with awful graphics, awful pathfinding and awful AI yet still been fun because it was ..................... well simple. Now im not asking for an easy game. Im asking for an easy UI. This game has everything but. It challenged me, it made me think, it made me worry, it made me draw tiny plans on napkins !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But not for the reason youd expect. I had to pre-plan every key stroke, every box i drew every single right mouse click. Because everyone of those should have had an 'ALT' or 'CTRL' in there somewhere. The game has mountains of promise. And it truly is not a bad game. It is however a bad UI. When games such as Total War solved this issue eons ago by using a 'drop equipment' button it is a terrible shame that a game with this much promise should struggle on this point. By all means try it. Enjoy it as i did. But remember it is not your keyboard or monitors fault when you forget to press 3 keys whilst drawing a box over both friendly and enemy units pressing left and right mouse button and selling your soul to the eternal evil that is 'how do i win that level'Enjoy :)"

How could you possibly sell a game like this for money? This is the most inefficient, slow, and un-intuitive gave I have ever bought and wish I could return it. As a matter of fact, I wish I did, don't sell garbage. This is the bad version of early access."

76561198007392293,Recommended,601540,31451268,Posted: 29 April,all,StephenJackson_GR,"Has loads of potential and looks like a Mount & Blade/Total War hybrid. Interface needs a huge overhaul but I'm sure that will come with time. Looks promising and the developer looks like he means business, so if you're up for supporting a developer and sawing a promising game, it's worth a tenner, especially for what it could become."

I still love playing and look forward to what is to come. The fight animations are fun to watch, the pace of the game makes me want to continue. If you're into strategy games this will be on to please you so long as you consistantly remember that it is still being developed"

Not sure if by design or by it being early but it is brutally difficult and I love it!  its definently in an alpha state not quite beta but the devs have been updating very quickly.  All in all for the $15 I would recommend to anyone who can tolerate a very early access game.  The game itself besides its flaws is already really addicting!  I can see myself spending ALOT of time here as it flourishes into the masterpeice it will become

76561197998323489,Recommended,601540,31515230,Posted: 2 May,all,AkaalElite,I think the game as amazing potential. The creators make it clear that it is alpha and so it is. Given enough time and support i belive this could become something of a combinationa between mount and blade campgain with the rts aspect.
