,Not Recommended,601980,33698776,Posted: 21 July,all,DakotaThrice,"EDIT: This review was posted on relase day and so only considers the initial build. Typically when reviewing a game so early on in it's lifecycle I'd return to the game after updates so I could update the review to account for any issues that had been resolved. HOWEVER, as the developer is dismissing any issues brought up on the game forum as ""design choices"" I'm unwilling to dedicate any more time to this particular title.Deep Fear is a procedurally generated endless ""runner"" that was originally Greenlit as a VR title. The store page for the current release however has no mention of either VR support or plans for it's addition in the future.As soon as you start the game however it's immeaditley obvious that the game is still designed around VR implementation. The main menu is managable but the in-game HUD is placed off-screen above the character and requires you to pan your view upwards to t which is far from ideal as this also moves you in that direction.Comments on the forum indicate the game is an asset flip with the developer responding that some assets are store-bought and some are original content. I personally have nothing against ""asset flips"" but it will obviously impact others decisions whether or not to buy the game.The achievements which were my primary reason for buying the game are another aspect that others will have issue with and whilst it does have more than the typical game it's closer to Zup! than Sisters in Hotel as it does require some effort to unlock them rather than just idling the game.The visuals are clearly an example of ""sex sells"" and it's obvious this is why the game is in third person. The third person camera makes for poor controls though and the crosshair - when it can be seen - seems to be too far ahead of you, meaning you often go everywhere but where you expect to go.There are three game modes which are identical except for the colour palette. During each run you collect shells/coins that you can then spend on extra health, increased speed or additional characters. The health purchases however are consumable and not a persistent upgrade.Whilst there are a number of questionable design decisions you can't really argue with what you get for the price, whether discounted or not. However at this point I'd recommend holding out to see what state it's in after a few updates."
,Not Recommended,601980,33710666,Posted: 21 July,all,Occular Malice,"TL;DR Cheap and you get what you pay for.Let's be clear on this, it's an endless runner made up of a bunch of assets. While it's not technially an asset flip (i.e. I can't find an asset demo that is this game) the assets are pretty stock and the game is boring.You swim, collect bubbles, avoid the deadly (?) plants, and then get eaten by sharks.What interested me was the video intro, thinking it might be a survival game or something (think Raft, Stranded Deep, etc.) but no. You don't have a raft, you'll never see the rendering quality of the swimmer like in the video, and you'll play it for about 10 minutes then forget about it.The description is deceptive. Maybe there was some point in time where you could see ""Atlantis"" but I thought, from the description and video, this was some kind of exploration game. If going in a straight line seeing bubbles, various sea life, and some plants is your idea of exploring, maybe the developer will want to hire you.Oh and there are achievements. Well, you get an achievement for almost every meter you make it in this game. No creativity whatsoever in these so they're just there for you to pad your achievement collection, if that's what people do.I get it's ""early access"" and some people will say ""there will be more"" but I don't see it. The three modes the game offers are the same thing but with a different coloured ocean. Early Access is a cheap out for this developer and game. This thing isn't going anywhere and in 6 months to a year, it'll be the same maybe with a whale or somehing added.Finally this was a VR game, as much as the developer might say it wasn't, it's clear. The menus are VR, the screens just activate when you hover over them, and 9 times out of 10 you'll accidently activate the menu system when swimming or browsing the menus. So a VR game that isn't VR.At least it was less than a $1."

It is nothing of the sort - the trailer is completely misleading and has nothing to do with what the game is actually about.  What the game IS about is an on-rails, obstacle course race against sharks.  That's it.  Nothing more.  And a boring one at that.  Uninstalled after about 5 minutes of playing the three courses available...which were actually the same course in different lightings/effects.  Glad I only spent 50 cents on this piece of garbage....can't even be bothered to get a refund.  But do not waste your time.  As much as a mess that World of Diving was, it was far superior to this travesty."

Except it isn't VR now so.... the FOV makes it really hard to play and navigate. Still, I paid like 0.59 for it so not going to return it. I also just noticed it is still in EA so maybe it will get some improvements? I hope so and I can one day turn this to a thumbs up."

76561198111460867,Not Recommended,601980,33789232,Posted: 25 July,all,risky.ashtreehouse,"Full disclosure - I paid all of £0.47  for this game.  Having played it, I think it's over-priced.  Even as a pre-release version, there are just so many things wrong with it that it's hard to even know where to start...I'll start with the seriously annoying VR style interface.  This is a game that clearly was either originally intended for VR headsets, or that they're hoping to turn into a VR game at some stage.  At present, it's a pain.The game itself bears absolutely no relation to the apparent game footage in the promo movie above.  Basically, it's like one of those annoying little mini-games you get in some real games - you know, you're falling out of plane, and you're having to avoid bits of falling debris or rising flak.In this case, you're swimming, trying to avoid objects like bizarrly shaped lumps of metal etc.  When you hit one, you bleed a bit.  Do it a couple of times, and the sharks come and eat you.And that's basically it.  Move left, right, up, down, avoiding objects until you hit a couple and die.  Hugely disappointing, compared to what it might have been."
76561198116841324,Not Recommended,601980,34201866,Posted: 12 August,all,Thrai,"My honest review: The graphics are not bad. But unfortunately I can't recommend anyone to get this game at this point as it is in my opinion ""not worth paying for"". The controls are terrible both in and out of gameplay. Your selections are confirmed simply for having the mouse on it for a second, that includes buying health upgrade that is NOT permanent. There's no instruction on the controls, if I'm correct moving mouse direction is all the control in this game. Invisible walls will block you from going off the course but way too often it blocks you from getting around an obstacle as they are often not obvious which way you can go around from.The game trailer is quite missleading as it makes you think it's an adventure/explorer game. But the game is just an endless runner with swimming instead. Plus the actual gameplay looks nothing like the trailer.Actual gameplay of the game:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dEjdjvHB-Y"
,Not Recommended,601980,34340969,Posted: 18 August,all,Blinkdog,"this isn't an out right bad game but its not a good one either.first off the controls for the menu seem to be made for a VR game as you have to mouse over the item you want for a second to go into it. this confused me for a bit.don't let the store page fool you this is a corridor runner type game. don't mistake the open world backgrounds as anything but that a background as you are in a cardboard tube and the open ocean is there as nothing more than scenery, no more, no less. the point of the game is to run from 3 sharks as you avoid what seems to be dinosaur or whale bones. adrift in the open sea? most are static but there are some that are spinning in place in sets of 1-3 in a row (odd currents i guess). some times its not always clear where you can go to avoid bones without an invisible wall pushing you into some bone pillar. you also gather red balls to spend in the after life. i can only assume this is diver/fish leftovers or chum that the person that ditched you there is tossing out. anyway when you hit something 2 times (can upgrade to 5 but only for 1 dive) the sharks eat you. that's it.the game consists of 3 levels (only difference is the background), 3 diver skins (girl/free, skimpy girl/unlock 1k blood, guy/unlock 1k blood), and upgrades include: speed that effect how fast you avoid things, and health that seems to only last for 1 dive but adds 3 hits (5 total)."

,Recommended,601980,33746383,Posted: 23 July,all,ANCRON,"Enjoyable, underwater ""obstacle sidescroller"". You simply try to swim as far as possible, collect treasure bubbles on the way and try not to swim into obstacles while chased by hungry sharks. Every hit will reduce a health bar, if you run out of health the sharks eat you, so don't run into things. It's fairly easy to navigate around the debris. You can upgrade swimming speed and health with treasure, as well as buy different characters.As you can notice on the screenshots, default character is quite the eye candy in terms of distraction, so unless you constantly stare at her booty, you won't swim very far. ;)"
