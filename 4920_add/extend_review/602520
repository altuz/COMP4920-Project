No! She worked and worked her♥♥♥♥♥off until she collapsed and got hospitalized just to give some virgin weebs their Neko Girls.If every weeb could be only half as passionate as she is, we would already have genetically modified Neko Girls. So let me praise  this badass MF! \[T]/I haven't played this game yet, but I already know that I have spent my money well even if I have to face reactions like these...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIDjMDRe_ts"

,Recommended,602520,32098077,Posted: 31 May,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"I enjoyed this third title quite a lot and right now it’s my favorite from the whole franchise. Maple and Cinnamon are adorable together, and it was cute to see them both pursuing their dream. The VN is cute as always and there’s a lot of adult scenes (which are censored in the Steam version, but you can buy the R18 patch at Denpasoft to unlock the “interesting” stuff lol).9/10. Even without the patch, it was cute as f*ck, I don’t care. Worth every cent."

,Recommended,602520,32241531,Posted: 7 June,all,泥鰍小妹妹,"The art and character design is some of the best I’ve seen from a lighthearted visual novel. Each character is animated using the e-mote system that thankfully doesn’t make them look animatronic, but instead brings life to the characters so they aren’t represented by static images. Throughout the game, the cast visits a variety of locations, which keeps the entire story feeling fresh and makes it so it doesn’t feel like it’s just taking place in one area for the entire visual novel.Other than multiple moments throughout the game, where an option is given to the player to “pet” a catgirl, there isn’t any player interaction. The game is fully voiced so it’s possible to just leave the game in auto-mode and watch it play out as you would an anime. The story holds enough comedic and emotional elements to consistently be interesting, while the main arc is supported at a steady pace throughout the 6-8 hour story.There’s no attempt made to bridge the gap between what happens during the scene for readers of the Steam version. Things might simply start to get heated out of nowhere (always prompted by the catgirls) and then there’s a flash of white. After this sudden and terribly ungraceful transition, we’re left going through the eye-rolling pillow talk between Kashou and the various catgirls. With that said, there is still some nudity and sexual content retained in the Steam release. So don’t go in expect pure wholesome catgirl times just because you’ve opted for the “all-ages” edition. C’est la vie.Nekopara is always a visual feast and Nekopara Vol. 3 is no different. Once again we’re treated to copious high quality anime CG artwork as well as active, bouncy sprites. With that said, if you’re the type to click through before a line is completed, be in for some weird sprite animations. The animation speeds up, causing the characters to appear as if they’re vibrating dangerously. There is still full voice acting as well (aside from Kashou himself). Again you can also opt to play through the game with text in English, Japanese or Chinese as needed. Just be aware that the voice acting is only available in Japanese.While Nekopara Vol. 3 may be the best of the Nekopara releases thus far, it’s still a far cry from more developed visual novel narratives out there. The thing is that nobody comes to Nekopara expecting that. They see a colorful cast of catgirls and a harem theme and know whether or not that’s exactly what they’re looking for. The real question is what will happen next now that Kashou has succeeded at his weird unexpected quest of romancing every single catgirl in the game. Some believe Vol. 4 might finally take a turn to a taboo romance – but that might be a bit too controversial – or obvious.Conclusion:Nekopara Vol. 3 is a welcome addition to the series. It holds everything great about the previous entries, while giving it a plot with real character development. I enjoyed my time with the visual novel and can’t wait to see the wonderful characters and story beats that Sayori brings to the series in the future.Verdict 9/10 Although somewhat predictable in regards to its sexual aspects, the storyline is becoming less of a throwaway component, even if it’s still short."

,Recommended,602520,31989157,Posted: 26 May,all,DarkNinja13,"I love this series.  Nekopara has, in my opinion, been a shining example of what great VNs should do and its 'Overwhelmingly Positive' review status for each volume serves a testament to the art of ""getting it right"".1) The series has great art and a great design style2) The series has compelling stories that are a joy to read3) The series has lovable characters that, while you may have a favourite, there isn't one you really hate4) Numbers 1-3 stay consistent throughout the series when there's multiple volumesNekoPARA Vol 3 is, at just under 7 hours of play time, the longest of the series (longer than the previous two volumes combined) and closes the series out with the final two catgirls, Maple and Cinnamon by showing a level of depth to each of them that may have gone unnoticed in previous volumes.  On the surface they appear to many to simply be a snob and a pervert, respectively.  However, this volume very tidily sweeps those notions away by peeling back that outer layer and showing us the vulnerable human qualities in both Maple and Cinnamon. Watching these characters being allowed to develop is a rewarding feeling and feels very true to life in the scope of the story as we get to see both Maple and Cinnamon realize what they want, stumble as they reach for their goal, learn from their mistakes, and rise above their self-perceived limitations.With that said, I confess my bias: I am very fond of Maple.  To see her doubting her own self-worth as being viewed as ""just a catgirl"" and then rising above that limitation almost in spite of of it was quite rewarding.Just trust me, buy this VN - you won't regret it."

,Recommended,602520,32309205,Posted: 9 June,all,GG.Sunshiners,"Soo, if you see this, its most likely that you know or have played Nekopara before, but for those that didn't know, Nekopara Vol.3 is the third installment (or fourth, if you count the Vol.0) to the Nekopara series. Its a Kinetic Novel (Basically a visual novel without any choices) and its main focus is telling a story of cute girls doing cute things (and lewd thing, if you buy the patch) and the guy that owned them. Is it good enough for your money ? Is it better than the previous one ? did it achieved the cute girls doing cute things stuff ? I will tell you all about that in this review.The plot and characters development in this novel is surprisingly quite good for such a lighthearted novel such as this one, its better than the previous one that basically just tell the story of some cute catgirls in heat that want to be the main guy catpanions and didn't explore their personality further. In this one, Maple and Cinnamon (The main heroine in Vol.3) got their own problem and conflict that both them and main guy solve. I honestly can see the why they both ended up liking the main guy in the end. The conflict and problem is the good surprise that this novel have, its not a light conflict and problem. Its about hopes, dream, and also about friendship (It also hinted at some racism to the catgirl as a race). Basically, One the heroine got a dream that she wants to accomplished but she don't want the world to see her just for her looks or race, she wants them to see her for her talents instead. Its a pretty deep story for such a lighthearted novel and i will say the story is the best one in this series. The characters development is also the best one in this series, you can see how the main heroine grow as a characters, from their selfish beginning to finally be considerate of their friends and lover. Its nothing special in the visual novel genre, but its special in this series considering it usually are pretty weak. I said in Vol.2 review that you only come to nekopara for the cutegasm. But in this one, you would get that and also a pretty good story plot and a decent characters development. It took me 11 hours to finished this one, with 5 adult scene each takes about 50 minutes, it leave the novel with about 7 hours of storytelling which is longer than the Vol.2 and on par with Vol.1.The art and visual in this novel is still one of the best, it even better than the previous one, since they use the emote system (Their technology that makes the characters move a little in a 2D space) more in this one, usually the characters only have one expression per sentences, if they said something and they smiling, they would just be given a smilling expression, but in this one they will use a serious speaking expression, and in the end of the sentences they will change their expression to the smilling one. Its subtle but it definitely better. They also add more expression and movement to the characters in general, like my favorite a little shaking when they laugh which is something thats very small but it makes the characters feels a little bit more alive. Apart from the expression, the background is nice to look at but its not the best and the characters design in general is very pretty and one of the thing that makes me like this novel.I can't say much about the adult scene, its good and i might say its the best in visual novel genre since moving even though just a little bit, its better than still image that what usually happened in visual novel. It helped you to know how much the catgirl love the main guy, since as usual there's a lot of talking involve in it. There a lot of adult scenes in this one, soo if you are the type that buy this only for the adult scene, you would get what came for i guess. I will say that getting this game with the adult patch is a must if you want to have the complete experience since there also a bit of characters development happened in the adult scene.Soo, the big question still remained, is it good enough for your money ?? This novel i feel is the type that either you would like it, or you will hate it. Since its still Nekopara in the end that is full with cutegasm stuff and lewd stuff (Again, if you buy the patch). Even though it got a good plot, better character development, pretty characters, and nice background, if you never like cute girls doing cute things, you would not like nekopara. But if you like that or you were put off by the vol.2 for lacking any good plot and characters development, you would like this novel. Recommended only if you like cute girls doing cute things !"

,Recommended,602520,33290655,Posted: 5 July,all,小理世,"I think this is the most valuable Nekopara ever. It had the plot which is much more than before, and certainly more interest. It had the same feeling with vol.1 and vol.2, but much more better. In vol.3, they show me the more multivariate plot's element, it's not easy. In the past, we always said Nekopara had only cute, but this time its really change my opinion. Some people were sharing the r-18 patch, but I didn't think I need it. I love all the roles of this, and the plot is interesting enough. So I don't need any other thing including the r-18 patch.The only thing I got to complain is the low resolution, it cause the bad experience on the high resolution and huge display. But anyhow, it's not a major irritant in a game which has the great plot and cute roles."

,Recommended,602520,33117543,Posted: 1 July,all,forgehe,"Nekopara is not only about the catpanion-fication of Cinnamon and Maple, it also has the catgirls face their lower social status as catgirls. The game puts a heavy emphasis on the importance of the bells worn by the catgirls. No bell shenanigans occur, but from the dialogue and how often the bell is brought up, it is clear how important the bell is to the catgirl's freedom.Maple wishes to be a singer and to be addressed as something more than a catgirl. Cinnamon wishes to follow Maple, but to an extent that is far from conventional.From rude customers to childhood promises, Nekopara Vol. 3 really piles on the substance compared to the previous games.Moving away from the story, the improved animations in Vol. 3 make reading this visual novel even more enjoyable. Now, the on-screen sprites have tiny subtle movements during the dialogue, and this small detail really helps bring the characters to life.The soundtrack of Vol. 3 is very similar compared with the previous games, but the soundtrack does its job well, by setting the tone of each scene. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Voice acting is superb as usual. Note: Shigure's character does have occasional bursts of ""ohohoho"" laughs, so a word of warning if that's not your thing.Overall this volume of Nekopara is the best one yet. 10/10."

,Recommended,602520,31997343,Posted: 27 May,all,Kujar3Player,"So here it is, the VN that got me into VNs in the first place with its first itiration ""Vol.1"" is back with another sequel, I've been waiting for this the whole year, did it deliver?There's a reason these take so long to create, the NekoWorks team is full of talented people and it shows by just taking a glance at the screenshots, it's every bit as lovely as it appears to be. What I expected from Nekopara was here yet it feels like the team improved somewhoe, things feel way more alive than they did before, the emotes the catgirls throw in here and there really help to get you immersed and quite frankly lost in the cat paradise. There just seems to be so much more effort put into place with Vol.3 but it may just be the team really getting comfortable with using the engine.The story is fairly simple, if you haven't played the previous parts, I'd strongly recommend you do so before trying this out. The Minaduki family consists of a man ""Kashou"", his sister ""Shigure"" and 6 bloody catgirls all unique in their personality, you never get to see their parents but they et talked about in the story. Kashou was raised to be a baker under the strict rules of his family, never allowed to experiment with his creations so he decided to go on his own path and open a bakery ""La Soleil"", two of the catgirls, Vanila and Chocola decided to follow him and basicly moved in with him into his new home without him ever allowing or asking them to. His sister that seems to love him way too much supports him all the way and makes his bakery a huge success due to her crafty online blog that focuses on the catgirls day to day life. Everyone else kind of followed suit to make a long story short and now he has 6 employees consisting of all the Minaduki catgirls and this time around the story is focused around Hard headed Maple and oh so so lewd Cinnamon that just can't seem to controll herself over little things.To be fair the story is quite Emotional, as it always have been, it's hard not to be taken on an emotional roller coaster while you're reading through it. These catgirls can really be so Adorable and you go from ""AWWWW"" to ""OH GOD NOO-OOO"" on regular basis especially with Cinnamon around, this is a direct line from her ""Wait, Carousel...? Arousal... What a lewd name...!"" Maple is dragged against her will to perform as a singer on a stage, later remembers her childhood dream to be a singer, hesitates to PURsue her dream from a fear of being looked at as ""just a catgirl"", with a help from Kashou and her best friend Cinnamon they ""push"" her forward and she decides to go with it. I will not reveal more, it's worth experiencing for yourself. And yes, it can be enjoyed for the story and the atmosphere, you'll ""not miss much"" if you decide not to buy the R18 patch but I find it lets you appreciate each of them more if you do so. There are in total 8 h-scenes if you patch, it's quite a lot.There are no choises, it really is just a Visual audio book if you think about it, but choises were never really needed in the Nekopara series, while it would incentivise re-playing the games and for some it might be a deal-breaker, I am honestly quite happy with this linear narrative.Soundtrack didn't change, there's no need to change it up tho as it still fits the VN quite well, few songs were added, mainly because of all the ""musician career path"" Maple is going through. And I have to say, I am a 24 years old dude but listening to Maple sing made my eyes well up with tears, but that's probably just me, I usually stay away from VNs because I get into them way too much and I become such a woman with my emotions, it's not even funny.If you're looking at Vol.3 and you're not sure whether to get it or notDid you play the previous ones and liked it? You can't go wrong with this one, it's every bit as good and better in some ways, don't hesitate.If you didn't like the previous itirations however, there's not much else that would make you happy, perhaps this is just not the type of VN for you.If you're a newcommer, take a look at the previous volumes first, Vol.0 is a good tease and pretty cheap just know that there's no real introduction and that VN kind of expects that you played at least Vol.1, it's more of a bonus for the fans I feel. Start with Vol.1 and see if you like it or not.For me, I am very happy I got to experience another one and I can't wait for what's in store next, there's nekopara OVA coming up sometimes in the future as well as another mini-volume confirmed. I'd be surprised to see Nekopara go anytime soon, it makes me happy just to see the opening screen every time I fire up any of them and it's like this for many others. Highly recommended!"

Nevertheless its good to get some insight into the least explored characters in the series.  One issue I did have was withCinnamon and Maple's yuri subplot.  This is hinted at throughout the story but only seriously brought up in one relatively brief scene that doesn't give much of a resolution.  Maybe its just that I'm a yuri fan, but I would have liked to see more focus on this subplot, or at the very least a more definative conclusion.Other than that, I just want to know: whatever happened to Milk?"

It's ultimately some light hearted fluff with some common drama blended into the mix for good measure.I personally think they hit full stride on this one. While it does have that spur of the moment sugar that cheep shows have, they manage it very well and have clear information and tidbits that aren't forgotten or contradicted. Everyone has their one line descriptions, but there's a bag of sand, so to speak, to each of them.This installment would obviously be the hardest one to juggle, with the history of the story along with the slightly more delicate nature of the starring characters, and they pull it off just fine.The art is good and the writting is good.My veiw of the series has slowly been shifting to a more lighthearted serious rather than a joke."

The hard mode in this game is when you are doing the ""action"" part but you have to remain unseen or else you'll be compromised and that there are no restarts in this. If you get caught in the ""action"" part, I heard you will be disowned by whom you were working with, be ignored by society as a washed up weirdo.The controls are much more improved, instead of just clicking, you have to use your hand to quickly tab out when the ""enemies"" are nearby, and tab back in. Or if you unlocked the door lock mode, you have to actually use your hand to Lock the door and unlock the door if you hear knocking.The story is very good, it starts of with you on the store and you see Nekopara, you buy it, then you progress through it. then once you are in the middle part, it's very emotional and you need a ""box of tissues"" to clean off your ""tears"", I loved the ending its very well donefinal verdict 8/9, my Arm needed support after this, but it's a cool stealth-action FPS"

Maple and Cinnamon's story and development is a nice change of pace from the other girl's dreams/goals. So again quality story telling with thoughtful and hilarious moments, mix in the pleasant music, top notch visuals and voice acting and you have a VN that's more than worth it.It's a great game all around that never fails to deliver.10/10 would Nya again"

,Recommended,602520,32296113,Posted: 9 June,all,[[-|-409th-|-]] Deon,"UpdateWas having a bad day when I originally reviewed, so I kinda went a little too harsh on this, even though I do somewhat adore nekopara, but this is still gonna be the last one I buy probably. The original 6 catgirls have been banged, so thats a sweet enough end for me.So this time we learn about maple and cinamon, which, I'm sure many fans greatly appreciate, because up until now, these 2 were actually the least explored of the catgirls, but were many people's favorites. (mostly people admiring cinamon's sweet rack) Maple is probably the most difficult of all the catgirls to get inside, as she seems to be the most intelligent and most independant thinking of them all. Nii sama getting inside her walls pretty much makes him the catgirl slayer. Hell, getting Azuki to crack was quite the feat too, but she seems no where near as difficult as maple.Cinamon though.......suprised this one didnt litterally start with him screwing her as the intro, like, seriously.At this point, Nii Sama is basically a catgirl♥♥♥♥♥♥artist......like, if this were the real world, it would be no secret.......his business would be shutdown after a huge scandal about him having affairs with all his employees, including his underaged sister, he'd have people calling his shop a catgirl brothel, and people asking when is his sextape coming out. I mean, lets face it.......he purposefully made each of them stay overtime before, just to get to know them, he always convieniantly gets alone tmie with each of them somehow (arent chocola and vannilla basically his wives? How do they get seperated from him for such long unexplainable periods of time) I mean, come on, then he acts like the innocent guy, but he just somehow ends up inside them sweet walls without fail, this dude has totally no shame.........and neither would I, LOL"

This was my first visual novel, and although I haven't played the others, just from comparing trailers between games I still feel like Nekopara is a true master piece. I know a lot of people joke that it's a great game because of the obvious fan service and hentai scenes. Yes, those definetly help in making it a great game, but even when the game is not focusing on that I still appreciate everything about it. Beautiful art style, animation, voice acting, and more. A pretty decent story as well, not gonna lie. I give this game a 10 out of 10. I don't really have many issues with it.

It felt so amazing to see the cat girls again, the story was even better as well, the part with Maple's dream of becoming a singer and playing the guitar was so cool. Cimmanmon once again confirms why she is my number one fave. The rest of them all had a very good part too, especially the ending. An amazing way to wrap up what's been an amazing journey of adorable chibis, beautiful nekos and top-notch quality artwork.All in all, I give Volume 3...a perfect 10!PS: If you like Nekos, I recommend you get the whole Nekopara collection and I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did."

I Loved volumes 1 and 2. with Vanilla being my best girl for a long time.Volume 3 is just like the other volumes, but with much more substance. Yes the nekos get ♥♥♥♥ed hard, at this point i was excited for that. What i wasn't expecting was a decent story.Not saying the last few volumes are just about the♥♥♥♥♥dem cat girls. There was a attempt at a story there, But Volume 3 actually gives it a story, one that was actually impressive for what is basically a hentai game.I was very excited to see maples story especially after the trailer a few months ago, but now Vanilla has taken a step back to my new favourite cat girl Maple.Would highly recommend to anyone intersested, but i guess if you are reading this review isn't needed since you either already have it or are reading this to make a meme of funny reviews.Plus the Maple-Cinnamon sex is hot as fuuuuck."

It's not a big deal, that happens from time to time. The animations were adorable, especially when you go in and pet their heads. And the way they've been used to simulate movement and motion, dispite only a few poses? They keep getting better with each iteration!The only knock I have against it is that the ending movie didn't appear. By that I mean, the music played, but the slideshow didn't show up. I can only assume that my copy glitched a bit. It's not a big issue by any means, but it was odd enough to point out.If you're a fan of slice-of-life anime and seeing cute girls fall for a loveable blockhead, then this is for you! And I eagerly await the next one! I swear, if they go where the pattern is leading, Imma feel psychic."

Though it's been a while since I've even touched the other volumes, this is probably the lenghthiest in the series and, I'd like to think, has the strongest focus on its story compared to the other two (three?).When it comes to the 18+ material that you'd have to acquire elsewhere,everyone of your catgirls get boink'd at least once and you're treated to a 60 FPS animated mashing of dong and taco.The end hints that thismightbe the end of the series (or at least is very near its end since Vol. 4 has apparently been announced) and future projects of apossibly similartopic might come around.

You should definitely read this series if you like bouncy things, cat girls, anime, and if you're depressed.If you aren't sure where to get the 18+ patch, just go denpasoft for it (or through other mysterious internet methods). If you don't want to buy the 18+ patch with your card but with paypal, you can go to sekaiproject's website and get something called $10 denpasoft store credit.

Be advised to play this when you're alone, you're using your headset and the cable is plugged onto your PC / laptop (check the sound volume as well), and make sure the doors are locked. I don't have to tell why, do i?In this volume, we'll be focused on Maple (that ""Your Highness"" type catgirl) and Cinnamon (that kinda masochistic type catgirl). They have a very close relationship because they're always stick around with each other...to the point they are gay to each otheri've waited for around 15 months after i played the 2nd volume. I can safely say that it's worth the wait! From the previous volumes, it only contain around 8 chapters, but in this volume, it contains 15 chapters and the price for the game is still the same just like the price for the previous volumes although i think they can make it more expensive a bit. I can't ask for more.This Visual Novel is a kinetic novel, which means you cannot make any choices. You just got to sit back, get a popcorn, and set it to autoplay mode and you'll feel like watching a movie.There's also petting system. You can click the button at the top right corner on your screen, then click on the catgirl's body part (head, chest, and torso) to pet them and hear them letting out a heart melting voice. I hope this feature won't give you diabetes.If you look at the options, you can set the chest bounciness. You can set it to ""still as rock"" or ""♥♥♥♥ physics"". The developer of this game sure knows a part of what we want when we are playing this game.Tl:dr this is a very fine Visual Novel. I would like to rate it 10/10"

,Recommended,602520,33723854,Posted: 22 July,all,DJHarmony,"As someone who is somewhat new to this series I gotta say, this game really does a good job of continuing the story. Everything feels hopeful and joyous, as if all the characters have grown up and become more developed. The girls it focuses on this time around aren't excatly subtle with their quirks, but there's still some depth there that is appreciated. I also like how all six of the girls get some spotlight in this one, allowing you to develop the relationships with your previously established catpanions and win over the hearts of your new ones. If you get the 18+ patch, then prepare yourself for scenes even more intense than Volume 2. This game has alot more chapters than any of the other games, which makes it feel longer, thus the story is allowed to feel less rushed and time constrained."

Witness the dreams of one catgirl being twisted into Kashou's evil plan. Exposure of his catgirls to fame and fortune effectively funds his plan from the shadows, all the while tricking his beloved catgirls into becoming slaves in a plan so clever even Austin Powers is at a loss. However, now that all of the cargirls have been enslaved in his insidious plot, only one girl remains. His innocent little sister Shigure. Witness the destruction of a girls mind in the next volume where Kashou's slippery mental health catches onto Shigure. Can this madman be truely stopped? Will Shigure survive his perverted assault? Find out next time on Nekopara Vol 4."
