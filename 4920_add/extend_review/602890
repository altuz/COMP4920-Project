I had to hack my way out of mission one by using BruteForce 4 times in a row, triggering the next steps that way. I actually couldn't do the mission the intended way. Second mission, the website you need to connect to is down for maintenance. No explanation on how to get passed that. I had to use a ghetto bypass described by a user on the forum. Mission 3... same deal. Website is blank. A user complained, rightfully so, to a dev. Not only was the dev quite aggresive in his response, he said he fixed it in an update... which still leads to an empty web page for me. Again, no indications to help with the mission. Went on the forums another time, people suggested other URLs to try. Did nothing. I'm now roughly 5$ poorer, stuck after 15 minutes of reading forums and 6 minutes of gameplay, at the 4th out of 5 (or so I've heard) missions available.Quite dissapointed, even for a 5$ or so game on sale."

Got to the point with ""something went wrong try again"" when you just speed thru he pop ups on the screen you are fkd and at this point i can t go any further. This game seriously needs some organization to it."

,Not Recommended,602890,31147155,Posted: 14 April,all,[THP] E. Woodruff | 5C-22,"Alright, hack_me 2 looked like my style of game, and on sale you can't beat the price. I played up until the 3rd mission where I accidentally skipped on of the dialogue boxes (my mouse is finicky). You wouldn't think it is a big deal, but it really is. You can't go back to look at previous dialogues or anything of the sort. I was left confused and trying to figure it out. This game could be really good if the developers put some more time and effort into the game. Another thing, the developers do not seem to care too much about there customers since I haven't seen any acknoledgements from them that the game is a broken (or any other notes from the devs. They don't even release patch notes.). I wish that I could recommend this game. I really do, but there are just so many problems with it that I can't. From the game itself to the developers, it just needs help."

,Not Recommended,602890,31966422,Posted: 25 May,all,Dash,"I'm not toally sure how I feel about this game. On the one hand I absolutely love ""hacking"" games that try and create an authentic experience, and I enjoy the desktop aesthetic of this game... To an extent. The main desktop was very promising but then you start opening programs and immediately the facade falls away because of poor UI design.The puzzles quickly became less fun and more bashing my head against the wall trying to remember arbitrary commands I had used an hour ago in the console. The console itself is a huge problem, using made-up commands and invalid syntax... It all just unravels very quickly.I really wanted to enjoy this game but there are better ""hacking simulators"" out there."

,Not Recommended,602890,31719057,Posted: 13 May,all,Plater,"One of the worst games I've ever bought from Steam. Bought this on sale thinking that it would be somewhat decent, but I was gravely mistakened. DON'T GET THE GAME!Edit: As per SomaThe worst part of the game was the fact that it bugs out whenever a mission is completed. A full restart of the game is required for it to progress to the next and trigger the next set of events."

I reccomend to buy it but first buy ""hack_me""(the 1st game of series). If you buy it will help you to understant a lot of words and hacking ""methods"". Also the price is very good for the quality of the game"

,Recommended,602890,30478756,Posted: 12 March,all,DyBeast,"Fast, Fun, Plot Twisting, Cheap, Amazing Game!For an Indie game I suppose anyone would call this game it is very good. There are a total of two endings im not going to spoil them. Just a warning one of the endings is pretty sad and upsetting and made me tear up.SPOILERSThe ending where you decide to DDOS the agency and you find out Kate or Kat3 is an AI and that the entire time through out the game you have been talking to an agency and Kat3 leaves you one last clue to take down the agency before they shut her down and I also realize throughout the game im not sure if this was intentional of not, but Kate's name changes from Kate, to Kat3, to Kat33, and finally back to Kat3!SPOILERSAnyway the game is quick i realized, but from what I read there will be free DLC?! Thats amazing if that is true. I also wanna shout out the amazing devs who are on top of this game. This game has only been out for 2 days and there alrwady has been multiple updates. In conclusion I rate this game a9/10 this is the best indie/puzzle game I have played so far."
