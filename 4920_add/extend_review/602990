,Not Recommended,602990,30420750,Posted: 9 March,all,NeroBron,"I have the sneaking suspicion that this game is on steam due to the recent Steam release of another originally flash-made game. That game, Ricochet Kills Noir, is worth at least $3. Maybe not the 5 they're charging, but it was made into something worth paying for. This, though... this is worth as much as it was worth as a flash game... nothing. This game should be free.The shooting controls are awkward as hell and feel stiff and unresponsive. The arrow going where you want it to feels almost like a shot in the dark sometimes. I swear, sometimes I pulled back all the way and then the arrow travels half the distance I had expected it to. This became a reoccuring problem as the shots are VERY precise. You HAVE to hit the rope that these people are hanging from and you are always on a timer which decreases if you mess up your shot and hit someone, regardless of whether it was the game's fault or yours. If you are even the tiniest bit off, the arrow is either lost or it damages the person you're trying to save. Either way, 9/10 times it felt like it was the game's fault that the arrow didn't hit its mark, and that's where Ricochet Kills beats this game the most.Ricochet Kills is built so that the bullet travels in a straight line and YOU have to line it up. It bounces based on how you shoot, and with that, almost every failure you experience is totally on you, but is also a learning experience that you can use to plan future shots. This game has none of that. There was actually a moment in this game where not even the REQUIRED method of beating the level worked! The arrow bubble shot the arrow towards the hanging man's rope and it hit the guy in the top of the head... that arrow's direction is specifically set to be the same every single time.My other big problem with this game is that it gives you very little challenge to start off. It basically gives you the answers as to what you need to do to complete the stage. The there's an arrow bubble positioned anywhere implies that it's going to shoot to a location that you can't natively shoot at, therefore you have to shoot that bubble to beat the level. When it introduced the sheep as a mechanic, it actually pointed at it and said ""Shoot This!"" A game about puzzles is supposed to be frustrating because the puzzles are hard which results in you feeling really good when you finally figure it out. This makes it feel like I didn't do anything... and that's boring. If I wanted to pay 2 dollars to be bored, I'd rent an Adam Sandler film from Redbox.I have minor gripes with this game, such as the fact that these people that are being hung are SMILING and the fact that perfect is spelled with a K, but those are all overshadowed by the big two factors stated above. These basically made the game unenjoyable right out of the starting gate. Would I recommend? Take a guess."
,Not Recommended,602990,32031640,Posted: 28 May,all,Monterico Gaming TV,Simple little puzzle game where you shoot an arrow to save people from hanging to death. The game has some resolution problems to far after release and to much of a clone of better games to go positive on this one. Bad Archer....Bad
,Not Recommended,602990,33683428,Posted: 20 July,all,Your Cheeky Uncle,"Maybe i'm just bad but in this game when you shoot the people in the head it saves them, however when you fire the arrow above the head it results in the arrow being stopped by some kind of invisable hit box and the person dies. The sounds are low quality and there isnt any sound control apart from mute or max volume. Some of these things for me are just basic things that i would exspect in even te cheapest of paid games. However, if these issues where fixed I could see alot of potential for the game."

Launched game, started shooting the humans instead of the rope and got frustrated about failing the missions. Turns out I have to shoot the rope...I got this game for 90% off so it was worth the price. Fun & simple. Although it would also make a great mobile game, its nice to have games like this on Steam as well."

Good archer wasn't an exception but there is a big fault of this game. It isway too short(and a little bit easy). I've finished this game under 50 mins.( even i tried to do some perfect score) and i believe most of the players can finish this game under an hour.  So basically you can buy this game, finish it and return it for your money. I think this is a big flaw like these types of games. Of course i won't return it, but someone else might...Anyway nice little game.  Cheap and perfect for the achievement hunters."

This game has:✔ Nice cartoon graphic✔ Nice soundtrack✔ Simple control✔ Good puzzle✔ Unique (I think) gameplay mechanic, not only shoot the target, there is another like teleport bow & arrow, shoot with another arrow icon (?), etc.How much I like this game score:6/10How much I want to recommend this game score:5.5/10 - Maybe when it on sale?"

It is fun but I don't even feel its hard enough to be satisfying for me to grab the last few achievements....so yeah, fun for the first 10 minutes.

,Recommended,602990,32738741,Posted: 24 June,all,Kovic,"Maybe 30 minutes to complete all 45 levels and unlock all achievements (only level passing required - perfect doesnt matter)This is basically a cleaner looking version of the Archery Flash Game many of us have played.The controls are not great, no matter if I played in windowed or full screen mode, sometimes I couldn't get full power.  Also, the aim is a bit, meh as well.  There are glitches in-game, like floating arrows, and an awful hit box.  Many times I cleanly cut the arrow but yet somehow hit the person as well.  Oh, and getting a ""Perfekt"" rating on a level doesnt seem to work correctly either... I had to play some levels multiple times...doing the same thing, just as fast...to get ""Perfekt""If you like simple 100% games and get this for the $0.49 it cost me, I guess I can recommend it."

,Recommended,602990,30458831,Posted: 11 March,all,vittoria,"great games usually are based on great ideas, and i can name endless list of examples of a small, not expensive but addictive and funny games - Cogs, Quell series, Thomas was alone, Wayout, Hexcells, Cleverweek games, lots and lots of others - they are small puzzles that make you solve tasks, preventing your brain from going rusty and  giving you the true pleasure of successfull solving that tasks - ones are already in library, others are in a wishlist, and i never miss a chance to add another game of this kind to a collection :)and this one is not an exclusion: my first impression was its Angry birds on steroids - but it appeared, that only way of shooting the arrow may look similar, as you have a bow that you are pulling similar to Angry birds slingshot - but:while in angry birds you destroy and kill in Good Archer you are saving lives shooting a rope of a hangman; while in angry birds you have collateral damage from falling blocks or whatever level is built from, you have to be far too more precise in Good Archer game - shooting a hangman, in fact you shoot your level time!after some play you start to feel the physics of an arrow flight is different, and that it is not that easy pigs shooting, your aim is often hidden by something, and, finally, you have a limited time to shoot and that turns a game totally inside out: you are not enough just to be clever to solve a puzzle - you should be clever and QUICK.meanwhile, as you continue to play, levels become more and more difficult, you could pass them, however, if you have either unlimited number of arrows or unlimited time or, preferably, both - but here you either miss or don't get in time, so you try again and this is a point where game appears to be addictive! after the first run i could stop only after level 10 :)"
