76561198056911465,Not Recommended,603120,31066877,Posted: 10 April,all,Eppleson,"I can not honestly reccomend this game. It was good effort, the music isn't bad and the art was very nice, but holy hell if you've played other adult VN out there, prepare for disappointment.First off, the MC can be male or female and to my knowledge that doesn't change much. The MC is also waaay to frequently a ""watcher"" and not interacting with the 3 girls. And your choices don't really seem to matter.There are indeed 3 ""sexy girls"" in the game. However, if you're looking for character arcs, go elsewhere. Two of them only hook up with eachother and the one you can have sex with, I swear has a mental disability.Sadie is the standard tough girl ""I can't trust anyone, why make friends?""/tsundere sterotype.Mai is okay, but good god, the choices she makes and the amount of times she's messed up makes me question why she was still given a chance to be an instructor.And then there is Lizzy. Good god, Lizzy. She will likely be what turns many people off from the game. She is totally insane, has sex with snakes, refers to herself in the 3rd person and acts like a child, or what felt like to me, someone with a mental disability. AND SHE'S THE ONLY ONE YOU CAN SLEEP WITH! I don't want to sleep with a girl with mental disabilities, it's weird and just totally uncomfortable.It looked good. It looked promising but there are too many bad choices in here. The story is bad, the characters are at times, passable and I sort of felt for Sadie and Mai at times, I'll admit. Lizzy I couldn't connect to or care about in the slightest. Your choices ultimately don't matter I guess aside from whether or not you choose to sleep with Lizzy. It is also short.For those caring only about the adult pictures, look elsewhere. There are few actual sex pictures and again, you can only sleep with one of the women."
,Not Recommended,603120,31511808,Posted: 2 May,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"I wanted to like this game, and I really wanted to recommend it. But unfortunately I can’t. I enjoy Razz’s work quite a lot and Zetsubou’s writing as well. However, Happy Campers is a badly written visual novel with the weirdest dialogue I’ve probably read so far in a fan service game.The art style is alright, I have nothing to complain about since this is a fan service game. The story is… Okay? I mean, I’ve seen worse. It starts somewhat decent to be honest, but then it just turns out bad. The MC doesn’t do s*hit, they only look at things happening and they barely interact with the girls.You can only romance one girl, Lizzy. And she is the dumbest character I’ve seen in a while. She talks and acts like she has some sort of mental disability, and it wasn’t cute at all and made me uncomfortable. I wanted to romance the other two since they seemed a bit more interesting (at least not Lizzy-level-of-personality), but you can’t. Your choices are a) being with Crazy Lizzy or b) ending up alone. Also, the dialogue is really bad and cheesy.I’m glad that the developers changed the description of the game based upon the feedback at least. I still like them a lot. But please, remember how bad Happy Campers turned out before you think about writing another similar VN. I don’t want to put this title as a “stain” in your career, what I’m saying is: everyone has their ups and downs and this title is, at least to me, a down. But don’t let that discourage you. It happens, it’s part of life. I wish you both good luck with your next releases, and hopefully they will be better than HC. I’ve seen you do way better works.2/10. I wish there was an ending where Jason would appear and kill them all."

[This one might have been fixed, so kudos for that.]Visual novel about camping with three sexy women - and seeing them do baffling, nonsensical things just so they can get naked and/or contort into awkward positions. Watch two of them have fun with each other, and enjoy your fill of the mentally deranged, snake loving third one.Interactive choices - one of them MIGHT even change the story slightly!Uncensored content available - and the pics that aren't outright bizarre are actually nice to look at. Too bad they were wasted with this horrible narrative.This one is definitely the worst game so far from the publisher, and I advise you to give it a wide berth. Unless you have a fetish for demented girls making it with snakes, then this might be your only hope to get that itch scratched."

Playing a man or woman, as featured in the game description, doesn't matter!Con: Choosing your gender matters very little.You're obviously the same guy in the Lizzy sex scene, even if you chose a woman for your gender.  The novel just omits a few lines about your ""sausage"" if you pick a ""woman"".Con: The artwork is sparse.  Tripling the amount of unique art would make this a pro.Con: You can only actually ""get with"" one girl, the other two do their own thing.Pro:  The two that do their own thing is the most yuri part of the game, but not gonna blow your mind.Con: Decisions are few and matter little, this isn't a deep choose-your-own adventure novel.Pro:  I learned that you shouldn't poop near your own camp, it attracts animals like Bears."

What killed it for me was the lack of character development and story (Although I don't think most of us cares for that). The multiple choices (only 2 each time) didn't seem to have any impact on the story except for maybe the last one. There's plenty of nudity as the girls lost their sense of decency/their mind during camp."
76561197988569311,Not Recommended,603120,31060271,Posted: 10 April,all,Nepster,So. After playing this game i must admit this is first VN that has been a god damn disapointment. 3 girls+MC. Out of those 3 girls two are total slu** and one is borderline mental patient.Plus MC more then often is left on the role of a watcher. Who enjoys this crap?
,Not Recommended,603120,31071764,Posted: 10 April,all,TheLordDoggo,"I dont normally review stuff, especially not like this but I felt compeled to do so for this VN. I was super excited when I saw the trailer for this. 3 different women? Gender choice for MC? Awesome, sign me up. However there is a lie behind both of those features. Minor spoilers but you know how in visual novels you start with general tom foolery and choose who you like best eventually leading you onto your favorite girl's route? Well this game never actually has routes. Technically you can have a relationship with one of the girls (who will remain nameless for this review), however its not part of any honest route and just sorta happens if you make a choice. The other two girls are off limits (and seeing as when I mentally ranked the 3, these two occupied 1st and 2nd I was quite upset).I just dont understand why they went through the work of giving us our own character and zero agency with them when they could have just as easily given us the perspective of one of the three main girls, similar to how Love Ribbon worked. It baffles me really. I normally wouldnt get a refund for something like this but it just doesnt feel like the advertising was honest about the final product.I wouldnt go on this rant without at least singing what praises I can, which are that the h scene come in a free patch and were fairly enjoyable with good art. The comedy was also amazing at times, with some fairly outrageous lines.I just feel cheated after playing it. When in expecting a zany story with my own protagnonist's journey to seduce three different people and ended up watching a lot of things happen to everyone around me and then the credits. Very very frustrating."
,Recommended,603120,31245527,Posted: 19 April,all,Draek,"Quick summary: Razzart Visual does a Sakura game.When this VN showed up on my Steam frontpage, I thought it looked pretty trashy; but when I saw it was from the studio behind the fantastic Starlight Vega and Love Ribbon, I decided to take a chance and see if it was more than met my eyes. Well... not quite.Graphics: 7/10Most of the art on this game is truly beautiful: backgrounds are gorgeous and detailed, CGs are well done and in a way that flows seamlessly with the general art style of the game... but character sprites do leave a lot to be desired, and the humongous proportions of the entire cast quickly becomes embarrassing rather than titillating. Which is problematic when it's the one part of the graphics you're supposed to focus on.Sound: 4/10No voice acting whatsoever, and the music is rather average; not good enough so I'd go and buy the OST, but not bad enough I'd turn it off either, and for the most part it's a good fit.Story: 6/10No way around it: this *is* for the most part the trashy eroge VN it appears to be at first glance, with a plot as ridiculous as your average Sakura game, and not much more developed either. Characters are shallow, situations contrived, fanservice aplenty, and oh dear Lord the snakes, why.And yet it's kinda fun when all's said and done; it feels less like an amateur making stupid mistakes, and more like a professional writer having one drink too many and deciding he no longer gives a crap. Thus, the game does have brief bursts of brilliance, both within itself as well as in a more meta context--the sheer length they keep the whole snakes subplot going is so audacious you can't help but laugh.Longevity: 0/10Took me only 2 hours of playtime to 100% the game, and outside of two choices near the end, whatever choice you get affects one or two lines of dialogue at most. So, no.ConclusionTo anyone in the market for a Sakura game (you know who you are), I'd strongly recommend this: it's got far better backgrounds, no censorship, and is cheaper to boot. To anyone else... see if you're in the mood for playing a game that actively has you laughing at it instead of with it. Still hitting Recommend because, well, I did have fun after all, I just don't think it's for everybody, or even most people."
76561198039619705,Not Recommended,603120,34516351,Posted: 26 August,all,AngelofNoMercyX,"First of all, yes, this game is absolutely as bad as all the reviews say.  I had to see it for myself.  While I agree with the badness, I also found myself laughing...a lot.  And I sincerely hope that's what the devs were going for with this - humor - lots of laughs at the sheer ridiculousness of it.  Because if not, I am deeply disturbed...It's also a serious stretch to call this a game.  There is only one ending.  The ""choices"" affect nothing more than a few lines of dialogue.  There is one actual choice of something you can do or not do that branches the story slightly but brings you quickly back to the same ending.As for the 18+ content, I consider the game itself to be 18+   It is extremely inappropriate in a lot of ways to begin with. All the patch does is add two anatomical details.  It adds nothing else - no new scenes, no new dialogue.Again, not recommended, but you might enjoy it if you go into it like I did expecting it to be bad and you aren't easily offended.   I enjoyed this for the moments of comedy (some great dialogue) and a few instances of surprisingly deep conversations about relationships, but I can't call it good overall."

I'd recommend it on sale, not at full price.This isn't Razzart's best title, I will admit I'm a bit disappointed.But, I didn't think it was as bad as some other reviewers.I liked the art but found nothing memorable in the story.I also dislike the ditz-is-really-a-genius cliche'."
,Not Recommended,603120,31066967,Posted: 10 April,all,NevetCS CSGOPoints.com,"Really, you can see the entire game just by the pictures that promote the game. The character you play as is just a cuck and only engages in any sexual acts with anyone once, and thats only following the proper path. None of the decisions really change the game at all, except for maybe one or two, and thats it. As for the nudity, you have to manually install a file, and all it is is a few pictures of breasts and thats it. You can probably find better nudity in some PG game out there."

You can play as either a male or female. Through a number of choices you can end up having a fun time or... end up with one of the girls. And by that, I mean only one girl is a possible connection as the other two girls... are rather interested in each other.Also, the one you can acquire is a bit of a... ditz. And whether the relationship continues... well that's still a bit unclear.There is a patch that allows you to see more explicit pictures, which considering you already see those pics (just with strategic white dots)... well, it is a free patch, so..."

I liked it personally, but I can't really reccomend it, I dislike when given the illusion of choice in a matter only for it to boil down to ""like this one of 3 girls or be alone"""
,Not Recommended,603120,34623417,Posted: 30 August,all,Aylisia,"33 minutes was all it took for me to have done everything you could do. Was hoping for a little bit more length to a $1o VN. Love Razzart's other works, like Love Ribbon, but can't say I recommend this one."

I liked it tbh, maybe a bit overpriced I guess, and the male/female protagonist choice doesn't really matter, infact if you chose female you'll actually be magically transformed in to a male depending on your choices at the end(this might have been fixed since I played it though, not 100% sure).. It kept me interested all the way through though, and just for that I would have to recommend the game, even for the 9,99€.I like the art-style, some inconsistency, but mostly it's really well done and easy on the eyes... Hopefully more of this style in more interesting stories in the future? Would love that."

Most of the time all you do is click through awfully written dialogue (with embarassing humor). In the first 90 minutes you have 3 or 4 ""interactions"" where you have to choose between two options.The art is ok, but the whole experience is completely static as you look at drawings all the time. Did I also mention, it's sexist crap?"
