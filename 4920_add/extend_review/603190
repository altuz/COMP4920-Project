,Recommended,603190,30416109,Posted: 9 March,all,[LST] Fighter5810,"For those who dont like to read: It is fun and worth the 0.99€ in my opinion.But i wish this was a higher priced early access title.Right now there are 20 levels with 3 different enemy types.And while it is indeed fun it is also quite short.According to steam i spent 31 minutes in the game and that includes launcher, menu, etc.(I have finished it)I just wish there was more to it.- More enemies- Different Terrain types that make your tank slower / faster / hard to see / etc.- Destroyable walls (Not everywhere ofc)- Level editor- Colour customization- Upgrades / Power ups- More levels (Duh)- Different weapons- Coop / Versus modesWell enough of what i would have liked and onto something that is there and in my opinion needs some fixing.There are 2 problems that i had while playing:1. Shots coming from outside the screenI would say around 30-40% of my deaths were to tanks that were outside of my screen and that i didnt know of2. On the bigger maps when there is only 1 enemy tank left it can take a bit to find it (also problem 1)In my opinion this would be much better if the tanks left tracks behind and destroyed tanks left some kind of mark on the level.That way you could track the tanks down and you could atleast get a vague idea of where the enemies are right now.So if you dont mind dying and youre looking for a short game this might be itI just hope that the dev uses this game as a foundation for a second bigger title because it is fun and has potential."

,Recommended,603190,33316728,Posted: 6 July,all,Alice,The object of this game is to Destroy Tanks and dont get Hit by the Enemy Shots. Overall This game is Challenging and fun to play. You need to repeat and find the way to Advance the next level.

76561197962535997,Recommended,603190,31763047,Posted: 14 May,all,SoliDus,"I'd recommend only getting this game if it's on sale, or if you get a coupon for it, etc.  I can't really say it's worth 3 bucks, considering there are free flash games that offer more customization, and longer gameplay.  I've already beaten it in an hour.That being said, it is a fun little top-down shooter.  Feels unfair for a little bit considering the enemies can see you outside of your own range, but you'll get used to it.  If more were included, such as power ups, more levels, etc., it'd be great."

It's very difficult, unlike other tank games, where enemies seem to ""throw"" themselves at you, this game's AI is remarkably cunning, as they will literally set up traps and abushes for you, and the map design favors patience.I would have to say 10/10 AI, 10/10 music, 10/10 map design, and just an overall 10/10. (no i'm not going to go into more detail. Don't got time for dat)To all of you who say that you can't get past lv. 4 or that the game in general is impossible, I would like to say you're mistaken.I will say I was stumped for a while at lv. 4, but I was eventually able to overcome it with PATIENCE. PATIENCE is what you need in this game. Impacient people who rush this game will of corse get stuck due to the AI's clever tactics."
,Recommended,603190,33814035,Posted: 26 July,all,Null,"Great arcade game overall! There are a few things I would change:More Levels (I can't get enough)Multiplayer (Seems like it would work well with this game)Radius For AI to attack (They currently shoot cross map, but it does add to difficulty and I would mabye make it a toggle option.)Show the number of kills you got at the end of every level along with the timeIf you don't change anything about this game I do think it would still play it and its still pretty good left as is."

Lvl 19 kinda rage quit me a while tho but it is literally a nice game for the people who wants hard and pew2x tanky like style that is below 1gb

But think about it, if it was easy, you would finish it in 30 mins.Even so, it only took me around an hour to complete, worth the 49 cents.However i wish there was more detail, and a custom map editor would have been lovely."

Combat is tense, fast paced and challenging due to great good AI. only criticism is the length - the game is super short, a wave game mode like Firefight in Halo would definitely improve the game. 9/10"

,Not Recommended,603190,34231494,Posted: 14 August,all,Charkles,"Playable, but that's about it. Spend less than 50 cents to purchase. Adequate. No real replayability, seemed more like a tiny project through Unity. Only real gripe is that the AI is able to see you off screen. Not a huge deal.Can't really recommend at full price."
,Recommended,603190,31468535,Posted: 30 April,all,Astrophilia,"Tank Destroyer is a hard, very fun game. There isn't many faults with this game, just missing a lot of things in the gameplay. The dev is missing a lot of key features that could improve the game a lot. It is very obvious they spent little time creating the game. I personally would only purchase the game when on a discount.Pros:◉ Cheap.◉ Simplistic.◉ Good soundtrack.◉ Very enjoyable.◉ Easy to play.Cons:◉ Only a singleplayer, adding a multiplayer would be very fun.◉ Add a tank customization, to have different tank colors, models, etc.◉ Add a level editor.◉ Add upgrades and or powerups.◉ Levels get quite hard, which is fine if you enjoy the challenge.◉ The dev is not very involved, and has already left this small game.Overall rating, I give this game a 6 out of 10. Worthy price: $1.99"

,Recommended,603190,31795523,Posted: 16 May,all,CheepChubby,"Tank destroyer is a birds eye view tank shooter where you have 1 objective destroy all tanks.this game is Ok, The music is fine the controls are Ok the and the gameplay is Ok and The price is Great.The games bots are really hard almost as if they had wall hacks but once you get the hang of sneaking around then popping up and shooting you will progress alot easier. The Way you look at your tank makes it impossible to see other tanks the maps are to big and the bots are always shooting first because there off the screen adleast make it do you can either see everything or so bots cant see you from across the map, Over all everything else is OK, 6.5/10"
,Recommended,603190,31479287,Posted: 30 April,all,WeegyBro,"IntroductionThis game is amazing! Tank Destroyer really has the features that the developers describe. Everything is well-poured and I would recommend it for those who are bored and are looking for good challenges.Controls and MechanicsThe controls are awesome. Basically, there are only 5 inputs, which are mouse1, w, a, s, and d. Are you good enough in controlling them? Check your skills right in this game!9/10VisualsIf you are looking for realistic boom-booms and vfx of any sorts, get out of here, because this game uses classic visuals with simple shapes stacked and grouped one above the other. Don't expect for a realistic atmosphere here, because this game has an atmosphere of its own, and it's one of its kind. Why? Jump down.9.3/10SoundsThis is the main object that rounded all of it up and made the game awsome. The soundtracks are way cooler than you can imagine. If there's a DLC for the soundtrack, I'd be glad to have it. Wanna know how it sounds? Buy this game!9.7/10OverallDifferent tongues tell different stories. Give this game a try, you wont be sorry for that. It's just $2.99 anyways.9.3/10"
,Not Recommended,603190,34460357,Posted: 24 August,all,MrPanSzkieleton,"So first of all, the game isn't bad, i can recommend it but only if you buy this for 0,10€ (90% coupon discount).So what is this game about?Well as you can see in the tags and trailer this game is a Shoot'em up with some tactical thinking aspect. The game is pretty much minimalistic. The menu has only 3 options and the one that is in the middle has only 2 sliders for sound settings. When you click on the ""play"" button the game shows you some levels (of course on start you only see level 1)GameplayThe gameplay is.. well this is a minimalistic game. You steer a tank and you try to kill all the enemies in your way.It's pretty good for 2 hours of gameplay but after 2h the game is just boring.Not only that but the game has no real replayability.Frustrating parts of the gameThe most frustrating parts of the game were probably bad level design, lack of new game mechanics and AI, wich shoots at player while not being seeable by him.Would you recommend the game?For card hunter? Sure, but for somone how would like to play? No. There are much better shoot'em up on steam that aren't that much more expensive."

Unless you have crazy reactions and ""never done that before"" predictions, this game is not for you.This could be made more possible by having like, 3 health and can take three shots instead of one. Otherwise, not fun."
,Not Recommended,603190,34400006,Posted: 21 August,all,Dieser,There is much to say about this game.First you can't upgrade your tank.And u need it.The enemy keeps getting stronger and u are just the same tank.they can see u across the map but u can't because we are not playing on 4k
