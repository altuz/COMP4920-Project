,Recommended,603260,33375809,Posted: 8 July,all,Mαяzιραη,"A very sweet, charming little game for all ages. If you're fond of cats then this game offers a really nice experience. There are technically about 5 minigames and 3 have personal leaderboards. Some of the game involves puzzle-solving and a bit of exploration. The achievements are all pretty easy to get with the exception of one or two that just take some patience. The game is almost perfect but I just wish it had one or two more minigames to round it out. I got it on sale but I think even at the full price it's worth buying.Plus my cats liked it, too. 9/9 lives"

,Recommended,603260,33145924,Posted: 2 July,all,-=AJAX=- EpicMama,"This is a rather short and simple game with 3 scored mini games and some little ""side activities"".It's very cute. I like the art style and the classical music fits in smoothly with the mood of the game.Overall the game is very...C A T <3=^._.^=It doesn't offer a great deal of extended game play but it does have Trading Cards, Leaderboards  (I found that you can compare scores with other people if you access the stats via Steam client, not in game as far I could see) and 16 Achievements that aren't too difficult to earn as long as you're curious like a cat and willing to take a quick look at a walk-through guide if you're not 1337 enough to crack the cat code.I got a perfect game (all achievements) in about an hour and a half and probably could have done so quicker if I had tried. (And if there had been more frequent opportunities to catch those delicious bugs!)I believe the developer is Chinese but I didn't find any translation or language issues aside from the incorrect term ""catched"" being used in the bird catching game, which seemed to go along nicely with the child/cat like atmosphere in the game so well that we'll just assume it was done on purpose... Because as we know, cats never do anything they did not intend to do.As long as you love cats, and you are looking at this game more for it's aesthetic and not any kind of hardcore challenge, or long hours of game time, then you may enjoy this game.I think this is an adorable, whimsical, casual game that could be purrrfect for humans and cats of all ages."

,Recommended,603260,31917392,Posted: 23 May,all,Erika {C²},"You becoming a cat is now the real thing!First of all, you must appreciate the simple and cute design, as you turn the game on.I suppose, that the cat lovers & owners will appreciate the diversity of the game more than the other mortals :) But it doesn’t mean you should have less fun!So what is this game about?Game is controlled by LMB and RMB easily. You can expect three main games namedIndoor Racing, Swim ChallengeandCat Breed BilliardsIndoor Racing:Run around the living room, try to avoid the da*n furniture in your way and don’t hesitate to annoy the dog, by accidentally bumping into him or wipe your butt while running over the carpet.Swim Challenge:The adrenaline of falling or not falling into the bath-tub full of water, right?! Smash the stupid soaps, sponges, hairbrushes and moar! Beware of shower and bubbles. Those could be fatal to your furry coat :)Cat Breed Billiards:I like the mottoLearn something new every day,so why not to learn some cat breeds while trying to nudge the ball into the hole?The game includes even more funny stuff like trying to catch a bird behind the window or crack the mystery of cat dreams. Every mini game unlocks an achievement for you and it’s not a trouble to complete the whole game at 100%, especially withthis well-written guide.Pros:* Cats* Cats* Cats* Easy navigation and controlling* Cute and simple graphics* The Idea in general* Training your reflexes, learning something new (if you didn’t know before)* 100% achievements possibilityCons:Found NONE!Summary:This game definitely deserves100%for the idea and possibility to complete 100% of the achievements. If someone doesn’t like the Product Placement achievement – so what. The creator has to eat something, to be able to create even more great games in the future and it doesn’t irritates me at all. The game worths the full price and what’s different about this game from the other cheap ones – there is always a score to be beaten, so if you will be in the mood, you will possibly come back and play it time by time.Thanks to M.Hanka for this catmazing game."

,Not Recommended,603260,30711841,Posted: 24 March,all,Totohli,"This is a simple game and you could argue if it is worth any money because it's definitely comparable to (free) online flash games.The game has 3 main minigames where you avoid furniture by going up and down using the left and right mouse button collecting as many points in the process possible.The other game has you 'fighting' for your 'life' in the bathroom. A series of washing/bathroom related stuff get thrown at you and you have to get rid of them before they hit you and knock you in the tub, you won't get any points for knocking stuff away except for the objects that jump out of the tub.And finally we have Cat Trivia Billiards where you play a simple game of billiards where you're shown a certain cat race and have to get rid of that one for maximum points (the balls have cat heads on them).Besides that you have a dream sequence where you can connect 3 symbols and get an achievement, you can also catch birds outside and figure out a password for some more achievements.The game can be completed in 10 minutes if you don't care about achievements and play it slowly...So is it worth it? Not really but complaining for spending 2 bucks isn't worth it either so enjoy it if you have it and try to get the most out of it, or ask for a refund when you've completed everything.Extra: one of my cats liked this game 'tho, the sounds got her looking at my screen and she tried to catch some of the stuff that appeared so it certainly is a cat game..."

My only real complaint is when you play the mini pool cat game, the controls are a pain in the butt, i spent forever turning around my mouse over and over trying to get the dang thing to line up and sometimes in the bath mini game the things don't actually work. A word of advice? get the freaking balloon Achievement EARLY (you click the balloon every time you beat your high score) if you don't, youll have to keep trying to beat your own scores and when they get up there and with the controls, its REALLY tedious."

If it weren't for a few bugs in the billiards game, it would be very relaxing to play.I found that a couple of times, the game won't register when you've sunk the right cat ball. At other times the tracking for the white ball skips or pauses, and if you're using a touchpad on a laptop it plays up even worse. On the touchpad note, it's not possible to play the bathtub game with a touchpad because it won't register when you're clicking right and left both at once.But those issues aside, I love the game. More than worth what they charge for it."

And now, a super cute simplistic set of minigames dedicated to these perfect purrers.The Cat Games features three games, each with their own little high score table. The graphics are chunky and sweet, and the sound effects are perfect for the style. The games include skidding around an obstacle course in your living room (smearing your butt on the white carpets as you go), hitting bathroom objects as you balance on the tap, and also a game of cat breed billiards. I am especially grateful for the billiards game, because although the controls for it are a little clunky, it allows me to gloat in my superior knowledge of feline breeds over that of my husband's.The achievements in this game are adorable, and some of them require trickiness to unlock, or puzzle solving. I 100% completed the game in about an hour and a half, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the fuzzy bundles of fluff that are our purring little friends :)"

I would totally recommend playing this game when it's a rainy day. The game itself has three mini-games to chose from, which isn't a lot when you think about it but it clearly disintergrates boredom for awhile.The mini-games include: Indoor Racing (avoiding hazards while running in the house), Swim Challenge (cat stands in the bathtub and swats away different colored objects to stay balanced), and Cat Breed Billiards (match the name with the cat and hit it in one of the openings on the sides of the table). All of the mini-games are simple enough to learn and fun to play. My favorite is Swim Challenge! Also, the achievements are pretty simple to get and not overly challenging.If you are looking for a cute and relaxing game to kill boredom, I recommend The Cat Games, especially if you love cats!"

,Recommended,603260,33334836,Posted: 6 July,all,Tziva,"The Cat Games is absolutely worth the $2.  It's an adorable design with three mouse-controlled games of feline schenanigans.  It also has a number of easter egg interactions, puzzles and corresponding achievements.  Just finding all the interactions was a delight.  This isn't a game you're going to spend a lot of hours on, but I think anyone who likes cats will be tickled by it.The only really problem is the really awful controls on the billiards game.  Getting the right angle for the shot is very difficult (and seems to be an issue in both windowed and fullscreen).  I actually like the concept of this particular game the best of the three, too, so it was a bit disappointing that it was so finicky.  I hope that can be improved in a later patch because the game is really solid otherwise.The Cat Games will definitely put a smile on any cat lover's face and give at least a couple hours of mindless enjoyment."

It's for all ages from my view, and it's really cute and fun. It olny has 3 games, and I wish there to be added more. But if you're a cat person, you may enjoy playing all of the mini games."
