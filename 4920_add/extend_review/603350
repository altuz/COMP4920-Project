This game? It a good and nice.HOWEVER. Some bugs/suggestions I'd like to report:Bug: Being a lil' choosey jigga on the chef tends to make the game decide to not accept input. I always have to restart if I cycle characters more than 2-4 times.Suggestion: Keyboard input near F/D to start/restart game. It's kind of weirdly irritating to reach over to the mouse and click twice after slappin' off half my grabber. Maybe set it up so that ""F"" is the all-encompassing hotkey so I don't have breaks in my hunched ULTRA GAYMUR posture; I just want to keep mashing F/D as fast as possible. I was ranked first time I played the game, and I'm at 109 now. I'M SLIPPING AND IT'S ALL FROM BREAKS IN CONCENTRATION!!!!"
,Not Recommended,603350,32986442,Posted: 29 June,all,InterfaceAS,"I havent been so frustrated with a cheap game before. Its got some nice polish to the art howevere the mechanic is too inconsistent as both the chef's hand moves over the hand at random incriments and the knife's hit box is off or moves. I know this because I used sticky note to line up the blade of the knife to the food after I was frustrated with losing when I was SURE that I wasnt over the hand. The idea is good, i just wish the mechanics worked better however I may try out the mod creation."

That said, it did feel a bit like the game was cheating at times, as I swear some of the ""foods""* varied in how many cuts they took, despite looking exactly the same size every time (so you can't even tell yourself ""a tomato is always two chops"", 'cause occasionally it'll drop to one)!I guess there's a bit of added longevity if you're the type who fetishes visually ""different"" characters who would otherwise appear to function identically; unless I missed something, which is entirely possible, given that I only got as far as unlocking one character beyond the initial two** before chucking in the bloodied tea-towel.You can't really fault the price, though. It ultimately comes down to how much you think ""killing"" thirty to sixty minutes of your short time on this Earth is worth.Verdict: 6.5/10.(* Including miniature submarines and UFOs, for the ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles I guess.)(** Oh Trump, you card, you do crack me up, ho ho ho.)"

,Recommended,603350,34942315,Posted: 13 September,all,MakotQ,"Don't cut your handis a great game to play in your spare time. There's no real story, and the gameplay is far from difficult or complicated. It's pretty much an arcade game; get as much points as you can, and when you lose, try again. But that's okay, because it's pretty good arcade game. And if you're feeling competitive, you can play in multiplayer mode and go against your friends (or random strangers online). I would recommend this game to those who need a fun little time waster to play once in a while"

,Recommended,603350,33913092,Posted: 30 July,all,Hannah Faker,This is a good game for its $1 price tag. The game also has great modding potential but as of 7/30/17 there are only 9 mods in the workshop and a few of them don't work/ don't do anything. If more people (modders) gave this game a shot it could be something special.
,Recommended,603350,31635676,Posted: 8 May,all,Tyclone,Not a bad game for the price. Theres not much going on but it is fun and fast paced! It is a lot of fun if you can play with your friends.. Sadly you cant join your friends directly so you have to luck out and randomly get the same session as them. I recorded a collab with this game today and we did land in the same session together but i do think joining your friends is something they really need to add! But all that said the game is fun and well worth the $1 price tag!Check out my video to see some gameplay!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tf3fPMBOTI&t=25s

76561198352158753,Not Recommended,603350,35430253,Posted: 2 October,all,Stormaggeden,"I dont particularly like this game. Its simple and hard. I know the point is that it is supposed to be hard. Each item has two versions that are so minorly different you would often miss the difference and miss count the cut. Making you lose. The achievements are kinda hard but mostly tedious cause youll have to just keep playing and playing.But as I write this one acheivement is not even possible because the creator has not finished the game.I do not suggest getting this game unless you have a few dollers to blow, dont care about achievements, and are extremely bored.2/10"

Just trying to make the right call as to cut the food or to pass it on, while under a time restraint makes this game fun. Obviously, not a lot of depth to the game, and personally, I think it would be better as a phone game then one on your laptop/desktop. Still though, pritty fun.
