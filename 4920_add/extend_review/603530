,Not Recommended,603530,34803311,Posted: 7 September,all,Losian Rooke,"You know.. I wanna leave a positive review but I just can't for the game's cost/length.There's a lot of good - the music and sound are pretty solid, the graphic style is decently solid. They've got a nice pixely art thing going, but obviously not a 'true' pixel art with the way assets and gibs move and flop around, but it's a minor nag.What gets me  though is I beat the game, first playthrough, no deaths, in an hour and fourteen minutes. The bigger problem is I didn't really feel compelled to do it again - the unlocks just seemed to be a few random powerups and a weapon or two, but none of that really changes up the game dynamic enough to be really worth further exploration. Metroidvanias work because they are sprawling and vast - this one had basically two areas, and that's it. Several powerups felt kinda pointless - the 'dash' is just a sluggish short-range dash with no purpose besides breaking a few blocks to arbitrarily block you, and many many assets are more 'copied' than 'inspired by' metroid. There's a fine line between homage and needless mimicry. The last boss was more of a pain in the finger from button mashing than difficulty, I knelt in one spot and just shot for a few minutes.This is a game where I wish steam had a yes but bear in mind or a more neurtal rating, I hate having to give it a thumbs down, but I really just wouldn't recommend someone to buy it. It just doesn't quite work as it is. A true metroidvania relies on several things to really make it jive, and those things don't really jive well with some roguelike nuances.It was kinda fun but horrifically short - if I hadn't left it on the title screen to get lunch I woulda beat it with 45 minutes to spare in the refund window, and that just doesn't cut it for me and a 'metroidvania' of any sort. The entire point is to spend hours and hours wandering  and exploring different areas, going back and forth, finding things, etc.Several things really threw off this game further - the item which lets you see powerups totally trivializes exploration and removes the need to keep an eye out, you immediately know every room with a powerup, period. SEveral powerups don't seem to work together - I got a 'shot fragments on collision' powerup, but my shots already passed through enemies and walls.. so it just did nothing? The shops have no explanation whatsoever for items until after you buy them, and resources to purchase seem random/scarce.. but ultimately not really needed anyways, apparently.The game isn't bad, if it were just a couple bucks I'd let it slide for an hour and change, but as it is I just don't think it really works."

Controls scheme is very much like Super Metroid (shoulder buttons to aim up and down, can't move and crouch etc).Highly recommended if you want a bit of roguelite in your castleroid rather than the other way around."
,Recommended,603530,34806605,Posted: 7 September,all,RetroNutcase,"I'll be doing a more detailed review later, but for now, the quick and dirty.Usually when people say ""Roguelike Metroidvania"" it gets dismissed pretty quickly because it doesn't really have everything that makes up a Metroidvania. You may have a big open, explorable map, but you don't get upgrades to get to various parts of it. Or you may just have individual levels that can be explored, but then you go to the next one and never go back to the previous.This game is neither of those. This is literally a Metroid Roguelike. Find upgrades to advance to new areas, and find stuff in old ones. And your upgrades change every run.As someone who loves Metroid games, this is just amazing and fun as all heck. Get it already."
,Recommended,603530,34872361,Posted: 10 September,all,Skull Daddy,"I beat this game in about 3 or 4 runs myself, and I gotta say I absolutely adore it.It IS a straight rip of Super Metroid, and theres nothing wrong with that. Lord knows this game has done more for the Metroid series in about 2.5 hours of my life than Nintendo has in the past what, 4 years?PROS:- Unlocking items for future playthroughs is always a nice time, making your next runs feel that much more fresh.- Secrets aren't too hard to hunt down, which for this style of game IS a good thing.- Bosses are varied between playthroughs so its neat when you fight one you haven't before.- The game controls and feels just like Super Metroid.- While its true that coming across the same rooms is kind of yawn inducing, its nice that the larger rooms have varied doorways between runs.- Poor, poor Tutorial Smith. We knew him long enough.- Save Rooms as extra lives was brilliant.CONS:- The music just.. isn't that good. Its not BAD by any means, but I often found it really easy to just ignore and never really felt like it was adding to the experience.- Its... shorter than I'd like. My first successful run was about 2 hours long and after I beat the boss I just sat there wondering if there was gonna be anymore. Then the credits rolled.- The Final Boss fight could have been better. Its a nice bullet hell (sort of) but when you show up completely decked out you can kinda just blast all the pesky mobs and bullets.- Normally I like my games Charge-Attacks to charge off the first press, but in this case I found it more frustrating that my attack-speed gets nerfed slightly by having a charge weapon because it always tries to charge shots when I wanna just tap-tap-tap the fire button quickly. (This might be modifiable in the options, so if it is disregard this and call me an idiot)Things that could be done to improve the experience (aka Things that my greedy white♥♥♥♥♥demands of the dev) :- Make it so that you can visit the Final Boss at any point, this will promote Speed Runs and No-Powerup Runs. And give the Final Boss door a clear warning so that people know to avoid it if they want to.- Unlockable areas to flesh-out (heh) future playthroughs, Isaac did it first yeah but that doesn't mean its a bad mechanic for other Roguelikes.Thats all I've really got right now. Thanks to the creator for making this game, it was well worth the money spent and felt really fresh and satisfied an itch I've been having for some time."

,Recommended,603530,34805344,Posted: 7 September,all,dRaven43,A Robot Name Fight has the best qualities of Metroid blended with hints of games from our childhoods.  The procedurally generated levels make for an infinitely-playable adventure through new worlds of familiar hallways and rooms.  It's a permadeath game which makes for some intense battles and adds a heart-wrenching difficulty but still remains playable and fun even to those of us whose Nintendo reflexes are far behind us.I can't recommend this game enough and look forward to many playthroughs.
,Recommended,603530,34890885,Posted: 11 September,all,Superevil,"It's Super Metroid in the best kind of way. You can tell this game is a love letter to the genre, and it scratches just about every itch that's associated with it.I'm not fantastic at reviewing so I'll just skip right to the Pros and Cons:Pros:- It's a bite-size adventure that has all of the best elements of a Metroid game. It's designed to be able to be beaten in a little over an hour, which encourages multiplie playthroughs and speed running.- There's a good sense of progression, you really feel like an unstoppable force by the end of a run, yet the final boss remains challenging.- No mindless wandering. I know this wont be a plus for everyone, but I don't like feeling entierly at a loss on what to do next, this game always has a few leads to follow if you're unsure. It never spells it out for you, but you always have an idea on where to go next.- It follows the beam-stacking formula, which means your default weapon will always be fun to upgrade and worth using.- There are some really nice musical pieces in here.Mixed Impressions:- Bosses are a bit too easy sometimes. I'm grateful for this sometimes, but other times I'm unsure. Maybe the late game bosses could be a little harder. The final boss seems just right though.- The minimap lets your know if there's a powerup in the room somewhere. This isn't a big deal, and encourages speedier play, but I wouldn't mind if there were additional powerups that weren't revealed on the map as well as the ones that are. (Unless there are, then whoa...)- The downward shot while jumping looks hillarious.- No wall jump. I can see how this would break a procedurally generated game though.Cons:- This is just an early game gripe, but my first few play throughs saw too many of the same powerups.- Each run (so far.) has contained the same areas in the same locational placement.I'm always happy to see fellow Unity developers have success. This game is totally worth the money."

,Recommended,603530,34803231,Posted: 7 September,all,Gorondorf,"You know? It's pretty hard to find games that deserve to be called ""metroidvania"". I'm pretty glad to say that this one has everything that defines a true title of this genre. It's simple: do you like Super Metroid? Great. Do you like feeling rewarded for exploring areas of a map? Nice. Do you enjoy a challenging yet fair experience that changes everytime you die? This is your game.Now I know what you guys are thinking: a roguelike with procedural generated maps? Sounds dull. HELL ♥♥♥♥ING NO.  Trust me: every single time you start, the map layout arranges itself, and every single ♥♥♥♥ing time it's something that it isn't crazy nor it doesn't feel dull. Heck, you can even get shortcuts in order to reach other areas faster. And everything connects perfectly which is something that you'll never see in any other ""metroidvania roguelike"". This one EMBRACES those terms and manages to create an experience that makes you go ""I want to play again to see what I will find this time"". Coming from someone who played Super Metroid for more than 200 hours it's something.Pros:+Great level design+Great soundtrack+Controls are just great+Exploration feels and IS rewarding+Random generated maps which connect areas in a very metroidesque wayCons:-It ends. Wait, no, it never ends, because there are A BILLION DIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY THIS GAME.Score: I'm gonna expend weeks playing this game non stop/ 10"

,Recommended,603530,34925325,Posted: 13 September,all,Nuben,"A fantastic roguelike that barely feels procedurally generated because of the clever mechanincs and using certain items to gate content behind bosses and such. It feels like a metroid game with all the backtracking, upgrading & exploring that comes with it.Wonderfully excecuted!"
,Recommended,603530,34817852,Posted: 8 September,all,MindBoX,"A Robot Named Fight! truely is a Metroidvania roguelike/lite. The creator managed to find the right balance of sprawling exploration, backtracking to areas previously not accessable, unlockable powerups, and just plain, good fun. Excellent original soundtrack and great meaty sounds.Dropping into the game the first time immediately reminded me of Super Metroid; especially the movement. Although sluggish at first (at least compared to my memory of Super Metroid), the movement feels better after your first speed powerup and overall makes sense with the concept of continued growth. By time you head to the final area, you feel light-years from your sluggish start.You'll spend slightly over an hour to collect everything and get to the final area. I'm sure that time comes down the more you play (there is a 35 minute acheivement). While, I was initial surprised how quickly it took me, it does feel right. Replaying the game yields new bosses to fight and new powerups to enjoy. There are also varied room types each play through, such as fire rooms and dark rooms. Good surprises each run.For me, the difficulty is somewhat easy with moments of panic as Fight hangs on with 1 bar of health. I think the difficulty could be bumped up or possibly offer a hard option to suit people's taste. Don't get me wrong, a wreckless person will be punished.A Robot Named Fight! is well worth the asking price, especially given the creator is actively incorporating feedback into the game. I only hope that more people get to experience the game so more Fight can be added!Pick it up now!PS. Tutorial Smith... A+"
,Recommended,603530,34848985,Posted: 9 September,all,TrucktubGAMES,"I've only played the game for about 5 hours but can tell this is going to be a game I come back to. This year has been amazing for ""homage"" games with 20XX taking inspiration from MegaMan X and now A Robot Named Fight! from metroid (a series in dire need of SOMETHING)You play as a Robot attempting to rid the world of fleshy beasts and if your robot dies, another Robot takes its place (not a huge deal, but it helps me personally be okay with the lore aspect of the revive lol)There are hidden powerups throughout the map and there are indicators on the map telling you that there's a powerup in the room...this is a pro and a con. I can see people being a little MEH about KNOWING there's a powerup in the room because then there's no ""discovery"" but you still have to search for the powerup. Maybe in the future there can be an option to turn off the indicators?The gameplay is great, it feels like you're in a Metroid game. The weapons and powerup you get change so much about the game. You can only access certain areas with certain powerups and sometimes you flat out don't even see those powerups and will have to abandon that room.Basically - if you're a fan of metroid and ""roguelike"" permadeath games with random powerups you should buy this game. It's fantastic, It's so much fun. I've only been to the 3rd ""area"" and I've probably seen 6 bosses.ALSO THE MUSIC IS OMGGGGGGGG!!!!"

Would recommend to anyone who knows that they like this kind of game."
,Recommended,603530,34802680,Posted: 7 September,all,blackguard,"First impressions review based on a single hour-long playthrough (I died before I even got access to the final area due to carelessness).The game manages to recreate the feel of Super Metroid pretty well. Pacing is a bit faster; there's more combat and less peaceful exploration. The difficulty is just a bit harder than Super Metroid, which means it's still relatively easy if you're prudent. Secrets and other stuff are conveniently marked on the minimap from 1 tile away, so there's always a sense of progression in every way possible: exploration, incremental upgrades (damage, atk rate, max health, etc), and exploration upgrades (double jump, arachnomorph, etc.).Currency can be acquired and used at various vendors throughout the map (for weapon upgrades, suit upgrades, shmup-type orbs, and other stuff), though there are no descriptions for any of the items before you buy them.Music and sound effects are spot-on, though the music starts to get repetitive a bit too soon.Overall it's exactly what it says on the tin, and pretty much what I expected."
,Recommended,603530,34869750,Posted: 10 September,all,StuOnThis,"If you liked Binding of Isaac and Super Metroid, then you will LOVE this game. I've blown the better part of my weekend on this game and just can't get enough. There are plenty of other reviews to cover all the pros and cons (99% of which I agree with), but what I will say is that I hope there's an upgrade in the future to make the game a little bigger and add some stuff that isn't blatantly ripped from Metroid. But all in all, it's a lot of fun. The controls are pretty tight and I haven't died without totally feeling like I deserved it."

Most people these days don't know what the metroidvania and roguelite genres mean, but if you do, you know what you're looking for and this game blends the two naturally.  And if you don't know, then strap on your arm cannon and get out the grill cause it's about to start raining meat!"
,Recommended,603530,34908666,Posted: 12 September,all,Luke 'M4g1cW4rr10r',"tl;dr Best sentence to describe this game: semi-permadeath Super Metroid randomizer.You play as a robot named Fight, one of the last robots willing to stand up to the fleshy abominations of Megabeast, by going deep into the earth and gathering all the fight he can! ... eh, screw it. The story is not the main focus, and thank god its not, because its just about killing some giant flying meatball.As soon as you start the game, you immediately go into the settings and fix your button layout. I don't have a 360 contoller, and I don't know why, but my Generic USB Joystick (my GameCube controller) has an inverted axis only on this game, and I can't seem to fix it. So I had to use keyboard, which was probably the best option for me. The most suitable way I found is to have movement with 'WASD', diagonal aiming and switching weapons on the arrow keys, Space to shoot and Enter to jump.The game doesn't hold your hand, and unless you know how Super Metroid controls, you may go through a few playthroughs getting confused about the control scheme.Upon choosing 'New Game' the world is created, building a map using pre-existing rooms with random powerups in them.Even if you only get terrain-phasing shots, four orbs, and no energy weapons, or something equally ridiculous, the game is still entirely completable as its procedurally generated to construct the world's obstacles based on the upgrades you are given. Because of this, the game is fairly linear, and you should be able to get 100% completion as long as you go through every room, since there's no secret rooms or alternate shortcuts, and all the items show up on your map.Eventually you'll come to your first boss, 1 out of 3 random bosses for each area. Although these bosses are simple enough, they can be quite hard especially at the start since you're only guaranteed one or two powerups, which may not even be for your weapon.If you beat the boss, you'll be introduced to the game's semi-permadeath mechanic, with new items and perks for all future playthroughs as you progress and unlock achievements.These items can be found in upgrade rooms, or forged by the hand of allies whom you can find in the lower levels of the world. To craft these items, you use scrap found from monsters, or found randomly in hidden locations where powerups can also spawn. You don't need to craft these for 100% completion, but you do need to find all the ones across the world.If you manage to survive the onslaught of all four areas and their respective bosses, the objective now is to go all the way back to the start and kill Megabeast. Assuming you beat the damage sponge that is the final boss, you teach robotkind the important lesson that things die when you kill them.The ending wraps up telling you Megabeast's arrival was due to the 'anti-fascist' Mole People, and that many other robots will now take on the name Fight and challenge Megabeast. Which kind of makes sense with the permadeath idea. S'not 'A Robot Named Fight' as much as it is 'Multiple Robots Named Fight'.And the game ends with no further explanation. And then you win! Cheers!Music and graphics are alright."

Same with powerups placements.Powerups are nice and orbs are a nice touch. I just wish there would be more area types (sections/sectors), more enemies and bosses, and more powerups...

76561198042368636,Recommended,603530,34848392,Posted: 9 September,all,Cavi,"Pretty interesting game that mixes the best of the Metroidvania genre with Rogue-like elemets.The game controls exactly like a Metroid game with backtracking, ""hidden"" power ups and upgradable gear as you play.Pros:- Graphics and presentation are great.- Backtracking that doesn't feel annoying.- Great power up diversity.- Very good controls, exactly like Metroid.- Overall the gameplay experience is very good.Cons:- Although it's supposed to be a Rogue-like game, it's pretty short, my 100% run took around 2 hours and later playthroughs become much shorter and less interesting (until certain milestones).- The room variety suffers because of the randomly generation, once you see a room you know how it plays out.- The minimap shows you the hidden upgrade so it's pretty hard to miss anything in this game.- No lore basically, the only information you get is from the first/last cutscene. It would have been nice to find some lore items that you can collect.So unless the game gets longer as you beat it there isn't much replayability, once you beat it that's it. I look forward to what the dev does next, I feel that if he ever decides to make another metroidvania without the rogue-like elements and with some storytelling elements he can make a game as good or even better than Axiom Verge.So, should you buy this game?If you are here because of the Metroidvania or Pixelated graphics tags then yes, it's a wonderful addition to your collection.If you are interested in the Rogue-like element you may consider waiting for a discount/more content being added.Edit: After playing the game a couple of more hours there's some things that I want to point out:- The game becomes harder with each playthrough which is good since it makes the replayability better.- Enemy placement should be rechecked in future patch notes to avoid ""unfair"" damage, specially on later playthroughs.(SPOILERS)- A new area becomes available after beating the game a sixth time which adds a bit of lore. Still, I stand with my opinion that the story of the game needs to be expanded upon as collectibles."

I love how it's basically Binding of isaac meets Super Metroid.I have one BIG complaint though, one that I'd love the developer would adress somehow...The bosses, the bosses are ridiculously easy, they barely last a few seconds, have extremely silly behaviour patterns and are overall not a challenge in any way.I actually think the world difficulty itself is fine, specially when you unlock the difficulty ""boosts"" (one or two more wouldn't be bad as well, though) but the bosses are just insanely easy.I understand that maybe the devs want to give an opportunity to all kinds of players, but many of us here are really disappointed with the overall challenge that bosses present, and I'm actually having a hard time imagining new players having trouble with the bosses at all.Maybe a boss difficulty setting at the beggining? Normal, hard, very hard? I don't know, just please, adress this somehow."

And I am not a huge rogue/rogue-light fan (besides Rogue Legacy;has never been my favorite genre), yet this game drove me deeper and deeper into the bowels of this meat-opolis!I believe that I can say with pretty much 100% certainity that this will go down in history as not only a masterpiece of gaming, but also a catalyst for more developers to find creative ways to create more Metroidvania rogues! Matt Binter you are a freaking genius with one hell of a messed up mind to create all of those meat creatures that will assuredly give me nightmares for a long time!

Fun game, one of my roommates wandered in during the final run for a bit and commented that the design was a straight rip of Metroid, but I happened to be in one of the early areas with lots of meat background that really do look like Metroid levels. Other areas are more varied.Controls are nice and tight for the most part. Was able to hit jumps where I needed to, always good in platformer parts. Found the final boss pretty easy, maybe a little too easy. Not sure if it was just the combination of weapons I had or what. Will see.Story was interesting, but a little lacking. Not sure if there is more shown in later play-throughs, if not, probably won't keep playing.All in all, fun game, reasonable length.

So one run you might start out finding the missles, and another you'll start out finding a wave beam. The game has the right amount of difficulty, and respects your time. The music is rad, and the creature and boss designs are fantastic and gross! Probably my favorite metroid style game to come out this year!"

So far I've really enjoyed the game which kind of makes me imagine what Metroid might have been like had it been given the Sega treatment.The enemy and boss design is really cool which reminds me a bit of Alien Syndrome, Alien Storm, and Treasures own classic Alien Soldier! That's alot of Aliens I know but these disgusting sacks of flesh are pretty cool looking.The music and the sound effects especially the sort of squishy noise you get from flamethrowing some lumps of meat is quite good and satisfying. It's brief but pretty sweet and makes me pleased that I bought it on a whim.You seem to get a pretty large variety of weapons to choose and create along with upgrades to you normal shot like explosives.Control needs a tiny bit of work as I find the game is a little picky about aiming straight up using a 360 pad but no regrets."

,Recommended,603530,34870233,Posted: 10 September,all,SolarFlar3,"This game is a real procedurally generated metroid like game in that it requires that you have platforming and weapon keys to access new areas, and has areas that you can backtrack to to gain new items and upgrades that aren't necessary. I like it a lot. In fact I was giddy when I first started playing it because it blew my expectations out of the water. I've beaten the game twice now, and from what I understand after you've beaten it a few times, the game gets harder, which is good.Pros:Real metroidy map design and gameplay loopDifferent upgrades spawn that help you get through the same obstacle. For example, to reach a high ledge some games will give you a double jump, some games will give you a jetpack, ect.More items unlock when you complete certain achievements.The character movement feels almost exactly like super metroid, which is admittedly kind of sluggish. This is a pro for nostalgia, and a con for feeling sluggish, ha.Lots of bosses and lots of content. Each run has you fight 5 bosses including the main boss, but there is a lot more bosses than that in the pool that can be drawn from.Local coop is as good as it can be for a metroid like game. The second player controls a floating orb and basically plays like a twin stick shooter. Having the second player makes the game a lot easier, but that's okay.Interesting art, and unique locations to explore.Cons:The opening sequence is poorly voice acted. I wish that there wasn't a voice actor and that it was just text.There's a piece of graffiti in one of the areas that says ""f***"". Everything else in the game is probably rated E10+, and that automatically makes it so you can't play with your kids anymore for absolutely no benefit. Kind of ridiculous.The video options are pretty limited.Finding the upgrades secretly hidden in the walls is kind of a chore. There is no graphical indication (that I saw) where the upgrade is, so you just have to shoot like a crazy person all over the room until you break the wall chunk that has the upgrade in it.Sometimes enemies are a little hard to see against the environment."

Over all a great game.If the whole GORE thing turns you away from the trailers, its not really that bad, and honestly if the dev asked me how to change their trailer I would say focus on what you do interesting rather than the whole GORE thing.Made by a single guy for the most part.Using examples of other games, this game is literally a Metroid / Binding of isaac like game.Every run you do is some what random, bosses, actual room lay outs, direction you need to go. But the metroid aspect comes from actually gaining items that enhance you. Things like double jump, charge beam. Which not only give you more freedom or strength, they also open up their own paths opening more of the game.A great example of this is the sub weapon system, you have a small energy pool (recharges on its own slowly) Which allows you to use things like Lightning Rod which pierces walls, locks on to enemies, AND does the same affect that a charge beam would on doors. So while your run may NEVER come across Charge Beam you'll have that Lightning Rod gun to open doors, and paths.Unlocks work a lot like Binding of Isaac, which is fine. The majority of items are always good. And the Dev is fairly active in the forums and does take suggestions!I hope this dev goes on to maybe growing the content or even a continuation with more items, and such. But for the cost this game is a great grab for that Metroid itch you may have!"

Trial and error are part of the game as you learn the nature of enemies, bosses, and traps. Dying is part of the game as new items and mechanics are unlocked through your progress, making the next attempt possibly more managable. The art and music direction are pretty good compared to other games that try too hard to emulate faux-retro styles and miss the mark.It even features couch co-op, although I'd personally have liked something for online play too.For its value and replayability, It's definitely worth it.

However like most roguelikes, your run's success can be dependant on how merciful the RNG is on you just as much as your own skill. There are times where you are in immediate danger the moment you enter a room, and damage is hard to avoid at times, but the developers are hard at work at not only solving these issues, but are also still working on new content.As it stands, the game is fun, and incentivises repeated runs to unlock new weapons and equipment, and also bonuses for future runs. I do hope to see new things added to this game in the future, as there is a lot of potential to be had here. And while a lot of these items seem to synergize with eachother quite well, it's up to the RNG to not leave you with a bunch of items that don't combine well at all.All in all, A Robot Named Fight is a very solid game, and quite enjoyable if you enjoy action games."

,Not Recommended,603530,35194424,Posted: 24 September,all,Sankt Kaiser,"DISCLAIMER: The opinions and views presented in this review are wholly my own. I'm not pretending to speak from an objective viewpoint, here. I either liked the game, or I didn't.A decent little procedurally-generated rougelike Metroidvania. Plays very similar to - and looks a lot like - Super Metroid, which was the entire reason I bought it and it did not let me down in that regard.A quick breakdown of what I did, and did not, like about the game:Things I Liked:Handles close to Super Metroid, and has a similar gameplay style.Good pixel art, and great effects.Lots of upgrades to acquire.Great enemy design (visual and practical) for the most part.Story was orginal in many aspects.Things I Was Neutral Towards:Story overall, however, was rather meh. Which is its own charm for some people.Soundtrack isn't great or varied, but at least suits the game.Jumping feels like it's always underwater, which is weird.Lots of unlockables, which is great if you're into that.Most areas are pretty cramped.Things I Did Not Like:Locked out of several runs because the game does not spawn approproate power ups in an attainable area.Not very many procedural rooms - feels very same-y each run.Lots of randomization in the powerups, meaning some are wasted; i.e. getting lots of ""Energy Tanks"" for secondary weapon, when I don't get one until the end of the run.Very little explanation about some powerups. I thought the Shield Bot would protect me. Turns out, it doesn't, not much anyway.Dark rooms are unnecessarily annoying. Doesn't add to gameplay aside from making me find one more powerup that may or may not be there.Speed Module. I don't want to run faster, Fight is plenty fast. How about my bullets go faster instead?Fragile Shell. I lose health for speed and RoF? Makes Fight almost uncontrollable. Lame.UI gets in the way of... well, everything. Including itself (active save station icon is overlayed on minimap).Doesn't scale well on 21:9 (3440x1440) monitors. Understandable because it's a minority resolution? Yes. Doesn't mean I liked it.Things I Would Change:Have some kind of ""completable"" check so I'm not missing powerups to progress, even after I've checked every room.Get rid of Scrap counter on main UI and move it to the fullsize map display.Fullsize map display is toggable, not hold to use.Turn on and off powerups. E.g. Not a fan of Big Bolt, but I want my 100% item find.Boss name display, rather than just ""Get Ready"". I know it's a boss fight, I've played a videogame before.Jumping mechanics. It's too... floaty. Like I said, it feels like it's underwater.More distinct areas.RT + LT is always aiming straight up, regardless of movement.Map size modifier. Like, Normal, Double, Quadruble for number of rooms.Powerup exchange vendor. Trade one powerup for another one like it. E.g. firebolt for flamethrower, slide for spiderbot form and vice versa.Biased About:Some animations could use work, or a few more frames. Jump + shoot down in particular is kinda cringy. But I've also got a hard-on for how Super Metroid it looks, so I'm probably just unconsciously expecting that animation.Overall Impression:It's not a BAD game, don't get me wrong. Could it stand improvement? Sure. Most games could, so it's not like it's alone there. It's easy to pick up and play, it's stable, and it's fun in and of itself. However, having to abandon a run because I've explored everywhere and the powerup that will allow me to progress didn't spawn is insanely annoying. When successful runs are ~90 minutes and locked-out runs are anywhere from 20 minutes to almost an hour of futile searching, it's just maddening.VerdictBeing the case,I can't recommend the gamecurrently. If this one thing were fixed, and every run were able to be completed, I would change my stance and Recommend the game."

Meat Monsters theme.Its controls are tight and the level design is solid.Good enemy variety as well, especially within the limitations of ""meat monsters"".On one side, it's a roguelite. On the other side, each run is basically an independent Metroidvania game.With each run taking between 50-70 minutes if you aren't rushing too much.You start, fight your way to the first boss, then drop down into the exploration part of the game, it's fairly open but usually a loop that you can figure out vaguely where things are going to be. This makes ""speedrunning"" possible while still being randomly generated.There are incentives to revisiting areas that you couldn't fully explore (like a proper metroidvania), there are merchants where you can buy some very helpful or powerful items and upgrades.Little white circles on the map denote the general location of items (often hidden in the walls, floors or ceilings), it's entirely possible to 100% collect each item every run.This is all good stuff that I'd expect from a pure metroidvania.On the roguelite side, it does have permadeath and a generated map, different bosses are selected each run, different items and *key items.As well as unlocks that affect future runs; items you can find or buy and the ability to sometimes start with extra items.*Key items being a staple of Metroidvanias, such as an item to let you move under 1-block-tall spaces, or explosives to bust through an armored door that you saw 20 minutes agoYou can even unlock one-shot save stations, up to 3 extra lives can generate on the map once you unlock this feature. Sometimes you won't even need them because, unlike a lot of other roguelites, this game isn't brutally hard.For the most part, it's fair when you get hit.

After a while it can get repetitive to play the same part all over again after dying, and the levels don't feel THAT different each time. Still,  the bosses and the whole atmosphere of the game is great."

I really dislike most rougelike games but I made an exception for this one :D.Feels like metroid, like super OP metroid if you get lucky.You can turn it into a rougelite by backing up your save games folder if you totally can't stand rouglike."

So many neat game ideas shackled to the extreme difficulty and constant re-playing of levels over and over just to get that tiny bit further, usually with tedious and absurd ways to slowly eek out progress in the metagame.A Robot Named Fight seems to toss all that nonsense aside in favor of a solid, fun, highly replayable experience. Or at least, that's what the game's first impressions seem to imply.Rather than expecting you to learn every room and every enemy flawlessly, punishing every mistake and holding health drops and ammunition to ransom, ARNF embraces its obvious inspiration. Health and energy drop regularly and in ample supply, enemies respawn between rooms, and the overall gameplay balance seems to be made to facilitate fun encounters and exploration rather than focusing on lots of short-lived runs.Perhaps it's just my first impressions, but it seems to me like ARNF is more interested in giving you something fun and well polished to play that can be replayed over and over with different results, rather than making the roguelike elements a restraint that draws all the focus. I almost expect the roguelike elements were added in simply because they had too many ideas they wanted to add to fit a standard game, and so used procedural generation to shuffle elements between playthroughs.On my very first run, I got 3 zones in. There are no absurdly tedious multi-step elevator/tunnel/teleporter metagame level skips either, which plague so many other games of this type. Expect to sit down and have loads of fun with a very faithful Super Metroid homage that happens to mix things up every time you die."

A bit of replayability. Basically, im into it.Now who would win in a fight Samus at full power or 50 robots named fight? Hmmm...."

I've done runs that seem to not give enough health power-ups or odd placements of new equipment, but I've still had fun with the game. I highly recommend it to people who've wanted a metroidvania game similar to what the Binding of Isaac offers."

A Robot Named Fight provides a complete collection of qualities that make it more than worth its price tag. While some minor grievances deter it from being a truly recommendable piece, the replayability and variety of its structure provide hours of treasure-hunting escapades. I really can't figure out what I enjoy more: the exploration or the action, as both play a heavy role in the game's performance-based highlights. I only wish it wasn't so determinant on its luck-based extremities to pad itself to more than an hour a playthrough. Even so, it's worth recommending more than it is not.Pros:+ Abundant replayability+ Excellent performance rate+ Combines the best of action and explorationCons:- Unimpressive soundtrack- Somewhat lacking in content- Too heavily influenced by luckThe full review can be found athttps://www.keengamer.com/article/17175_a-robot-named-fight-review"

I particularly enjoy the music- and the game as whole is a step above others in the genre. It's obvious that if you long for the days of the SNES, this is a game to play. The cutscenes are very fun, and harkin back to the days of the original XCom on floppy disk.Note: This game is best played with a controller."
