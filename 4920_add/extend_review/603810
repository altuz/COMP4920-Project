,Recommended,603810,30499119,Posted: 13 March,all,CjuGames,"Overall this is a solid first person horror game. It won't last you very long though, maybe an hour at best.Also, some controls aren't shown to you (presumably this will be fixed soon) -i - inventorye - use (notes/doors)It's nothing incredibly new or revolutionary, the puzzles are basic and easy, but I found the story intriguing, a lot of the scares worked well and ultimately I left the experience very satisfied. The more you explore and the more you find, the more you'll understand.Personally, I preferred this over Mind's Eyes (Stanislaw Truchowski's previous work). Good stuff.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgv5sw97WU"

I recommend trying Mind's Eyes first, as that is free and lets you get a feel for what this game is like-- but you should know that this game is a step up from Mind's Eyes in absolutely every way.Also, press ""I"" to use your inventory. That took me a bit to figure out, and it's important.UPDATE: a patch added it to the controls, so that shows up now. Problem solved."

I felt too safe, I never felt like I was going to get caught or killed, it felt a little more like a walking sim with a five nights at freddy's feel to the sleeping portions of the game.For a cheap indie title? Honestly, it was worth the money, it held my interest, and that's better than the majority of indie titles out there. I hope to see a few key updates to the game and maybe I'll give it a few replays to collect those achievements.6/10TLDR: Improvements can and should be made, but for the price it was an enjoyable experience._______________________________Features:Multiplayer - NoVR - Not currently"

,Recommended,603810,30655300,Posted: 21 March,all,Vee,"A Girl's Fabric Face: 8/10Great little game! There are at least 2 different endings here, though I suspect there may be more than that. I've only gotten one so far, but I genuinely enjoyed it.The jumpscares are there, but few and far between. The game is much more concerned with creating a dreadful atmosphere, and I appreciate that in a horror game. It's clear the developer spent a lot of time making this game look as good as it does!The only aspect that I dislike is the lack of a save system. It seems like it wouldn't be too hard to implement one, especially at the ""rest points"". However, I think the lack of saving was a conscious choice by the developer who wants players to get the most out of the game by playing it all through in one sitting. That said, it took me about 30 minutes for my first playthrough, for anyone wondering what they are getting into!For a few bucks, this game is definitely worth the time, all said."

If you're a fan of horror games and don't have any weird hang ups about Unity, this is definitely a title to check out.I had no idea what I was getting into and I honestly hated it at first because I tried to rush around and didn't really take a couple minutes to learn the game. Once I had a bit more patience with it, I found it to be a lot of fun and I also enjoyed the little story.It was a little awkward until I got the hang of the way things worked but overall I enjoyed it and felt like I got my money's worth. I look forward to hopefully seeing more games like this from these Devs.My only complaint is that the voice over didn't really jive with me. It wasn't poor acting or reading or anything. Just something about it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.  Maybe that's not a bad thing? I mean, it is a horror game after all.  :)"

Having read reviews I made sure to keep my camera charged and I figured out I could look through my invetory while the charger did its thing, also I could look around. This game is slower paced than some and I got stumped a few times (plus I missed a ton of stuff according to my invetory) but I really enjoyed myself. There are four possible endings, and it honestly took me about an hour on my first playthrough.https://youtu.be/hF5XFQg3ehI"

I'm not usally scared of horror games but this one takes the cake!! This is the first horror game that makes me want to uninstall it or a refund. And i'm not joking.

The game is short and so I would have loved this to be a full game however for the price you cant go wrong. It has multiple endings too that gives it a replay value also.I really recomend this game to anyone that likes the occasional jumpscare and to be able to have the feel that you are really investigating the paranormal activity.Check out the video to see the first part of 2https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joWZRqPttjo"
76561198263804556,Not Recommended,603810,31551707,Posted: 4 May,all,TechFXpunk,"This game started off pretty good in my opinion. I really liked the idea of trying to capture paranormal events on your camera. Exploring the house after witnessing actitivity on your night cams makes for some intense gameplay. I do wish their was one extra camera during the night cam parts. The game felt a little lacking with only being able to switch between 2 cameras. I mean just set up a camera in the kitchen or a bathroom, I would of felt more urgency to switch cams faster.  I also seemed to have a reoccuring bug of not being able to switch cameras. I played the game twice and it happened both times. This obviously needs to be fixed and kind of ruined the experience for me.The atmosphere was creepy, unnerving and had me feeling a little on edge. The fact that I had to react fast to capture footage added to this very well. The puzzles were simple but not completely obvious. I really liked the game up until the looping hallway. This is where the game lost me honestly. I would try to film things thinking its was paranormal findings but I wouldn't get anything from it. In fact the first time I played this I ran out of battery in the basement ""maze"". I couldn't find my way through the darkness and had to restart. Lights were falling, ghost girls were moving and none of it registered as paranormal. I really didn't like this part at all. I believe I had a similiar issue with your first game ""Mind's Eye"". I enjoyed that game up until the computer maze section.Overrall I really liked the idea here and the first part of this game. The camera bugs and looping hallway kind of killed the game for me. I really couldn't say I would recommend this game. I think you're a good game designer though and have a lot of potential to really impress me with your next game. I will be watching out for other games from you.Cheers"

,Not Recommended,603810,30642288,Posted: 20 March,all,Indurok,"Video version of this review:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=887967416You know, if a face belongs to a girl, people would usually put an apostrophe in the word “girls”.The game starts off with a voice speaking in your head. Time to start what again? What did I do before? What are you trying to do to me, Mister Voice Man? You don’t really get any sort of explanation about who you are and why you are in this haunted house. But you have a bunch of cameras and sh**, and a little percentage of “Paranormal findings” in the bottom corner. So obviously, you’re investigating some spooky stuff.So I’m walking around the house, as one would usually do in a situation like this. So far, nothing scary has happened. There’s a note by the front door that looks like I’m supposed to interact with it, but nothing’s happening, so I guess not. Why can I open the stove? There’s nothing inside it, so what’s the point?There’s also some little machine that you have to use to charge your battery. Honestly, it kinda gets annoying. There’s a problem I had with one of the doors upstairs. I entered a room, but it wouldn’t let me open the door to leave. Well, it turns out that you can’t open doors when you’re crouching. First off, that’s just bullsh**. And second, I couldn’t even tell that I was crouching. I swear, the door knob looks like it’s at a normal height.So I figured out that I’m supposed to set up a rest area at the top of the stairs. I’m sure it’s a good idea to actually sleep in this place when spooky stuff is gonna happen. But this is where things start to get confusing for me. I’ve been playing for 20 minutes, and I can’t figure out what to do. I’ve interacted with everything in the house, but to no avail. I’ve gone into every room, but there’s nothing of any importance, except random letters and hanging dolls.The only progress I’ve made so far, is reading that note I thought I couldn’t read. You have to be standing on a specific side of the table in order to read it. What’s that all about?So after being stuck for several minutes, I talked to the developer, who told me that there is a key hanging above the kitchen. Are you kidding me? You can’t just start off a game by putting a key in one of the worst possible spots! I mean, what do you have against a table or a counter? But anyway, after getting the key, it’s time to explore more of the house. Things actually start to get a little better from here.The spooky-spook makes a couple appearances throughout the game. I also did catch a few jumpscares. Every night, you have to look at the two cameras you set up, and keep an eye out for spooky stuff. I didn’t see anything the first night even though it got me some percentage of paranormal findings. Then I started to get stuck again.I used the pipe wrench I found in the basement to get the valve, because that totally makes sense, but what am I supposed to do now? I’ve tried interacting with everything, but nothing else will happen. There’s a piece of paper in the basement that, for some reason, shows all my objectives. I’m stuck on number 7, and the next one says to get out of there, but I don’t know how to get to that step. I thought it had something to do with the safe, but I can’t figure out the code.The developer told me later that the safe was optional. Okay, while it’s great to know that, it’s not so great when the safe is literally the only thing that game will allow me to do anything with.“Maybe a power box?” What? You don’t have one of those at your house? Why would the main character say that unless this power box is of some importance? I can’t even do anything with it. Alright, you know what? I’m done. I give up. I’m just gonna quit.“Simple as possible”, my♥♥♥♥♥ If the puzzles were THAT simple, there’d be at least SOME sense of direction to be had in this game. You can’t just give me something like a valve, and not give me anything to use it on.I won’t bother coming back to this because I’d have to do the entire game over again because the game doesn’t save. Let me repeat that: THE. GAME. DOES. NOT. SAVE. Why the hell would you do that?! It even says that on the store page, but it’s just so stupid! You can’t do that in a game that has puzzles, because I’m one of those people who sucks at puzzles, and constantly has to EXIT the game in order to look up what I need to do.I honestly cannot recommend this game. But if you’re smarter than me, and I’m sure anyone who isn’t me is, then you’ll probably do a better job at this game than I did."
76561198084935483,Not Recommended,603810,30436962,Posted: 10 March,all,iMSaiyan,"Kinda plops you into the game, then you start walking around with no explanation - charging the flashlights, etc like that - point of setting up the cameras? It's more of a walking simulator where you click on everything to make sure you've picked it up. Was boring and had no sense of direction for the most part. You have an inventory if you press I, theres a little note that kind of tells you what to do but ""I should rest"" like what, rest where? do what? just seemed needlessly confusing for a horror game."
