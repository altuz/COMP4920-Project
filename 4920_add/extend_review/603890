,Not Recommended,603890,30562493,Posted: 16 March,all,Monsieur-Owly,"Pain Train 1 was not a good game but at least it provided some mindless entertainment with its non-stop carnage and ridiculous achievement spamming (kinda like a poor man's version of Call of Duty Zombie Mode). Pain Train 2, on the other hand, is just an uneeded sequel that fails to improve on the ""foundation"" of its predecessor besides keeping the same flaws and adding new ones.POSITIVES- New type of enemies- Weapons crafting system (although very simplistic)- Upgrade system (although very simplistic)- Level selection menu featuring different tiers- At least 2 varieties of boss (and maybe more)- Achievement spamming is back!NEGATIVES- The game is so dark that it is difficult to navigate through the map- Enemies spawning frequency has been increased, making the game overly difficult- Repetitive maps and mission objectives- The generic sci-fi setting is reminiscent of the abysmal Galactic Hitman- Texture popping issues can be found in some part of the map- Aside from 2 new weapons, the arsenal is basicaly the same as in the first game- Weapon skin design is quite horrible- The modern arsenal does not fit with the sci-fi setting- The zombie models are the same as in the first game- The cartoony zombie look does not fit with the sci-fi setting- No way to save your progression- No train to be seen (why call the game Pain Train 2 then!?)- 5-6$ price tag (why crank up the price when the production value is about the same as the first game)After being able to get past Level 1, 2, 3 and 4, I feel like I played Pain Train 2 long enough to confirm that it is neither worth its full price nor worth its discounted price.Meet the Eye of Sauron and his army of eyeball minions:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzikjHDpBcE&feature=youtu.beRating:2.0 / 10"

,Not Recommended,603890,30576459,Posted: 17 March,all,Maluno,"tl;dr:- if not achievement hunter, steer clear.- if achievement hunter, no tl;dr.In 7+ years of being on Steam, this has been the first time i requested a refund.As an achievement hunter who's mildly tormented by the tug of war between the awareness of the futility of it all and the slight satisfaction of a new trivial completion—but who does it anyway—I've gotten as used to playing with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t as a manure farmer.I attempt to maintain a healthy and balanced diet of good games that are enjoyable to play and crap games that serve simultaneously as another AGC boost, a +1 on the perfect games counter, and/or (as it's become the trend these days) yield a ludicrous amount of achievements for little to no effort, time or money.The first Pain Train was one such game. A laughably brainless asset flip concoction with close to 600 achievements that could easily be completed in less than an hour. They were all straightfowardly quantitative stuff such as 'fire this type of weapon x times' or 'kill x zombies'. Then you had 12 remaining achievements, each for completing one of the 12 levels, and those were exploitable because you could just complete the first level (the easiest one) 12 times and it would unlock all of them.Pain Train 2 is almost the same thing. Comparing the two, the irrelevant differences are that it has more achievements (720) and all achievements but one are 'kill x enemies'. The remaining achievement, much like in the first game is also (and more clearly stated) 'complete any 12 levels'.The relevant difference here is that the first level is annoyingly much much harder than on the first game. Ironically it's also much harder than all the other levels on the same game as well (i hear), as you start with just a pistol and won't unlock new and more powerful weapons until you beat the first level. Which to me didn't seem like an easy deed as the generators you're supposed to destroy spawn an ungodly amount of enemies much faster than the other game. I would find myself inescapably swarmed by the time i managed to destroy one (of 3?) generators, every time.It could be argued that i should 'git gud' at it. Some people have completed it, and I'm sure many more will persevere. And while in general that sounds like a good point, I would argue that personally, something that makes me sad on the insides is not worth gitin gud at.Since in reality this isn't really a game, but an achievement piñata, its difficulty on the very first level is unnecessary and counterproductive.Price is the last factor, one I wouldn't consider commenting on given how relative it can be. What's expensive to one person is peanuts to another, and time/price doesn't hold much objective value since a short game could easily provide a richer experience than hundreds of hours of mediocrity.I feel fine making an exception here though. If you set the other achievement piñata games or even the first Pain Train as the True North of pricing, you'll realize that this game costs, at 40% launch discount, four times their price."
,Not Recommended,603890,31894836,Posted: 21 May,all,Mikazuki,Pros:- Easy 720 Achievement.- 60fpsCons:- Repetitive Gameplay ( All you do is go to the corner of the room and shooting endless spawn of zombie to unlock all the achievement)- No replay value.- Only have 1 stage.- No story.If you are achievement hunter and want some easy game to boost your perfect games count then i recomend this game because it's so easy to completed.but if you are not achievement hunter and don't care about achievement then i don't recomend this game for you because i'm sure you will easily get bored with only a few hours when you start the game.

Despite all the *Improvements* this one is even worse than the 1st - because of its all the SAME SH`T but 5 times more expensive LOL.-Exactly same repetitive gameplay placed in a different are - now the dev kid managed to buy spaceship textures! Yet we meet same zombies from the 1st part, and some robots + turrets-You can be stuck in the textures all around the game basically I was trying to advance more or less in the game progress, but after the game from in the ESC menu twice, and I stuck in the wall and in the mid air(srsly?) that was enough for me.-719 easy to get achievements + 1 hard to get (complete 12 levels of this garbage ugh)-Game priced 5 times more than the 1st one, why? Because of the weapon skins you can buy in-game? Idk.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=919792531Bought this game with a 90% discount coupon and still feel ROBBED.YOU can buy this game, get all achievements and refund it BEFORE 2 hours expire."

Basically you play the same game just with more smoothened graphics. 3d models are still the same or they are stolen from the fifth element and other movies/games -  who knows. The 12 base levels are now split into 4 main stages with an impressive superboss. The first one was the the huge flying eye surrounded by hundreds of smaller flying eyes. Also the boss from the first game still exist. The full price of 7 EUR is quite not justified. Try to grab it for 1 EUR or less if possible. And just play it for the 720 cheevos then ... deinstall again."

On the same level. With the same objective. And you can't get all the achievements without playing the same level 18 times (3x1 + 3x2 + 3x3) in a row. AVOID IT. Or buy, play fast and refund.

,Recommended,603890,33786841,Posted: 25 July,all,JHGaming- CSGOatse.com,"I personally dont understand how we got from a subway to a spaceship, but let's just role with it for a few minutes, i believe way too many enemies spawn in Pain train 2, especially in level 1, the levels are supposed to increase in difficulty, but i just believe it stays the same throughout the levels to be fully honest.Another thing is that i like these games, i liked the addition of the paintjobs and the gun collection thing on the side and a few other things, but i think they should just focus more on the graphics more than the achievements, dont get me wrong i bought the original Pain Train for the achievements, but the second didnt need any more, i think this game would be much more appealing to other people, if the zombies didnt look like they came straight from 2002, i mean the eyeballs look decent and some other things do, i just think it would make the game more enjoyableThe only other thing i can say is about the achievements, how about instead of having 700 achievements about getting that many kills, have fewer for those, ie ""Get 100 kills"", ""get 200 kills"" etc, and have more achievements like, getting the shotgun or the machine gun, and achieving the armour addons and more for accomplishing each level instead of just one for 12. This would make the game more appealing to people who don't like achievement spam games.I understand you cannot just remove 700 achievements but i feel they should learn from what people are saying and improve their future games for what people want mostly. Personally i do like the game for the achievements and for the ""story"" i just want them to listen a bit more to the community."

76561198221024944,Not Recommended,603890,31608735,Posted: 7 May,all,Envelope,"This game is an okay sequel. It uses the exact same bad guys as the first game plus 3-4 extra units. The guns are the exact same, except you get skins this time. The map is much bigger, but it's the same repetitive script as the first game. There are also spots in the map you can get stuck in or behind walls, forcing you to die and restart. Like the first one, there is no way to adjust the music volume or sensitivity that I can find. Overall, it was about an hour of playtime to beat all levels.The massive number of trading cards and achievements is definitely an appeal, but for the 7$ price tag, I cannot recommend getting this game. It should be 99 cents or less. Buy it with a coupon or on sale in a bundle if you must have the achievements. If not, don't bother at all."
