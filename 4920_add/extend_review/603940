,Recommended,603940,33689655,Posted: 20 July,all,Barik Morloc,"This game is awesome! Its kinda like Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale where you manage a shop but for 1/3 the price. The music is great! The dungeon gameplay is addictive. You frantically try to place all the items to sell in your bag in a tetris-like minigame. I actualy preffer it over Recettar as the dungeons are quicker. Stratedgy is involved in order to make maximum profits like knowing an items sub type, your customers classes, events on the calendeer, and which things to upgrade. There's lots of items to craft as well. And lots of ways to improve your shop. I can tell I'm going to get 40+ hours on this game. Get this game! Especially if you like shopkeeping games, you won't regret it!"

Okay with that out of my system let me tell you about this lovely. This game is made by one person and that one person is often checking the forums to help/ take suggestions. The game is being updated often enough but is fun with whats already there.You start off with getting out of  school and a debt to pay off for all that you learnt! Wow, school is expensive depending on the difficulty. XD Anyway you have to pay it off so it's time to  open up a shop and sell sell!! but there is a slight problen... you need items so hit that dugeon with it's Tetres like puzzle system and your epix packing skillz to get all that sweet loot into your small bag that later can be upgraded! Hmm... I need  people to buy my stuff so lets poke the crap out of people till they buy my awesome stuff. >:) Oh.. whats this... I found a note and it tells me how to make some sexy boots!! YES PLEASE!!! I'll just equip that and sell my old dirty boots now he he he he. I want friends.... Lets go to the park and make some so THEY can be the ones going into the dungeons to earn crap err I mean treasures of quality to sell in my stores for me!  yeah yeah...I'l just play in my garden and grow some horns  to make even sexier boots!"
,Not Recommended,603940,33708164,Posted: 21 July,all,Mr.B,"[Edit: The Dev has informed me that the game is missing a little bit of story, and that will be added later. So when it is added, i might change the recommendation]I really liked this game. It is a easy to get in to, mouse only, puzzel/management, type of game. The first part of the game seems a bit unbalanced, and quite hard (Feels like a more unforgiving college debt, than the one i have in real life, geez). After the loan is payed back however, it becomes a enjoyable sandbox, chill, although sometimes repetitive, game.The ideas are great, and everything is fast-pased. From the Adventure/loot collecting, puzzles. To the shop management, and sale days. Every step of the way, you have clickable people, birds, desert dust balls, and a ton af comical dialogue, if you pay attention.But i have some issues with it.[Edit: The gamebreaking bug have been fixed] - If you keep playing after you have 500.000 gold. It will open a cutscene that keeps crashing the game.- The hired manager makes no sense. He earns you money without selling anything. Also you cannot go adventuring, and have a manager/managers work in the store, at the same time. It is one or the other.- Notifications pop up i the middle of the screen, making it impossible to interact with people, while it is up.- Not really a bug. But the only way to get ingredients for crafting, is donations from townspeople, The ocassional chest, if you get lucky, instead of collecting them on adventures. I feel like it should be the other way around. You find ingredients, then use them to craft the gear for sell.[Edit: There is now a Easy mode, if you don't wish to go trough this. So it is no longer a big issue] - The first part of the game is a terrible mess of trying to pay back a loan in time, and reloading again and again. Not sure if i feel it is to hard. But it surely was a pain.- The autosave saves just before you need to pay back the loan, and if you can't, you lose. So if you dont have a backup manual save, you are fked.[Edit: This was fixed, you can now build the house a lot bigger!] - The house can only be upgraded to around double the size, but the lot you have it on is huge. This makes the game very grindy, since you cannot make money faster, lategame.- You have to CONSTANTLY click the tables to clean them. This is probably the biggest annoyance in the game. There are so many other things you need to pay attention to during a sale day. And having to constantly having to click the tables, multiple time, to clean them, makes my heart bleed (At least the shelfes never get dirty. Phew).- It is missing some story elements in the end, that i know the dev is working on at the moment.As it is. I just can't recommend it.I DO feel however, with some patchwork, and more storytelling from the very helpful Developer, this will become a great game."
,Recommended,603940,33693659,Posted: 21 July,all,SemperPie,"Simple, deep strategy, and very addictive!The game is simple, upkeep your shop by traveling out for items to sell. When you're automatically killing enemies, you have a mini Tetris-like minigame with different obstacles to hurdle. Each stage is harder, so you have to upgrade your shopkeeper through constant upgrades. Along with your shop too.But it's more than simple, since the world is very vast with many items! Perhaps simple pales in comparison to the game. You can have relationships with merchants, ninjas, warriors, fighters, clerics, mage, archers, blacksmiths, etc. These relationships means more customers that buy your stuff! They will turn into loyal customers.The music is good, but can be repetitive at long hours. This was made through Unity, so I'm throughly impressed.If you bought the game;Important to know!:-Remember that when Green Herbs drop during stage runs, you can heal yourself. Sustain yourself.-Check the calender regularly.-There is no load function unfortunately.-Speaking of loading, save your game! I had to restart a few times because I done goofed.-Don't expand too quickly. You'll know what I mean.-Invest small things and save up! Make small goals like redoing the roof, new tables, and new decorations for bonuses!-Equip the newest items as soon as possible on yourself. It'll make you clear stages easier.-When you sell your wares, click everything! Click the birds, your dirty tables, the people (especially the people with stars over their head when they pass by your shop!), and the little dust thingies!-Each stage run counts as a day! Don't spam lower dungeons unless you need base items for crafting!-Save your game!"
76561197979995032,Recommended,603940,33824888,Posted: 26 July,all,MDSVeritas,"I'm having a lot of fun with this game so far. It's a pretty interesting mashup of a couple different genres: of course at the heart of it is the shop management, which has a nice bit of depth to it as it involves outfitting your shop with the tables, shelves, windows and flower pots, and pairing them with specific items you slowly accrue. You've got to know when to invest in a bigger shop, when to attract more customers, or when to subtly increase prices for certain items. This is also paired with elements of crafting, growing crops, and even some small clicker-game elements that don't outstay their welcome (e.g. try clicking the birds).Complimenting this already interesting management side of things is the way you actually get the items you end up selling: by adventuring. This part of the game is crisply short and to the point; there's no need to worry about hour long dungeons or lengthy battles. Instead there's the refreshing twist that your character does the fighting all on their own, while your job as the player is bag management. This ends up getting into some Tetris-y moments of fitting oddly shaped items together by rotating them around and trying to save as much space as possible, all the while you're on the clock. There's even different shaped bags you can get which provide new and strange challenges as to how you pack away your items (some bags are bigger and square, while others may have strange and challenging shapes while giving you other perks).And the glue holding these two sides of the entreprenurial endeavour is a time-management mechanic where opening the shop for a day or heading off adventuring will take up days in a precious week. So you've got to balance when you re-stock weapons, when you sell them off, and how you spend your money; you could save it to be ready to pay off increasing payments of a rather large debt, or take the gamble and use that money to level your character up to hit better dunegons and get more pricey loot, or buy new loot bags or other such gear.While all of that may seem like a lot it actually comes together pretty neatly. After a few minutes I got the hang of the gameplay loop and it's been a blast since then. One thing I'll say is that the inviting, playful appearence of this game masks a pretty intense race against time that tests your skills with a good bit of difficulty. I died while adventuring or failed to make my payments more than a few times. While this was a bit frustrating at the time, it also forced me to delve deeper into the mechanics of the game. I appreciate that the game doesn't seem to want players to be able to spend carelessly or do a sloppy job of balancing adventuring and selling. It's a game that demands your attention and comprehension and rewards you for taking time to examine it and learn from it.All in all I've been having a blast. I've failed more than a couple times but never unfairly, and the more I've died or missed my precious weekly payments the more I've come to understand all the cogs in motion at once here, and which ones I have to focus on at different times. I'm not there yet, but I aim to be a master shopkeep yet and I think it'll be a lot of fun getting there."

I was up for a challenge, so I bought it and played 3 hours straight and payed off the loans WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY AT ALL. This game is too good to be dismissed just because some people feel it's too hard. On the other hand, it's way too easy for management-loving gamers like me, which makes it a very short and content lacking game. Considering the price of the game and the active dev, I would still recommend this to anyone who likes shop management games."
,Recommended,603940,33708913,Posted: 21 July,all,suksas,"An interesting little game a bit similar to Recettear. Though more basic too.Perhaps I'm early on, but the game has no buy mechanic as you simply sell stuff to adventurers where's the later give you stuff for free. There is crafting, but you'll need to be way into the game to make anything meaningfull since it seems buying recepies is expensive.The world doesn't seem large at the moment with only 5dungeons, but am hoping there are more to unlock if I pass that 5week.But for 5£ this isn't a terrible game, though it might not be for everyone. Don't go into the game expecting Recettear style quality of gameplay, you'll be dissapointed. But as is, the game can be fun to play."

I've been wanting a Shopkeeper game for a while, and with the added cute pixels, this game hits every note!The best way to descripe this game, IMO, is a puzzler mixed with clicker. On one hand, when you go into dungeons to collect items to sell, you have to manage your inventory space a la Tetris style. You kill the end boss, you keep everything you can fit. You die, you lose it. When you're in shop keeper mode, you click on as many people walking by for better chances of selling items. You can also click on the little birds and tumbleweeds that pass by for extra gold.With every game there can be improvements, for this game training stats is very RNG based and can make late game near impossible, but the Dev is awesome and is always in the Discussion forum, helping and giving advice as much as he can.All in all this game is a solid 8/10 where it stands, and I look forward to seeing it grow alongside the community!"

I never have enough money to enjoy upgrading other aspects of the store, or just enjoying the game.Game basiclaly feels like work more than fun."
,Recommended,603940,33743499,Posted: 23 July,all,Gamesjunkie,A fun little shopkeep game with an active dev that listens to his players. Many people found it a bit too difficult so a new sandbox mode was quickly added which takes away the stress of having to make payments at the end of the week. So now you can go for the normal challenge mode or play relaxed and work towards unlocking everything. Worth the current price and with more to be improved/added in the future I can definitely recommend!
76561198027782555,Recommended,603940,33789307,Posted: 25 July,all,Feryaz,"A real good and fresh shopkeeper game. Definetly the best since recettear.The bad stuff first. It needs works in almost every aspect. The gameplay loop, interface, balance, controls and much quality of live stuff. Further many mechanics are not very clear or it fails to explain them properly. As the tycoon genre is about optimizing and min/maxing that is certainly harder then it should be here. My biggest problem is that I can't play it for longer sessions as there are to many tedious tasks and they get more the larger your shop gets. There's no way to automate even the most simple tasks. I want to play, I have things I really want to archive but after an in-game week I just have to quit because the thought of filling my whole shop again feels like work. I don't think I ever had this problem with another game.But the developer shows great ambition to improve the game. And the basis for that is really quite good. The puzzle element is nice, maybe one problem is it's rather stressfull than challenging. There's much to unlock and constructing the store is the best part. Most of the furnishings are shelves or passive bonuses and I'd like to see more things changing up the gameplay though. The progression feels good and there's always a goal and it has surprises and new gameplay elements that open up later on. Again most of those are not fleshed out or explained enough, but it shows a certain understanding of the genre.To be honest it probably should have been an early access release, but if you like shopkeeping games take it - we don't get that much and this is our best bet at the moment."
,Recommended,603940,33809463,Posted: 26 July,all,[REDi]1R CAPT Owlcoholic [A D],"I've only played for 3 hours and 40 minutes at the time of this review but I'm having a blast with this game so far! The art style is simplistic and the music can get a little repetetive but the gameplay is very addictive. You can pick from multiple difficulties which is always nice for challenge runs and such. A lot of customization in your shop, from the stands, down to details like wallpaper and roof types (each with bonuses)The core of the gameplay is split into managing your shop, in which you stock up your shelves, plant seeds in your garden and then away you go. There's a few things you can do while customers come and go, including clicking people to urge them to visit the shop, watering your plants, clicking birds and tumble weeds to get random drops of bits of gold, getting quests from NPC's in whic you supply and item and they later return with some great rewards. You can also train to level up your character, craft items to sell or equip and buy supplies from the merchant.The second major gameplay area are in the dungeons. The character moves along attacking themselves, but the player has a pretty interesting job. As enemies die they drop items which you must quickly slot into your bag. There's a ton of different bags with unique shapes and unique features (certain tiles that warp an item to your shop or sell an item directly etc). It's almost like tetris in terms of trying to fit as many items as you can in. You also need to keep an eye on your character's health and use potions when you need to. Different dungeons have different quirks such as some where items placed in your bad will fall to the bottom ala tetris, while others may have obstacles such as rain falling on random bag tiles making you work around them until they disappear.Sure the game may sound simple but it certainly has that old-school addictive feel. The multiple parts of the game with completely different play styles keeps things interesting and there seems to be more and more that unlock over time. I've recently unlocked the ability to buy another shop on an island as well as take NPC's to a park to raise their relationship level and get some extra rewards. I'm always looking forward to see what features will unlock next!The developer listens to the community and makes changes and additions based on feedback which is always a huge plus. They even have a survey for new features built into the game i nthe form of an NPC who occasionally will ask which feature you would prefer from a couple of selections. A unique and interesting way of voting for new features and I love it!Can't wait to play more of this and to see wha tthe future holds."
,Recommended,603940,33803465,Posted: 26 July,all,Kepz,"Cute, funny, varied and addicting!There’s a lot going on in Pixel Shopkeeper, in fact, you’ll probably be a lot busier running a shop than you’d be if you were just adventuring all the time.And unlike most fantasy games, the evil forces in Pixel Shopkeeper are truly evil, with their legends being based in reality. I speak, of course, of the dreaded student loan debt.And just like real life, if you miss a payment for your student loan, you die and have to restart back to when you graduated.But that’s okay, cause it’s pretty fun running a shop, gathering all the ingredients, and doing everything you can to milk those adventures of all their gold.The developers seem very dedicated to working on the game after release, and the game even includes a survey taking NPC who comes by the shop every now and then and gives you a multiple-choice question on what new features you’d like to see in the game.Balancing your loot-gathering skills, and how well you run your shop can be challenging at times, and just one missed payment means starting over, but all in all it's a fun experience, and one I recommend."

But wait; don't stop reading.I think it's important to note; I don't find it very similar to Recettear, and I'm not quite sure why that's where everyone goes. The only thing it has in common is that it's an item shop game, as in you collect items to sell in your shop, and you have to pay off a loan -- but that's the only similarity. That could be said for a lot of games, from some Harvest Moon titles, to some expansions on the Sims. That doesn't mean this is a bad game, obviously.Pixel Shopkeeper is very cute, and endearing. Definitely scratched my money-management itch, that I'm sure everyone here is familiar with. While I'm a little put off my it's repetition (and grating music), I see how often the game is updated, and I'm very excited to play it again when they've added more to it.To me; this is more like 'You Must Build a Boat'. If you haven't heard of it; it's a pixel-style passive dungeoning game, where you don't control your character in combat, but you play a minigame to move it along, then you sell items you've collected for gold, and use that gold to upgrade yourself, and your boat to forward the game. How is this similar to Pixel Shopkeeper?Let me just copy/paste what I just said, with a few choice word changes;  it's a pixel-style passive dungeoning game, where you don't control your character in combat, but you play a minigame to collect items, then you sell items you've collected for gold, and use that gold to upgrade yourself, and your shop to forward the game.If you're thinking about buying this game because people say it's like Recettear, I can't recommend it to you. Recettear has very satisfying combat, interesting characters, an RPG element, a lot of re-playability, better sound, less repetition, and fun controls.However, if you're thinking about buying this game because you like shopkeeping games, enjoy money management, cute pixel graphics, challenging goals, collect-athons, crafting and general mind-numbing repetition; I can absolutely recommend it to you. It's fun, and I don't regret buying it."

The humor is great and the sound of coins overflowing into your purse is pure bliss!If you like making money this is the game for you.If you like gamer jokes this is the game for you.If you like running dungeons for that dank loot this is the game for you.If you don't like spending over 10 dollars for a great time this is the game for you.If you like puzzel games such as Tetris this is the game for you.The only things I really didn't like about this game is the fact that popups block off your hotbar, which can get really annoying because they love to spam 20+ one after another. I'd lay money that the dev's are going to fix that soon enough though. Only other thing is that the music can get really annoying after a while...

But it really grew on me due to the different types of bags to store items in and the special blocks in those bags.  Bigger isn't always better when it comes to items, except when you need gear!Managing the shop was a lot of fun.  Picking the decorations, picking the items to sell, etc.  It was all great fun.There is a lot of clicking, but not as bad as cookie clicker or other games like it.  Mostly you click on NPCs and your tables to keep them clean, but that's it.  As someone with old hands that hurt, it didn't aggravate my hands at all.The loan concept is great.  It keeps you pushing forward, but not too hard.  I had to figure out if I wanted to get more items, level myself up, or spend money on my shop.  It was a good balance I had to manage.  Though, I found once I was done with the loan part of the game it fizzled for me.  There is a story afterwards, but I didn't feel as motivated.A few negatives - you can't delete save games, it seems.  But you can overwrite them.  There are some minor bugs, but not enough to detract from the gameplay.Oh, and the dialog is great.  From the main character to the NPCs.  It's basic, but in some ways better than more expensive games I have played.However, these games are so few and far between, and I consider this one to be a gem and completely worth the price.  I enjoyed the time I spent in it and see myself going back once the game has even more added to it.  I completely recommend it!Edit:  I tried going back after completing the loan part of the storyline, and just couldn't get into it.  It felt like a grindfest instead of a face paced and natural progression, which did take the fun out of it.  However, I still strongly recommend it, as the price is really worth the entertainment it will provide."

I enjoy shop management and puzzles, but the ""success or die"" idea - either you succeed or start from the beginning again - rankled me.I originally wanted a refund on this game because I found it frustrating that I'd do all this progress and then get a ""GAME OVER"" and being unable to figure out what I did wrong. Did I not train enough? Upgrade tables? Buy too many or not enough buffing items? Worse is despite using the various save states I couldn't figure out how far back to reset so I ended up starting all over again, feeling like I'd wasted time.I wish there was a soft reset like Recettear's ""start at the beginning with all your items"" to help me learn what to do (and it doesn't feel like I wasted my time). At the moment I'm too anxious to experiment with different recipes, tables, etc. because by the time I scrounge up the money I have to spend it all on the debt - then I need to frantically throw things back on the shelves to make up the difference.There's now a sandbox/easy mode that erases the payment system, so I guess that alleviates my main concern and allows me to enjoy the game at my own pace.

The pixel aesthetic is amusing as well.I'm optimistic about the future of this game because the mechanics are good, but it could use more content.

After buying it, I was playing it non stop for 10 hour. It has a very good gameplay whereby the difficulty is achievable in a consistent manner. You yourself being well planned in decoration awards you greatly. In any good game, this game truely shows that every click you make makes a different in the quest of paying of your debt. It is time base in both fighting and selling your item/weapon/armor. Don't get turn off by the picture, it is a lie. This is definitely a good game.Game type = selling stuff rpg game."

Charming and witty throughout with the help of some playful writing and music. It might be a bit overwhelming at first but once you settle into the rhythm of the game, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the new types of dungeons, loot bags and ways to run your shop the game offers.I wish some things were paced out a little more slowly, and there's a few bugs here and there but I want to keep playing it regardless.  There's something special here!"

Difficulty spikes may be a little too high because you have to spend some time selling, making friends and building your shop if you want to get to the next levels.Would love to see more such games"
,Recommended,603940,33854840,Posted: 28 July,all,Dan ^__^,"I don't know why people think it's hard. i've played once and played about 3 hours before losing and on the 2nd try i've aced the challenge easily. yes you do not have enough money at the beginning to buy everything, yes there is a bit of strategie involved. But i have never played another shopkeeper game and being able to do it on the 2nd go for me seems to be simple enough. Especially now with the easymode, it's something everyone can pick up and eventually have everything.This game may not look like much at first, but it's addicting and i love the way you do the dungeons and puzzle your loot into the enventory.The shop mode is actually pretty hard, if you try to click everything you can click in time and make the most money on each day, but it's not required to beat it to be super fast.A bit of spoilers on how to get through this game for the rest of this text to help people out a bit:If you have trouble getting through the challenge, you might want to try leveling your hero more quickly (and use items while leveling) and going into better dungeons to get better items and buy a better bag quickly. since the starters are both not good enough to get you through the game. after you've got that, you're going to pick 1-3 few crafting recipes and get your shop bigger whenever you can afford it (+ decorations and upgraded tables etc.)the rest you have to do is simply adjusting the prices, i feel like going a little higher has no impact on the salaries, until the the message appears that your customers might think it's 2 expensive.if you do all that, you should be able to beat the game with different selling strategies."

,Recommended,603940,33728746,Posted: 22 July,all,KingsLoMein,"Having fun playing this game. Only about 8-10 hours in. But Since it was less than 7$ I feel i've already gotten my moneys worth.There is enough variety and purchase options, to keep me interested. I feel like the money i get, is never enough. I have to make the decisions to spend money very carefully.  My first game I had a bad week, wasn't able to upgrade anything in my shop, barely made my deadline for the loan payment. Because of that I wasn't able to make next weeks higher payment.  Makes you think. There are no down times. Even the shopping phase, has you clicking constanntly."

I'm all for the dungeon crawling-fit as many things in your inventory as you can part. The selling part however...everyone moves SO SLOW and you have to polish your tables which just means while they're moving slow you repeatedly click the tables...and I hated that so much I returned it.
,Recommended,603940,33707107,Posted: 21 July,all,mmBOP,It's addicting with good writing. I died a couple times in the beginning but I think I get the hang of how to balance upgrades versus payments.

,Recommended,603940,33727379,Posted: 22 July,all,DevilMire HellsBane,"I can see this game has a lot of potential. What I would like to see is maybe a hiring system. This is a shopkeeping tycoon with dungeons. So as such, I figure maybe either hire someone to man the store for a day while you adventure, selling items you set up while getting more for the day. It would help automate the process like a real shop would. And when I click the balance book, it says something about how many shops you have. Which means having a hiring system open would be a high reconmendation as the more shops you have, the more profit you bring in, and the more goods they are gonna need. Another thing that could work is hiring some customers to go adventure either for or with you to double or even triple what you get, or have them go to other areas so you can get items from differnt dungeons at once. On top of that, I could see potential to have different shop areas, each having a higher set of customer bases than others. Like one could be in the mountains and have more ninjas while one more on the islands has more bards. What would also be interesting on top of that is having a sort of luck system, and pay 5-10 gold to find your fortune for the day. high fortune means more valuble items are found, where low fortune is just junk or herbs. And from seeing what the herbs do and that there is potions, I am thinking maybe have a potionmaker to use those herbs for a price to make great potions that could be sold. Another mechanic that would help in this game is some sort of investment system. Something to use excess cash you think could help expand though risk/reward. If any of this was already in consideration, I am glad we got a lot there. However, if I said anything that may have slipped the devs mind, I am glad to help and bring up extra ideas. Overall, I would recommend the game based on it's simlistic puzzle/salesman mechanics. But adding more, I would definitely buy a few moer to give out because of how fun it is."

You can tell this game was made with passion based on other wonderful shop management games we dont get often enough.- its graphics are defintely fitting for the subject matter of the game.
