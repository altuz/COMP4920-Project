People that camp spawn points, cheat with increased speed, trash talkers, and people that non stop accuse very good players for cheating. I find that these are common enough that you will run in to some of them, but for the most part the majority of the community is friendly. The discord is very active and the creators are very involved. The game is fun as hell, the creators are invested and hard at work on completing it, and the community is not very toxic for a 1st person shooter all in all its worth 10$ easy and its got a bright future."

While it's currently rough around the edges, there's still plenty of fun to be had. The shooting is fast-paced, the puns are great, and the creator is creating the game beneath your feet. You can even pop into his Twitch stream every once in awhile and he is very receptive to player feedback and suggestions, taking almost any terrible farm pun you throw at him. Stick with this one. I have a feeling it will be worth it. Sniperagus/10"
76561198105425700,Recommended,604240,32113028,Posted: 1 June,all,Flintsteel7,"This game has fast-paced play and brings some interesting ideas to the FPS genre. You don't reload you weapon, you ""harvest"" a new one from the plants that grow up where the bullets that have been shot hit the ground! There are several types of weapons in addition to the corn-based shotgun, such as a ""Peastol"" pistol, and asparagus-based sniper rife, and the powerful ""Carrocket Launcher"" which will blow your opponents away... if you can hit them. There are also melee weapons: a standard-issue shovel, and an axe. The controls and weapons feel great, and the game's art is quite fun. Several game modes and maps add good variety to the gameplay. Since this is an early access title, and the game is still being worked on, you can expect more content to be released and bug fixes to be steady, but the game is already a winner in its current state. I highly recommend giving this game a go, even if you've never played an FPS before."

The game has beautiful graphics which keep you drawn into it and the music keeps the action alive, not to mention the music which plays during the final seconds of each match that get your palms sweaty.  During the hour I played so far i encountered various different game modes which i thought were very thought out and personally I think having a game where the developers show this kind of commitment to it is another draw because it just shows that they are willing to improve and add onto the game and not just drop it like so many other games i've played before have been.

I guess it's either fanboys (so early though?), kids or the subscribers from the channels of those youtubers telling them that anything they play is fun. But whatever, let's get back to that review here.________________________________________Nuh-uhn, gonna refund for now.Game is too simplistic and poor-executed, and the content is unexistent at the moment. It feels like a free flash-game, but you actually need to pay money in order to play it.The ""Missed Shots leave ammo packs"" mechanic is not really fun once you figure out that you can just grow a whole farm of ammo behind your back while camping somewhere in the corner of the map.Graphics are extremely mediorce as well as the sounds. Nothing of an eye-catcher.Also, nobody plays this game. The only populated (2 players) server I've found was located in East US and the ping is high for me on it, as well as for other people. And that leads to laggers scoring most of the kills. You can even see them because they tend to just teleport around.This game is a very long road to go through for it to become something special or even playable. Don't buy it right now."

Gameplay is fun and refreshing and the concept puts a new spin on the FPS genre. The developer is a super fun guy and he has been streaming the production of this game on Twitch since day one.

The problem sets in with high ping, lack of options when setting up a game (I'd love the option to limit amount and which weapons can spawn) to make it more fun (rockets only/shovels only) or skill based (shotgun/snipers). The game does have a solid foundation so I hope they add more."

,Not Recommended,604240,35481598,Posted: 4 October,all,Fileepaa,"There are a lot of good things about this game, so I'll talk about those first. The concept is inginuitive and fun,  music is good,   (although it's really just one song on loop the whole time), the weapons all feel different and are very imaginitive and there's plenty of game modes. Now the issues. I gave this game a negative review not because I feel the concept is bad, but simply because it does not come with enough content to justify even a  $10 price tag. Although there are 4 or 5 different game modes and maps, they all feel rather similar and repetitive. Add that to the fact that the servers are ALWAYS EMPTY. This is not an exageration. Normally the only region with a servor even running is the eastern U.S. servor, and that normally has one or two people and the rest filled with bots. For a game based on online PvP, the is not a good sign. Also there's just general bugs and lag, such as when you shoot someone and then they die a second later instead of right after you shot them. This game is a great concept! It just needs more content (like more guns) and a bigger community. I very well may change my review in the future if these needs are met."

The game idea is interesting to where the bullets grow the guns with more content coming soon.(hopefully) I find the best part is the community of the game. You can join a server and be pitted against someone else in a 1 vs 1 showdown with other teammates watch you die! There are some cons to the game though. 1. You can shoot the shotgun some long♥♥♥♥♥distances and kill someone. 2. Some bullets even in close range. Aren't 1 hit kill.Well that's all I really got to say.

,Recommended,604240,33294490,Posted: 5 July,all,GiClan | Nico,"Pros- This game is enjoyable, and fun to play with friends. But taking it too seriously might end you with a broken keyboard.- The game's graphics are not GPU-intensive in the slightest.- You can host private matches exclusively for you and your friends.- There's a great variety of gamemodes, all of which are fun.- The game's not hard to play, but beware of tryhards.- There's absolutely no fall damage, so feel free to try and hit some nutty shots.- The weapons you get to use remind me of the classes from TF2.Cons- Very little public servers to choose from.- Hit registration varies from flawless to terrible.- Aiming down sights is a little wonky on most weapons.- The shotgun's range needs to be lowered.Final Rating84 out of 100."

Shotgun Farmers, a fmily friendly romp where bullets are seeds that grow your weaponry, and your farmer characters look like mii knock-offs. Throw in a leveling system and personalizztion ability, as well as a sevwere lack of music or even background ambience to fill the dead air.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zQxBrYf608&feature=youtu.beThe controls are pretty good, but unless you're playing deatch match, the expansuve level designs leave you hunting around blindly for foes more time than actually in combat. Team deathmatch actually wound up feeling empty and incredibly boring due to this. Hopefully the developers add a little more to the game, or additional levels that are a bit more cramped to speed things along.This isn't really an engrossing experience alone. Unless you go in with some friends, this is pretty boring. Shotgun Farmers has a small player base from what I Saw, so I don't really epect the on-line community to really last long. I also didn't hear a single person talking the whole game. While this can normally be a bit detrimental, flogging players with insults about their skill, sexuality, or how promiscuious his/her mother is, it would have been nice to kill the empty audio that makes up much of each match.In its current state, I can't say this is worth the full ticket price for entry."

Both hit detection and general game lag is pretty bad, I can have people completely disappear and teleport in front of me and having my shots not register at all with the shotgun at point blank. Also the idea of picking up someone else's weapon when they miss you doesn't come into play all that often because looking down where they missed and picking up a weapon is not the best thing to do when someone is chasing you down.Also some gripes about the settings:There is no anti aliasing optionThere isn't separate sliders for general mouse sensitivity and ads sensitivity"

This game is unbalanced as hell. The laggier you are the better you are. The games are lopsided as they dont balance out the teams. Whatever team you were on when the match ends is the one that you end up on next game. Usually a 3v1. Stupid game. All the good reviews are probably paid or made by the owner himself. Theres literally only one server and its in US East. Some of ya'll might be thinking ""Oh then thats fine because i live in the east coast"". NO DO NOT BUY THIS STUPID GAME. Only one server means that all the foreigjners who have this game flood into the US East server and lag kill you. Cant hit em because theyre teleporting everywhere. Id rather waste my 10 dollars throwing it into the ocean and pretending that King Neptune will find it. Seriously waste of money. Pending for a refund right now."

You can only type in this game.The devs need to slash the price, add some new games and maps, and then move on to another game. This game isn't going to go anywhere and its pretty seamless as it is.
