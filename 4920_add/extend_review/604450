,Recommended,604450,30449882,Posted: 11 March,all,Notakas,"I just played this game. It lasts for about 1 hour. Don't judge it by its price. The game consists on several stories about different people and walks us through their lives and minds.The stories are interesting, deep and easy to follow, the narrative is pretty good as well, the soundtrack is beautiful and fits quite well, the gameplay is simple except for some interesting minigames it has and you can tell that the developers have put big thought and effort on making this game.I won't give it a score because I feel that number would depend a lot on who is playing it but personally I have really liked it and I hope it gets popular; I'd love to see more games from this studio in the future."

This is not a adventure type game.Pro:The story is nice.The music of choice is great.The art style is fitting (but not great)over all worth its priceCons:.....TOO short...the game limmits your imaginationEnglish translation seems a bit off.

I hope you like it and I hoped that I described it well for you to purchase this game or not :P. If it isn't helpfulI want to apologise in advance. Sorry Q_Q. Anyways, This review will be split into three different sectionsSections of this review1. Introduction of this game2. Pros and Cons of this game3. Final Thoughts on the gameIntroduction of this gameA narrative game that revolves around you (the player of course :D) being inside the minds of different people that have different occupations. Exp:Game Designer, Progammer and Art designer.All of whom were part of the process in developing this game. (That is so COOLLLLLL >_<) You will start to learn about the hardships and experiences these people have in their life. Be it crushed dreams or thoughts. It shows how hard life can be for everyone and that these people's life can be relatableto your life experieces too (I know that this sounds boring but trust me it isn't as boring as you think <3)Pros and Cons of this gamePros:Amazing Story telling and narrative - The voice actor was well doned and fitting for the narrative, a smoothing and calm voice that soothes the mind. A story telling so well done that it makes this game seem so relatable to us, by reminding us that we are never alone in this world with wierd thoughts :3.Music - Calm and peaceful, just like the story that they are trying to tell us.Cheap - Of course another good reason to buy this game, since a lot of people can't afford triple AAA games like me :( and want to get something affordablelike these. I mean it is $2.50 :D (atleast for my currency :P)Cons:Major Lack of gameplay - Sadly not every game can be perfect, but to be fair it is $2.50. I mean I can't argue with that. This game has not much gameplay apart of thestandard point and click and ocassionally a much more complex game like atower defence.Lack of replayablilty - if you played it once, you would most likely never play it again, because you have already heard the story. The story wouldn't be as relatable as the first time you heard it. Combined with the lackof gameplay, you would also be bored since you already know what is gonna happen. :(Too Short - I be honest with you, I completed this game in 1 hour and a half. which is really short for a narrative game like this if you compared it with life is strange. But like I said it is not expensive so don't expect muchFinal ThoughtsPersonally I think that this game's rating or so called 'fun' is depended on each invidual. If you like games with more action and gameplay. This game is most likely not for you. But if you are looking forward to a more story based gamethen this game might be right for you and even if you looking for a good story. This might not relate to you giving you a much worst experience of this game. Personally , when I played it, this game didn't really relate to me that much as I neverhad these kinds of thoughts :P. Overall I give this game a 5/10 since its major lack of gameplay is covered up by the story. I didn't placed graphics as one of the pros and cons. Since it is dependent on individuals. (I thought they looked kawaii as Hell <33333333)This is a personal opinion, so plz don't hate on me :(. Thanks of your attention :DDDDDDDD"

,Recommended,604450,30454955,Posted: 11 March,all,NoBrakesGames,"If you like games like The Stanley Parable or Beginner's Guide you will like this game. Another Adventure is really funny but pretty sad at the same time. I completed it in an hour, and it is definitely an hour well worth the price."
,Not Recommended,604450,32573287,Posted: 19 June,all,Beauwight,"It is a good game experience, and well done, too. It has an excellent mix of movie and interactive elements that helped keep me invested in the game. I applaud the work that went into the game. It's good value for the money as well, if that's a concern for you. While the English subtitles don't always match the voice lines, it's not a big deal--even if I did cringe at the pronunciation of ""melancholy"".I really hate to not recommend it. So why did I hit the no button? At the risk of a **SPOILER**:After one playthrough, I'm utterly depressed. I'm admittedly like that most of the time, but still. I know that there's more in the game to go back for, but I don't think I could take the soul crushing. If you're predisposed to depression, this might not be great for you."

,Recommended,604450,33379003,Posted: 8 July,all,Devil、神鬼莫測,"Presumably, you guys don’t know the developer of this game. His name is THANKCREATE, born on November 1990. This game is his personal experience. Four different people represent four stage of his life.His high school life study in Huanggang Middle School, A key high school of China. He would like to be educated in Tsinghua University. However, his result in NCEE is not as ideal. He finally got a ticket to learn in HuaZhong University of Science & Technology-School of Software Engineering.When year2 in University, He was affected by his classmate and decided to join the New team of his university, Team Dian. He worked in a group of international project cooperation. He had totally changed his school life after attended this group. Other than the normal daily activities such as attending lessons, kicking the football, playing games and sleeping, he has to concentrate on project development until late at night, so that he can return back to the dormitory.In year3, he studied in a key class of School of Electronic Information and Communications instead of previous one.He gave up the opportunity of becoming a postgraduate before graduating from undergraduate.When campus recruitment, He sends his resumes to Tencent, Baidu, and Taobao, Tencent and Baidu accept his application. Which one would he choose? He chooses Baidu without hesitation because he thought Tencent is a ‘copycat’ company. And later what he see and hear, his thought with these two company have completely different than before.On October 2012. He resigned from Baidu, he only worked 3 months though.""I can learn something from here but I as an aspiring youth who has just graduated should do something else which is more meaningful.Someone always tries to tell us what we should do or not.When studying, a teacher tells him that you need to read more book. You won't have time to read after work. However, he can still read some book every day.When he before graduating, he has found a survey result. It shows that a programmer who has just graduated can get ￥4000~￥6000 every month.(around 600USD~900USD) However, his salary is more than that.When work, lots of people express their experience that a graduate shouldn't try to start their own business. However, THANKCREAT successes and he don't think it is difficult.He wants to work on gaming in the future.""I was pretty narcissism. I thought that I am a creative game developer. I always ridiculed that I am an artist with my friend before. However, after watching <Indie Game: The Movie>, the oversea developer is a real artist.""He earns lots of money through <Strange Adventure>  though, he thinks this game is a bit odd. Its style is not very good. ""If I can make an indie game like <Super Meat Boy> or <Fez>, I will be contentment.Although THANKCREAT is a programmer, he buys a tablet and starts to learn how to draw by himself. He spends 5 hours every day. He is doing this for a 'more artistic' game.That why Another Adventure appears in our sight."

For what its worth, its has simple stories with a deep thought process. Making choices, you don't seem to be fond of.

The narative and the story touched me deeply as I can actually relate the characters point of view with mine. ""OMG, that is so me!"". There is just something really beautiful and sad in this wonderfully-written story.Anyhow, the music in this game are great and the art style is unique. The minigames are also quite challenging and offers interactivity to the story (I got 50 points in the Non Stop Motocross minigame in Kevin's story. How many points did you got?). The only downside is that this game is only about 1 hour long, but who cares about playtime?I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys games with minimal gameplay but story-rich. After all, this is just another adventure, right?9/10Java is better."

My opinion is: save your money for another product you feel more interested and save your life once you feel bored if you had decided to have a try,There are hundreds of ideas on what a game is and what a game should be. I have read an article referring this product as 'a poem of self expression'. If so, the question would changed to 'what a poem is' and 'FOR WHICH the self-expression is' (so what).These are my concerns if we don't follow a traditional viewpoint of video game. And, I can hardly share any resonance coming from those 'thump ups' under this product. Or to be honest, I dislike the feeling evaporated from such resonance. The only reason for me to write this comment rather than to simply leave it alone is: Many positive ideas echoing here, and this may imply the need for a sound representive of people to speak out.Now, let me consider this as a game, then there are two points I believe should be developed more: the narrative and the gameplay (more precisely, the interaction).Obviously, the flow of a story should be smooth so that audiences can dive into the virtual world. It should be the reason why many people replying positively that most of them find themselves somewhere during playing. However, this game doesn't keep the pace with its story due to the fact that the narrator here is a combination based on speech (instead of text-reading) and interwoven with interaction with players.In other words, the interaction doesn't work well to enhance the story-telling, this product could be published as:a visual novel or galgame with moe moe paintings, ora sound book without any pics and interaction, ora click-game (not a puzzle one) as mentioned in the game description.So what's the necessarity for putting these media together if they don't improve the final experience? The only answer I could find is:to make THEIR daily life recur. That's the reason why someone said it is a game which the people who like it would like it so deep while the other might not dislike it any more.

The developer has his own understanding. I appreciate his unique thoughts and his spirit to maintain his  own style in his several games. Mainwhile, the writer obviously has his own life experience which is integrated in this game. The game could be better if it was more chanllenging. The lack of interaction with the player becomes the biggeest weakness of this game. In some parts of the game, the developer can add more parts to make it fun.It should be marked that the voice over in this game is really NICE!Overall: 7 out of 10!"

Most of the nerrative feels very bland and it relies on the music to make anything emotional. This isn't a game; there is no game aspect to this.

The game consists on several stories about different people and walks us through their lives and minds.The stories are interesting, deep and easy to follow, the narrative is pretty good as well, the soundtrack is beautiful and fits quite well, the gameplay is simple except for some interesting minigames it has and you can tell that the developers have put big thought and effort on making this game. ''Just another stupid adventure game.''10/10"
