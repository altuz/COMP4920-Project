Sidescroller with one button required which is jump, collect bottles and jump over bears. Nothing is required though since this game gives you achievements from jumping and that's it, there's no options for anything, menu is literally ""play"" and ""exit"".This could be made in to a mediocre sidescroller for sure, just like any other similar game but I doubt it will happen, just another one of these games that sell solely because of high amount of achievements, that's it. Game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ but people are giving it good reviews because of the achievements, highest amount in any steam game as of today, which is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing sad.The time you are spending to add each and every achievement could be spent in to making the game actually decent atleast."
,Not Recommended,604490,32136303,Posted: 2 June,all,XJ9,"Complete garbage as it is, at the same time you can't blame the developer for ALL the flaws of this game:-1st of all I have to mention that game-wise this game is a complete trash, as it states it in the early access state, but it close to impossible to imagine this game as anything playable in the future because it's the most basic runner you can make with the Unity engine. 3Fps animation and bunch of static models flipped onto each other, buggy collisions and no actual gameplay with garbage level design on top.-It claims that you will face Russian stereotypes, but all you have is paint drawn Slavic guy, a bear and bottles put into heaven, hell or the forest locations, nothing Russian here except slav picking up vodka bottles.+- There are 4100 achievements, ONLY 25 (twenty-five) of them are actual achievements where you have to do some kind of *work*, while the rest are given for 4075 jumps, why +- - the developer went the ZUP! way and made 4K achievements icons for your profile decoration - I have to admit this is big icons collection BUT here is the problem - since the developer pretend that his game gonna be playable - he made it that way that to unlock those icons you have to spend like 2 days clicking your mouse WHILE at the same time the game is buggy/unplayable boring sh`t. So he cants provide 4000 EASY achievements AND he can't provide enjoyable gameplay. Chasing both things he ends up with the all around bad game.Easiest way you can do the jump 4000 times part is press click->escape>click on restart-> repeat 4000 times-No steam cards as for June 1.+CheapNow going back to why I said that you can't blame the dev for this crаp - Easy games with thousands of easy achievements - is what consumer demands. Demand creates supply - so school-kids pick up unity crap and give you what you want. Can you really blame them? No, blame yourself. This game is already sold like 15000 times and will be sold more to the achievement-hungry people."

NO, YOU WILL NOT BE FREE!!!I REALLY need to stop falling for the same trap.  Cheap game + Tons of achievements.  An unholy grind to get the achievements you desire.  Making matters from bad to worse, the game no longer counts distance towards achievements, but individual bottle pickups...meaning you'll need to pick up over 4000 bottles minimum to 100% this game.Running Through Russiais a runner about a man wearing a wife beater shirt and a Ushanka who runs around, jumps over bears, and drinks voda he picks up.  Running into a bear or falling through a pit in hell lead to instant death.  Black bottles also lead to instant death.  Orange bottles send you to hell, where pits kill you.  White bottles send you to heaven, where pits only send you back to Earth.The graphics are subpar, the gameplay is obnoxious and bugged, the music is monotonous...Given the theme of the game, I'm quickly reminded of my experience ofGO AWAY, THERE'S KUMIS OVER THERE!, which is also a mediocre title focused on alcoholic content.  This is why you don't drink and develop games...unless you're ZUN, who drinks in moderation.Obviously, there was not a lot of planning that went into this title, so there is not much to say about it aside from what I've already said.  Don't fall for the same trap I did.  Though this game is priced at $1 and goes for a discounted price of $0.79 when on sale, I cannot justify the price...even with 4K achievements.  Maybe for $0.10-$0.25, it'd feel worth the price, but I'd rather not relive this game.   Stay away if you're a casual gamer.  It's a pain in the *ss if you're here for the achievements to boost your profile as an achievement hunter.0.5 / 10  I heard the mission bell and I was thinking to myself,  ""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""...turned out, it was Hell while posing as both...."
,Not Recommended,604490,31893377,Posted: 21 May,all,Apoch Weiss | Apochs.net,"Running Though Russia is yet another endless rumner in the slew of mobile/non-mobile entries to the style on Steam. Take control of a Russian man on a quest for vodka as you run through the country. The differences in terrain come from certain colored bottles. A white (can't tell if that or very light blue) ushers in winter, or green ones to venture to what appears to be Hell, all the while avoinding bears and the deep purple bottles that are instant death when consumed.Between poorly hand-drawn graphics and the game's music, Running Through Russia really doesn't offer anything for even the most seasoned of casual gaming veterans, especially if you gotta pay. This is something best left as a free download on mobile stores, or your favorite mini flash game website. Really, the only humorous bit is not the cartoonish racism, but bottles randomly falling over or through holes when transporting to the different terrains, as well as the bears that often stand stuck between ledges.Unless you're an achievement hunter, it's best to avoid this boring title, but even then over thirty of the achievements cannot be unlocked at this time. The content required for them will be included in a later update. It's a tactic I'm seeing appear more and more, and hopefully the developer will follow through with this statement in the discussion page."

The engine of this permanent accelerating endless runner is not only pretty simple and minor challenging but also utterly bad. You can get stuck on edges that you have to restart the game which only helps to fix it. Some jump gaps over bears+abysses are not even doable with doublejumps. Bears fall into holes or vodka bottles flip over while the screen is still loading.You have 3 different kind of level types which change while drinking the right colored vodka bottles - you start in Greenlands and get there also when fallling down from the clouds, clouds (white),  or hell (orange). The purple bottles are poisonous and cause an insta-death like also touching a bear. Your goal is to collect the transparent vodka bottles which slows you down and to run as far as you can. The game lure new players with incredible 4096 (jump) cheevos atm. But it still can be changed literally every day. Because it's hillarious to declare such title as an early access game if there's no sight for any quality changes on the long term. STEAM should introduce an Early Access fee of 1000 USD / game."

Buggy as hell, superficial ""Early Access"" title added so the developer doesn't get reamed for such a horrible mess of a game.It's amazing how often you can fall through platforms, come across unavoidable deaths (the black insta-death bottle being too close to a bear so you cannot jump over both), and the no reg clicks leading to your death.Apparently this game was easier to farm achievements on with a clicking script, but the developer decided to patch the game forcing you to actually play this mess for the achievements (and I presume to get trading cards for the game, since Valve is actually trying to combat ~faux~ games now). I wouldn't have a problem with this, if they game were actually good/was decently playable.There are better low effect, moar achievement games out there, like Zup and Oik, which are actually somewhat fun to play."

That's it.  In a nutshell.  It gets faster and faster as you go.Is it a particularly good game?  No.Does it have over 4k of achievements?  Yes.Do you need 4k of useless filler achievements?  Yes?  Then this game is for you.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the achievements that pop, so just giver and maybe in a couple hours you'll have them all.Otherwise, save your .87 cents or whatever it costs in your region, go out and run.  Maybe you'll come across a couple bottles of Vodka kicking about, maybe you'll run into a bear.  Don't try to jump it, bad idea."

,Recommended,604490,31917698,Posted: 23 May,all,Xolara,"This game is recommended for people who are wanting to get over 4k achievements without effort. The game is buggy and glitchy but that's to be expected since this game is in Early Access. While there is not much to do in this game other than jump over bears and wine bottles (purple bottles but I call them wine bottles)I honestly do think this game is a money grab for people who are wanting as much achievements as possible. Cheap product for a shi‏t ton of achievements that are easily obtainable. Something an achievement hunter would orga‏sm over, however this game does have its funny moments. At first when you play and see all the achievements unlock there's a chance you'll laugh your as‏s off like I did. As time goes on the bears and wine bottles will start to pis‏s you off. What is also funny and makes you go ha-ha is when you get the white bottle that takes you to heaven, there's a chance you'll see a bear fall off which is amazing to see.So, moral of the story..If you want easy achievements for your profile: Get the gameIf you're someone whos trying to get a shi‏t ton of games: Get the gameIf you're a serious gamer whos trying to find a new game to play: Don't Get the gameIf you got the game for free from a friend or promotion: Get your achievements then decide if you like the game or not.My thoughts: I honestly liked it. Not for the achievements but for the laughs and times it pi‏ssed me off. I can't say you'll like it as much as I did, I'm not fully liking this game. but it's fun to play on your spare time."
,Recommended,604490,31942844,Posted: 24 May,all,FatBatMan,"Before you read this, please understand that I am a 28 year old working adult. I have never said the words ""lulz, check theez dank memes"" and nowadays I mainly giggle at tax related puns. Bear that in mind when you read this...This is the most I have laughed at a game in ages, probably since the early days of Newgrounds.Well, what's this game about?It's a 2D runner type game. You try see how far you can get without dying and picking up the alcohol bottles.How do you die?Either by drinking the Death Bottle, falling through Hell, or landing on the Bear.And that's the first thing that gets me - see, you're told it's a bear. But it isn't. It's part bear, part buffalo. A Bearfalo, if you will.I giggle everytime I see that sad, confused animal. Sometimes, if the Bearfalo is positioned right, when you touch a Sky Bottle (which transforms the stage into one in the clouds) it'll fall through a hole in the clouds, waggling it's sad, pathetic legs in a doomed attempt to get back up.And then there are the bottles - there are 4 in total. One kills you, one is for achievements/collecting, one transforms the stage into Hell, the last one transforms into the Sky. And they spawn randomly. Anywhere. This can be annoying - your jumps are all the same height - so dodging the Bearfalo means not being able to dodge the Death Bottle behind it. Or, falling from the clouds and landing on a Hell Bottle and immediately falling through the floor.Sometimes, though, sometimes they spawninour cross-bred buddy. Or on it's silly face, and go rolling away...it probably drinks them to forget about its worries and its strife (yea, man!)And the bugs...so so many bugs! The small platforms aren't actually platforms and you'll fall through. At least 10% of the time I'll jump and get stuck on a ledge, flailing my arms around and pelvic-thrusting like it's going out of fashion.If you land juuust in front of the bear's horns it'll headbutt you backwards 3 screenlengths to your death.The achievements. Oh boy. This is where I've been giggling the most.See, the dev decided to add 4000+ cheevos to this game - one for every time you jumped. People responded by making auto-clickers and wrapping them up in a few minutes.""Oh no,"" says the dev, ""not in my game!""And now they got changed so that every cheevo bottle will award one - because the dev wants you to play their game, see?But now you can't - the whole point of a 2D runner game is to be able to see what's coming and time your jumps. You can't do that if you have achievement boxes constantly popping up and blocking your view, can you?Honestly - don't get this game because it's good.Get it to laugh at that stupid Bearfalo's face.Get it to laugh at the devs brilliant achievement plan.Get it to try figure out how, or why, it's Russia.EDITThe dev has locked some achievements, and is very involved in the community and discussions.It's a good sign, and maybe might be another reason to give this a shot.EDIT 2The new achievements were added - they removed a bunch (which will have an effect on stat-tracking sites; something that was explained to the dev, who didn't care) and added a new ""Speed up"" bottle which has the effect of making the Hell levels virtually impossible. You now need to avoid 2 bottles and a Buffalo...Still recommend this game for the same reason I have a picture of me when I was 10 - we need to remember the mistakes of our past so we don't do them again. It's painful, but has to be done."

,Not Recommended,604490,31914562,Posted: 23 May,all,DKBJOLER,"76 minutes for 4000 achievementsthat is about 30 minutes of playing and the rest is automated, The general priciple is fine its an endless runner that hand you an achievement for jumping... maybe like 4000 achievements for jumping...So the game is in theory fine, its a fine gag for a 1 time off. This is DLC Quest just not as fleshed out. if the game was more fleshed out like DLC Quest was it would make the game a statement instead of an achievement farm"
,Recommended,604490,32055519,Posted: 29 May,all,Freethesquirls,"so i downloaded this a few days ago, and it is amaizing. a little buggy, but hey, its early acess, and the devs are stil working on it. Ive ad more fun playing this than some of the recent AAA full releases that ive spent $60 on in the last year or so. I think this game has a lot of potential to be really fun and cool. plus its deffinatly challenging, which is hard to achieve with out becoming infuriating in a game like this. 10/10 will play again"

The bears look like deer. I have a 50% chance of falling through the platforms on the board.  It's a pretty s**t game.But you know what?  It was $.80 cents, and I've gotten 404 achievements in 30 minutes. I mean... c'mon. What else are you going to spend $.80 on? You could probably make that much selling those trading cards in your inventory.If you're an achievement hunter, such as myself, it's a fun, mindless way to pass time and fluff your achievement count on Steam.  If you don't give a crap about achievements, look somewhere else.  You're definitely not going to be satisfied by this riveting gameplay."

Played for 4 minutes, got 267 achivements. Speaks tomes about what the video game industry has come to. And along with DLC quest it's the best satire on the topic I've encountered in recent memory.

Let's be honest, everyone only bought it for the achievements, there's too many and they're too easy to get.Just another crappy mobile game on the Steam store. If you want the achievements so badly I'd just wait for this garbage to go on sale, or try and find free keys anywhere if that exists out there somewhere.While the developers are working on this game, it just feels like another pointless side-scroller money-grab. At least the ZUP series is very enjoyable and relaxing to play for free achievements."

The game's rules are simple, drink vodka. BUT, one must avoid the black vodka, as it kills you. You must avoid those AND the angry bears that roam in heaven, earth, and hell.You start out in the earth stage. If one were to fall into a whole on the earth stage, one would then be transported to the hell stage. But instead of falling into another stage, one would find their death. But if one were to drink the orange vodka, then one would be transported to hell. Then the question is posed, how does one go to heaven? Easy, drink the white vodka. Its magical powers can transcend one to heaven. If one were to fall in a hole there, one would then be on earth again. One can find all kinds of vodka in all of the stages.In conclusion, this game is about deep stratagy. Deciding which vodka to drink and which ones to skip to choose the most ideal path whilst avoid the angry Russian menace-- the bear. Good luck, comrade.BEST 99 CENTS OF MY LIFE ♥♥♥♥♥!!

The achievements keep popping up on your screen, preventing you from seeing the bear that you're about to run into.If you buy this game, you are buying a turd. However, some people love crappy games. They're the stuff of legend in some circles. This game is so bad that it's good. When you buy it, understand that this is probably one of the worst side scrollers you'll actually pay money for.I'm going to recommend the game because it's so bad that it is good.

The story is intriguing, with unexpected turns and jumps, main protagonist is well rounded, graphics exist and work on potatoes, and the game has a large modding community under the arctic ice cap, but good news is that is starting to melt.  Best 1$ spent, hours and hours of content, i will make some LPs and also twitch streams. I got Shadow of Mordor for 4$, this games is much better."
