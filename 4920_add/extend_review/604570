,Not Recommended,604570,33232766,Posted: 4 July,all,Paradise Destructor,Achievement-Spam.+everyone can make such a game in about 5 minutes. I've made such things in Construct 2 while I was practicing it.

And the horrible part, is a achievement game that you can't complete because have 3 last achievement broken! Thanks Steam for sponsoring this high quality games."
,Not Recommended,604570,32115985,Posted: 1 June,all,WWWIII,"Tastes like a partially finished undergrad project; not worth $2. If you get this for near free with a coupon, it might be worth it for a laugh.If the developer actually reads this, I suggest two things:1. Have the game keep track of high scores.2. Make the reticle larger; it's nearly impossible to keep track of with everything going on."

,Not Recommended,604570,33252424,Posted: 4 July,all,Blade,"You know, I was going to say that this is the worst game on Steam, but then I remembered the other games this developer made. And I cried.This is an Asteroids clone with absolutely nothing else going on. One screen, five or six sprites, and Wave/Lives text that overlaps in the right corner. Nothing else. But because it's so simple, it's actually the best game (gameplay-wise) that the developer has released to date.What BREAKS this game is that the achievements only seem to pop WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING. So you have to be in-game, on that one screen, for achievements to unlock. There's no place to idle since there's no place to hide, unlike the others. This makes it the worst and longest awful achievement grab game to play."
,Not Recommended,604570,34207395,Posted: 12 August,all,ToiletROCK,"How did this game even make it onto Steam? This can't even be considered a game; it is nothing more than an achievement spam. And seriously, for that price too? You must be pulling all our legs.When you run the game, you get greeted by a rather sad-looking main menu with only three options: New game, Score and Exit. New game starts a session where you basically fly around in your small spaceship, dodge enemy fire and shoot baddies. That's it. No plot, no story, no tutorial. Nothing. Score brings you up to another menu where you can see just how many people basically cheated their way into the hiscores so don't bother. And why would you even want to actually play this game for what it is? It's essentially souless, repetitive and it's not even fun at all, at most for the first 5 minutes.Then, you have your 6,200+ achievements. How do you get them? You basically press New game and then press Esc. Do it for 6,200+ times and you'll get most of them. Yes, you won't get all of them. Why? Because some of the achievements are broken and there's no way you can achieve them. Unless the developer intends to fix that (last update from them was 1 July), you'll never be getting that 100%."
,Not Recommended,604570,34954999,Posted: 14 September,all,Tezlakipuka,Game froze every few minutes and had to be restarted from Steam.Forces you to use AutoHotKey / etc. if you don't want to spend hours on it.
,Not Recommended,604570,35201440,Posted: 25 September,all,Redbeard,"Universe in Fire is a retro-style space game in which you fly a spaceship around the screen, shooting at attackers.There's not a lot to recommend it.You might get a few minutes' amusement, but that's about it.I found the mouse co-ordination to be a bit iffy, but that may just be due to the style of the game.If you want some retro-style entertainment for a few minutes, then this will provide it.But, apart from that, it lacks gameplay value.It would have been a great game in 1980, but not so much now.#AchievementCrazy"

,Not Recommended,604570,33361982,Posted: 7 July,all,Emoji-nal Roller Coaster,"Not necessarilybad, but it plays like a mediocre flash game I could find for free online, or code myself if I really felt like it. Definitely not worth the two dollars they ask for -- I got a coupon for this, so I only lost twenty cents and thus am not too torn up about it.Badge is cheap to craft though, and it drops 3 out of 5 cards. Probably the only thing this game has going for it (unless you like having 50+ achievement notifications on the side of your screen at one time)."

They never stop popping up while you play.Truthfully, the game isn't horrible, but don't pay much for it, if you pay anything at all. There are similar and much better games out there. Bit Blaster XL comes to mind. Buy that game instead."

You should add a pause because I lost my score when I tried to pause2. You should make the reticle bigger3. You should add differnet soundtracks4. unless you plan on nobody playing it unless they got a coupon to make it 20 cents you should make it free6. Make the text more interesting5.Achievements dont have descriptions just random words with new achievement7. Add a better main menu than new game and exitI hope this helps to make this broken incomplete but fun trash into something that people would play and if it gets improved people might actually pay 2 bucks for itUPDATEafter the first update the game was less broken and more enjoyable im actually getting into it but it needs more updates"
