,Recommended,604780,30518745,Posted: 14 March,all,ctuchil,"Well, let's see...I bought the game, finished it in one sitting, and don't regret the purchase.There are, however, a few annoyances I'd like to bring up about the game:Smooth(?) ControlsMovement is fine...until you touch a wall and start rolling choppily. It's not a big thing, but it would be nice if that was changed.Differences Between Difficulty LevelsThe difficulty levels are a little misleading. The transition between easy and medium is obvious, but I didn't notice much of a difference between medium and hard. All of the mazes are pretty straightforward, so I would have liked more of a challenge.MY EYESOkay, this might not be a big thing either but some of the background/maze combinations were hard on the eyes. A little variety is good, but maybe not so much in this case...Game IssuesSome parts of the game seem a little broken. If you look at the guide(s) for the game you can find at least one exploit already, though they might be fixed later. You can still play legitimately without problems though, so it's not too bad.Overall, this game is alright. I would give it a neutral score but I can't so this will have to do."

Hard mazes are really just bigger than the easy mazes, and that's it. Music and atmosphere is light and fun, and the achievements are easy to get; all you need to do is beat the levels. Took me 40 minutes to beat them, but would've taken less than half the time with a pencil."

,Recommended,604780,34429904,Posted: 22 August,all,Ravenquick,For the price this game is ok.  It's really easy if you have been doing maze puzzles for a bit.  It's great for beginners or children.  The music isn't bad I do wish there was more variety in that department.  Since there isn't any time limit you can just sit back and work out the maze rather easy.

It is some replayability so long as it has been awhile since you finished a level and you are someone who enjoys doing mazes.Even if I only play it once, I paid $0.90 for 45 minutes worth of entertainment....seems like a good deal to me!"
76561198033102868,Recommended,604780,30745313,Posted: 26 March,all,SericaRose,"I'm only up to lv 20, but do rather like this game. Since I buy a lot of games for my grandchildren this is exactly what I wanted. No violence, no adult content, and everyone can  have a turn that lasts 10 minutes. Also, for kids anyway, replayable. And the price is right too. What do you expect for $1?For me anyway, a  great buy. Recommended for Kids.EDIT:  I have now finished the game, and yes - it didn't take too long and was not at all difficult. But just yesterday my 3 year-old grandson came by and he played the first 3 lvls several times and loved it.* No penalty for mistakes or hitting the walls.* No time penalty or limit.* Even the HARD lvls are easily understood if you just look a little bit ahead.  That means that dead ends are not too far from the places where you can choose which way to go. And that means a much lower amount of frustration for young children.The only thing I didn't like was the black screen with white lines which I found hard on my eyes.Also I wanted to note that when I checked the Achivements - only 5.3% got even the first achivement, which is for STARTING the first map.  Not too sure where all the negitive reviews are coming from - you get what you see on the shop screens."
,Recommended,604780,32224565,Posted: 6 June,all,BluePaw,"It's an okay game for the price. Use the arrow keys to move the ball, that's about it. Was able to beat it in about 30 minutes (rest recorded time was for the card drops).The mazes do get more and more elaborate that you might at times find yourself going in the wrong direction and get lost.The music is soothing but doesn't loop smoothly.It's a one-off game, nothing more.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish."
76561198263628036,Recommended,604780,31351689,Posted: 24 April,all,Boxed,"If there was a ""meh"" rating option, I would have chosen it. I did finish the game, but towards the end I wanted to just get it over with. And I don't really care if I'm going try-hard on a 1 dollar game, at least it's a thumbs up.Issues:-Ball controls - Ball gets caught on edges and drags when too close to the walls, which becomes immensely annoying once you get to the harder levels.-Difficulty between Medium and Hard - Really no difference, the maze just gets bigger.-Music - Single track that's about a minute-long looping throughout the whole game.-Color changes between levels - There are levels where you go from black to NEON. PINK.-Lack of settings and additional buttons - No settings, no key re-configurations, no movement sensitivity changes, you can only turn music off and on. And when you beat a level, you can only click on the arrow to proceed. Allowing the shortkey to be 'enter' or 'space' would have been convenient.-Finish through walls - There are a couple levels where if you can get the ball close enough to the goal through the wall, it counts as passing.-Uninteresting later levels - Specifically the latter half of the medium levels and all hard levels. You have to pretty much go through at least 50% of the maze to reach the exit. Some levels have you going through almost the entire maze where it's obvious where dead ends are since it literally takes a couple glances to see that it is sectioned off.My thoughts throughout the game:Easy levels: Ahhh, good old nostalgia.Medium levels: This is fun, but it's kinda getting repetitive. Oh hey, that's a bright co- MY EYES.Hard levels: Is this actually Hard? It's just slightly longer than Medium. It would be great if I could customize the ball and background.... I wish I could handle these balls as well as the developer thinks I should. Just let me glitch through the frickin' walls, I've got 49 problems and I don't want mazes as innovative as modern-day art to be another one."

,Recommended,604780,32042327,Posted: 29 May,all,newtonu,"Extremely easy maze game, Just completed all the mazes in 50 minutes (about 1 minute per maze). On the other hand, very relaxing and with great acomplishment sensation. The music is a single track in loop. Could be a little longer music, or 2 or 3 songs of the same lenght. I think there should be a Real Hard mode with very hard mazes, but ok...Very fun and relaxing. I´ll be playing the second one too."

76561197971341065,Not Recommended,604780,31376907,Posted: 26 April,all,sfnhltb,"So fairly straightforward here - you have 50 mazes, 10 shortish easy ones and 40 called medium/hard of essentially the same level of difficulty and you have to find your way to the finish line. Or sometimes brush past the finish line while passing close by it. Playtime is probably about 0.5-1 hour, with little replayability.The controls are poor - your ball will stick to wall and has trouble cornering, making long windy passages really annoying to traverse. Which is another problem - instead of having mazes with lots of medium to large branches to choose between, the mazes here are mostly long winding passages with sometimes a fair number of ultra short dead ends you sail past (if you don't get stuck on a wall) without needing to pause or look ahead to decide which is the right way as you can tell at a glance.There are a few levels with fairly decent branching that actually work as proper mazes, but entirely too many you walk 60%+ of the length of the maze to get to the end because all the branches are so short. Others also make decisions that cut off large chunks of the maze way too trivial - the first screenshot on the store page shows a level where you start right on the bottom, move slightly up and right, then travel right to the top of the maze, splitting the level in half and making the half without the finish immediately and trivially easy to ignore, and there are several more levels that do the same (although slightly less obviously).So overall the controls are annoying, some of the levels have horrible backgrounds, and the mazes are mostly poor; even by the time you get to do the few decent levels that are interspersed in the later part of medium and a couple of the hard levels you really just want it to be over."

It's very easy mazes that is great if you have little kids or if you are a little kid. If you are a achievement hunter this is also a decent game that you should get for it is very cheap. The game is more fun if you try to make up your own story to it because it does get a little boring near the end. For the price this game is pretty good and I don't think it should get much hate.

Good game all in all, though very short."
,Recommended,604780,32112645,Posted: 1 June,all,adykacer,Pretty decent if you need to kill time somehow. The game itself does not last for more than an hour and half. The movement of the ball near walls is kinda clunky though.
,Recommended,604780,32402599,Posted: 13 June,all,KevLarsen0,"A simple, refreshing maze game.  Similar to buying a maze book that you can complete on your computer and with which you can get Steam achievements. I found it easier to keep focused by turning off the repetitive music and listen to something else."

Simple, clean, non-horrible background music. Sure it's easy, but there really isn't any way to make mazes hard really. ""Hard"" usually translates to large in size and variety of potential paths to make. This game has a good ratio of size to complexity with its later puzzles."

The motion of the ball is very annoying, especially in the latter stages as the 'alleys' get narrower and the ball annoyingly rubs against the wall.  The graphics are very basic and quite often hard on the eyes as the backgrounds can be chaotic.  I turned the music off immediately.  You can get 100% achievements in an hour, or less...a very dull hour at that.  Probably worth £0.10."
