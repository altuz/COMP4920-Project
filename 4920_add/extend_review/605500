,Not Recommended,605500,31230824,Posted: 18 April,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Final Revision: April 22, 2017What's Under Your Blanket 2 !? is the sequel to the semi-successful, indie cash-grab, jerk off simulator from 2016. Once again, players will be tasked with quick clicking (hope you've all been practicing by flickin' the bean) until our hapless hero is able to achieve maximum pleasure under his blue blanket in various locations. Often compared to the look of the Canadians on South Park, the unnamed male now has a girlfriend... which is his hand, who also bares a striking resemblence to the mock Jennifer Lopez hand that Cartman had created.While the initial release was nothing more than a cruddy cash grabbing masturbation simulator, it still had a fair amount of kinky quirks and a squirt or two of humor to it; however, much of that is lost in this follow-up release. It's over-whelmingly obvious that the developer had zero love for this title, and even after pushing back the release date and slapping on some patches, this game is little more than YouTube fodder.First up, the patches have broken the only dialogue scene that I've seen so far in the game; it has replaced the lines with ""bob1"" ""bob2"" ""bob3"", which are obvious place holders. I've pointed this out, but the developer has yet to fix it. Likewise, most of the achievements are broken, another problem that the dev has yet to address. There's also very little in the way of instructions, and those that are present are wrong. At one point, you're told to use the ""left, right, up, down keys"" to move to catch a cat... in reality, you have to use WSAD to move. There's also no indication of how to fight during the arm wrestling scenes, and you must figure it out for yourself (click the dude's hand).What more is there to say, really? What's Under Your Blanket 2 !? is a horrible game because it doesn't function. Sure, it has more levels than the first release, but what good is it when the game is broken? Even the sound effects tend to stop working, and the music is just the same loop from the first title. If you by some chance enjoyed the first one a lot, do yourself a favor and just don't bother until the developer shows some pride in his work.Rating:0.5/5.0- Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

Game either freezes at launch or when you try to fix the settings so it doesn't start in garbage 720P. Funny though, when you try to change to fullscreen it sticks on Windowed and it only allows your mouse to stay in a small windowed mode border while being fullscreen.Basicaly, this is pure trash and Steam needs to start putting the hammer down on developers thinking it's fine by putting out pure sh*te on the Steam Marketplace as long as it's free or really cheap.F this developer and anyone recommending this."

,Not Recommended,605500,33206065,Posted: 3 July,all,m0lineux,"You know what you're buying when you purchase a game like What's under your blanket 2 !?, a cheap game with limited gameplay and achievements to boot! However this game isn't fully functional and the achievements do not appear to work. A casual look through the Community pages for this game and it seems like the Devs have made some attempt to fix reported issues but have since abandoned the game. I'd love to see the Dev team resolve the outstanding issues, but i can't see that happening.I'd avoid this game, even at £0.49, isn't worth the disc space."

,Not Recommended,605500,31832013,Posted: 18 May,all,Lightoning,Trust me even after seeing the reviews this game is not worth is worst idea fap simulator which works exactly like hero clicker or sakura clicker tho in this stupid game you only click and do not earn anything total 5 of which every stage is about 1m MAX not worth my $ I do not recommend it to anyone sakura clicker is better it even has a nude patch
,Not Recommended,605500,31246410,Posted: 19 April,all,Ardoneye,"Most users are unable to pass Level 2 due to a large amount of bugs present in the game.The few fatal flaws I've found so far:1. The instructions tell you to use arrows instead of WASD to move about2. You can only get up if you hold down W and catch the cat if it's below the bench3. Moving is buggy, the characater doesn't move properly all the time4. When you you sit down you're behind the bench and the only way to get the gauge up is to click on the player's face5. Once you complete this buggy part you're in an arm wrestle against a bear, the level starts again on repeat as you are unable to increase the gauge against the bear as when you click or press any keys everyone is shocked.6. If you also click your person too quickly after a pop up message appears the timer freezes and the gauge will not increase therefore you have to restart the stage (this applies to level 1 and 2).It had great potential and it's cheap at 71p but for one levels worth of content thats a minute of gameplay long....I know some premium numbers to call for less money and more thrill!"

,Recommended,605500,31235493,Posted: 19 April,all,Dank Weed,"Honestly this is THE BEST game out there on the market. It is also very cheap. It have exellent graphics and great fps rate. The picture is very realistic (EVEN BETTER THAN ANIME) and the story is rich (I felt empty when i fiished this game). I can see this outbeating the game Witcher 3. Would totally recomend it. but at the flip side, i dont know how to fight the bear. Nevertheless, you should buy this game. I wish directors would make tons of movie sequel of this game. If i own IGN and other game reviews i wouldnt rate it 5/7, i would rate it 7/5 which is better than 10/10."
