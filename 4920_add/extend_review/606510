,Not Recommended,606510,31739933,Posted: 13 May,all,Euphoric,"The quality of production is extremely high. The graphics is detailed, the music creates good atmosphere and the voice acting is stellar.The story is average. First chapter's story doesn't seem to do anything special, compared to many children-as-assasins stories. The characters are also nothing amazing.It is the price that makes me not recommend the game. 15 Euro for little less than 4 hours? Way too expensive. It might be fine for 5 Euro."
,Recommended,606510,35065550,Posted: 19 September,all,Africandave™,"Absolutely recommend, but not at full price⭐⭐⭐⭐ ★Nice to be back at Mihama, as others have mentioned the production quality of the anime is high, great voice actors, and returning character artist Akio Watanabe and writer Ryuta Fujisaki doing what they do best make it an interesting and attractive story. Fans of previous Grisaia games will enjoy it but others don't need to have played them to understand this.The biggest problem is the price-playtime balance and episodic release format.£10.99 ($15 USD/ €15) when full price for approx 3 hours of playtime (most reviews are ~7hours but this is idling for card drops). I paid £8.79 (-20%) when it was on discount for release (which was less than the amount paid by kickstarter backers btw) and still felt it was too high. So far there are 3 episodes released which seem to be based on character routes (except vol. 1). If we estimate that there will be a volume per character + the first ""intro"" volume there will be up to 6-7 volumes to buy (Intro, Rena/Maki, Tohka, Chris, Murasaki, Arisaka, and maybe Haruto). Both volumes so far have been very short at ~3 hours, so for £65.94-76.93 ($/€90-105) for 18-21 hours of material it is pretty damn steep. Even at my 20% discounted price and love for the series it is hard to justify the costs involved. Episodic release of a single game in ""books”, “chapters"" and ""episodes"" is a frustrating marketing technique that relies on the sunk-cost fallacy where a person really doesn't want to miss out on the next part of the game because they have already invested in the beginning...Hopefully in the future Phantom Trigger will be sold as a set or collection at a reduced price, then I can complete it and consider my earlier high spending as support for the series or funding for the anime adaptation."

There wasnt the lead in to the gritty strangeness that was evident in originals (you just get kind of dumped into it) and the use of the chosen characters view point as a lead into the story wasnt a great starting point. Most of the smutty humour that was basically the icing on the originals cake seems not to have survived the transition either, but this may resurface in the later episodes.-The short episodic nature of this entry seems to be business model driven rather than story driven. Considering the amount of cash that was generated from the kickstarter it could have had far more content.The lead male character is camper than a drag queen conventionOverall its good and worth having a look, if it didn’t have the Grisaia tag on it I don’t think I would have been looking quite so critically at it and just leave it at ‘its good’. The problem is that it has so its still really ‘hung jury’ atm"

,Recommended,606510,31422964,Posted: 28 April,all,SICP,"I just loved how they revived grisaia and mihama-gakuen, too bad it was extremely short (completeable in 4 hours) and no choices which makes this game really unsatisfying..I can recommend for Grisaia Fans, but for those who never play grisaia trilogy before, I don't recommend getting this one."

Frontwing-sama, please also add JP version to other titles such as Himawari.なかなか面白い作品だね。日本語版も同時にリリースされて有難うございました。海外でも日本語が必要です。こんな拙い翻訳ではどうにもならないんだから。是非、ひまわりなど、グリザイア前作の日本語版も待ってます～"

,Recommended,606510,33883306,Posted: 29 July,all,Nightingale,"Great start for the first volume of the series, don't expect the action from the start of the story to be the main plot since this volume pretty much about explaining each character nature of this series.Apparantly, Kazuki remains as Thanatos in this series, I thought that she's back with Yuuji from the last trilogy of Grisaia. It will be great if she shows up more in the next volume."

,Recommended,606510,31572344,Posted: 5 May,all,Sharp,"Pros: You don't need to finish the original trilogy to understand this. Its very welcoming to people new to the Grisaia universe and its hard to get lostSome references to the original trilogy for those Grisaia fans out there.Characters are great. Art is very well done. Voice acting is TOP QUALITY.Cons:Doesn't flesh out the characters enough, imo. In the first Grisaia game, you had a really long common route before you even got to any of the girls routes, and you come to appreciate the cast more. Here, that doesn't happen nearly as much. The characters feel like they are just ""there"" some times and when it was all said and done, I feel like i barely scratched the surface when it comes to understanding these characters. I really hope that Vol 2 goes more in depth here.Very short. I only paid 15 dollars for this, but at the very least was expecting a somewhat longer game. The common route of grisaia no kajitsu felt much longer than this by comparison and that was only a portion of the first game.Final thoughts: I NEED MORE. Luckily vol 2 is out."

,Recommended,606510,31641424,Posted: 9 May,all,PenguinPandaZero,"As of now, there are only two volumes out but judging from those two volumes alone,this is a solid VN series. Knowledge of the previous Grisaia VNs will help draw some connections, but isn't required by any means.Each volume is admittedly short for its price, but the effort put into each volume shows, and if you are into VNs at all then it'll probably be worth it to you."
,Recommended,606510,31740883,Posted: 13 May,all,Michael_SK,"Many who have read through this can agree with me on how nice and fresh everything looks: the menu is stylish and the artstyle is fantastic. Things look new and modern compared to the original Grisaia visual novels. The characters are interesting to the point where I am already wanting to dive into their pasts and see how they all got here. The music is great, and there are some comeback tracks from the original Grisaia visual novels (which isn't bad in my opinion). The only issues I have with this visual novel is the default font being too simplistic, some backgrounds being reused from the originals, a badly placed fan-service scene, and the visual novel being way too short for how much you pay. In my opinion, this is *at most* a $10 visual novel.Overall, I liked this, and I think fans of the original Grisaia visual novels and newcomers to the series will enjoy it. It's a start to something that can become good.https://youtu.be/UQBFkeomYlw"

,Recommended,606510,32029017,Posted: 28 May,all,GCNess,"DON'T GO IN EXPECTING GRISAIA!!!!I went in without knowing anything of the premise besides the fact that it takes place after Rakuen.I thought it would be something similar where a main character goes to Mihama and cares for the girls problems. Even if it wasn't what I expected, it was still pretty good. But wait for it to go onto sale, because $15 is too much for a game that only last 2 hours."
,Recommended,606510,34011037,Posted: 4 August,all,DimDito,"Solid fun, but a bit lacking as its own game> Very loose sequel and is perfectly playable without having read any of the original Grisaia> Fully kinetic. No dialog options or routes> Not 18+ butstill has fanservice+ Likeable cast w/ nice character design+ Good translation. Nice job, Frontwing+ Great voice acting from top-tier seiyuu+ Amazing art and music reminiscent that of the original Grisaia+ Friendly UI w/ extensive options- Very, very short (2-5 hours)- Content doesn't justify the price tag- Haruto isn't voiced even though the prominent POV character is. Initially a bit jarring- Story lacks sufficient sense of stakes and depth due to the world-building role of the first episodeI enjoyed Phantom Trigger Episode 1 a lot. Murasaki is adorable and I might be gay for Hisato. The narrative structure might suffer due to the episodic business model but that's a given considering it's a Kickstarter title. I look forward to reading Episode 2!"
,Recommended,606510,32260742,Posted: 7 June,all,🅰🅻🆃🆁🅸🅰,"Grisaia returns with a fresh game that revitalizes the series. You love unique / cool / badass characters? This one should be right up your alley.There's a fun story, memorable characters, and AMAZING voice actresses. In fact, I'm a huge fan of Grisaia but didn't hear about this game until myfavorite Anime voice actresstweeted about this game. And lucky for me, she's the lead heroine.Uchida Maaya!I believe this could even be her first visual novel voice appearance! Aside from her, her also very popular friend Ayane Sakura also lends her role here. This is a huge treat for anime fans who recognize these actresses.Anyhow, enough rambling. I highly recommend this game and no knowledge of the past games is necessary. I'd actually even recommend this if you're new to the series and want to give it a shot. It has a more ""action-centric"" story that should appeal to lots of people. Get it now!"
