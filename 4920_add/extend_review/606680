,Recommended,606680,32182867,Posted: 4 June,all,Epifon,"This was my first real game I played when I was a kid.I might have been 9 or 10, and it actually was the Demo of the game that I got from an old Gamer magazine.My father at the time saw how sad I was when the demo was over he actually went and bought the game.It was more of a hit or miss experience, since I was so young and I didn't understand English.But I managed to complete the game. I think it took almost a year for me.I revisited the game again and again, it kinda grew in my musclememory.As I grew and learned more English, I could actually understand the plot and kinda adult theme of the game.There's actually a part of the game I remember having a lot of problems with, it scared me when I was kid.And I would lie if I didn't feel a cold sweat down my neck when I revisited it today.The voice-acting goes from awesome to corny on a dime.The characters are colorful and the action is just plain fun.The plot is simple ""rescue your wife from the evil wizard"".This game focus is more about the journey and adventure, I hold it kinda close to the old Zelda games in that regard.Would I recommend it? Yes!Is it a perfect game? No way ahahha!This game is not for everyone.And this review comes from one that is feeling the rush of nostalgia from his childhood.I would have bought this game for 15 Euro. Just to relive it.-And this game made it possible to change my avatar to my absolute favorite character  :D"

Been searching for this game forever since the CD doesnt run under anything else then 95/98. Inmagin my surprise when i saw it on steam, so ofcourse bought it right away and started playing. It holds up realy well, tho i do have a small ""glitch""  that sometimes when i leave the item/battle menu the field im on gets disoriented so the background/field is compleetly messed up, tho you can still fight, interact and go to the next field. So far that is the only ""bug"" i encounter but wont let it bother me to much. Dont know if only i have this or others have it too. All in all i loved it then and love it now, even for ppl who never played it, if your a fan of rpg/adventure i would go for it. For info its a click and move game with a unique battle system (dragging your mouse in different directions while holding Ctrl gives you different attack moves :p )"

Thusfar, the steam version has been running great.Silver is an RPG with fixed camera position. It's funny, has great dialogue and good voice acting.Fighting is done with mouse 'gestures'. The direction you move your mouse in while attacking alters the attacking move. It feels great and intuitive. The graphics are pretty good too, especially for such an old game.It's a game with a some unique features, you should definitely get it."

76561197961098939,Recommended,606680,32402081,Posted: 13 June,all,Edward Howton,"I remember trying a demo of this back in the day. It's been, what, almost 20 years? The fact that I remembered it and recognized it on Steam is telling of just how much of an impression this game left on me. I didn't buy it back then, but I never forgot it, and I'd even tried finding it in the years since (but good luck googling 'silver game'; Pokemon is just one of the things that erased this gem from search results).Suffice it to say, I picked it up immediately when I saw it. I remembered nothing but the name and that the combat was ""different"" and yet here we are.The graphics are slightly lower quality than Final Fantasy 7 despite coming out two years later (the intro suffered from stutter when I started the game, even), so that's not the reason to play this.The story begins as standard adventure fare, but it sucks you in very effectively. I'm only a few hours into it as I type this up, but the real appeal is the combat. I guess you could call them mouse gestures; clicking on an enemy results in a normal sword swing. Holding Ctrl and swiping up, left, down, or right results in different attacks, including a 180-spin-and-slash at enemies behind you, which is very useful since enemies usually outnumber you and will go for a flank. The inventory takes a bit of getting used to, but it was a very innovative (at the time) 'wheel' design and you can switch weapons or use items in just a few clicks, even in combat.Yeah... it's not turn-based. Dodging attacks, blocking, running around enemies, back-dashing,  there's a surprising amount of strategy involved. Diablo and Dungeon Siege have nothing on this game's complexity.Did I mention it's almost 20 years old? This is no ordinary game. Give it a try. It doesn't cost much andjust the demo left an impression that lasteddecades.It's not without its problems, mind. After killing the first boss, I'm noticing some questionable design decisions in that healing seems limited and money appears only in set quantities in chests. There's also the aforementioned video stuttering, but I think it's Bink video and no matter which computer I've used that has never worked well for me. Perhaps these problems will be fixed, either in later game mechanics I haven't seen or by patches, but even if they aren't I don't think they count too much against this gem.Be part of gaming history and make this little-known treasure finally see the success it's always deserved. It still does. And it's almost old enough to drink."

76561198021676032,Recommended,606680,34132437,Posted: 9 August,all,Wingthor,"Silver is a forgotten gem if there ever was one. I loved this game when I was a kid. Sadly, my old CDs wouldn't work on newer versions of Windows, so I was delighted when I saw that the game is available on steam, in a version compatible with modern operating systems!Originally released back in 1999, the game is quite old, so don't expect any fancy new graphics. Graphically, the game isn't exactly complex, as it features polygonal 3D characters drawn against beautiful pre-rendered 2D backgrounds.The story is essentially a fairytale. The protagonist is the brave, honorable hero whose wife is abducted by stereotypical evil meanies with a sinister laugh. On his quest to save his wife, said protagonist gathers followers and visits many different places and landscapes.Silver's great strength is the active combat system. While it is possible to fight enemies by simply clicking on them in a hack'n'slash like manner, this proves to be quite ineffective. Combat really comes to life when it is controlled by mouse movement. You literally control your character's sword with your mouse. For example, holding the left mouse button and moving your mouse to the right causes your selected character to slash to the right, whereas holding CTRL and the left mouse button and moving your mouse down causes your character to perform a turnaround slash. This may feel kinda clunky sometimes, but it becomes second nature after a few fights. And it's so much fun. Fighting is so much fun in this game, it's incredible.But since you control a party of up to 3 party members, this can sometimes be quite a hassle, especially during boss fights. Instead of controlling all 3 characters separately during combat, it's often the best to just concentrate on one of them and let the AI handle the others.Party members can be changed at any time (except for the David, the protagonist, who will always be in the party). Companions that aren't in your party can be found in Haven and there is a total of 5 different companions to choose from. Every companion has strengths and weaknesses; some are good archers, others are good sorcerers or melee fighters. There is even a character that excels in unarmed combat.The game has a few minor flaws. The voice acting surely isn't the best, and the inventory feels clunky and inefficient and needs getting used to.The game feels kinda ""open"", but is actually quite linear with just a few secrets here and there. Due to this, the game lacks replayability.I may be a bit biased and I'm sure nostalgia plays a big part in this, but I love the crap out of this game, despite its flaws. So naturally, I recommend this game to anyone who is interested in RPGs.By the way, a lot of people seem to complain about crashes. Well, all I can say is that (apart from some issues with the intro) I played through the entire game without a single crash, error or bug."

I can tell you that in 9 hours of playing i had just 1 error on my windows 10 system.Also for the people that are worried about the bell puzzle. It works (without any help from slowing your pc or save exploiting. You just need to know the timing on when to click).What does the game have in store for youAn epic adventureYou control your sword with your mousemovementsNice background drawingsWhat's not so goodIt's really hard controlling all your 3 characters seperatelyChanging weapons / specials / magic is weird compared to games nowadays.Replayability is only interesting if you want to play with different characters (the story stays the same)My own experienceI've played this game about 20 years ago. Back then i really enjoyed it. Seeing this on steam made this an instabuy (although i was sceptical about all the 'crashes/errors' people said they'd encountered). Again i didn't have any problems while playing this game and it took me back to my younger years. I still like the story, the characters and the drawings. I had a blast while playing this game. I've just completed the story and at some time i will replay it again, probably with the other characters.A funny sidenote; at one point during the game the game really reminded me of a Game of Thrones character. A white long haired girl with a 'guardian' that looks and almost has the same name as Drogon."
,Recommended,606680,32205680,Posted: 5 June,all,CoSmOtheCoDeR,"I played this game when it first came out (it was actually a birthday present for my 17th back in 1999). I loved it then, I love it now. Yes the graphics look dated and it has a few little issues due to compatibility, but the story and the game itself make up completly for that.The controls are completly mouse driven, you move around the world clicking in locations, pick up items using the mouse cursor, it feels exactly how a PC RPG should do. Perhaps an option could be added to use the gamepad (ala Dreamcast version) but that's something that is up to THQ-Nordic to decide if they can and want to. The fact that the way you swipe the mouse controls the sword is really unique and makes for a good mechanic, there issues in targeting enemies but that's not a big problem.There are a few issues with the other languages at the moment (apparently, i'm on the English language) and some are saying that it's just the GOG version. It's not the same, it's been updated (apparently it had to be to work correctly) and hopefully some of the bugs that existed in the original are sorted too. If not then the chance for them to be fixed is greater now that someone has actually re-released the game.This game is a perfect peace of gaming history, if you look past the fact that it is almost 20 years old!"

The title video/sound still drift out of sync, but the game is just fine.  Great work fixing it so fast developers. :)-------------Right now I cannot recommend this version of Silver.  I have the original on cd's, but it's near to impossible to get it to run on a modern system.  Unfortunately this version crashed with a 'grunt' related .cpp error to the desktop before you even complete the 'tutorial' where your wife is taken to the boat.  This is on top of the title video becoming about 15 seconds out of sync (audio behind video) with sound breaks by the end of the clip, and then the music randomly stopping during the initial battle tutorial.This is a great game.  Once these errors are fixed I could only then recommend it.  In it's current state, definitely not.  I guess not everyone may have the issues, but my system is a pretty typical i7 Win 10 setup with a good stable Asus board and it fell over fast.  Shame."

Like many of the reviews and comments, this game brings so much nostalgia that it actually  warrants a greater price the low low price that they are charging.   I fell back into swing with this game like I had never left it all those years ago.   It runs great on my machine, with no load times to mention and so far no glitches at all.   Truly wonderful experience.The game itself I think is timeless, it is a wonderful story with depth, intrigue, sadness and satisfaction.   The voice acting of Tom Baker is reminiscient of the voice of Richard RIdings (who did the original Dungeon Keeper voice), well scripted all in all.Innovative interface that has long been unrivalled using the mouse and the CTRL key.A game that truly set high standards in its day and in this day proves the old adage that great graphics does make a great game.If you have never played it.

,Recommended,606680,32243319,Posted: 7 June,all,Hitch,"Firstly, yes this game still has some bugs however for me personally on Windows 10 with a 6990 HD GPU and i7 the game runs extremely well once you get past the intro FMV which sadly de-syncs and has awful audio, but it's just an intro...As for the game itself, it runs wonderfully but hates being Alt-Tabbed (Like most games these days) and brings back all the memories I have of the Dreamcast version without me having to bother plugging the DC back in.Silver plays like a very chilled RPG with interesting controls. The mouse combat is brilliant using CTRL with flicks of the mouse in various direction to pull off certain moves and despite a few people saying otherwise it really is extremely versatile and easy to get used to. Apparently it lacks controller support right now but it really does not need it beyond some people refusing to try the mouse method.The graphics are just as pretty as they always were with a couple of upscaling options for the characters etc to ""smooth"" them out. Personally I prefer leaving them as standard as I was never a fan of that ""super eagle"" look and feel with filters. The backgrounds, the water etc are all great as is and whilst lacking somewhat in a colour pallete fit the aesthetic perfectly.Story wise, well... I have always said this is the best RPG on Dreamcast even beating my much loved Skies of Arcadia, but many will disagree as is their right. For me the story is perfect, and the progression is perfectly balanced. The voice acting is mostly top notch and hilarious at times with the banter between the protaganist and the guys/gals he speaks too. You will find yourself wanting to slap David but I think this is usual and has been said for years by players around the globe!My only true complaint is one I have always had with the game and is partially an RPG thing in that you can get lost in your objectives extremely easily so I do suggest you use a notepad and pen to avoid the inevitable ""Google it"" moments. Perhaps this is less a fault of the game and more a fault of the player simply not paying attention, who knows :)All in all a great version of a brilliant game. Most bugs are fixed over the GOG version and as mentioned this plays wonderfully for me on my PC bar the intro. It's cheap as chips and we have a steam refund policy if the game fails to work for you. Honestly, try it out."

I lost CD #2 and never had to chance to finish the game and I've had the biggest gaming blue balls since then. 1000 years later Steam puts it on the store and I just had to get it.This game is old but it doesn't have the classic RPG menu mechanics. You have to use your mouse and aim at the target but it doesn't break its own RPG system. Similar to what Fable did many many years later (though Silver is not that sophisticated either in gameplay or interface).I'm not sure if this game actually inspired newer RPG systems but if you like exploring the history of RPGs this one is a hidden gem.Others report bugs but I haven't found one yet.If you run it on Debian based Linux distros make sure to install the libglew1.13:i386 package.

Frequent saves were enough to continue to progress as far as the midpoint of the penultimate area, but at that point the crashes became closer together than the save points and I therefore cannot complete the game (or even get to the point the GoG version crashes at, the introduction of the final boss).Sadly that last just tips the scales from a Yes to a No for me - hard to recommend something when you don't know if the recommendee will be able to play all of the game."

The story is nice, the difficulty of the puzzles are just right, the combat is enjoyable, the prerendered scenes are beautiful and the music is meshmerizing.For the Steam version:Let's start with the pros. After the initial bugfixes this seems to be the most stable version of the game on modern computers. I have only encountered one crash towards the end (the labyrinth likish room with a lot of stairs). It's a little annoying since it is well after the previous save point, so I lost quite some game progress. But in my experience at that room all versions tend to crash. Another pro is that the infamous bell puzzle is working like magic. And the last thing I would like to mention is an extra save opportunity towards the end of the game. Back in the time I really could use this. Now it doesn't matter to me (since I oneshot everything except one boss which I will not name to avoid spoilers), but it could be good for newcomers.Now on the other side... There are more than one thing. Most of them are only affectinig gameplay experience, like sound glitches, music loop issues, the blurry edges, but there is one serious issue. The mouse cursor is not changing on usable objects as it should and does in other versions of the game. So if someone is new to the game, might be stuck in a couple of places, unless he/she reads a walkthrough but then there not much point in playing the game.My opinion altogether is that if you are not new to this game, and you are willing to sacrifice some of the gameplay experience then go for it. Otherwise I recommend to aquire another release."
