I played the older version and the newest one brings enough content for veterans to play again and a whole package of challenges for newcomers. Graphically speaking, the devs improved even more the beauty of the game. Challenge is at the right level. Plenty of things to do after finishing the campaign, despite its 12 achievements. Here is how they work: you need to complete a set of objectives (say 6, 7 stuffs at least) within the game to reach higher ranked badges (kind of a pilot classification), so the achievements are tied to these badges, so don't think it will be easy. Specially the last two stages are absurdly well made and dynamic. Soundtrack is also great, also it has a fairly complex plot, which you require you to reread and consequently play again. Controls are smooth (played on Xbox 360 and Xbox One gamepads).Lastly, those who owned the game before got the EX update for free, which worths praises nowadays. That'a the second time THQ Nordic does that on Steam. Good job!"

The original version is no longer sold.The upgrade improves the original game by adding improved graphics, English voices, and improving the game in general, also some new game modes are added.The game also fully supports 21/9 aspect ratio for ultra-wide monitor users. I tested the game on 2560*1080 and it’s perfect.The game is a shoot’em up with impressive 3D graphics, good sound effects and a good story for this type of game. As it’s a shoot’em up playing with a controller is recommended, I tested with an Xbox one wired controller.The game is very fun to play and it doesn’t get frustrating for players new to the genre.I highly recommend getting this game!"

The cut scenes and 3d movement through stages is seriously awesome and have kept me engaged.From what I can tell, adventure mode covers an arcing story over a few different characters (who all have their own ships and special ability).  Time is a recurring theme, as when you get hit by an enemy you lose time to finish the stage, gain time when killing an enemy, have the ability to slow time, and the story overlaps through different characters viewpoints over the same time periods.Various upgrades drop throughout play which can give you ammo for your special weapon, upgrade your main gun, give you more slow-down ability, etc.  Stages appear to have multiple boss fights which are both beautiful to look at, and fun to fight.  There is a Co-op mode, but I have not had someone to play it with as of yet.As far as bug and glitches, I have not experienced any as of yet.  At first I thought I was hearing an audio glitch with characters repeating the same lines until I realized I was replaying the same moment in time through a different character.  A pretty cool concept to introduce into a game like this, where typically its all about the bullet-hell aspect.All in all, this is a beautiful game with amazing graphics, great audio, good voice acting, and fun/engaging game play.  A solid recommendation."

Played co-op with a buddy today, was a lot of fun!Originally I wanted to buy it on Nintendo Switch but the release date got delayed, so I picked up the Steam version, which is suprisingly way cheaper than on consoles. Win-Win!Runs great and I didn't encounter any issues or whatsoever. Love the art style and gameplay!"
,Not Recommended,606730,34589859,Posted: 29 August,all,tearfromthered,"Don't buy it for the coop mode. this new version proudly offer a coop mode, but it's a really bad one. the solo is as good as it was before tho. Issues with coop: the second user play some sort of  ""ghost"" that ennemies will never shoot at. He is a giant ""ball"" with no powerup or anything upgradable. At least it's free if you own the normal game tho."

,Not Recommended,606730,34844002,Posted: 9 September,all,*711,"What is the ONE important thing to get right on a bullet hell? Pretty graphics with a nice aesthetic, artistry and shadow effects? A competent sound engine that creates a cool atmosphere? Nope… it’s the god damn ability to dodge and explode crap and while this game succeeds on the first 2 items it utterly fails on how it plays.I was hooked from the screenshots when I bought this game but less than an hour in and over a dozen of “but the bullet / wall didn’t hit me!” deaths I’m done. More often than not either because of a pretty and slow plane animation or a very weird hit box you’ll get hit for no good reason.If that wasn’t enough different planes have a “wildly different” gameplay that you can categorize basically in two groups… one of them work and one don’t. Many times during the story mode I was given planes with pathetic bombs and bullet patterns just to spend the next 10’ wishing I could’ve gotten something different.Story is completely forgettable and generic and the time gimmicky is shallow and uninteresting but I won’t hold that against a game of this genre specially when the gameplay itself is more than enough reason to stay away from the title."
,Not Recommended,606730,35376778,Posted: 1 October,all,rmz,"Sine Mora EX is a side-scrolling shoot'em up that provides a unique challenge, where time is the ultimate factor. Mixing classic shooter sensibilities with contemporary presentation, Sine Mora EX is a gorgeous shoot'em up offering both a Story Mode that weaves an over-the-top tale and an Arcade.I'm torn. I like shooters, and Sine Mora EX is a very pretty shooter with all the important mechanisms, weapon upgrades, multistage bosses, great looking, etc. It has an interesting mechanics where you have given time for a level, each hit taken substracts from that time, each kill adds to that time. When the time ends, you die. There are several ships to fly with somewhat different main weapons and totally different bombs. And have I mentioned that it looks great? It does.The problem is the game is sometimes overwhelmingly unfair. Take one of the bosses for instance, the boss enters from the left side, where you usually position yourself. If it touches you it's insta kill, and you have zero time to react. There's a level where you fly through a cave, touching a wall equals being hit and it's very easy to touch a wall because sometimes the barrier wall will look exactly like the background wall. Unavoidable insta-kill lasers? Yup, you can find them here. So basically while the game is very pretty to look at and quite fun to play, sometimes you just die, for some random reason that is so very unfair it ruins all the fun you had just a minute ago.It's not a bad game, it just requires more patience than I can muster.I liked:* looks, it's a pretty game* some boss fights are really coolI disliked:* the insta kills* unfairness of some levels/enemiesGet this if:* you like tough as nails sidescrolling shooters and are not easily discouragedDon't get this if:* you're bad at shooter games, there is no easy mode here and limited continues* you're short on patience"
76561198277247864,Recommended,606730,34172803,Posted: 11 August,all,Flameheart,"The developers might want to improve the game's messy narrative structure a bit. The story tellsing is a failure, even the stupid wiki page tells more than the game itself. English voice cast is disappointing too.Story mode should allow players to choose their own sub weapon and time ability, instead of forcing the use of default weapon/powers. Not everyone like to play arcade for achievements...In general a great game, beautifully fitting its name and philosphy. But worth some big improvements."

,Not Recommended,606730,34523102,Posted: 27 August,all,MajorKoenig,"i do know♥♥♥♥♥♥about hitbox consistency or movement calibration in bullet hell games but this feels very empty.the concept that you race against time and gain bonus time for destroyed enemies tries to be innovative but for me it wasn't a major change in the game dynamics, most of the time i didn't even pay attention to it. also i think i didn't undesrstand this mechanic perfectly, it's not very well explained nor intuituve. to ma it makes little sensethe game features beautiful backdrops, and a story i cannot care less about presented by furries.cutscenes are almost longer than gameplay itself and they do not make up for the fact that the game is shallow and boring though in a beautiful shell.if they invested as much devotion to the gameplay like in the visuals and the furries it might be a decent shooter, but i guess this is the euro-shmup dilemma."

,Recommended,606730,35036610,Posted: 17 September,all,RandomNPC,"Controls could be tighter, hit boxes could be better defined, and some of the ""hard"" elements can come across as cheap. Still a good Shoot em Up for your collection. Visuals are amazing and the story is interesting. Story mode can be beat in one short sitting on normal. Never bothered with the harder modes. Plenty of options beyond the story and easy to pick up when your look for a quick arcade break."

,Not Recommended,606730,34166732,Posted: 11 August,all,Harmony,"As a holder of previous Sine Mora, I recommend to avoid this game.1. Don't be fooled by the name of ""Sub-Weapon"". By using the traditional shooting game genre terms, the SW in this game is in fact a ""Bomb"". No seeker missiles. No spread shots. No charging shots. You're only allowed to shoot the enemies in front of you since there're no ""Sub-weapons"". Not much like a hero, eh?2. You'll lose some of your powerups if you collide with your enemy or specific terrain. But if you have full powerups, one touch will make you lose them ALL. You don't have much chance to get them all back in a tight fight, so you must be pretty skillful to take the rest enemies down to make up the firepower loss. In other shooting games, there'll be some backup supplies (remember Striker 1945? Those little red ones?), but in the game, you get nothing. GLHF.3. Some SWs don't even have invincible time which means you can't eliminate the upcoming threat by using your SW. If you really want to beat the boss fast, just make sure you don't lose any weapon powerups, then smash the shooting button like mad. It works best in that way.4. Some bosses will shoot tiny missiles which will perfectly blend in with the background.5. Terrain kills. And repeat. And repeat. And REPEAT.I can play Gradius V for the whole day. But this game...better avoid it."

They fixed nothing of the utterly broken game design.Every hit makes you lose all your weapon upgrades. Every hit costs you time so after a few hits you can't complete the level anymore but you don't realize it until much later: thats surely one of the most stupid game design decisions ever.After you died you find out that the number of retrys is limited. Seriously, in 2017.And if you try again the time limit is reset to such a short time that completion of the level is completely impossible anyway. Seriously.And all of this happens in ""beginner mode"" in the first level. Unbelievable."

There are children around our house and some like to play shooters, but this game is unfortunately not one children should be around, as well as many mature adults. When I have company and would like to play co-op, I would be embarrassed to play it with them for this reason. Very, VERY bad decision on developer's side, especially since text can't be turned off (at least speech can). If I knew this before purchase, I would have stayed far away."

Drops you in at the deep end of bullet hell with little time to get used to the rapidly-introduced mechanics.

,Recommended,606730,35390167,Posted: 1 October,all,Splatoon,"With the caveat that I'm not a big shmup guy, I thoroughly enjoyed Sine Mora and the improvements brought with the EX version. Lovely art, an engaging minimalist story and a slow-down mechanic for the reaction-time challenged, what more could you ask for? I've seen some people lamenting the difficulty, but honestly playing on normal mode I haven't had much trouble, and while there's a definite element of pattern recognition at play I've managed to beat most levels on the 2nd or 3rd try at most. Plus, once you beat a level it's unlocked as a starting point, so no need to run through previously completed ones if you're not chasing scores. I can't really say where it falls in the pantheon of shmups, but if you're the kind of person who likes to occasionally dip a toe into the genre this was a uniquely entertaining entry in the genre."
