,Not Recommended,606800,34264462,Posted: 15 August,all,Hunting Wizard,"A glorified Cookie Clicker. You start slow, you have to click your Developers manually and click the modules you want to make, you take on easy simple contracts by manually clicking your sales exec when they find a contract, you earn money little by little. The progress is pretty much streamlined, what's with the tier level unlocking new staff and chairs.Closer to the end there's no need for contracts, managers do your dev clicking work for you, you basically print money automatically, with almost no input. All you have to do is keep Hype level for your own products high by clicking either Update or Marketing buttons.When/If the dev of this game adds the feature of selling your startup to start anew, this is gonna look pretty much like a Prestige/Ascension thingy from Cookie Clicker et al. I don't even know what can be done to move from the concept of Cookie Clicker at this point, I hope the modders will figure it out through the Workshop, and I'll try the game again at some point in the future, when there's a lot of mods and the promised random event system, but for now I don't want to boot it up again. It's even cut short of the promised 8 hours of playtime, 5 hours were enough to get to the ""print money"" phase. Really wished for it to be deeper than that.Also, the framerate gets choppy closer to the end of the game, and the game's crashed on me once while at it, probably something with the amount of elements and animations from all the employees, the desks, different windows etc. No big deal, it's Early Access, just wanted to point it out.EDIT: since somebody asked me to compare Startup Company to Game Dev Tycoon, here's the link to the comparison:https://pastebin.com/uRWPPhaF"

The largest office space is also far too small to accomodate the full 50 workstations, with a nice layout and other furniture.The contracts lose their meaning after a short while after making your own product. That product is also very little dynamic, and grows at a linear pace (unless I am mistaken) that makes the growth of that product far less realistic. As well as it seems it cannot fail given that you just keep the hype up.Memory leaks as well.All in all a fair game for a few hours, but any point beyond that is plain boring with no incentive to play further.Might be decent when finished, but I'd wait till then if I were you."

They want to go to vacation every 3rd day…The game is really boring. Also a bit weird how the developer thinks that how is a software made. it's like a factory. the different experts creating different products (like encryption, database, etc...) and storing them in a storage. when a contractor needs a software (mentioning what ""ingredients"" and how much of them need to fulfill the order), and you have all the thing in your inventory, the contract can be done instantly. if not, then you have to assign a programmer to create the missing element. I was try to make a lot’s of program elements, then I fired all the employees except the sales executive, and he was fulfill all the orders alone, without any programmers. Took the elements from the storage, placed into a bag, was shake it, and the software was ready. I don’t think to develop a software is like this. Every order should be unique and should the programmers create it from the beginning. Ok, if you create an engine, or framework for yourself, then you can use it. But still… I personally don’t like this game, and the market already has same type games but better and more interesting gameplay."

Okay..So I got this mail today from Steam, telling me that a game I followed just released on Steam, the name was ""Startup Company"", first I was.. WTH? - Why can't I remember this, and why did I follow that unknown game!?So I opened Steam Store and checked it out, and quickly saw that the game was beautiful crafted and decided it could easy be the 10 EUR worth. So i bought it straight off only to go in-game for 6 hours straight.The game is by far the BEST beta game, I've ever played. This has merely no bugs and are very stable. It allows me to go in depth with a lot of the game, and the developer seem to do whatever the players what most, which is truely great in a time where we live with EA, Ubisoft and other big companies just making what looks good, but isnt feeling good.This game is both looking great, stable and have very addicting gameplay. It allows you to start your very own software company. You start out doing contracts (Freelance) for other companies, and soon after you'll able to hire more developers.You'll be able to move to greater offices and even take the fight to the big guys, trying to beat Facebook, Twitter, E-bay, YouTube and Amazon?Are you able to make a better Social Media, Shopping Site, Streaming site or video sharing site than the big ones?- Buy this, and it will soon be worth it.BTW. By default the game support modding with Steam Workshop, which really let me wonder - How come the pricetag is that low?It's simple. The developer is doing this out of love, not money. Support him - Buy it."

It isn't about making games, it's about making the components used to power the internet. And it is a GOOD one. It is extremely accurate, well designed, expertly executed, and far from boring. I have at this writing over 20 hours offline playing. It is a clickfest BUT you need to hire the entire spectrum of employees as your company grows. Designed by one person it is amazing and intense. HUGE fun if you are a simulation geek like I am. And if you came from the industry, you'll find the game to be an accurate representation of what your life was like making digital components for the biggest, cheapest companies in the world.The workshop is alive and thriving, with MANY great items in place to help you enjoy the game. Oh and patience is required. You aren't going to be successful overnight. The contracts that come in in  the first 30 game days are small and survival will be critical. Balancing the needs of the employees with the requirement to keep the company running is a must. Happy people produce lots of inventory.Overall I wholeheartedly recommend this game. If your spice is shooty shooty bang bang, it ain't here. But if you want a challenging deep game that mirrors the needs of the company you play this game on, BUY IT RIGHT FREAKING NOW.PS When you finish researching and make your own Facebook, then you'll see the money roll in. But it's gonna take a while to get there.BUY THIS GAME!!!"

I can't quite recommend it yet, but as it is early access, I'll come back to this review.The game is fun and the classic game mechanics are there, enough so to make it hard to stop playing. ""Work"" is decently well portraited in a way close enough to reality to make sense. However, most of the systems in this game massively lacks a depth and complexity that you expect from a tycoon game.One of those things are the number of skill parameters on the employees. There is no room for complexity with just the speed & mood metrics. Adding furniture doesn't make sense after so many chairs, since mood will always decrease.Also, how the devs will only work if a manager manages them is frustrating. I see how it might seem like a smart game mechanic, but the metaphor is a little brittle. Same thing for hardware. If you call it ""startup company"", the metaphore kinda falls on the fact that a modern start up would likely buy a lot of services, and build only their own core themselves.This game is fun, but not satisfying in the long run.Devs should perhaps try to work out some of systems on paper before tossing them in as game mechanics, that way you'll see if it balances out."

The game places several artificial limits in place to keep you annoyed as well. A manager can only manage so many, so you're stuck assigning the same thing over and over to a staff member... basically clicking the same crap again and again. 3 hours in and you will feel like this is carpel tunnel syndrome for your brain."

Own software projects have been running and missing features (what, a online shop platform without payment feature? WTF. And nearly everything is mobile only.

It was always ""i'll just build 100 of these, oh i'll make 200 of these, oh i can upgrade this, i should hire another one of these"" and it kept going and going and going!Super fun, extremely polished, I think the only issue I saw was the big office table+chairs has clipping issues but that is hardly anything really...There is some lag at end game, due to the nature of the game it doesn't make it unplayable, just mildly annoying and I believe this will be fixed in a few days anyway.The game is super casual friendly and even though it is incredibly easy (you don't need to true much, its very unbalanced) I found this quite rewarding, you're not going to struggle consistently and if you go from 500k down to 50k due to investing in 10 new devs with all new tables the reward will almost always pay off (you'd need to be unlucky for it not too!)By end-game it can feel a bit boring, it depends where you hit it. I hit what I felt like ""end-game"" before I had even made an product because I had too much money to know what to do with and stock piles of the basic tech, I just then made products and learned + built everything as a ""side project"", since there were no losses.I think the mood feature needs a bit of work, getting grumpy after a few week and needing a 3 day holiday is odd, but it's also odd when you send everyone on holiday and then fire 5 guys and no one is the wiser. (It's also hilarious when you do fire people and EVERYONE but ONE guy is upset. That ONE guy is like ""i hated that dev!"" haha).Super rewarding gameSuper polishedAwesome developersCheap priceIt's a great game to get hooked on for 8 or so hours. I will defiantly come back on launch to see whats new and get stuck in again."
,Not Recommended,606800,34497511,Posted: 25 August,all,Cosmopygian,"I loved playing Coredumping's Software, Inc. and Greenheart's Game Dev Tycoon, so when I saw this, I had to have this game.Unfortunately, Startup Company doesn't seem to deliver in the gameplay department as it does on graphics - just the opposite of both games I've mentioned.First, there is no tutorial. I understand this is still an early access game, but it really could do with a tutorial. I didn't struggle per se, but the importance of certain mechanics such as hiring specific types of employees didn't register to me early enough. Also, I never could figure out how to construct modules, which were necessary for certain contracts.Second, it needs better UI organization. I wish I could move around windows that block essential information underneath. I also wish there were shortcuts to essential buttons that determine what kind of work my employees are assigned, instead of clicking on their names above their avatar's heads and then clicking on the work they need to complete every single time (unless you hire a manager, which unlocks later on), which is about every thirty seconds. If this doesn't sound bad, the buttons for their names and the furniture they're using are so closely positioned that I end up misclicking about half the time. Also, the game could do with a better time management system. The regular play speed is way too fast for me and would have liked a slower speed in order to prevent wasting time between micromanaging employees.Third, better balancing. Unlocking things to program/design costs $1000 per employee, and that is just ridiculous. This means it takes ~$1500 to recruit and hire a programmer, $4500-5500 base salary for that employee, and $6000 to unlock all beginner skills for that programmer alone, all while managing a mandatory $40k loan. It just doesn't make sense to me. Also, you need to hire an HR manager, which doesn't unlock until later on, to control what hours the employee works. Huh??? This means an employee can come to work whenever he or she damn well pleases... like at 10 while another comes in at 8. I really don't understand.Overall, this game feels like it needs a lot, I mean, a lot of polishing. Everything feels tedious and doesn't feel fun at all. This could be because I haven't gotten very far but even then, I don't see very much entertainment value in taking a mandatory loan, having very little control what happens in the office overall, and clicking a bunch of buttons that are in very awkward places. It sometimes feels like a mobile clicker game like Adventure Tycoon, just with buttons that take several clicks to get to, and in that sense this game completely lacks depth compared to other similar games.So far I'd have to say I'm really quite disappointed in this game and would not recommend it at this stage, especially at $10. Let's hope that devs can improve it before it's released. Meanwhile, I'd love to get a refund."

,Recommended,606800,34227166,Posted: 13 August,all,SammyMavrs,"Pretty fun game. In the state it’s in, you can get a lot of great hours of fun. I love the letters the developer put in there to personally talk to the player. It was a nice touch.The game is far from done but based on what I’ve seen, there’s a ton of potential here. One drawback I noticed is basically the end game. Once you’ve researched the top framework and all the upgrades, the game pretty much gets put on autopilot. What I mean is, you do some contracts to get money to make your product. You upgrade the product only when you need hype to sustain it in order to keep building that user base, then you move on to the next product and do the same thing. Once you have the products actually making a profit you pretty much just sit back and repeat the process of upgrading to keep the products hype up and people using your product. This is pretty late game and doesn’t take a while but the build up to this is loads of fun. Some balancing needs to be tweaked with the hype system hands down though. I stopped paying attention to it and I suddenly dropped from almost a million users to the 4 digit amount. This happens far too quickly in my opinion and needs to be changed a bit. You can counter this with Ads but upgrading lets you relax for a day vs the hours from Ads.This game has 1 developer so the amount of work put into this is amazing. I have no doubt that if more aspects of creating the products get put in, like Software Inc has, this game will be perfect."

I dont know if you guys know any of them or not I just want to let you know. Any more over 40 more employees the game have frame drops when not paused, and i have a 8 core PC so its not me. The game has a bit of a problem not saving or having a save set back. Those are 2 of the game breaking problems I have seen so far I will keep playing to find more to help out.Now for gameplay I found some problems that really get to me. First off the higher priced walls and corners are a bit off centered to the grid. This makes the corners almost not use able with out looking bad. The secound thing is the desks, need the ability to move if there not in use, also wasnt clear on how to delete them either. Now this one isnt a big one but it would help alot if you can have more then one location to expand the company. Maybe have a buy out offer from other companies to restart and have more replay value or have law suits or employee isssues that effect your compnay the give it more of a challenge.All in due time Im guessing but hope to see more updates.

I actually think it could be a great sim eventually, but with one dev it might be a while., will def look again in couple of months to see if it has progressed.The title is startup company but its focused for the moment on being a software developer (as it says in description!).. so its not about different sorts of companies in reality, not sure if that will come in future.    I found it particularly easy to get up and running and was making money pretty quickly but this was a little bit of a grind (which can be automated via a manager, which is a must).I felt though that this was about it ..either hire bunch of devs and designers and bid on contracts or design your own app / company ...  whilst not losing interest in it.. it just didnt extend beyond that at this point.I like the idea of building your office at adding items, and bidding on contracts is good idea but at this point felt a little guess worky in terms of winning them.. would be nice to have been able to judge what it costs to build a product vs the price the company is willing to pay to make it easier to judge whether to go low or high.. ultimately I found bidding high on urgent items was best strategy and forgetting those of lower value in the $3000 and less.Id like to see more work on the investment side, just going along and gettinga  loan from a bank (or actually with the interest rates so high it felt like a pay day lender!) didnt really feel like I had acheived investment in my company so more options there would be good.I like the idea and graphics but needs a bit more for me to pick it up again."

Can get irritating constantly having people on vacation.Best aspect of the game is the ""plate spinning"" aspect; keeping it all in balance.

Yet!I played this for a short time and watched a ""Let's play"" for an hour or so, and while it has potential, ""Startup Company"" feels like a clicker game at the current state. It is very text-heavy, most of the time you look at menue screens and tables. This is okay for a economy-sim, but I am missing one vital thing: the office does not feel alive, because nobody moves around. Just watch the trailer: it shows off a lot of the different interfaces and menues, but the office is rarely shown, because nothing is happening there.Example: you buy a coffee maker and this adds a few % on the productivity of your developers or something. Fine. Eco-sim, numbers, effects. BUT: I want to see the staff actively USE the new appliance I got them! -> They don't. -> I am disappoint.Conclusion: If I can't see my actions affect my peons workday (other than in numbers), it does not feel real.At the moment, the game is not ""alive"" enough and thus not for me. I will give it another try if and when more visual feedback is added, though. I would love to see people scurry about in my office. And I can see how this could be fun, because the basic gameplay seems solid - it just lacks flavor."

Sure its only ten euros  but im 6h in as im writing this and ive almost done most of what you could do in the game. The rest is just a grind which i belive you could finish in about 4h hours. But as i said the rest was mostly just a grind which isent that fun.Its also a bit too easy only the first hour of palytime is some what challeging but once you pay back your first lone and have enough empleyees to do contract constently it becomes extremly easy. You dont even have to take more loans that the first one you have to take in the begining of the game. I guess the game would be harder if you tried making an own product earily on in the game which i see no reason doing snice doing so is exensive and dosent make alot of money its smarter to just complete a bunch of contract until you are in the very late game. In the late game you dont have anything else to buy snice there isent much and the rooms are to small to bother spending to much money on furniture the employees desks will just cover 70% of the room. Its also a bit repetive which i think is a consequence of there not being alot of stuff to do.Overall i think its fun but it dosent have enouth content to juctify buying it. Im writing this in early access so keep that in mind the game isent finished yet and maybe we do get more content but as of right now i wouldent recommend it unless you are willing to pay 10 euroes for 6 hours of content which maybe is worth it but i think there are better games with alot more content out there for the same price.

Taking that into consideration, I have found this to be one of the worst games in a long time.  Each employee you hire needs to be manually told what to do until you hire a manager.  This is just boring, not tricky.  You then auto find contracts and either agree to take them or not according to the product your employees have made.This is a dull combination to have employees make items and then spend them in order to gain money.  I don't know why we need conference rooms or things to look nice.  The employees get cranky and you send them off on vacation.  That's pretty much it.In higher levels you can make your own systems, but again, the process is dull and repeative.  I've played all sorts of click games, sim games, tycoon games, and I don't need major advancements.  I just want to be entertained.  This is really the perfect type of game for me and it was a fail.

As only a few hours into it and you've pretty much gotten everything you need. However as said in game, this is a game made by a single person, so I would like to commend you on your efforts and think you've done a wonderful job. The game needs more, that goes without saying (although it has been said with the 'Early Access' tag, and people would do well to remember that).Some things I think should be worked on or added however;Selecting each employee can be a little difficult at times because it seems the camera pan option takes priority, so you may not be able to click on the employees if you move the mouse ever so slighty as you click. Also, having to click on the Sales Execs to search, accept, and complete each contract is some what tedious and a better system for this would be appreciated.It would appear as though the research team loses their functionality real fast, I researched everything and then did away with all of them as I didn't have a need for them and they were soaking up money without having to do anything (best job ever though).Completing contracts seems as though it is clearly the way to go with the amount per job ramping up at a reasonable pace, whereas the income for hosting your own product is very slow. I believe changing the system in which it's bases on to show highs and lows in user gain and loss would be better than a straight #user per minute based on hype %. I feel it would make it a little more exciting, kinda like hitting a 10 10 10 in game dev tycoon, not saying it needs to be the same, but hopefully my thought is conveyed.More options for specialisations would be nice, such as tending towards tv or web multimedia, or focusing on social media and so on.Larger workspaces in order to create better set out work spaces, rather than cramming your employees in to maximise space and filling what little is left to simply boost them. Plus of course more stuff to put in there (not a big concern in my opinion)Giving Managers the ability to command their team to create exactly what is needed for the current contracts automatically. Then perhaps making them either harder to get or just more expensive to have. Not that the game has to be fully automated, but of course not every CEO goes around telling each individual employee to do one specific task in order to complete a contract.Also the game seems to become some what resource heavy in the later part of the game, noticed some freezing and what not.Other than that, good job, as said.

,Recommended,606800,34178775,Posted: 11 August,all,PizzaPeter1998,"Game seems well built and look quite good. Goes into quite a lot of depth within financials, recruitment and managment however the start of the game is very demanding and requires alot of manual spamming before managers come in to play. There are no tutorials which caused me to atleast spend around 20 mins of trying to figure things out and how to get a flow going.One major thing is recruitment every 14 days or so I have to keep on recruiting which costs me money and time I cant afford within the game and becomes very annoying as I have to restart my production lines as in some cases I'll have 50% - 75% of the work force quite even though Im trying to add items in (which cost a bit) in order to make them happy.Overall adecent game which over time could potentially be pretty fun however I prefer the play style of Software Inc. as it is easier to manage, less spammy and a bit more fun to play."
,Recommended,606800,34180736,Posted: 11 August,all,Noxxys,"It's a great software development company simulation, very polished and pleasant to play. It's similar to Game Dev Story and all of its clones, but focused on web/mobile development instead of video games. I've completed contracts for the first few hours, in order to make money and hire a few solid teams (around 20 people). And then I started my first 2 products: ♥♥♥♥book and♥♥♥♥♥♥tv.You can hire different positions: developers, designers, dev ops, marketers, etc. Each one can produce different components, which can be assembled together into modules. Several modules are needed to develop your products and their features. Your employees are dependent on each other, and managers can both boost productivity and help you automate the smaller tasks.As a developer myself, in a similar tech company, I can say this is a quite realistic experience (on a high level of course). The only thing I don't find realistic is the fact that you can create components and modules in advance, even before you know what you will be working on. But the whole gameplay is based on this, and this is fun and balanced, so I don't think it should be changed.I would like to see more needs from the employees apart from their overall satisfaction. The work environment rating thing is too basic for my taste. More could be by using the various items placed in the office to fulfill  those needs. Please keep up the good work and top-notch quality!"

You can manager developers, DevOps, designers, marketers, … as in a real software company- Addictive! Once start playing the game. I cannot stop until I reach tier 10- Not too much micro-management. With the help of managers, you can assign tasks your staff automatically. However, you cannot just sit and see the game runs. Some micro-managements are still needed to complete contracts or upgrade your own software.Cons (I believe that most of them can be fixed in future releases):- There are too little personalities. All developers seem to be “full stack” and they can do all tasks with the same efficiency.- There is only one audio track- Characters always sit in one places. I really want them to walk around the office like what I see in “Software Inc”- The exterior design of the office cannot be customised.- Lacks reports and tutorials. As the game is currently in beta, we can wait for them later.- There is not tester role in the game"

Similar to Game Dev Tycoon and Mad Games Tycoon but instead of having a focus on different game types, the focus is on different website types such as developing modules for a streaming site, a social media or a shopping site.

I think it's a very good how this developer has created such a great game to get into. It keeps me on my toes so to speak. Having to keep up to date on what my employees are doing at all times is not easy, especially when they're getting tired and need a vacation. At the start is so easy to take off and forget you're in debt and it's a struggle to keep going. Once you get to grips with the game, it's very rewarding, especially when you've created your product and it starts to thrive via upgrades. Obviously it takes a lot of work keeping everybody happy, but when you have a great team behind you, you usually get better results.Well I thought I would add a little more to my original review about this game. I've read that some are calling this game 'too easy', well I can say I agree, but that's EARLIER on at the start. The real fun(hard work) starts when you have created your very own product. Then trying to keep it getting better via upgrades. And even then it gets much more difficult because you have to keep on top of your hosting & marketing of your product. If you don't you will lose your users that you already accumulated (as I lost over 400,000 users in 2 seperate days plus a heck of a lot of daily profit) and it's hard work trying to get them back and keeping them!So to those that think this game is 'too easy' think again, or at least try to play the game how it were meant to be played.I don't know this developer (apart from getting an email within the game) only his name Jonas, but congrats Jonas on creating what I believe is a stella job from you. It's so easy for many developers to give up on games that they create that they simply lose interest in. But I believe that you're genuine and will not only keep up the great work that you have provided so far, to me and others, but will even make this a better game than it already is ;o) Well Done Jonas!"

(If this feature is actually there I will remove this segment of the review)-And finally, while yes it has to be challenging, lead developers should not be a thing... lets take a look at software inc, in that game, you can either play it safe and only do contracts in the beginning, or be risky and put all your money into a product and hope to make it big, while this game on the other hand, forces you to start doing contracts at the beginning.which kind of ruins the fun, but not really, as it doesnt take long to get a lead developer! but it would still be nice to makeproducts right off the bat, instead of waiting until tier 4I hope you read this review dev!

I soon got into getting contracts completed with a build up of components to make some quick easy cash.Getting managers in is a key part of that for me, and something that helps the game feel less monotonous, leaving your employees to get on with it.My only con at the moment is that the employees feel a little bit lifeless, it feels like they need some animation, walking in, in the morning and back out again at night. Maybe walk to the water machine, or a managers desk. Something I hope is added further down the line.Another, comment, not really a con, is that when it goes through night mode, it gets a little too dark, this doesn't help if you want to do some admin during these hours, e.g. change tasks, build offices etc.Overall, great game with stacks of potential, and for this price it is an absolute steal!"

In my opinion i love this game as it is great to just chill out, relax and play this game for a short while at a time. It is nice to have something to always work toward and come across a few challenges throughout, it is a quite tricky game at first but once played for a bit, it is easier to pick up the jyst. Personally i enjoyed the aspect of working towards upgrading certain aspects. Another point i would like to make is that it doesnt all just revolve around making your own company, there is much more to it.I would definetly recommend this game if:a) You enjoy having your own customisable space (which at the moment isnt a large thing but has a start and hopefully will be worked more on).b) You fancy playing something by yourself for a while.c) You need to kill some time.d) You enjoy levelling up, upgrading and working toward something.However, i would not recommend this game if:a) You are wanting to get things done quickly and easily.b) You hate customisation.c) You want to play with friends (which stands as of now)All in all i think this is a great game and you will easily get your moneys worth. I would give it an 8/10 as of where it currently stands, rich in potential and has great content which could be worked on lots more and i have great hope for this game.p.s Any feedback on this review would be grateful :)"

Once you've researched all frameworks and features, Researchers are pretty much useless.

I am attempting to grow my own social media product - but it takes a long time to gain market share. So, the gameplay itself is starting to get a bit repetitive."

By comparison, Game Dev Tycoon’s gameplay is simpler in execution, but player choices have a greater effect.  After the first, hour or so of playing Startup Company can become an exercise in mouse clicking.  Especially as the user interface could still be polished up in a few places, but I would expect that from an early access game.I think that genre fans can buy this without fear, but those looking for depth in their games should avoid.  I look forward to seeing what the developers have in store in the future."

At this point in its development I think that the later-stages of the game still need re-working and more of a challenge to them, as it suffers from the typical simulation-game issue of getting too easy after a few hours of play. However, the first few hours of play are great, and this could be an awesome game if scenarios are added later and some balancing is done for the late game. For $10 it's worth it at this point, particularly if you're a fan of the genre."

,Not Recommended,606800,34235435,Posted: 14 August,all,Justice ♡,"The developer has stated in Discord that the game is slowly dying, and he expects it to die out really soon, and therefore he will stop development of the game (and just take the money and go away). Sad to see such a promising game turn to♥♥♥♥♥♥ but ah well. The developer has been sitting watchning streams the entire first week the game was out, instead of fixing game breaking bugs that has been reported countless times on Discord and Steam Discussions.That's usually what happens, same with the last 100 other Early Access games here on steam. I have a feeling this developer is delutional. Today he removed the best contributor in his community frm the discord (banned her actually), and removed all admins because quote: The game is dying, so I don't need help anymore.Do not risk buying this game. There's a ton of bugs, the only thing that makes this game remotely fun is the modders in the workshop."

Considering its in Early Access I'll give it a pass but it needs more polishingMy suggestions:-more office spaces and larger !!! really needed otherwise it looks cluttered as hellsome quality of life improvements like-sending all employees at once on vacation-modify schedule for all emplyees at onceand more but these things should be done asap

So I stop playing it. NO LONG TERM GAME.- no animations, no workers behaviour, they just sitting and moving hands. Fun at start but further brings boringness..- work office elements and placement have only percent meaning, nothing else so you can make just ant farm.- lack of product variability.. few option- lack of option, how to develop own products. There is only upgrading components without right meaning.- don't know where to put earned money- only few offices to choose, max 50 workers, there should be plenty- no random events (only workers are seek)- no competition feeling aura with other companiesAfter first hour playing- AWSOME GAME!After 10 hours playing - BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORINGIf you want short game without chellenge, go for it, If you want to spend lots of hours building world software company, go to other games.For me now this game is worth no more than 5E."

I was able to happily sink almost 20 hours into building up my company and earning potential. I enjoyed being able to slowly replace my beginner employees with better more productive expert ones and investing into other companies to increase my profit. There is quite a bit more to this game than what can be found out in a couple hours. If you're at all a perfectionist like me, and like to make things as efficient as possible, You will love this game. I've noticed that a lot of the poor reviews are coming from people that didn't play it long enough to see its potential, which is un fortunate.There's a few quality of life things that I would like to see added in the future, and I'm excited to see where this game could be in another few months. But even in the current state that it is in now, I feel that it is well worth the 10 bucks and I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys playing business simulator games."

Sorry, in your company, your boss say what you should do step by step?3) Mode of workers is terrible! 20th day, mode goes 0 and we should send them to vocation to full the mode!4) For setting the working times, we should employ HR manager. It's a great idea, beacuse bosses can make big mistakes on setting working times, so every company needs HR manager for this. In real life, if company don't have HR manager, can workers start and break working when they want?5) We can stock up codes!!! It's too much funny but in the game we can do it! In real life, company takes project and develop it as what client wanted. But in this game, there are some subjects/items/modules (how do you call it, I don't know), our developers allways write codes for these modules and we can stock up them. When we take project, if we have the modules that project needs, we can finish project immediately! I think the developers of this game don't have any knowledge or idea about the copy/paste functions or implementing dll to projects. Or the developers inside the game can see the future, and create true modules for future projects!6) We employ developer but s/he doesn't have any skills but we give some money, s/he would have immediately any skill.Some ideas:1) We can set the working times of workers. For this we shouldn't need HR managers.2) Weekdays and weekend should be seperated. At the weekends, mode of workers goes up. We can schedule weekdays, weekends and paid holidays (vocations) of workers. When we delevop HR managers, this schedule should be automatically prepared.3) Stock up codes idea should send to trash can. Developers should work after taking project and special for that project. Or they can work for company's projects.4) Developers should have skills and we can see them on searching. If we want to give a new skill to a developer, we should send her/him to training course. Adding skills cannot be completed immediately when we pay money.Best Regards"

It's one of those games where you look up and four hours have gone by.Installs easily, runs flawlessly, and the interface is easy. It has a bit of a learning curve, and you may experience a few false starts before you get the gist of the game, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.I'm hoping with future versions there will be more options for office design, as well as maybe some advanced sorting options for picking locations for workers. I'd like to be able to click on a workstation, tell it I want to to place a certain type of employee there, and be able to choose by senority or employee level. Also, it would be helpful to advance schedule things like release dates and allotted vacation times.Future versions of this game sound promising, especially if they build on the base they've already developed.  All in all it's a simply designed game with a pretty easy concept, and lots of room to grow."
