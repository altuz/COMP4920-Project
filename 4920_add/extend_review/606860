76561198048974498,Recommended,606860,32293927,Posted: 9 June,all,rjmacready,"The first thing you should know about Nephise is that it can conceivably be ""speed-run"" in under fifteen minutes, once you know what you're doing. Furthermore, even clueless ding-bats like yours truly can probably get 100% of the Achievements in under an hour, so I'm not going to pretend it's a game with a lot of replay value.It is, however, priced at a measly two dollars, less on sale or in a bundle, so only the whiniest of whiners should find reason to complain here. Suffice it to say, self-professed haters of short games and ""walking simulators"" should abandon this Store page at once, and spend that spare couple of bucks on yet another ""skin"" for that first-person multiplayer frag-fest you've already wasted three thousand hours of your life on.(Whoops, is my cynicism showing? Sorry about that. I've got nearly two thousand hours up on Left 4 Dead 2 myself, so I'm hardly one to judge. That said, I would never spend money on ""skinning"" a character I don't even get to see, haha.)Anyway, back to the review. Nephise is the fifth game released by Mr Tonguc Bodur, who is nothing if not prolific given that his first game (Drizzlepath) was only released in 2015. In his defence, he manages to keep things reasonably fresh from game to game, and this time out he's chosen to push the puzzles a bit more than before.This isn't to say that Nephise is anything more than a fairly ""light"" puzzle game, so again, anyone in the market for a genuine brain-befuddler may want to look elsewhere. It's mostly meant to be a relaxing wander through some lovely snow-drenched scenery, with a few small tasks to keep you busy while you do so. There's only a tiny bit more to it than that, so I won't go spoiling what few surprises the game has up its sleeve.If you enjoyed Tonguc's previous games, there's no reason you won't enjoy this one. I'd say it's one of his slighter efforts, but it made for a pleasant forty-something minute diversion just the same. I'm certainly of the opinion that his games work best when they're longer and more story-oriented - Drizzlepath: Glass and Drizzlepath: Genie being his two strongest efforts to date - but at least you know what you're getting with a Tonguc game. Someone give this guy a decent budget already, so we can see what he's truly capable of.Verdict: 6.5/10."
,Recommended,606860,30759987,Posted: 26 March,all,Toadflax,"This is a bizarre little game. Short, and very peculiar.""You are a young orb gatherer..."" What do you mean, you don't know what an orb gatherer is? Well, neither do I. But you gather orbs, that much is clear.The story contains neither sense nor logic. Beside gathering orbs, you have to correctly position four identical nude female statues (discreetly draped). Unfortunately, the statue's faces are turned at 90 degrees from their bodies. So it's hard to decide which way they're ""facing"" (clue - it's their faces you need to concentrate on, not their bodies).English is clearly not the developer's first language, but he's soldiered on and done his own translation, which his voice actor has faithfully reproduced. You'd think a decent voice actor (and this one is) would say to the developer ""Do you realise this doesn't make sense in English?"" But that didn't happen in this case. As a consequence, the narration is strange, and very idiosyncratic. You're never really sure whether you're deliberately being given incomprehensible clues, or whether the real meaning (indeed, the story) was lost in the quirky translation.The statues are clearly female. They're naked, for Heaven's sake. But the narrator keeps referring to them as ""Fellows""The developer is obviously a talented landscape builder, and the general scenery is very pretty. However, some of the model assets used make no sense at all. Why classical statues? Why the dog? I get the distinct impression that the developer has just found some attractive public domain models around the internet, and built some sort of vague story around them, without any regard to their relevance, or even their scale (when the puppy eventually stands up, compared to your character, it turns out to be bigger than a horse).On the positive side, the game works. For me, it was bug-free, and I was able to play from start to  finish without problems. As I said before, the landscapes are very pretty. On that basis, and because it's very cheap, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, and give it a ""Recommend"" - but only just.My score - 5/10"

Very realistic.CONS: No save feature. Can't RUN.  I paid for it.I knew what to expect but turns out I don't think I'd recommend even paying more than a few cents for it unless you just want to support the artist for the wonderful atmosphere. Good for people who like scenery games, but it may only take about 30 minutes. I can give you a hint to something in particular regarding statues, but if not don't read below:...The statues have their body faced one way, but their head turned to the side so it's kind of like a trial and error when figuring out when it's turned correctly. One has to be turned so it's body is sideways from the Inn, but its face is looking at its direction. The other has to have its body facing away from the Inn, it's face towards the back trail. I gave it away because it's kind of vague and you have to keep walking back to see if it worked and it stopped being a puzzle at that point and just kind of annoying."

Of his walking sims I have so far played Bottle and this one.It is a short game taking place in a beautifully made environment - courtesy of the 4th iteration of the Unreal engine.Puzzles here and there, great animations, winter time, soothing music and a (funny) twist at the end! Keep up the good work, monsieur!"
,Recommended,606860,34029789,Posted: 4 August,all,[slckr]robilar5500,"Alright. My journey through Tonguc's catalog continues. My current stop is at Nephise, a charming little tale that can realistically be told in about 15 minutes, but with which you could easily spend an hour simply taking in the sights.StoryAt it's heart, Nephise is the whimsical, lighthearted tale of a young orb hunter named Nephise, who enjoys a nice brew, gets some sleep, and then goes on an orb hunting adventure. Her exploits could potentially be the stuff of legends! For the purposes of this tale however, she really is starting off on what could be the road to legend.While quite simple, the story in Nephise is effective and amusing, and as such marks a bit of a departure from the more somber topic matters covered in the Drizzlepath series. While it isn't a fully realized story, I also don't feel it is necessary within the confines of this game. Perhaps if the series is explored in greater depth though, this will become more explicit in its conveyance. Nephise Begins is next on my list, so maybe things are even more fleshed out there.7.5 out of 10GameplayThe gameplay in Nephise is not so dissimilar to previous titles from Tonguc, but does actually rely more on puzzles and less on actual exploration. This is driven home by the small environs crafted for the game, which really just entails a small snowy forest area near an inn, and a brief subterranean system below. There is really just one primary puzzle, but it was pretty clever in design and relies on you doing what you should be doing when playing a walking simulator: taking in and observing your surroundings. If you do so, the puzzle will be pretty obvious in design. If not, you may be wandering back and forth for a little while trying to get it just right.Now, Nephise is an orb hunter, so you will be advised to embrace the role and find the orbs lying about the forest. There are ten in total, glowing red and pretty easy to find. My advice is: when you feel like you have found all of the ones you can, progress the story. You will find the remaining hidden orbs by doing so. Does this have an actual impact on the story? Not that I can tell. However, why not dive into the role presented, right?As far as functionality, this is once again another example of seamless programming. No technical issues whatsoever.9 out of 10GraphicsAs always, Tonguc's use of the Unreal engine is exemplary. This is a snow covered and beautiful world on the surface, with some interesting formations and a rad looking wolf. Once you go underground, the world really becomes stunning and somewhat different than I have seen before in a game. Really a unique and awesome looking experience. Also, the Inn itself, which functions as your intro story spot, looks quite rustic and nice.10 out of 10AudioThe audio in Nephise is pretty limited overall. That doesn't mean it doesn't sound great. It is simply limited in scope, which is consistent with the game itself, as it is very focused with limited scope overall. I thought the musical score was nice, and the old lady narrating sounded believable and fun all at once.9 out of 10VerdictI thought Nephise was a charming experience with a sense of fun and whimsy that I didn't expect going in. I quite enjoyed it as the first entry into Tonguc's second series of games. I am very interested to see what will happen next.8.875 out of 10, which of course rounded up will be 8.9 out of 10. I definitely recommend this if you want a peaceful and charming experience."
,Not Recommended,606860,31262417,Posted: 20 April,all,Bodomi,"Another poor walking simulator by the same developer that makes games that feel more like testing grounds or early alphas rather than complete games.There's not a lot to say, it's a short(~60 minutes) walking simulator that has an alright-looking world but♥♥♥♥♥♥poor graphics performance, which seems a trademark of this particular developer.And the only reason it has a half-decent world to look at is due to the engine and the copy-pasted assets, not due to any real work from the developer, as showcased by the cesspool he releases on Greenlight, and at the speed of which he does.The story is nice to listen to as background noise and for you to pretend you are spending your time productively, good voice acting though.A nice and relaxing soundtrack that becomes old and repetitive after 3 minutes.1 thing that you have to master if you're gonna create a good walking simulator is to make a beautiful world.This world isn't ugly but extremely stale and repetitive. You're looking at the same copy pasted piece of ground or tree or rock over and over.The puzzles in the game are quite simple and feel like placeholders, as if this was a demo or a concept for a grander project.I can't really recommend this at all to anyone except for the small subset of people, including myself, that for some odd reason feel they need to play each and every one of these walking simulator games no matter what the review score is."
,Not Recommended,606860,35428639,Posted: 2 October,all,Helevorn,"I didn't enjoy this game that much.It's a quite short first-persone puzzle adventure, but very very limited in choices and movements.Graphics are nice and there's a lot of options to customize them, but the main problem is that there's no setting.Basically there's a house, a cave and some winter looping forest and that's it.. so even nice graphics aren't a plus here.There's only one main puzzle, in which you have to rotate four statues with the clues given (no subtitles or anything - there's no dialogue at all).For the rest of the game (which is really very short, takes 20 minutes to complete) you only have to optionally collect 10 orbs shattered through the (super small) world and go into the cave after having solved the statue puzzle, swim a bit, and everything ends.It has really no story at all.Plus, you have no controls: wasd keys for movement and the left mouse button to do two or three things (open a door, move a statue); the space key makes you jump but the absence of obstacles makes the jump option totally useless.There isn't even a save feature by the way.I can't recommend this game, to me there's really too few things in order to consider it a ""true"" (albeit short) adventure. Only if it was free, but it's not.Props to Tonguç Bodur for creating the ""nephise"" word. I really don't know what it means but sounds nice."
,Recommended,606860,31968523,Posted: 26 May,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Nephise is yet another short walking simulator from Tonguç Bodur, the same publisher/developer who brought us the Drizzlepath series, a well as Bottle. They're known for making rather mediocre titles, usually within the $5-$9 range, although their new series of releases have been in the $1-$2 category.There's nothing inherently bad about Nephise, so to speak. You play as a woman of the same name, who travels to a nearby inn for a mug of ale and a good sleep before venturing out into the world to solve one statue puzzle that's made up of four different figurines. After that, you enter an underground portion of the game, follow a linear path, and that's all she wrote. The narration has good voice acting, and the story is short, simple, and concise with a funny little twist at the end. The game runs at a stable 60 FPS, the graphics are fairly decent (with the exception of the fur on the large wolf creature), and the music is a relaxing, melodic folk song.For half an hour, at most, of game time, it's really your choice as to whether or not Nephise is worth a pack of gum to you or not. While this title doesn't necessarily do anything bad, it is extremely short, linear, and all out mediocre. There's nothing stopping me from recommending it, but there's nothing in-game that urges me to tell you that you need to play it. It's just one of those take 'em or leave 'em titles; if you thoroughly enjoy your walking simulators, then you'll enjoy this small little title.Rating:3.0/5.0- Average, can take it or leave it.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

The screenshots looked promising and so were the visuals in game. The environment, either outside or inside of the cave, is carefully adorned with details that are a feast for the eye. Even if there is not much of interactivity, which is pretty normal for a walking sim though, the puzzle still ensures an inclusion of the player. The female voice of the narrator got the right pitch which goes well with the relaxing atmosphere. The length of the game is alright for its price."

This exploration experience is accompanied by a relaxing music score, and a simple story. There is a puzzle sequence included within the game which has some nice elements to it, and gives the player an incentive to explore. For those interested, I have a video discussing what you can expect from the game, and critiquing certain elements -https://youtu.be/Dtoa_uF-oTYThe game takes 20 - 30 minutes to complete, and although it does include a puzzle sequence, it is not overly interactive. While I hate the phrase ""walking sim"", the developer themselves describes their games as such.

,Recommended,606860,35432523,Posted: 2 October,all,The Real Tim Shady,"An interesting little tale... between this game and its prequel. There is not much story to be had, and the two games are only loosely connected through your character Nephise. To me, the story was more like a template of a story, but it was asking me to fill it in, and I wanted to do just that. There is much mystery surrounding this world and Nephise to me, and I've created my own characteristics about Nephise.What power does the orbs that Nephise collects give? Why or how has she killed things only by touching them. Is it voluntary or involuntary?Still, it's a simple story but a sweet and short one I enjoyed. It is accompanied by a small but sweet and soothing soundtrack. The graphics look fine, though the scenery can be breathtaking at certain spots. Some stretched textures and their use of parallax can be jarring on some cliffsides but overall looks beautiful.+bonus brownie points for GLISTENING SNOW.Is $2 worth just over half an hour of your time? Or is that soda bottle from the vending machine worth $1.75? You choose! Just make sure you dont make that comparison more than twice a month, then it might hurt your wallet ;)"

,Recommended,606860,33001216,Posted: 29 June,all,LyonHart,"At the end of the day Nephise is a perfectly fine Walking Simulator that's rather short, but if you like the genre enough and want something quick to play (and I mean quick, can be beaten in less than 30 minutes on your first try - quicker beyond that), then Nephise may hit the spot for players looking for that kind of experience. The scenery is rather pretty, though due to the tedious task of walking around collecting orbs and rotating statues, it can come off as a little boring. I'd personally wait for a sale, but I don't necessarily think the $1.99 asking price is particularly bad either, despite what others have been saying.I like to support Indie devs as much as I can, and I personally really like Walking Sims as they're relaxing to me and a nice change of pace from the usual craziness in more mainstream titles, but, to me, a great Walking Sim should be accompanied by a great narrative as well. Since there's not much in the gameplay area typically with this genre, the story is where they should excel at most. Nephise doesn't really do much here either, though I got a good laugh from the end (which I believe, and hope, was the intention). If there was a sideways hand I much rather give it that, but I'll give it a thumbs up instead since by no means did I hate or dislike it, warranting a thumbs down. Just know, even if you're a fan of the genre, this really won't be for everyone."

,Not Recommended,606860,35318831,Posted: 29 September,all,Uncle Sparticus,"I have a confession to make: I play every Tonguc Bodur game. I'm addicted. They're always Unreal asset flips, they are almost all the same (there's a cave sequence, dodgy narration, surrealistic lighting, alcohol references, statue-turning puzzles, and vague nonsensical metaphors in just about every one), and I just can't help myself but to play them all at least once.Nephise disappoints in a new-and-improved spin on Dan Pinchbeck's formula, though. It's a walking simulator where you barely even go anywhere, and it's a narration vehicle with nearly no narration. What it does have is a frustratingly dumb puzzle, a few shiny assets, and all the Tonguc Bodur tropes I have grown to know and love.You play as Nephise, a woman who loves getting drunk and getting 100% achievements on Steam. She <spoiler>falls into a drunken stupor and dreams that she does a boring puzzle, explores a cave, kills a man, and drinks more</spoiler> I MEAN spends the night at an inn and then has to do an extremely tedious puzzle.Here's where I give Bodur some credit for striking out in a bold new direction--there is more interaction than normal in this iteration of the TB phenomenon. You have to solve some riddles and collect ten (count 'em, ten) orbs that glow bright red in a totally white environment. But the puzzle sucks. You have to orient the statues in certain directions based on riddles you hear out of nowhere, but not the whole statue! If you do that, you will consistently find that it doesn't matter how closely you pay attention to the riddles, you will be sorely frustrated. This is because you must orient the statues so that their FACES point in certain directions, not the statue as a whole. I feel as though this is Tonguc Bodur's way of saying ""Nah-nah nah-nah boo-boo, I am smarter than you!"" It's deeply appreciated.If that weren't bad enough, you play as Warwick ""Nephise"" Davis and thus you walk at the speed of lint, so moving around the (rather small stock) map is a chore. Meanwhile, repetitive harp music and surprisingly crisp but repetitive crunchy snowy footsteps drill a jagged hole into your brain.TL;DR: This game means nothing. It brings almost no original content to the gaming scene. The narrator barely did anything and was of basically no importance from a stylistic perspective. Bodur does the things he always does only with even less effort (because, honestly, he normally arranges his stock assets with thought and care). If you know how the statues work you will finish this game in five minutes."

Alright nice snow crumble sounds tho and the narrative is nice to listen too but really. even 99cents feels weird to pay for this... 15mins of gameplay? It takes longer waiting for the 3 cards to drop.
