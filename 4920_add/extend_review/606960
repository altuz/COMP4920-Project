76561198022370609,Not Recommended,606960,32413141,Posted: 14 June,all,Tiny Trees,"When the games started up, and I was holding the gun, I though, ""Oh wow, nice gun"".It all went quickly downhill from there. Rather than writing a review, I'm just going to post my Steam refund request. Then you can see why I didn't keep it. (I played one hour.)Dear Steam,Quote, ""I can't turn off the music, and it's louder than the gun play. Basically it's because there are no settings or options at all. There is no settings menu.No settings means you can't alter the performance. Given the result is micro-stuttering and other stuttering, it gets ugly. For a game that's download is 663MB, you'd think my GTX980 could cope with the graphics.I kind of like the game, but it has other problems too. Like not being able to rebind keys. Crouch needs to be held down on the 'C' key. It doesn't toggle, meaning moving aiming and firing while crouched is just too hard. (Crouch should be left control, so we have four other fingers to move with.)Stuff like no crosshair, and the aim function make it very tricky too. Aim needs to be a tap of the right mouse. If you hold right mouse or expect toggle, you get a shock. Holding right mouse makes aim constantly switch on and off, meaning the gun starts flailing in front of you while you're being shot.Basically too much is counter-intuitive and I can't get on with it. It did crash as some players have reported. Just now I quit after a few minutes of play, because I literally could not cope with the music anymore.Sorry Steam.I try not to refund games, and I would rebuy this if the issues were fixed. Two of my other recent purchases I nearly refunded. However in the interests of not being pushy I played on with them.This game is just a sad waste of £5, since the premise is otherwise perfect."""

76561198038905471,Recommended,606960,32514763,Posted: 17 June,all,komoriblues,"I'm recommending only if you have patience for an indie title very rough around the edgies. There are no options to select game difficulty, no game settings and random crashes. Now that I got that out of the way the game at its core is a great experience. I'm having tons and tons of fun playing Crimson Metal. It feels fresh and violent. I'm enjoying it a lot and don't mind the challenge in it so far, but I'd really recommend the dev team takes a good look at improving some features or else I think it's going to be a tough sale which is a shame because the game itself is great.The level designs are thoughtful and you don't want to put the game down. The music is AMAZING. Honestly the game feels great and I hope more people give it a shot.There's a very good game underneath some of the more cumbersome snags. For myself personally, it's an easy thing to overlook but knowing how some players are I can see some things really standing out in the wrong kind of way."
,Not Recommended,606960,33801345,Posted: 25 July,all,Erotic Thoughts,"At the time of this review, its on sale.I saw it was somewhat like DOOM. I like DOOM. Its $3.49, so I figured to give it a shot.*breaths in* BOI DO I EVER REGRET THAT.At the beginning, you will be greeted with the main menu. You get 3 options, new game, load game and quit game. There is no option menu. None at all, no ability to change the audio, I would like to change it since I think its a bit too loud. The resolution is locked, graphics are pretty terrible which is strange from a game from 2017, its not even like its bad for an aesthetic choice either. It does take a few minutes to get used to the art style, but enemies are rather difficult to find.All in all:+it runs... i guess thats a positive+music is actually pretty good-One difficulty-enemies will shoot you through walls-long load times-the microsecond you are in their line of sight, you will take damage, there is no warning-controls are stiff and confusing, you get one loading screen explaining the controls and thats it-bugs like enemies spawning in walls-nauseating FOV-random crashing-clipping problemsDo I recommend this game?Lmao no. Don't buy it. Im serious, it terrible. I like to play bad games from time to time to blow off some stress, garbage like Shell Shock 2: Blood Ties, but this... This game is not enjoyable in any way shape or form. Save your money."

Not a way to adjust the resolution or other settings in the game. The game is just very basic, only lasted about seven minutes before I decided to get a refund. The ai seems to be buggy and no clear direction to head in."
76561198119221692,Recommended,606960,32696442,Posted: 23 June,all,Qilinas,"What a pleasant surprise! Can't believe this was made with FPS Creator!This game is retro breeze from the past but in a positive meaning.Pros:+ Old school feel+ Good lvl Design+ Awesome Soundtrack+ Brutal enemies+ Challenging situations+ Nice weapons+ Interesting secret areas.Cons (for some people but not for me):- No rebind key- 15 – 30 sec per load gameI wholeheartedly encourage anyone who are interested to buy it right away, especially if it's on sale."
,Not Recommended,606960,32049988,Posted: 29 May,all,Skiff006,"PROS:-The guns have some actual kick to them.-Health kits and ammo are plentiful.-You run at roughly 97 miles per hour, and you can actually reload while running.CONS:-The game looks like a mod for Quake 2, which makes the hyper-realistic viewmodel all the more jarring to look at.-Despite what I said about health kits and ammunition being plentiful in this game, the game is extremely difficult. Although you start with 1,000 health, the enemies in the first room can kill you. It's like if System Shock 2 and Serious Sam had an illegitimate lovechild together.-The environments are way too dark.-Your FOV is way too high by default.-If you don't save, then it's back to square one if you die.-There's no quicksave function. You have to go to the pause menu, click ""Save Game"", and click ""Load Game"" to load up that save. Even then, it takes, like, 5 minutes. For a self-styled ""old school"" shooter, not having a quicksave function in a game like this is like trying to drive a car without a steering wheel.- You can't customize your controls.- The game is horribly optimized. I run a system with an Intel Core i5-4690K @ 3.5GHz and a GTX 1060 with 6GB of VRAM that can easily run AAA games like Battlefield 1, Fallout 4, and DOOM at ultra settings at 60 frames and higher."
,Not Recommended,606960,33025077,Posted: 29 June,all,gamerstu,Terrible sound. Enemies look cheap. Player constantly gets stuck. Feels and plays like an alpha.
,Not Recommended,606960,32962463,Posted: 28 June,all,A. Lettuce,"This game certainly has potential but it fails to provide an entertaining experience for me.Pros:Enemies are challengingCons:Same sfx used for several different weapons (IE the starting rifle and pistol sound identical)No options to alter video, audio or any aspect of the gameCollision between player and the environment is incredibly buggy-Pressed space while swimming and was left immobile-Seemed to slide down stairs if I was not moving up them-Found it easy to become stuck in things like elevatorsNumerous crashes during gameplayAgain the idea behind this game is great; a vanilla old school shooter akin to Doom, Serious Sam etc.  But the game just seems unpolished and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to the point where I feel ripped off despite having only spent 4.68 on the game."
,Recommended,606960,33875732,Posted: 29 July,all,Scarlet,"If you like old school shooters you'll like this. Health packs, 90s graphics, weird collision detection. I will say the game does late some things, as I'm sure you've already read, but I'll say again, no in game way to change controls, no graphical settings and no audio settings. So if you have headphones on take them off, ALT-TAB and turn down the game manually unless you like to bleed from the ears. I'm only on level 6 but I am enjoying myself. Deaths aren't too common but I can see where some might find it difficult, if you remember the kind of damage enemies did in Redneck Rampage then you'll know how these enemies treat ya.Lastly I will say it does feel like the game isn't fully complete, on the Greenlight Page it stated 4 episodes with 10 levels each and here we are waiting on Episode 2. So, I believe dev should slap an ""Early Access"" sticker on this bad boy.TLTR:Great old school feelMay be difficult for those who didn't grow up on 90s gamesFeels like Early AccessNo Graphic/Audio/Control settings as of now.Headphone users bewareI personally think it's fun"
,Not Recommended,606960,33560290,Posted: 15 July,all,GrizzlyOne95,"Do keep in mind, I'll be happy to change this review if the game is improved.Its not good right now. Its got numerous collision bugs, such as getting stuck in vents or even on a random wall.The gun models are decent but pixelated, you cant pick up enemy weapons, you can't rebind controls, there are 0 graphics options too!I like the idea of this game but it's a cheap imitation of old doom with none of the polish.On a positive note the game has great music."
,Not Recommended,606960,33067455,Posted: 30 June,all,thewindow,"Laggy, terrible FOV, and slow moving. It didn't help that a random enemy spawn killed me. 0/10"
,Not Recommended,606960,34024487,Posted: 4 August,all,bowserevilking,"Posting my refund request here:Game isn't actually, or rather doesn't feel fast paced or old school, ai has pinpoint hitscan accuracy  which normally wouldn't be a problem, many old school shooters like doom have this, except for the fact that you don't have any accuracy, far from it. You have to aim down the sights which slows down your movement, takes up half the screen and in general feels like a pain to doIf you intend to hip fire good luck with that, because your accuracy without it is a joke, and don't forget you only have a few seconds to do it before the enemies will kill you. You can't even run and run with the machine gun!Speaking of running, you have to hold down shift to sprint! You can hold it down for as long as you want, there's no penalty for doing it either, what's the point? Why not just have yourself set to always run? I wanna sprint automatically and shoot enemies without having to aim down the sights. Just a little nitpick.The shooting itself  is subpar, there's no ragdoll physics, no enemies flinching when attacking and no gore, just some pixel blood sprays and a death animation that plays with it when you kill an enemy, no fun in that.Graphics are nice though, I really do like the choice of weapon designs used, they look clean and pretty.I could forgive the lack of options, the terrible music, the extremely linear level design but when the gameplay is held back by such things, thats when you have a bad game."
,Recommended,606960,32169008,Posted: 3 June,all,Lord Reven,"Very old schoolgood level designvery cool atmospherenot really a fan of reloading or having to sprint, don't care for looking down the sights(but I have not had a problem not doing so yet) and it has some bugs, but nothing that a good patch can't fixgreat job!"
,Recommended,606960,31550691,Posted: 4 May,all,SinisterSaint,"So far I have made it to Level 4 and it has been quite challenging so far. I commend the developer and game for literally throwing you into the fire with only the controls known to you.I love the music (soundtrack) and it really sets the atmosphere for the dark, enemy filled halls. There is a lack of in-game options/settings but I feel you don't really need them and if you REALLY want to change something just edit the setup configuration file.The graphics aren't the best but definitely fit the environment/genre it is built around, (reminds me of a sci-fi DOOM 95 without the hell part)Really the only complaint I have is that it crashes on Level loads about 40-50% of the time which requires a restart that doesn't take very long to get back into the action. I am sure this will be patched in future updates.Level 3 will have some players scratching their heads on where to get the key to finish the area. Where it is located is a brilliant/unexpected location.For 6.99$ I can't complain much since it is very challenging and will have more level installments in the weeks/months to come. This is actually priced right IMHO unlike tons of other titles that are AAA or Indie. This game will make you think about just running around corners and blind firing..... the items/ammo/health give just the right amount to get through a level.Madbox Entertainment KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!"
,Not Recommended,606960,33938062,Posted: 31 July,all,zero7229,i dont know if this game is any good or not. i struggled thru 5 minutes just to write this review. there is no mouse inverting which makes a fast paced shooter impossible to play. no control custimizing either which is minor compared to the mouse aiming.
76561198097064186,Recommended,606960,31551672,Posted: 4 May,all,Vorobei,"I knew that the game will be not perfect from the beginning considering it's FPS Creator. But i have a great time playng it. Yes sometimes it feels clumsy, but i understand it's just the engine limitations. It feels that the developer tried to bring a dark sci-fi atmosphere, and he did it wright! The music and sound effects are awesome, the level design is great. Hope that next time they make a game on better engine!"
76561198119386850,Recommended,606960,31628736,Posted: 8 May,all,[UA] zZaGOR,"So far so good. Really liked game pace, old-school feel, level design (love hidden areas)) and atmosphere. Soundtrack deserves special credits. Dont have problems with loading time - 20 sec per lvl. Game is challenging, no hp-regen, crosshair and other softcore crap. Ran out of ammo at the beginning of second lvl =) Game has some minor issues due to engine limitations, but overall gameplay is really enjoyable."
,Recommended,606960,31553207,Posted: 4 May,all,DarkkevinC,"so, Im going to make this short and simple, because I only have a few things to say for the moment.The game itself has a very retro feel to it. Almost like a combination between retro doom and retro quake. Its very fun! The gameplay is brutal, and even though you start with ""1000 health"", enemys shred through you from across the entire room. so its definantly a game where you need to constantly be aware of whats around you. Also secret rooms spotted across the levels offer ammo and health, so I definantly recommend looking out for those.HOWEVER, at the moment, the crashes are just too unbearable for me to continue playing. It mostly happens when you load a save. Also sometimes when you die, you just magically teleport to the start of the level, and the only thing to do to continue playing is load your last save, which brings us back to crashing. I got to the middle of level 8, and considering the circumstances on that level (no spoilers for you!), I died ALOT. I would be fine with dying alot, because its a challenge and thats to be expected. However, Im not fine with my game crashing everytime I re-load a save after dying.so, TL;DR; Game is extremely fun. It feels like old school Doom and Quake put together, but sadly the game crashes every time I die and re-load my last save. If the devs could fix the crashing issues, then the game would be the enjoyable hardcore shooter challenge that it was ment to be, and I would definantly start playing it again. But untill that update comes, this games going to be sitting quitely in my library gathering dust."

,Recommended,606960,31552369,Posted: 4 May,all,dmaple,its pretty well made considering that it's using FPS creator assets and it has a pretty hard difficulty but its a great game

Very hard/challengeCons:1.Graphics are not that good2.Lots of bugs3.Only one difficultly settingGame is not worth full price. I only recommend the game if its on sale.
,Not Recommended,606960,34744381,Posted: 4 September,all,XxSUGARSPARKxX,"This game is horendous. The controls and gunplay are awkward, the weapons feel broken and unresponsive, but my main complaint is actually how hard it is. The game gives you 1000 health, and about 100 bullets to start out with, but in a single encounter, you're probably going to loose about 200 health, and 40 bullets. I like challenging games, but this game is so unbalanced that the only challenge is keeping your sanity long enough to hit 20 headshots in a row with an automatic weapon with zero accuracy. The levels have minor exploration, but for the most part is just really linear with almost no depth.I can't recomend this game to anyone."

,Not Recommended,606960,34726280,Posted: 3 September,all,AgentOfAsgardia,"Pretty much unplayable. The FOV is weird and skews the view when you look up and down. You can't hit the broadside of a barn while hip-firing, so this really isn't an old school fps. I couldn't get past the first area of the first level, it was just too frustrating. There's also not a single setting you can change. Pass."

Cons and pluses of the game.1) Plus: Models of weapons and mutants, I really liked their unusual.2) Plus: A lot of shooting.3) Plus: Walk on the floors and wonder what you are waiting for behind the mysterious doors and uncover them openly, and there you are waiting for mutants and you in the punk shoot all the clip in them and try to hide from them ...This is very cool.4) Plus: The sound design is great for a dark atmosphere.5) Plus: Very hard in a good sense.Now about the minuses1) Less: No settings.2) Less: I almost do not see any enemies.3) Less: Departure from the game.4) Less: FPS ...5) Less: Long time of loading.I am sure that most of these drawbacks will be corrected in future patches. And so the game really liked.I advise everyone to play!"
