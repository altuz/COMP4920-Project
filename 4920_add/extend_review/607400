The levels are progressively harder, but every time you die, you begin right before your challenge. That may sound easy, but it must be said, the challenges are not forgiving at all.With the game progression, there are abilities unlocked, such as double tap for a sprint/jump, two key pressing for a limited jatpack or destroying blocks wich you didn't know they could be a new passage.The levels are well designed, with enough complexity to make even the more experienced sweat.If you like the genre, you will most likely like this game."
,Recommended,607400,34672264,Posted: 1 September,all,NoodlePantryLife,"Necrosphere is truly something unique and quite the fun ride. From bubble jumping to fireball dodging, this game is a well rounded experience with lots of fun surprises and challenges. The mysterious story and the fantastic presentation really rounded this game into a full and special experience like no other. Though the Metroidvania mechanics themselves are pretty bare, the selling points of this game like two button difficult gameplay are plenty of reason to give this game a shot.In the madness of all of the big releases this year, this game definitely holds its own and was a fresh little experience to play in between. If you enjoy platformers or Metroidvanias, I'd say this is totally worth a playthrough.Pros+ Unique control scheme+ Clever mechanics+ Visuals and sound create an immersive atmosphere+ Unexpectedly good but minimal storyCons- Can get minimally repetitive- Some mechanics and detection can feel sloppy and improper at times- Basic MetroidvaniaYou can find the full review athttps://www.keengamer.com/article/17016_necrosphere-review"

The levels are well designed, and the two buttons concept is WAY more challenging than it appears on first sight. Finding this game was really a pleasure. Kudos to the developer, I just wish there was a mobile version."
,Recommended,607400,34887486,Posted: 11 September,all,Sae,"♥ I love to hate this f &*% game! ♥I've shouted at it so much that I don't even wanna shout at traffic jams anymore. Better than meditation.This game is easy to learn but hard to master.It's about an agent trying to scape a limbo-ish place... He is kinda dead already btw, but he keeps on dying so many times!Surprisingly it's not frustrating at all, because you have so many checkpoints. It only gives you even more will to try it again.The genius level design clearly shows to your face where you're screwing it up, but it's just so hard to make it right, so you keep on trying again and again and again.Till you finally get the timing right and run around the house in celebration scaring the hell outta your dogs... and neighbours if it's 4am.What the heck am I doing with my life? I hate the devs xD ♥"
,Recommended,607400,34660977,Posted: 1 September,all,harry,The level design is pitch perfect and the game uses interesting concepts like the zombies.My only issue is that I don't feel like I am exploring a non linear place like in metroid.

,Recommended,607400,34682518,Posted: 2 September,all,Alice,"Necrosphere is absolutely unforgiving. It's sometimes frustrating, but when you get it, it's soooo incredibly satisfying. When it's going well you don't want to stop because it's fun, and when you're failing the same series of jumps over and over again you don't want to stop because you ""almost got it"" and because you don't want to give up.The only real flaw I found with it is that sometimes you backtrack and when you go the wrong way you have to do a 'level'/part again because you can't go back to the entrance.Still, only a minor inconvenience.The game is total level design porn, would definitely recommend if you like crying in frustration but like, in a good way."
,Recommended,607400,34696105,Posted: 2 September,all,Sandrinus,Awesome game! Simplistic two button controls grant it an elegant design. Level design is also top notch :D ! I totally recommend!
,Recommended,607400,34685930,Posted: 2 September,all,Mark Venturelli,"I've played a LOT of this during events and such, and being able to finally play it at home is amazing.This game is just perfect. It blends exploration and discovery of a Metroidvania with minimalistic and tight controls, coupled with a hard but very fair difficulty - instant revive time, perfectly-placed checkpoints, devious and smart level design.It is the mix of Super Meat Boy and Metroidvania that you never new you wanted, the two-button controls make it very unique, and it has a KILLER soundtrack to boot.Please do yourself a favor and buy this game."
,Recommended,607400,34756964,Posted: 5 September,all,GabCap,"What an incredible game!With only two buttons this game would be expected to be quite empty.Happily the game designer keeps throwing in everyone's face the power of a smart and fun level design.The soundtrack is another rare gem, every song is immersive and brings up some kind of emotion.I strongly recommend this game to anyone who whats to find some challenge and have fun in the way."

76561197962902136,Recommended,607400,34743362,Posted: 4 September,all,GeneralMeliante,"So, you think dying in Dark Souls is common? Well, you're in for a new definition of dying.First, the game is about a dead man in a sort of limbo situation. The benefit? He can die as much as he wants. I'd say it's a game about and undying agent dying nonstop.Secondly, I would say the game captures the pain of playing battletoads minus 80% of the frustation because in this game you have a checkpoint about 100 pixels away on every situation.To sum up: I started playing and simply couldn't alow myself to do anything else other then finishing it. Took me 3h and 1081 deaths and left me with a superb sense of accomplishment.20/10 Strongly recomend"

,Recommended,607400,34744613,Posted: 4 September,all,andre.piltsen,"Metroidvania meets Twin Peaks meets VVVVV meets Super Meat Boy. The game is tough. You will die... plenty and thousands of times. Having said that, the level design is really well planned and every puzzle will challenge you more than the previous one. You will die dozens of times per challenge trying to figure it out. But when you finish and complete a challenge/puzzle... it is so satisfying. And all of that with only 2 buttons. Really recommended. And the soundtrack is amazing. Thumbs Up!"

Fun to play and watch, since my girlfriend couldnt stop laughing at my thousands of deaths.Although it is not my type of game it is very addictive and it makes you want to play till end it(not there iet)."
,Recommended,607400,34891462,Posted: 11 September,all,๑۩۞۩๑,"Best hidden gem I found in Steam recently.Takes the best of a metroid-like game and boldly presents it as a two-buttons only game.It is also specially made with speed runs in mind.As of now, I can't recommend any game more than this one."
,Recommended,607400,34726574,Posted: 3 September,all,Gabriel,"This game is a must buy if you are into sadistic platformers, like Super Meat Boy. It's super challenging, mostly because the level design is very carefully planned to make you get angry with the game, for a few seconds, and then you come back and try again. It is super simple to play, because it only uses 2 buttons, but it's bloody difficult.Also, if you are into speed running, it's a good game to do that.Pros:- Level Design straight from hell- Pretty neat soundtrack- Responsive controls- It's super cheap!Cons:- It's not for everyone, though that's really not a problem, right?Honestly, for this price, it's a must buy."
,Recommended,607400,34746315,Posted: 4 September,all,R0D_Costa,I am not a big platformer player at all. Altough I caught myself playing this one for hours!Brilliant level design.Definitely bang for the buck!
,Recommended,607400,34826047,Posted: 8 September,all,Suttles,"A short and sweet platforming metroidvania, similar to VVVVV.The game's gimmick is there's only two buttons -- left and right.  The level design is created in such a way that this isn't a problem, as there's bubbles that make you jump and various upgrades that improve your mobility.  The game is difficult and requires using the games mechanics to get through.I beat it in about 3 and a half hours, but I enjoyed just about every bit of it.  Challenging and kept introducing new concepts to keep me entertained.  I think a game like this would be amazing with a level editor, adding hours and hours of content, and it's honestly a shame that it doesn't have one.If you enjoy well made platformers that are actually challenging, Necrospshere has pretty much everything you want.  If you are truly hardcore, there's achievements for speedrunning, and not dying.  For only $5, I felt like I easily got my money's worth.Oh, and the music is also amazing."
76561197972276575,Recommended,607400,34983447,Posted: 15 September,all,marclev,"This game is great, and it's outrageous value for money. There are only two buttons, left and right (initially just to move in the corresponding direcition, but you can eventually double tap them, and hold them both at the same time, for new abilities as you unlock them).The game thus has one of the easiest control schemes in PC gaming, but the perfectly tuned difficulty curve quickly makes sure that you will be tapping those buttons like they're going out of fashion. By the end of it you will be pulling off maneuvres that you will look back on in awe, occasionally while being chased by an angry fireball that makes sure you're not getting too comfortable.It took me around 4 hours to complete the main story (I'm now working my way through the DLC) and according the credits I died 1200+ times trying. But that's not a problem, because the checkpoint placement is great, so even though you will occasionally scream at your screen with rage, you never have to repeat more than necessary for a given section as you try to master it.Only downside would be that beause there's no map, I did occasionally struggle to work out where I was meant to go next, especially when going back to earlier areas to find some previous obstacle after I received a new ability that would let me get past it. But that's nitpicking, the game is fantastic.Buy the bundle with the DLC as after you complete the main game you will be wanting more, and the DLC ups the difficulty curve even more, but in line with where you finished the main game."
,Recommended,607400,34722457,Posted: 3 September,all,orlandojr,"The level design is so perfect and unforgiving that it hurts, literally. The soundtrack is amazing and the gameplay is so well rounded, it's the kind of game made for videos and rage reactions, but it's so cool to try it another time, just like in Super Meat Boy.One of the best Brazilian games to date! Very well done sirs!"

You can play and notice how sofisticated it is, many times while playing you will be like ""ooohh, i see what you did there"", this if you dont stop like me as soon as you notice you cant jump and then you doubt if its worth to play a game where you just move sideways like a ♥♥♥♥ing crab, but later there are some stuff that makes you jump.Anyway, its well done. Its not what i expected. I will tell you something, the guys who did this, they enjoyed ""Pain Olympics"", a video from around 2004 where a guy exploded his testicles, ok? This is the kind of mind that is behind this. They are really intelligent and witty guys, you see the puzzles and you can tell this game was made from people with high intelligence, but they are holding themselfs. Its like Louis CK on a first date meeting his gf parents, you wont be able to see his full potential, like when he talked about bag of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc.Anyway, i shouldnt curse so much, this is a very well made game, not my style but i can tell its good, i hope they do a continuation with no limits or politeness. Well, one of the guys who did this became a vegetarian, so maybe he changed and is not into hardcore stuff anymore, i would like more hardcore stuff.If anywone wanna add me to trade bubblebutt pictures, lets do that, im into that stuff."

It was challenging, fun to play and totally worth the money.It can be a little bit frustrating because of the lack of help signs and instructions. Sometimes you can get stuck and have absolutely no clue of what to do next. But as soon as you get the hang of it everything becomes natural and intuitive."

,Recommended,607400,35063119,Posted: 19 September,all,tearfromthered,"Overall the experience is good. The first seconds in the game are great. The controls are tight and fun. The user feels in control. The graphics are both attractive and keep the level design ""readable"". The progression / difficutly curve / New powers flow is greatly done !It's a pleasure to discover the new Level design ingredients to make the game works with only two buttons being used.Things that were not great for me:backtracking in the game to use your new power in a new zone is quite hard.The lack of map AND the lack of teleporter / respawn at entrance feature makes it kind of frustrating once of twice in the game. Nothing major but it's a small issue.The dash feature is quite hard to use : double clicking a 360 trigger between two ""holding"" of it is not very precise sadly. Mixing that with the jetjack makes it almost impossible to have a ""perfect"" air control of our character."
,Recommended,607400,35196960,Posted: 24 September,all,baby jesus,"Necrosphere is like super meat boy turned into a metroidvania.The level design is flawless, the music is great, and the graphics do what they need to do.The only real qualm I have with it is the two-button design, while it works ok, would still work better with a dedicated button to dash/jetpack rather than relying on double taps and holding both buttons. So the controls are just a bit awkward when it demands so much precision in the platforming, more difficulty comes from a missed overly complex input than the level design itself."
76561198055195497,Recommended,607400,35095675,Posted: 20 September,all,anarchobama,"Like VVVVVV adds a new twist to 2D platforming by restricting the mechanics in an interesting way, in this case limiting control to just two buttons. Manages to be managable despite the high difficulty because of extremly generous checkpoints. A very good game that earned it's way to being one of my favorite indie games in recent memory."

You can't use a controller and double tapping the buttons is often inconsistent. Its almost like the developers realized their game was too short so they added in this feature to keep people from beating it too quickly. That being said, the level design is great and the game is probably worth $5."
