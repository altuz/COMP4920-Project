76561198086758882,Recommended,607880,34909192,Posted: 12 September,all,Zappieroth132,POSITIVE NOTE! Specification requirements are way above what you need!ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING! This game uses a 3-4 year old engine! This engine has been reused countless of times in their SAO games (Fatal Bullet is NOT gonna reuse it) thus it is quite obvious (for me anyway) that the system specs are simply invalid. Need I remind you all that there is a port of all their games optimized for the PSVita.Playing this on a:- GTX 670- i5-3470- 8GBMAX settings solid 60FPS.It's SAO it's PC it's a good port what more do you want?!Been dying for a SAO or good anime game on Steam and it seems that it has finally hit!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dtnazq6E1U
,Recommended,607880,34913910,Posted: 12 September,all,Asrei Murasame,"This is a direct sequel to Sword Art Online Lost Song with numerous improvements to the gameplay. While maintaining a lot of the aspects of it's predecessor. It has a large character cast from Sword Art Online and Accel World. The story isn't bad. It start's off as Kirito and Asuna trying to save Yui who has been kidnapped which leads into a larger plot involving both the SAO and Accel World team.I have not run into any crashes, or glitchs so far and I have some hours into the game. It does, however, require a decent PC to play.I'm on a GTX 1080, Intel i7-4790k, 16 Gb of DDR3 @2400 MHz, using the latest Windows 10 and I have no issues with lag running the texture resolution (HUD rendering name in the console) @4k while running the game in borderless mode with all settings maxed out. My screen resolution being 2560 x 1440 on a XB270HU. My average FPS is between 65 and 70. Hope this helps for those wondering about requirements.For those who do have better PC's I recommend running the game's texture resolution at 4k it greatly increases the overall sharpness of the game 1920x1080 texture resolution being somewhat blurry. Also I highly recommend a controller over the keyboard can be difficult to use. I am currently using an ancient Xbox Windows Edition controller and have had zero issues at all.If you have any questions about the game feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer them."

,Recommended,607880,35033213,Posted: 17 September,all,Xaffire,"After a few hours of playing this game I can certainly say I was skeptical about how my PC would handle it. The ""minimum"" Graphics card needed says GeForce GTX970 4GB which, for me was out of the question upgrading from my GeForce GTX 950 2GB and my CPU is a very basic low end G3200 @3.00 GHz from the recommended Core i5. I'm very glad I didn't run to my local MicroCenter and drop 300$ for a GTX 1050 which I was debating on buying.My game runs smoothly with basic mid settings no issues on my end to report. Graphics overall are amazing the game play is above average switching in battles. Story is moderate at best don't know if its the original voice cast from both series but from my short time playing I want to say/think the whole game is voice acted.Pros:Voice ActingEasy To LevelMoney MakingMassive RosterField Platforms Heal YouCons:Flying Is Somewhat Of A ChallengeLack Of Avatar Weapons (LOL)Accel World Characters Can't Fly (Except Crow haven't used Sky Raker Yet)Leveling Is Easy Seems Pointless (Took Down A Level 200 Boss With Party @ Level 140 Each)Overall my opnion of the game is positive, I guess a lot of people are giving it a alot of dirt due to the requirements to run the game which I agree were set to high but, like most ported games PCs have superior power to consoles."
,Recommended,607880,35078336,Posted: 19 September,all,Miporin,"AW vs SAO is a charming action-rpg title for janime fans. You don't have to watch AW, nor SAO to enjoy the story. Here is my opinion.ControlsThe control is a bit awkward, need some getting used to time. It can be played with kb+m with some bindings, but the game is designed with controller in-mind, so it is better to use it.StoryIt is nothing new actually, but I am interested in how they are putting this together. I would say, they did a good job with some twists. I would love to watch this as anime too. XDGameplayIt starts off a bit slow, but getting picked up in a reasonable pace. The game is quite casual though. You can do whatever you want at your own pace.The combat is simple, and enjoyable. The AI is a little annoying though. The loots, and the grindings are there as well. The game has more detailed customization than it meets the eye. There are many characters available to play with. (~40)PerformanceOne of the decent ports. Graphic Settings, Key Bindings are featured. The performance issue seems to be a result from how the game engine is handled, not the porting. The constant loading/unloading of area, objects is clearly designed for non-PC hardware. You will notice this during gameplay, though it is not that bad as some have claim to be. My PC, i7 7700/16gb ram/gtx 970, can run this without problem. 30 hours, 0 ctd, that is good for me :-)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1134973502Here is my first hour in.OverallTL;DR : The game is good, yet casual. If you are fans of the series, or anime games in general, I am positive that you will enjoy playing this."

Ive been anticitpating this for ever thank you devs for bringing this amazing game.The only issues I do experance is somtimes my special moves dissipear from my charecters less I restart the game, controll scheme is difficult to get used to but Its nothing to turn me away (unless you dont have a controller you need one to enjoy it in my oppinion 50$ for wirless xbox360 controller at bestbuy with adapter), and lastly camera can be weird at times."

I wont lie the price tag on the game is a little steep considering it a import from a console and the game been out for awhile. But  overall im enjoying it :) Fun game to just sit back and chill and enjoy your fav animes that you wished would come out with more seasons but you know they never will or take ages to do. :) If money aint an issue, sure go for it... Fun chilled game. If money is an issue, just wait for a sale :) I also recommend using a controller... Keyboard might be a little annoying!"

,Recommended,607880,35001105,Posted: 16 September,all,Axel,"Played the vita version before this but wanted to play a few hours of the pc version to properly review the game.I really like Sword Art Online. So when I saw that they brought one of the games to pc, I could'nt not support this game. I knew what AW was, but haven't taken the time to read it yet. Of all the SAO games that namco has released, this is probably the one I enjoy the most. The gameplay feels fun, the shear amount of characters offers a wide variety of playstyles. the story is better than some of the others they have released, but I ussually dont play these games for the stories. All in all I think its a solid game for any SAO fans. Don't worry if you arent an AW fan. They are basically special guests in the story, and are introduced enough to understand the story.Now on the technical side of things...Overall the port seems pretty solid, havent really run into any bugs. The launcher is kinda confusing when it comes to geting your graphics settings set up, but once they are it runs great. Graphics are about what you would expect on a ps4, with 60 FPS at all times (sependent on pc specs). On that note i do think it would be nice to release a demo/benchmark for the game so that people can stop asking ""can i run this?""FINAL VERDICT/TL;DR===============Overall solid game/port. Great gameplay, great soundtrack, alright story, and stays true to the source material. 8/10 namco please bring more of the games to PC!"

Don't expect mind-blowing graphics or groundbreaking gameplay (visuals are nice though).  Performance is a consistent 60 FPS with an i5 4690 and an R9 290.From the very beginning, was able to put Asuna and the other girls in swimsuit outfits.  10/10"

Haven't completed the game but so far I'm really enjoying it.. however you need really need a controller to play the game. I tried playing with keyboard & mouse and gave up after 5 mins, keyboard for moving the camera really? Haven't played any of the other SAO games and from what I can tell the story doesn't seem to be connected to them. The gameplay does get a bit repetitive over time but you unlock new skills and characters which keeps it fresh/progress through the story.Accel World > SAOSky Raker > all:)"

I'll still probably end up playing it because by this point I actually can't refund it but to anyone else I have to say don't buy it.You would be better saving your money for SAO Fatal Bullet coming out next year which firstly actually looks decent and secondly is actually being made for PC and not just a port which appeared out of the blue or you could go and buy Hollow Realization on PS4 which I can actually recommend.Pros -- A Sword Art Online game on PC- Has a lewd Asuna and Lizbeth CG- Has a memorable scene where a couple SAO and AW girls talking together realise they are a haremCons -- This is just Lost Song DLC minus actually having Lost Song- Massive FPS issues even on high end systems- Quest instructions that make finding the box of money in Shawshank Redemption seem easy- Combat switching between ground and flying is really annoying as it becomes hard to land hits on enemies who suddenly fly up- STAGGER LOCK (If you get hit by anything inside a dungeon prepare to end up like Sachi)- Klein gets ****blocked again and that guy really deserves to get a win by this point

A to go up, double a to go down meaning you go up then go back down about 1.5 times as far as you just went up, or cancel wings and freefall before activating. Good luck being on the same plane as your opponent. This game is garbage, wait until it's 10 bucks to check out the storyline, even the hook at the begining is insanely underwhelming."

,Recommended,607880,34910915,Posted: 12 September,all,Cheese Kimbap,"well... gameplay is great. you can fly, u can play with ur friends, have 4vs4 pvp also.i play with controller but its kinda hard to control my chara, maybe because i just not used play this game.and i`m using i5-6500, GTX 1060 3GB, 16GB RAM. usually FPS is about 50-60,but sometime when i fly high or so much mob showing, my FPS drop to 30-40 this is quite annoying.and why i can't change fullscreen Resolution to 1920 x 1080 ? at Fullscreen reso option max is 1600x900but i can play at reso 1920x1080 borderless or windowed, its kinda weird or just me dunno how to setting it up?but i love this game 9.5/10"

The port is crap, its buggy, has no 1080 fullscreen support. The story and the game itself are fun, but with such half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥efforts on making a port its not worth more than 20 euro. Wait for a sale or get it on PS4 if you have it."

76561197981515050,Not Recommended,607880,34938965,Posted: 13 September,all,Delta Force 95,"Hot Dumpster Fire, not even hot trash.  I never got past the second fight since the control scheme is as unintuitive as a guitar and a brick.  Mouse controls unusuable and you have to set up some weirdness so that you can turn with mouse.  Tons of layered controls shortcutting to each other to activate spells, switch character, its all just so so messy.  I was excited for this, been an SAO fan since 2013(yes late in the game) but now I have everal of hte manga and all the english books as well as blue rays.  Yes I enjoy SAO that much but if this was my introduction to either SAO or AW I would be like NUPE.  Maybe a modder will come along and fix it and I'll get it another go."
