If you are like me and played the drums in school but were never very good at reading music try this game.  Honestly though the songs are nothing I would normally listen to but are not bad and fun to play.  Game give a good job making you feel like a natural. Highly recommend."
,Recommended,608370,32424252,Posted: 14 June,all,R3V3NG3R,"Loving this game! Its forgiving when you miss or hit something else, you can hear the mistake yet it blends in track that sometimes, that wrong hit makes it sound interesting. There are couple tracks I could play non-stop but many are not of my favorite. I like Manhat10 - Dream the most so far and wish that the developers would add a youtube or another choice of playing any songs we type in search field. So far its very limited in tracks and the game lacks training tracks, like youre being thrown into chaos straight from the start even if the songs start on easy and you need to work yourself to normal and hard via higher scoring. Kinda disappointing, as youre just throwing your arms everywhere. But I know this isnt a teaching drums game, its an arcade just like guitar hero and you miss the pedals. I thought triggers would do the trick, or that it unlocks in tougher difficulty, nope, sadly its not there. Still, the game is fun and actually, going to play few more songs before sleep. Its quite late as you can see the time of my review posting. Great game! Would recommend YES! Definitely, I have it in BEST VR category of my games, good job devs, but PLEASE DEVS give us the option to play any song like other song games do. Drums, bass and hights should not be hard to be generized, or? PLEASE CONSIDER THIS as the list of songs so far is too low, and my selection limits it to less than number of fingers on 1 hand :((((((((( I want MUSE, Metallica and lots of others like Deadmau5, you cant please everyone so please add the option!"

It's so large that it just puts you off straight away. Even though I'm playing it perfectly in time the game thinks I'm too late and it breaks my combo.Then when it wants you to play a roll or a fill the whole thing just sounds like a muddied mess that's completely out of time with the song.I've read they've reduced the delay with v1.1,  I hate to think what it was like before but this is still not playable.Such a shame, i was really looking forward to a good drumming game in vr so I can keep myself limber.Maybe in 6 months I'll try again..."

,Recommended,608370,30705960,Posted: 24 March,all,FuntCase,"Just bought this game out of pure impulse as i'm a drummer myself and absolutely love playing things like Rock Band etc etc..PROS:- Very fun.- Visually not too disturbing and off putting when trying to concentrate on the specific hits you need to make.- Looks failry good graphically in the levels.- Very smooth and has a vey good possibilty of longevity value to it.CONS:- Drum hits you make do not sync with the audio at all, it's actually delayed by 1/8th of a bar on one of the first songs..this makes it entirely difficult to play the game wihtout fault.- Navigation around the game is awkward, left trigger is pause (in game) which is easy to tap by accident when playing..right trigger is accept. The game just needs to use the typical point and click, like most VR games.- Results screen resolution is terrible...the scoreboard is higher res than the background scoreboard image.- You only have two songs on the game to start and can only start on easy and unlock the next difficulty by beating easy at a certain percentage...this makes the game very slow and tedious for people (myself in particular) who can play drums or these types of games better than just hitting one drum at a time for the whole song length.SUMMARY:All in all i'm glad a game like this has finally been made for VR...It has a hell of a lot to address in this to be honest, but the potential is there if it's worked on better.Not entirely sure it's worth the full £15 i spent as it needs so much improvement but I would keep an eye on this game if you're interested by it's inital concept."

,Recommended,608370,30875058,Posted: 1 April,all,Matt_gday,"*Edit after Patch 1.1*Since this update, I have changed my recommendation for this game from a ""No"" to a ""Yes"".There have been significant graphical and GUI changes and a variety of needed options have been promised to come soon.But the MOST IMPORTANT part of this update is the improvement to the drum response time. There was originally a substantial delay between hitting the drums and the sound being played which made it very difficult to play on the beat. There is still a bit of a delay but it hasVERY MUCH IMPROVED making the game much more enjoyable to play.Most of the songs I have played since this update have been synced well - showing ""Perfect"" when the drums are played accurately to the audio cues in the song but one song (can't remember the name, sorry) was very out. To get ""Perfect"" hits I needed to hit the drums about 1/4 second after the beat.There seems to be a problem with the leaderboards. For most of the songs the leaderboards were empty, showing my position as ""0"". Even after I replayed the songs my leaderboard position stayed at ""0"". This will need to be fixed.__________________________________________________________*Edit after Patch 1.0.2*The update has fixed the ""Miss"" issue when you play to the beat but there is still a significant delay between when you hit the drum and when the sound plays. This is very offputting. If this issue can't be resolved I would like to be able to turn off the drum hit sounds (turn the volume of the drum kit all the way down) so the only drum sounds that I hear come from the track itself. That way I won't be hearing double hits every time I play ""on the beat"".__________________________________________________________*Original Review*I purchased this game last night and played for a bit over an hour. I'm a drummer so I wanted to like this game. Everything about the game, graphics, music, difficulty etc was great...except...THE LATENCY ISSUE.The drum sounds would trigger a fraction of a second after the drum hit. It was very noticeable and made the game frustrating to play for someone who tries to drum on the beats of the songs. A few times the game would appear to pause to load for about a half second which caused the music and the visual cues to be totally out of sync.I tried looking for a setting that would allow custom timing, like the guitar hero games, but It wasn't there.I'll probably continue to play this game because I love drumming in VR but I can only recommend the game when the latency issue is totally sorted out."

The only issue I have with this game is the song's are meh but you can't expect them to be able to buy the rights to use any of those song's when it's an indie company and only a 20$ game. Great job dev. Love the game. 5 of 5 stars. Met and exceeded expectations."
,Recommended,608370,30930229,Posted: 3 April,all,FancyPants,This is as close as you can get to Rock Band or Guitar Hero drums in VR. Lots of fun and quite challenging. I was very skeptical to the haptic feedback when hitting drums with no resistance but this feels great. Song library is growing and there are some good ones but I didn't recognize any of them. Hope to see more known songs in the future if licensing can be sorted out.

76561198111968299,Recommended,608370,30889678,Posted: 1 April,all,Hammerark,"After watching GametechUK play this on his youtube channel I just had to try it for myself as it looked like fun. I wasn't disappointed in the slightest and I've found myself enjoying it way more than I thought, particularly once I relaxed and went with the music. The music itself is an odd one for me, its not the type of music I would usually enjoy, but because it works so well for the gameplay I have started to really get to like it.  Those moments when you string together some complex beats become ever more satisfying as you lose yourself in the game and you really do feel like you have these drums in front of you.One thing I would like to have seen included would be the option to use a pedal for the bass, for those of us who have something that could fit the bill. My old CH Pro flight pedals would have been great for this but, because not everyone would have the option to use something, and having leader boards, I can understand why the developers chose to leave that out. It could still work as a non essential game element though, more for your own satisfaction than to add to your score.I'm using the rift with touch controllers and tracking is spot on, no latency for me at all.. One other thing I feel I should mention is regarding the controllers themselves, as with anything based around real life, it's always going to feel better when you can mimic the activity as closely as possible. Sitting back in a chair doesn't work so well due to the nature of the controllers being a lot bulkier than drum sticks. Crossing hands is difficult to do effectively and the sticks can be about 6 inches apart due to the controllers touching against one another,  so to give my arms the freedom to move I set myself up on a small stool and this ironed out that issue substantially and I never felt that restriction any more, crossed hands or side by side worked just as well.Anyway, rather than carry on raving about how good I think this game is I am going back for another couple of songs and I shall leave you with the usual 'should you get it?' .... In my opinion,  hell yes, it's the best money I've spent in a long time."

,Recommended,608370,34747249,Posted: 4 September,all,FastLawyer,"This game or Drummer Talent VR?  Answer:  get both!   They are both fun to play.  I'm not sure if I could play a real drum kit after playing this game, but it sure feels like I can.  Definitely got the beat/rhythm part down.The songs in this game are actually pretty cool.  I was surprised by the quality, even if I hadn't heard of the songs before.  The note map is very easy to read, so you know just what to play (unlike Drummer Talent VR).  Although, sometimes it may be hard to ""hear"" what you're supposed to play because the song actually plays other drum parts that you're not currently playing (at least on fun/easy and normal mode).Also, it doesn't seem to matter how hard or sotfly you hit the drums, it will always sound the same (unlike Drummer Talent VR).  Other than that, it's very reponsive and I didn't notice any missed notes due to tracking or delay.  There's only two visual environments, and neither are that good (Drummer Talent clearly has this better).Rating: 8/10, fun to play, good songs"

,Not Recommended,608370,32972250,Posted: 28 June,all,Micah,"As others have said, hitting the drum doesn't appear to line up with the music at all.  I can do pretty well playing the game by just aligning with the notes, but when I get a streak of perfects it is as if I'm playing the music to a _different_ song.  Alternatively, if I play to the beat of the music I miss almost all of the notes.I think I could find this game fun if it felt like the notes matched up, even closely.  Perhaps adding a delay setting that allowed me to move the bar forward/backwards would help as I would then be able to set it up so it _felt_ synced to me.Note: I play with bluetooth headphones.  Normally I experience zero delay with games, but perhaps its related.Note 2: When I hit the drum, I can see my stick going through the drum and then a moment _later_ the sound comes through my headphones, so I don't think its just a problem with the notes lining up."

76561198059520333,Recommended,608370,31867833,Posted: 20 May,all,Cyanight Smoek,"Tip: Hold your controller like a drumstick, not a gun=Play faster and better!  This game is Verryy cool! I've never played real drums, but played the crap out of the RB and GH drums. Drums Hero as of now plays at least as well as those others. An incredibly immersive game very much worth the dollars spent with responsive, accurate play controls and nice haptic feedback with the drumstrikes (I would like for the feedback to be a bit stronger, or adjustible). I hope the songlist keeps growing and the songs available now are obscure to known, but all fun to play!If you like Rythm Games, this is a Must Have for VR!"
,Recommended,608370,32519842,Posted: 17 June,all,PodKillz,I like this game and i believe they did a great job at note detection and the drum layout in general.One thing i could think of to make the game much better is having MIDI support for a kick drum pad or even just a direct pedal. It would increase immersion ten-fold and would really further the experience of pretending to play the drums.
76561197972337172,Recommended,608370,34180694,Posted: 11 August,all,o_O,"If you like music games, consider Drums Hero. I also own audioshield and soundboxing, but I like Drums Hero over those two. IMO the drumming in VR works pretty well. I like the music selction, and it's also great that the dev is growing the songlist. The interface also is pretty good.The drum tracks are a bit wierd though. There are 3 difficulties for each song: Fun, Normal, and Pro. I felt that for some songs, the order is incorrect. And for other songs, the drum track doesn't match the actual rhythm of the song which is a bit jarring. What is also weird is that the three difficulties are pretty much different and mutually exclusive of one another. Usually for rhythm games, the easist mode has some missing beats, the normal mode has fewer missing beats, and the hard mode would have all of the song's drum beats in the track. But that's just not the case... so getting good at fun mode doesn't help you get better at normal mode, and getting better at normal mode won't help you get better at pro mode, since the tracks are just completely different from one another. Strange that the dev made that choice.Other problems include the fact that the drumming experience is limited because there is no way to activate a pedal kick drum.  Sadly, it's not really the same without a drum pedal.I'm also not a fan of the letters used to label the drums, would have preferred the Rock Band style notation which is easier to read. This is a somewhat minor gripe though.Anyway, all in all it's a decent VR drumming game. If the dev's fix up the drumming tracks and implement a kick pedal (let us plug in a keyboard and have us press the space button with our foot, for example), then the game could be that much better."

,Not Recommended,608370,34807554,Posted: 7 September,all,EvidencePlz,"<<< Latest Edit: 02/10/17 >>>  Unfortunately I can no longer recommend this app because Into The Rhythm VR (find the link below) does everything this app does, costs about the same and on top of that also allows you to put your own song into the app, make your own notes for it and then play it in VR. Drums Hero only allows you to play songs pre-selected by the developer and you have to pay for them too. Sorry but it's gonna be a negative, thumbs-down review for me until and unless the Drums Hero devs decide to implement similar features. <<< Latest Edit: 02/10/17 >>>http://store.steampowered.com/app/677060/Into_the_Rhythm_VR/<<< Old Review >>> This app and I are a match made in heaven! It's highly entertaining in VR and a must-have for anyone who loves to interact with music and wants a proper drum instrument simulation in VR. Your Vive motion controllers become your drum sticks, and you use them to play along with the song you selected. If you are not a professional drummer then don't worry because there's a Fun mode which is easy and gives you enough space to practice until you get better at it and unlock the Normal and Pro modes. One thing I really like is that if you keep performing perfectly the audience gives you applauds and claps, making you feel awesome!Most of the the songs provided with the base game and the ones included in the Indie Music Pack dlc belong to the Rock genre, which I love to death! But if that's not your cup of tea then there are some pop and club dance type of songs too. The developers have indicated that they plan to add more dlcs containing more songs to the game eventually. You might not have ever heard of the artists and the songs available in the app right now, but trust me they are great once you start listening and hitting the drums like a rockstar.A great Lars Ulrich simulator, in VR. What more could I ask for? Highly recommended. I give it 8/10 and will change it to 10/10 if a bunch of Metallica, Megadeth and Iron Maiden songs are added. <<< Old Review >>>"
