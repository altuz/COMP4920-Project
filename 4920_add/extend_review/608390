,Not Recommended,608390,34083206,Posted: 7 August,all,Mertica,The gameplay is awful. You cut through life sized vegetables and jumping is buggy.Achievements buggy too.

,Recommended,608390,30918499,Posted: 3 April,all,✞ |-|3££ioT [] |2.!.P. ✞,Game is alright for 50 cents. Looks like a flash game but it has cards so whatever. Bitdefender detected a virus called cloud1.  I thought it was fake but seeing it as a russian game proabably not. I may have to refund and notify steam.

,Recommended,608390,30926814,Posted: 3 April,all,neonsun2004,"Mad Dagger is a platformer with simple graphics and gameplay. The main task is to kill all enemies on the level. You also can shred vegetables to path thru and collect coins. After a number of levels, we will encounter the first boss.In general the game is cheap and you should not expect from it advanced technologies and gameplay innovations."

Why vegetables here? It's unclear...The game is suitable for obtaining achievements, during this time the cards will fall out."
