Even though the game is decent and seems exciting at first, eventually after you've heard all the roars and been all of the dinos, it gets boring. I think the animations are decent, and the textures were good, but it's just the lack of things to do. But again, I'm still not going to give up on this game until a few updates, because I believe this game has a lot of potential.I'll probably come back after a few updates pass and I'll see if my opinion has changed. I hope it does."

There is not much to do in this game other than talk to people and kill an occasional dinosaur. I would wait until more updates, and the new game modes come out, other than that there is nothing else to do."
,Not Recommended,608990,33443787,Posted: 10 July,all,Mar,"I was quite excited for this game for what it was promised to be, a tycoon.Unfortunately, it is without any doubt, the most disappointing game I currently have on my steam library.I didn't refund it because I wanted to support the team and watch the game grow to be what it was supposed to be. But months have passed, and it still is the same as it was when released: A chinese version of The Isle.You'd expect to go to a chinese store and have things for half or even lower the price as the original brands, with less quality. In this case, the only similarity was the less quality, because the price is as high.I would tell people to buy this game if they have a low end computer/laptop and can't run The Isle, but from my own experience, it runs worse.No gameplay, awful optimization, no originality, not what was advertised to be.Only positive thing about it, it's the art style, they have cute models. Does it make it worth 20$? No.I'm aware this is EA so things can improve. The lack of originality is not an EA issue, though."
,Recommended,608990,31511148,Posted: 2 May,all,Oncamimus,"I don't normally review games, but I felt it highly nessesary to review this one, coming from the viewpoint of someone who is an aspiring Paleo-artist/Paleontologist and someone who went to school for years for animation.There are a lot of negative reviews, stating that the game is a copy of the Isle or too much of a dinosaur walking simulator, that theres nothing to do...etc, etc.  So off the bat I want to say this...I have no real clue if it is a copy of the Isle (as I use the evil Mac computor and so can't play The Isle), but from what I've heard and can tell...this plans to be a much different game.  Also...this game IS Early Access....meaning it's still being worked on, so yes...there may not be much to do at this point...but I strongly believe this will begin changing rapidly.  I was able to meet one of the Devs when I first started playing this yesterday and when discussing them game....well...I won't spoil any exciting surprises...but theres a LOT on the way.  Also something to mention is that the Devs seem extremely devoted and are very approachable and kind, which I find already to be quite a nice addition to the game.  They have a Discord, Facebook and Twitter....all of which seem very active.   On this point I will say this:  IF YOU WANT A FULLY FLEDGED GAME UPON PURCHASE...an Early Access is not the right thing for you...but if you want to discover worlds as a dinosaur and watch a game develop from a decent starting point up....this game sounds like it will be the exact game for you.  I recommend buying it on sale at this stage of the game or following and waiting for a few updates...but at this point...I GENUINELY think this game is worth buying.Ok...now that we've addressed that...the real fun stuff.  This game tickles me and ignites the dinosaur fanatic within me so completely, well...theres just no way to explain it.  The Devs are nice, the community is nice, if a bit young, but that hardly bothers me, Dinosaurs are for all age groups in my opinion.  There are 3 super awesome maps...A Desert which seems to be the natural go to for most players...but also a very beautiful lakeside foresty area called Green Valley, and an extremely large map called Sanctuary....which to me looks like a large delta system.  There are a number of dinosaurs already implimented in the game...and more confirmed to appear soon...including baby forms for those currently missing their hatchling character options.  Some dinosaurs are lacking in a larger array of different skins, but I also know that this will be changing very soon as well.  What I like about the skins...is that there is usually a ""set"" within the designs, that seems clearly created for a Male and Female version of that skin design...which I honestly think is....well...amazingly awesome....But even if you and your friends have a ""mated pair"" or a group and don't want any skins that are too overly similar...there are still skins that go together nicely and will allow the dinosaurs to look as though they come from the same family unit.At the moment, the things you can do are pretty limited, which could be a problem for players who want to do more then roleplay a dinosaur, but again...I've heard change is on the wind soon.Honestly...the only real cons I find are more asthetical choices/historical accuracy choices...BUT...from what I am to understand...the game isn't centered on being entirely historically accurate...so, it's a small bummer that the movements of some of the animals seem off (I'd really love to see the Ceratopsians run more like Rhinos....like...a lot...) but by no means does this entirely take away from the game...unless you fixate on it.  Besides...theres other nice additions like...feathers on t rex that in my mind cancel out some of the more movement based historical accuracy complaints.  The way I see it...is even when theories seem solidified...we have very little information to go off of with fossils...and new theories come along that erase old ones all the time...so...I think this game can honestly do whatever they want in that reguard...as it's the devs own realization of the world in that time period.Still...I laugh when I see a Steg and a T Rex chilling together. Haha.I plan to edit this review as time goes on...but for now...I think I covered most of what I can think to talk about.  So in closing:  EARLY ACCESS GAME...with a good Dev team who seem to be working hard to give the players what they want, a fun space to meet new friends and fellow Dinosaur Fanatics, and a very promising start to what looks like a...*snort* DINO-MITE GAME!"
76561198118667774,Not Recommended,608990,31712286,Posted: 12 May,all,MotherOrganoid,"A watered down walk and talk simulator that 'borrowed' nearly everything from The Isle and failed to execute them with even a hint of grace. Cannot recommend it at all in its current state. The controls are excedingly clunky, the camera is hair-trigger and its very easy to get motion sick. The graphics are cute but overly simplistic; it reminds me more of a child's playset than anything else. At least some of the dinosaurs are moderately accurate, but its hard to say for sure when the anatomy is under three feet of stylistic choices.No tutorial, no way to navigate, no way to keybind and utterly lacking in accessability. I'll update this review once work has been made on the game but as it stands its little more than a pretty sandbox full of squawking, clunky toddler dinosaur toys.The original idea had promise, but instead of providing a unique product that focused on environmental and fiscal management it went the cheap route of stealing from an established game in an effort to make itself look like a serious contender. That fact alone warrents a negative review, even before taking into account the pre-pre-alpha barely-a-tech-demo finish that barely runs even on a high-end rig. Don't waste your time or money, just buy the Isle or wait until this does SOMETHING to set itself apart instead of just being a cheap knockoff.TL;DRA complete ripoff of The Isle that stole everything from the UI right down to the skins from it and parades it in childish, dancing mockery"
,Not Recommended,608990,31813059,Posted: 17 May,all,Anthomnia,"I'm torn. This game needs more content because even being released as a EA Game all i could do was run around, talk, chirp, be overly cute and attack a very very small player base.I see potential. But it's very far away."
76561198052646009,Not Recommended,608990,33587216,Posted: 16 July,all,Generic,"Pros:- Unique art style- Many dinosaurs to choose from, including hatchling models for most species- Decent maps with room for exploration- Beautiful skins for most dinosaursCons- Art style is simplistic and can be off-putting for those looking for a more serious or realistic dinosaur game- Nothing to really do except sit around, explore, or kill others on sight (KOS)- To be blunt, too many similarities to The Isle- Controls and dinosaur movement are wonky at best- Very few people playing at a given timeOverall, this game has the potential to differentiate itself among dinosaur games - however, I don't feel that the developers are tapping into that potential.  The art style gives the game a unique flavor, but the gameplay itself is bland at best.  Unfortunately, that same art style that gives the game its character can also be to its detriment: this game is not for those looking for scientific accuracy/realism in their dinosaur models.The community is very small and I've encountered few people playing at the same time that I am.  There's little to do, the controls are wanting, and it feels like a watered down version of The Isle.Please note that the above are my opinions and that this is an Early Access title, so all things are subject to change. I do not recommend this game at this time, but as it matures, I may change my mind."
,Not Recommended,608990,31591659,Posted: 6 May,all,[BS] Lol U Mad,Great game if you enjoy paying $20 to run and jump. Yes it is early access but functionality should be reflected in price. There is nothing to do in this barely-a-tech-demo. I wouldn't call it a game.I *think* I attacked a player and killed them but cannot be sure because there was no blood or feedback of any kind to indicate that is what happened.I couldn't even eat. Just run around and starve to death.No manual or game instructions to speak of. Just hit keys until you hear sounds I guess. Not sure what they are even doing.No remap of keys.Default graphic settings are set to max. If you have a low-end system you will probably get one frame per minute while trying to adjust the settings. Good luck with that!I didn't even see any giant floating DNA in the game to eat (as shown in the logo). False advertisement!No wonder the dinosaurs were extinct. If this game doesn't improve hopefully it will go extinct as well.My current choices are get a refund or wait five years for something to happen in this game to make it playable. I think I will go with refund.I don't know about you but I am tired of seeing crap like this on Steam. This belongs on kickstarter or gofundme. I guess if you want to use steam to fund the development of a game this early then you will just have to deal with bad reviews like this one.If you think a game at this stage of development will get good reviews you're high.

Whilst if you're like me with a crap PC i'd wait for the game to develop a little,  but if you have a good PC, and patience give it a go."

This is one of the most underrated games i've ever played , because of people comparing it to the isle , CONTINUOUSLY. This really sucks for this game , that obviously cannot compete with a game that has been out for already more than 2 years or so, being in development for even more time. This game has an artstyle and feeling that games like The Isle , Primal Carnage or Saurian can only dream , i think that if it gets given time, it could and will transform in one of the best dinosaur games ever developed , also one thing that people don't think about , is that animations are not ALL , in my opinion , this game is really fun to play , so just wait, and play this young but already awesome game."
,Not Recommended,608990,33640331,Posted: 18 July,all,Kaity {DLTV},"I'm not going to go into too much detail as to why I did not enjoy this game, but there are a few reasons. For this game having below-par models, animations, controls, etc. it already put a bad feeling in my stomach. However, I was willing to give a try, as I've found myself fascinated with dinosaur-type games. As I began playing it, it felt quite empty and there wasn't much to it. I know I played it for a short period of time, but evenstill.The models, animations, etc. still bugged me in the game, and there's quite a lot of other games that are worth spending $20.00. For a game that has somewhat poorly made models and difficult controls, it is definetly not worth what it costs. I know this may offend some people, but I've found better models on Roblox of all places. There isn't much else to say, as there isn't any other aspect to review of the game just yet."

As of the time of this review the game is very bare bones, but I can already see that given some time this game will become one of my favorites. I love the art style and the models (It's very simplistic). But dont let the simplistic models fool you, they are actually fairly accurate ( Atleast compared to Jurassic Park and such). The sound design is done very well, perhaps they are not, but they seem more believable than other games and movies. So I suppose to wrap it up; if you have an interest in prehistory, dinosaurs, or any of that, then this game is for you. If you are not interested in those subjects 1. What are you doing looking into this game 2. Maybe try it, who knows you might like it."
,Recommended,608990,34016265,Posted: 4 August,all,☤Racingsnake8☤,"Love this game, this is one of my favourite games. It's a very chill game where you can just hang out with people and do whatever, there is only one mode at the moment witch allows the user to play as one of many different creatures. There will be two other modes eventually. There are already multiple creatures you can play as and there are even baby versions of each model (that are much cuter then the adults). It's NOT a realistic game and doesn't require BRILLIANT graphics but it helps to have a good graphics card as it will obviously look better. The models are good but basic (which in a way is nice) but I think the animations and sounds need a bit more work (but it's planned that the animations at least will be reworked eventually) but considering it's not been out for long, it's a very good game!This game has a lot of potential and can't wait to see the finishing product!Hope this review helped."

76561198034242053,Not Recommended,608990,33540241,Posted: 14 July,all,joker7169,"When I saw another Dino sim game on Steam, I was so excited! I love dinosaurs and have been waiting for game like this since I was 11 (I'm 27 now). This isn't the first game to incorporate playable dinosaurs and won't be the last. With The Isle out and becoming well established with a dedicated community, I wanted to be sure I gave Archotek a fair shot as it's Early Release and very new. I bought the game on sale and started it up! I was pleasantly surprised to hear a beautiful score on the main menu with a cute little raptor with hatchings standing by it's nest. This is where I begin to get slightly disapointed. When I started a game and went to choose what server I wanted to join, there were only a few people playing! There were four servers, two empty, one with a couple player and another with about ten. I joined the server with ten. When I began choosing which dino I wanted to play as, I gotta say I was impressed by the diverse selection! For such a new game that is early release, they made a very respectable selection of dinosaurs to choose from! I chose the spinosaurus and spawned into a pretty looking forest by a lake. Now, some people may not have a problem with this but I know others do. The controls. These are basically tank controls and it's very reminiscent of PlayStation 1 era controls. I don't want to compare this to other games but I feel since so many other modern games have the same movement control, I think it's fair. Moving the camera doesn't change which direction your dino faces or moves to. This small detail makes it hard for many player (by many, I mean about 5 of the 10 playing) to either run from predators or chase prey because if it to need to make a sharp turn, you can only do it by pressing the directional hotkey (wasd). Then you have to move your mouse independently of the dinosaur to see where you're going! In any other game, for the past 15 years or so, all you had to do was move your mouse to turn your character in the direction you faced. Sorry, I'm ranting. This just drove me crazy. Hopefully, the devs fix it soon! Another point of criticism is map size. It's small. I know there aren't a lot of players but that could change and I'd hate to be stuck in a tiny map with 50 other players, half of which may be aggressive predators! However, like I said, the maps are still very pretty and there's a serene feel to them. This brings me to the graphics. I like'em! Some people may think it's cartoonish and silly and my response is, ""that's probaly what they were going for!"" The colors are bright and vibrant and really go against the conventional view of the typical green, brown, or gray dinosausr we're accostumed to seeing in pop culture and books. These cutsie graphics, in my opinion, don't take away from the majesty of towering sauropods or the menacing presence of a T. Rex or Spinosaurus.At this point, you're probably wondering why I don't recomend this game. I liked the graphics, the atmosphere, the selection of dinosaurs, and the music! Sure the controls aren't sophisticated, the maps are a little cramped, and there aren't many players but that doesn't make it a bad game! So why a thumbs down? Because the game just isn't that fun. At the time of this writing, I've owned this game for about two weeks and only played for 1.5 hours. There's nothing to keep me there! There's no excitement of a hunt. There's no feeling of anxiety of being watched by a predator while you drink by the lake. There's no feeling of being a wild animal on the edge of survival! There's just walking around talking silly with other players. I don't know if this is what the developers were aiming for or if it's just the player community simply being made up of Isle refugees that are sick of being Killed On Sight (KOS) and refuse to play in an aggressive manner but the experience just bored me to near death! There is one ray of hope for this game, however! AI dinosaurs! The developers told me in a response to a post I made asking about AI that they would add them down the line and they were working on it now! This would help the game immensely by finally bring that survival feeling to the game and filling up those sparse maps. It would also stop any KOSing or carebearing (predators protecting prey) because you can play on your own server by yourelf or with friends! This game is a pretty good reminder that even though a developer can hit all the right notes, that doesn't mean the game is any fun or worth playing. But there is hope and loads of potential for The Archotek Project and if you want to support the game feel free to buy it! Just don't expect to play for multiple hours and have the time of your life."

No bugs from what I've seen,though sometimes the hitboxes for eating carcasses and attacking players is a bit wonky,but that can be easily fixed.

It's a very good looking game. The devs have chosen an art style and stuck with it. The sound is very good as well from the dinosaurs roars to the ambience in game. A bit of music here and there wouldn't hurt but it's early access so I'll forgive it. The animation is teriffic. The dinosaurs move very realistically. A+ for whoever worked on the animation.The bad... well there's not a lot to do at the moment and for £14.99 you're not really getting much value for money... at the moment. If it lives up to its promises then that £14.99 will be well worth it. There are a few clipping problems here and there and the fact that I can't climb boulders is a bit annoying. Can't swim at the moment, you just sort of... move through the water... and the water itself isn't particulary good...All in all though, it's a very pretty game that is, at the moment, not worth the cost. I would reccoment it however as it does seem to have a hell of a lot of potential."

,Not Recommended,608990,33733219,Posted: 22 July,all,Johnnykun,"This game has torn my heart into two places: loving this game and absolutly hating it.The good things about this game is that the dinosaurs in this game look more scientifically accurate (as far as low graphic models go) and more colorful than the isle. The isle is essentially an edgy, ""shadow the hedgehog"" bootleg of ARK: survival evolved. While the archotek project actually makes their dinosaurs look like animals that actually existed unlike the isle's shrinkwrapped abominations. and this is where archotek succeeds in: not making dinosaurs scary giant lizard edgelords and instead making them realistic. the maps in this game are big but not too big like they are in the isle, and they even have a dead corpse or two for carnivores to eat from if they dont want to hunt. the accuracy goes so far that archotek's spinosaurus looks like a partial quadruped like its supposed to be.Now here are the cons: The lead Developer,""Levia Draconia"" is somewhat immature in my opinion due to a number of factors. 1: she blocked me over an argument me and her had in the middle of the night even when said argument wasnt that agressive then decided to call me out in public on a different website saying im a bad guy or some silly stuff. 2: This game seems rushed and seems to be made as a final ""f*ck you"" to the Isle developers since Levia got fired from that development team over ""reasons we cannot know"" (in my opinion it was probably over somthing stupid too).I know the isle and its development team is possibly the most immature, rude, and corrupt game developers on steam (even badrats devs are nicer) but even Iwont get so ticked off that i will make a videogame just to get revenge whatever said revenge might be. This whole situation is turning steam into Tumblr and its getting rediculous. anyways let me get back to the game itself.The games graphics are terrible. Although i do like the art style of this game, it just looks like this game should go on the iphone app store or somthing. The trees are 2d pictures of themselves when your far away from them, most of the rocks and map isnt really textures, and the dinosaurs themselves look like they are made of plastic or bedsheets if the textures and models get completely overhauled then i will change my opinion on this game. There are also some few bugs (screen turning black for a second at random intervals, getting stuck in certain places, etc) but those might be fixed in the future.Another bad thing about this game is that its boring. Im serious there isnt that much stuff to do and theres a rediculous lack of content in this game. Im suprised the dev team behind this released the game at early access when the game still looks like its in early alpha. What doesnt help is the lack of players. the maximum amount of players i have seen playing this game is 17 and they are all in one server while the other servers are very empty. The community is only slightly better than the isle's but im probably saying that because of the lack of players in this game. Some of the players i have played with have said that this game makes them want to play the isle or Saurian when it comes out (im probably going to move over to saurian aswell when it comes out) and they are right. One player i have killed in the game threatened to hack my computer and whatnot and made racial as well as homophobic slurs against me. I mean who gets thats mad over a videogame? just get over it and respawn.Anyways for now i dont reccomend this game at all due to the immaturity of the lead developer aswell as the lack of game graphics and content. your better off waiting for saurian to come out. On the bright side: atleast this development team give out game bans to people that they dont like.UPDATE: the developer ""Levia draconia"" is now falsely accusing me of blackmail by saying that I told her to unblock me or i will write a negative review, even though that all i said was ""can you unblock me if you dont mind"" after she said no i said ""whatever the negative review still stands then i guess"". i said the latter because i was proving my reviews point. in no way shape or form was i trying to bribe that inconsiderate person nor was i even thinking of doing so. sad thing is shes getting her friends to vouche for her since there is no proof or sny evidencd of of me allegidly bribing her and the fact that she is straight out lying about this. this whole situation is pathetic in my opinion and given the fact that i suffer from high anxiety at times, i am afraid of getting reported/ banned on steam over somthing i didnt even do. if you guys dont want to deal with similar nonsense then hear my advice: do not get yourselves socially involved with any early access game developer unless you know them personallyregards~ JohnnykunUPDATE: apparently this just happenedhttps://imgur.com/a/UFwdInow she is claiming I am spreading false rumors now.
