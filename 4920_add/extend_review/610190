I imported this title on PS4 and Vita and found it to be disappointing on the PS4 and unplayable on the Vita in regards to performance.  Am happy to report that the PC version runs at an almost rock-solid 60 FPS on a capable PC!"

,Recommended,610190,34769843,Posted: 5 September,all,Pikapool,"Warriors All-Stars is the newest hack & slash game from KT. In short, this game is a dumbed down version, the gameplay is more shallow than the same games in this series like Warriors Orochi series. Here is the breakdown of my review.Graphic, music and sound:Overall, graphic is nice, nothing ground breaking but character's design are clearer and more detailed. In terms of music, this game has some good tracks, but nothing worth remembering. And sound, yeah, not much is happening in this department.Story:This is one of the things that makes Warriors All-Stars is just a quick cash grab, story is bad, after finishing the game for the 1st time, I didnt bother with it on my next playthrough. The character rooster is sadly very few, event DW8XL has more characters than this game. Though the character rooster isnt much, it has some awesome characters like Nobunyaan Oda, Williams from NiOh, Sophie from Atelier series, etc.Gameplay:This is the main problem why I said Warriors All-Stars is dumbed down, first there is no weapons, instead of weapons, we get cards, which acts like weapons, you can get cards by defeating enemies, finishing missions, finishing character's quest. Cards can be enhanced or combined to raise certain attributes, also can be sold or destroyed to get materials. Materials are needed to add your choice of attributes (enhanced cards). In battle, you can bring 4 other characters with you, you can use their skills in battle or summon all of them to battle (they will stand side by side with your characters in battle, sort of a human chains). They took some mechanics from Warriors Orochi. There is also rush battle, you can activate it if you have a star by pressing R3/RS, you can get rush star every 1000 kills you make.Availables missions can be selected in World Map, including story and final missions. Also, everytime you finish certain missions, the map will be highlighted wider and wider. This game has multiple endings with 3 main story branch depending which sides you choose when selecting your first character everytime you start a new game.Conclusion:TL;DR Warriors All Star isnt a bad game, but its not for everyone, too simplified, and not much content, especially for 60 bucks. If you are new to this kind of games and want to try, go ahead. But if you like DW or SW series to death, you might want to wait for sale, this game isnt as good as the main DW series. If you are a KT die hard fan, well, what are you waiting for? In short, ""Wait for a sale""EDIT: Fixed some typos"

Never played any Tecmo Koei games that obscureFirst of all, this is really a great game for a big fan like me, i enjoyed the interactions between the characters, and the playstyle of EACH character is very unique and different, like playing as Millenia, she maybe weak but her trap packs a punch when used correctly, then playing as William, if you could timing his attacks, William able to get boost which a nod to his original game. It's a no doubt a fan service game, for the Tecmo Koei Fans.The game suffers a bit with these kind of gameplay and the lack of free mode, but i able to look past it since it is a fun game even tho it's repetitive, for me at least.Either way, it's a HIT or a MISS for everyone.It's a hit for me if you asked me.And i rate it 8/10 because i really having a lot of fun.Note: Bring Nioh to the PC Koei.

,Recommended,610190,34607282,Posted: 30 August,all,RAID Noir - Mining or Idling,"An Hour and a half in. I was pleasanty surprised with some of the changes they made to the battle that made it a bit different from standard DW games.Like with Empires you have a ""Home Base"" in which you can interact with all the other Heroes you recruit. There are side missions that is recieved from other heroes and adds more depth to the background of each character.Previous DW\SW Games all tend to be story constrained in which after every game the next battle will always be a battle to continue the story. it works when they try to retell history but it also becomes a bit stale specially since they are just retelling them across the series. This series lets you choose what to do next. Recruit more heroes, do a side mission to help your team or even timed event missions.I am still getting used to the battle system since they added the ""Buddy"" system shown in trailers. There is also a slight change on ingame levels, In every battle you start low and there will be enemies that are difficult to defeat or near impossible if you haed straight for them,Port wise - They actually added a LOT of customizations in the graphic settings. Smooth gameplay even with LOTS of enemies on my main rigPros-Graphics are a step up from the previos DW game I played. Lots of settings and stable performance-Gameplay changes are quite interesting and makes it feel new-Original storyline like warriors Orochi series- Another Positive for the story. There is 1 true Arc among all 3-Performance is good even for a Dual COre and a RX 560ConsThe only issue i have is that it always starts with the ""config"" menu when pressing play and the setting only see's my LCD TV as 720P(due to windows 10 default to help with font) and i always have to manually change it again ingame to 1080p.(Not game's fault)"

,Recommended,610190,34600370,Posted: 30 August,all,Infern,"Another one of those Dynasty Warriors games.If you enjoy the franchise where you hack and slash enemies to pieces this is it.The only problem is 4.7 hours into the game only just a story mode.(Hopefully if i complete this game I'll unlock some super special mode where i can mess around to my hearts content)The difference with this game. Skills are attained by becoming friends with certain allies you recruit on your journey. So having them in your party will be a major boost (As they will level quickly.)Which they borrowed from their relationship system in Romance of the Three Kingdoms strategy game.Heroes do not wear gear. They have a ""Hero card"" which is another way to level up the characters.If you don't enjoy the franchise don't get the game. (Also if you want the game cheaper. Either wait for it to decrease in price or go to one of those gray market key sellers). I'd recommend it because it is as fun as all the other Dynasty Warrior games. (Still having more enjoyment from it than the Aslan series game)Update: Also found out alot of these Assets are literally taken from their other games. Even levels themselves. As was able to find a level that was almost identical to a dynasty warriors level (i've played in the past)"

Koei Tecmo delivers.The game isnt flawless, but it is wonderful still. There are framedrops on maps with potential fire (even with my gtx 1070), the lack of free mode is annoying and archery bases make you pull your hair out sometimes, but the game feels fresh. The interactions between characters are endless and seems so real, the amount of different reactions and dialogue outside of fighting is insane, and dont get me started on the 15 different endings. Mind you, I have only gotten one (have had a chance for 2), but since that was the one and only way I wanted the game to end I probably won't be grinding for other endings before I have all characters maxed out lol.TLDR: The game is a fresh addition to the warriors series and brings you a new, lighter(/darker) view of the genre. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys any warriors-style games, and to everyone who doesn't, still give it a shot. You will definitely like it ^^"

,Not Recommended,610190,34611636,Posted: 30 August,all,泥鰍小妹妹,"Hmmmm. I think that really depends on how eager you are for a new Warriors game.There's definitely fun to be had here and I did enjoy a lot of the characters (William from Nioh is great in it, as is that... guy with the sword that I can't remember. Hajime something), but the framerate and the mission design can really drag it down - or at least they did for me.It's a tough question. I think if you're in the mood for some Warriors action and you can keep your expectations in check, you'll get something out of the game, mostly because the playable characters are pretty cool across the board.For me personally, I think the characters are just enough to warrant a look if you're a big Warriors fan, but again, don't expect anything amazing.The framerate fluctuates constantly, hitting its target 60 frames-per-second and then dropping to what feels like half that every few seconds or so. It never quite seems to hit anything too low, so it's an issue that doesn't directly damage your ability to play the game, but things can get so choppy that at one point, we almost felt sick turning the camera. It's bizarre, and honestly, pretty unforgivable given how unremarkable the game's visuals are to begin with.Yukimura and Mitsunari kind of have their triangle combos from Samurai Warriors 4, but as far as I can tell, they're not quite as fast. I guess this was done to balance them with the rest of the cast, but having said that, the movesets vary quite heavily across all playable characters.the actual story doesn't carry much weight, and the members of the royal family -- the title's only original characters -- adhere to tired anime archetypes. You've got Tamaki, the shy and distressed princess, Setsuna, the energetic and enthusiastic hero, and Shiki, the stern and brooding older brother. There are some interesting character interactions here and there, but by and large, this isn't a release that you'll be playing purely to see what happens next.Despite its relatively small playable character roster, Warriors All-Stars does a fine job of offering varied playstyles and interesting movesets. From simplistic melee fighters such as Zhao Yun of Dynasty Warriors and Yukimura Sanada of Samurai Warriors to more complex additions like the rifle wielding Tokitsugu of Toukiden fame, unlocking new characters and levelling them up is enjoyable.Conclusion:Warriors All-Stars is a colourful hack and slash title that can be fun in short bursts thanks to its varied cast of playable characters, but it just has too many problems to be considered a good Warriors game. Frustrating, tedious mission design,repetitive skill sets, a throwaway story, and a wildly unstable framerate make it very difficult to recommend when there are so many better Koei Tecmo titles on the market.塵封在星蘊重明的魂魄叫醒了恍惚夢魘的無措揭開這宿命的脈絡逃不開 這一世的寂寞往後是陰霾 往前是山隘想逃也逃不開命運再主宰執著的心也不會更改哪管桑田 哪管滄海聽琴聲瀟瀟 該忘的忘不掉紅塵 困住我年少原諒我藏在心裡燎燎的狂傲去戰 面對天地盪浩人生也瀟瀟 魂牽夢繞像烈焰燃燒前塵 看浮沉走一遭用冷的鋒刃 琴的寂寥寫往事今朝古劍 指尖 談笑人世間有沒有一種解藥能覆蓋是非恩仇的喧囂屠俘了焚寂的劍鞘斬不斷 這一生的桀驁往後是陰霾往前是山隘想逃也逃不開命運再主宰執著的心也不會更改哪管桑田 哪管滄海聽琴聲瀟瀟 該忘的忘不掉紅塵 困住我年少原諒我藏在心裡燎燎的狂傲去戰 面對天地盪浩人生也瀟瀟 魂牽夢繞像烈焰燃燒前塵 看浮沉走一遭用冷的鋒刃 琴的寂寥寫往事今朝古劍 指尖 談笑"

,Recommended,610190,34813299,Posted: 8 September,all,Tallcat,"A Koei Tecmo crossover game just makes sense to be a Musou title. It looks and runs great, and feels pretty standard for what you'd expect from Musou at this point. Because it's trying to capture the Musou experience as a whole it does seem a bit lacking of its own personality. Everything it does have is quality, but I prefer its weirder, more focused cousins like Berserk and Dragon Quest."

I wanted to play it, because it's a cross over that includes some great characters from games I've played. I have never palyed Samurai warriors before, but I also think it's an awesome game too.Btw, talking about graphics. I was waiting for more honestly.Dead or alive 5, and even the old NGB has better 3d models as I think.It only has a good light environment and shadows. (lacks of character animations and expressions)Characters does't even move their mouth to talk in game. (Only the main character does)Talking about a cross over, this is important. (or could be personal)I do understand the risks, there could be a high demand of resources.Anyway, It looks like it's slowing a little when using special skills and lots of enemies at the same time, like using masou rush.PD: Details High (max + vsync), 1080p.FX 6core, rx580 XTS AORUS, 16gb ram."

,Recommended,610190,34597274,Posted: 29 August,all,NemesisSlayer,"Thus far, about 1 hour into the game after fixing NVIDIA forcably defaulting the game to integrated graphics:Gameplay - I can simply say if you like the Dynasty Warriors games, it's the same combat system but expanded a bit further to incorporate team combat with (officer) bodyguards.  I will say that there are some battles that are physically impossible to win - occasional ones where you must save your allies.  Due to the map layout for some of them, you cannot possibly reach all of your allies before they are defeated as allies are even more useless than in the dynasty warriors games.Visual wise, the game looks very colorful and 'fun'.  The one thing that I find a little bothersome is the small size of the enemy health bars but that could be due to the sheer number of enemies you encounter.Story wise, I will mention once I manage to get further into the game.  Thus far at least, it isn't anything special but most who I think would play this aren't playing for the story."

,Recommended,610190,34693952,Posted: 2 September,all,Hikari,"This game is pure fun especially when playing as AoE-centric characters. Mowing down hundreds or thousands of enemies as your favorite characters from many of Koei's series is definitely a blast. Graphics are pretty, performances (for me) are great, and combat is very fun. You can even choose the background music for each battle in the game yourself.Of course, if you play continuously for many hours, you will start to get bored. Fortunately, each battle can be finished in 2 minutes if you only do the essential missions in the battles, so they can be as long or short as you like depending on when you want to finish them. You know what you'll get from a Warriors game so don't expect it to be any different in terms of combat gameplay. If this type of game is what you like, then by all means, get it. However, if you don't like this series then stay away. You don't need to buy it, play it, hate it, give it bad review, and then get a refund. Many games got this treatment and the Steam ratings of those games will always be negative.The only gripe I have for this game right now is the rescue missions. The friendly NPCs that need to be rescued are so weak and frail. They will die very fast if you don't hurry at the start of the mission. With that said, after you rescue them all, you will be able to explore the map at your leisure.Be advised that there is no free mode in this game unlike many other ""Warriors"" games. Instead we get many missions to choose from the world map. There are a few variations in these missions such as story missions, attack missions, defend missions, rescue missions, or challenge missions (Defeat enemies as much as you can or 1-hit-kill modifier)."

,Not Recommended,610190,34789207,Posted: 6 September,all,AliceTheGorgon,"The plot is ungodly stupid and contrived, and there's no modes except for story mode.For some reason, whichever being created the world of Warriors All Stars decided it would be a good idea to make it so that the only thing sustaining life was one single magical spring that can sometimes just randomly stop when the ruler dies.This can apparently be solved if the people living in the land get a new ruler who has all three fancy magical items, who can then restart the magical spring. There are three people who each have one of those items, but they're all so  arrogant that they'd each let their *entire world die* rather than allow either of the other two characters be the new ruler. We're apparently supposed to like these characters for some reason.These terrible people then decide that, because they can't handle things like reasonable adults, they'll use magic to kidnap a bunch of warriors from other dimensions to fight on their behalf to force the other potential rulers to give up their magical items. These idiots also are *completely unable to send the warriors back home* if they don't want to help, because the idiots used up the *very last of the magic* in the world to start a war, rather than use that magic for something productive like saving their world from its *imminent death*. And for some reason all of the warriors just go along with the ""work for me or you'll die"" plan without a second thought, even though that plan is blatantly evil, and a number of the warriors *have magic of their own* and could probably figure out a way to go back home if they bothered to try.Also, the morons who'd rather let the whole world die than let someone else be the ruler, are blue cat people, for some reason.Like, sure, Warriors games don't tend to have particularly great writing or anything, but I've never seen them go *this* far into contrived anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t territory. Like, what the hell? Even Hyrule Warriors didn't have a story that was *this* ridiculous and contrived.And to top it off, there's also no chronicle mode or custom characters or *any other modes at all*, so if you don't like the story there's literally nothing in the game you can even do."

Friggin puss xd"

,Recommended,610190,34612765,Posted: 30 August,all,Ceetee,"Easily the best game in the Warriors series. Takes the best elements from each of the previous games, and expands upon them. If you like the Dynasty Warriors series, but wish it had more quality of life updates to the gameplay and didn't feel like it was 10 years old, this is the game for you. Its new, flashy, and it just plain feels good to play.However, while its never happened to me, you should be advised that the game does seem to have some preformance problems for some people.The game also lacks any english voice acting, so if that is an issue for you, you should turn this one down."
