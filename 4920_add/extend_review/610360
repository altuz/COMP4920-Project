Zero proves that the more achievements and sequels a game has, the more it may result in a monotonous repetition.Another Zup! game, another month. Ever since Greenlight has been published, it is no secret that cheaply thrown together games created by people who don't have the dedication to create a completed game get published to greenlight every day. Zup! Zero combines two of the things that I dislike greatly, casual puzzle games where levels can be completed in seconds, and games put together in a premade software without trying to create something interesting.Created in Clickteam Fusion, Zup! Zero is the fifth zup game in a series of bland puzzle games. This time, Zup! is another physics puzzler that uses explosions to guide a blue ball into a turquoise platform. The main interaction in the puzzle is clicking red objects to create an explosion that sends yellow objects  towards a direction and clicking grey tiles to make objects fall. Being a poorly thought out game would normally turn away people from buying such a game.However, Zup knows that earning a lot of achievements and earning trading cards is an effective way to convince people to buy the game. To further seal the deal, Zup! makes the price at $1, the lowest base price a game can be on steam without being free. Zup! takes achievements to the extreme by generating an achievement around every second you play the game. When you make achievements earned so easily to the point of not having any special merit, then the word ""Achievement"" loses it's meaning.Zup! is a game series that will continue to pop up on the steam front page with such a successful formula to attract casual players into buying it."

Part Four's music was better.Playable,should be a Must Buy for most hunters.*** Totally LOST the True Meaning of Hard Fought Achievements on completing a game.Dreadful process of playing Zup! just to see 1K + achievements roll by,just wishing it would end quickly, rather than the torment.Unlike the feel of first play of Zup! Part 1.The Developer isn't making a game, just selling Achievements.The game earned my Money, but also my Disgust.Just glad the torments over.Play and Uninstalled.Edited from my Part 4 review."

No hard levels beatable within 1 hour. Rewarded with 1043 achievement for leisure playing. But I still downvote if the achievements popup factor 7 for just entering or beating a level or to find the hidden objects exists. Then the popup machine like in Zup3! rises again. Hopefully that was the last part of the series."
,Recommended,610360,31027746,Posted: 8 April,all,JacquesLeSauve,"Even at this point during its short life, I feel as though the Zup! series has become a little stale to a certain extent. While still all being perfectly enjoyable, the biggest leap in innovation to the overall mechanic has been in the second game where it made the pivotal change of taking the square target block, and making it a rolling, circular piece instead. It seems like a small change, but that one simple alteration really opened up a lot of possibilites. Well, the very same adjustment has been applied to the rest of the game, too, as a lot of the squares have now been replaced by more rolling circles and opened things up once again.It's funny how such a minor tweek in concept can make such a big difference in play and really switch things up. There are times when it does still feel like you're going through the same motions, sure, but at least not anywhere close to the degree of deminishing returns that it was. Now, rather than having one moving piece making its way around the screen, there are several to be manipulated into place to open up the way. The other ""big"" change to the game is the introduction of switches that have to be activated to remove blocks acting as gateways to progress. Aside from that, there's nothing else of note to really report other than an improved quality of stage design with more direct interaction and less sitting back and watching, as the previous game was leaning way too much into. Otherwise, players of past games will be on very familiar ground here.There are suggestions that this may be the final entry in the series (where do you even go anyway after reseting to 0? Which in itself is an odd decision given the complete lack of narrative to any of the titles), as the developer seems to be exploring other games. And you know what? I'd actually be pretty happy if it was. It had a really good run and seems to have been relatively successful for what it is. But I think the audience's patience is starting to be tried at this point, with the combined saturation of the one series (five games in seven months!) and especially now as the b*stard children ""inspired"" by it are starting to emerge. This is a pretty good point to end on, too, and leaves on a real high. If more are released, I'm sure I'll take the bait and end up playing them at some point just the same, but if this is the final curtain for Zup!, then it was a fun ride while it lasted. Oh, and thanks for the three-and-a-half thousand achievements you gave me as well. Cheers."

This game was only made to be an achievement and trading card items farm (I swear to god the author of this game put more effort into the backgrounds and emoticons than the game itself). I only bought it for the card drops and partly the free achievements really. The backgrounds and emoticons of this game are more worthwhile and expensive than the game itself. It also hardly differs from the other Zup! games besides two new mechanics and a light soundtrack that consists of one song.You can buy it to get the card drops and possibly get a cool background and letter emoticon, but otherwise stay away."

I support this - in the past, doing so would require obtaining cards, emoticons, backgrounds etc etc.Serious achievement hunters are using 3rd party sites to track and weight their achievements - gamers with libraries full of Zups and [insert object] Hunts at 100% are not moving to the top of any leaderboards any time soon."

The puzzles are relatively straightforward and well designed. Some may catch you out a little here and there but for the most part they're not very tasking and you can complete any of the games in under an hour.This game did exactly what I wanted (gave me lots of cool achievements to decorate with) and wasn't a chore to play so would recommned highly to gamers with similar intentions. If you're actually looking for a challenging puzzle game however then there are probably better ones on the market.

,Recommended,610360,33286610,Posted: 5 July,all,KingKull2112,"So this review is going to be for all Zup! games, not just this one. Therefore, I will be literally copy/pasting this across all of my reviews.Many people call these games out, citing that they're card farming games. While this may or may not be true, these games have some very good puzzles. Sure, they're short, but I feel that the price I paid for them is well worth it (Less than a dollar for each game in the summer sale?!). Some of the puzzles are really well thought out and it feels good to complete a game like this. So here's the pros and cons.Pros:-Good music, never found myself reaching for the mute button. The music IS on a loop, but it's comparable to Hexcells' music, so if you enjoyed that game's music, you'll enjoy their music as well.-Well designed puzzles, especially in 4 and Zero.Could be a pro or a con:-A ton of achievements. If you don't want to artificially inflate your achievement count, don't play any of these passed 1 and 2. If you don't care or you in fact do want to do that, go ahead and play all of them-Feels like one of those games you would love to play on Flash sites like Newgrounds or KongregateCons:-Short, but enjoyable. You could actually ♥♥♥♥ the dev(s?) out of money by getting 100% achievements in less than the 2 hour refund periodOverall, I enjoyed these games enough to recommend them all."

You know what you have to do with the old blocks we know and love but with some new ones to add a bit of a challenge and make new levels work and actually feel different from the series.I go stuck on a few levels but soon figured it out due to trail and error.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.
