,Recommended,610750,31587891,Posted: 6 May,all,Shoukaku,"Review is fully based on personal opinionI'm just a casual visual novel player, therefore I don't really judge the game from a serious and logical perspective as I only have played this to fill my spare time and boring weekend.It's a very short VN, only took me around 30 minutes to complete one run of story mode. Noticed a few typos and missing words, but I honestly don't mind about that, I make mistakes all the time too. I chuckled on some of the lines, the dialogues are really straightforward, there's only 5 choices to make in the game but I honestly enjoyed it despite the game being short. Although the game design is a bit on the average side, I like the character arts and scene backgrounds. Other reviews mentioned about the cliche and predictable plot, but I honestly don't care... as I have been playing visual novels for my own entertainment and not to question the story whatsoever, I'm just not that type of person...Overall, I think this game is fairly above average, and I do recommend playing it if you're just a casual type person not going full-time on playing VNs, but judging from how short it is, you might want to buy it for cheaper unless you don't really care about the game's price and just want to have fun."

I enjoyed it enough to justify the price, and probably will buy future episodes, but it's certainly not an award winning novel or even close to the best VN on Steam.  It's interesting and cute, but not great writing by any stretch of the imagination.Ehhh, let's give it a 7 out of 10, but give it a bonus point for being offered at under $2, so a pretty decent value.. That makes this VN an 8 out of 10 in my estimation.  Just don't be expecting a 40 hour visual novel with hundreds of gripping choices to make or award winning writing, and you shouldn't be disappointed."
,Not Recommended,610750,31279041,Posted: 21 April,all,Buttered Falcon,"Well that was kinda strange. Excellent art, decent music and worth the chuckle (all be it awkward situation chuckling).All and all fairly disappointing and a lack of roundness in the story. Given the size of the studio, I was hoping for some uniqueness in the story, however it went all “Superstar” and into a bland and kinda boring ""master and servant stories with the ultimate endpoint of having sex and becoming a man"" that we seem to see a lot of in visual novels. So I am actually a little disappointed that they didn’t try to stand out, which ultimately I feel would help them out. However, if you like that kind of plot, this is the game for you.4/10 - kinda just bland.EDIT: Spelling & Grammar"
,Not Recommended,610750,33781157,Posted: 25 July,all,Bud,"An 'Okay at best' VN.  It is basically your male characrer being rather an introverted shutin who spent every dollar he had on a new game console and after a day, he wakes up and sees that it turned to a girl.  Being as introverted as he is though, he has no idea on how to handle a girl but the story was okay to read.I didn't like how you leached off of your family to just stay home and play video games but the game is what it is and I did like the computer on how her temperment was so I would suggest this game but only when it is on sale.------------------The decisions don't really matter much and I replayed it again and changed each answer to the exact opposite and there are only two endings  - To be happy with the  computerized girl or be alone...thats it.'2 stars'"
,Not Recommended,610750,31386350,Posted: 26 April,all,Kygun,"Not really sure what to say about this one. I play many visual novels, so this was recommended to me.The pricepoint is excellent, but several minutes into the game you can see why. The basic plot is an otaku in love with his game console gets the opportunity to bang her when it becomes a human girl.The game takes about 30 minutes to complete. At least you get some free achievements though."
,Recommended,610750,35427440,Posted: 2 October,all,Helevorn,"Being rather short, this nice visaul novel has a downside: it's composed by two separate episodes, and to get all the achievements (they're only four by the way, at least as of October, 2017) you are forced to buy the DLC too.. so, I would advise everyone to buy this game when it's on sale somehow 'cos the price is too high for the content.The content itself is nice, graphics are good and although there aren't many choices you have your typical Japanese-style visual novel.I think that this game has many negative reviews because of the price/DLC thing, 'cos really there are lots of way worse visual novels on the Internet..For an indie small game, to me it's good and worth it if you are into this genre. Put the game in your wishlist and wait :)"
,Not Recommended,610750,31224872,Posted: 18 April,all,Apoch Weiss | Apochs.net,"Short visual novel with nothing all that redeeming aside a quick chuckle or two. Plus only fiove chances to make a decision, most of which were mundane ones. Honestly not pleased with the price point (on sale at the time I wrote this for $1.79), but at least got two achievements and another completion out of it."
76561198073231578,Recommended,610750,31695777,Posted: 11 May,all,Miki-Chan,"Heres my overall opinion on the game:-Good art design (all art pieces are great)-Average Soundtrack (Fits the theme, but can be a little annoying. Considered mutting it at one point but I get why it is the way it is)-OK story telling. This would be the only reason I wouldn't reccomend the game. I feel the choices in this game are fairly below average. Whenever you get two choices, there is an obvious answer that you should pick and one that is blatently obvious that you shouldn't. The protagonist is pretty bland and unrelatable. Theres also a few grammar error but nothing game breaking, just a little frustrating but you can move past that. The story is also very predictable. Overall, the story and protagonist subtract from what this story could be in all. Sirrah, the heroine, was memorable however so that is a plus I can give the game.Overall:If I had to give an overall rating for this game, it would be a 6/10. However, I do encourage you, the reader of this review, to buy the game. Why? Didn't you just say the story was not the best? Yes I did. The reason is because, while the story is quite lacking, the game isn't horrible to play through. Its still enjoyable and Its worth a play through, especially when its price is only $2. If this game was around $10, it might be a different story. But for its relativly low price, I'd say it is a nice game to pick up.Also, on the off chance the developer reads this, considering this is a relativly indie game and I know most Indie game developers read their reviews, your game is fine overall but your story telling needs some improvement. Proof reading your script before publishing doesn't hurt either (sorry to be such a grammar nazi, things like that are just noticable for me). Also, make choice's tougher. As I said earlier in the review, the choice's given aren't that hard. It's pretty simple to tell which one is the better choice. If you work on making your protagonist slightly more relatable and tougher story choice's, then I'm sure your future games will be great hits :)."
,Not Recommended,610750,32720960,Posted: 24 June,all,Taebrythn,first thing i see is the font on a background that makes it hard to read. It starts to give me a headache. so i just start skipping. Even the stuff i did read was just boring to me. the artwork is fine. If you're looking for the nudity just keep going. there is none. Its barely ecchi. there is zero hentai for those that like that stuff with their stories.currently there is suppose to be dlc but we will see.

76561198069159152,Recommended,610750,33965188,Posted: 1 August,all,wrb41977,"So, this is a really short little visual novella. However, as it seems to also be the base for a series of ""Chapters"", it might develop into more. Thing is, I hope they add a different protagonist at each stage. Since the MC of this seems to have found his one true love...And while I'm betting you'll figure out the early twist already... I won't spoil it..."
,Recommended,610750,31258919,Posted: 20 April,all,Myerax,"30-50 minutes of reading time, depending how fast you read. VN has great art, can't wait for more episodes. I've seen the reviews, some people hate it, some people like it. This is just my opinion but I enjoyed it."
,Not Recommended,610750,31288661,Posted: 21 April,all,Azura Squifflepants,"Oh dear. This game is just plain bad. There is no story. It's a ""lose your virginity in your 20's without any nudity"" simulator and with not a jot of realism to it. The text is in a terrible font and placed on a background that makes it almost impossible to read. Translation is decent but not perfect.The art is really good though it can't rescue this from the bargain basement of visual novels. Mercifully it's short and if you can't get the ""true ending"" on the first try, you're really not trying very hard.Sorry, there's potential for this developer but it wasn't realized here. Thumbs very much down."

,Recommended,610750,31245567,Posted: 19 April,all,[MoeGamer.net] Pete,"While this first episode doesn’t really have the time to get too deep and meaningful over the course of its half-hour runtime (and has a few noticeable textual errors throughout its script, none of which are overly distracting, thankfully), it definitely has the potential to grow into something very intriguing with subsequent installments. The premise is interesting, the characters are pleasant to spend time with and the story, while rather mundane and clichéd, is charming.I’m certainly interested to see where Yume Creations goes with it from here. And if you, like the protagonist, are a lonely nerd, you might just find something to like here as well.Read the full review on MoeGamer"

,Recommended,610750,34032241,Posted: 5 August,all,Stormydove,"Weak story compared to other longer visual novels. It was almost like the author wrote around the art he had and tried to fit the story to it. No character development, just a quick few days with her.All in all, it was short and sweet, but I was hoping when he kept going to bed that he would awake to find her back as his console and him having dreamed the entire thing since he was up 30 hours. Could have been like a hallucination due to lack of sleep and having spent so much on the gaming console that it totally made him fall in love with it.Fun first game, can't wait to see what the author produces from here and pro-tip: Never finish inside your console, that's just bad for the system ;)"

,Recommended,610750,34486542,Posted: 25 August,all,Lumina,"At the moment I would call this a short visual novel, however it is episodic and so more is to come and thus it will get longer, but as of the time of this review, only one is out.The story is a gamers dream come true, your console turning in to a cute girl, There were a few minor spelling errors but nothing that really stands out.The game has good quality artwork and a sweet little story that I can not wait to continue when the next episode comes.One of my shortest reviews yet but I will add to it as the others are realesed, even though it is short; it took me 0.8 hours; I would say it was worth the money for the artwork alone, but throw in to the mix the short story and the hopes of things to come I will reccomend this."
