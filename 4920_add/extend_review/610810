In the darkness, weeping while sipping out from an oversized glass of wine. Or maybe a keg of beer.No? No, neither have I. Hah! Why would I ever..Talking to Hana is like talking to a kid that knows pretty much two word. Except maybe it's fifty instead, and the fact that she knows how to do this whole confusing math of kelvin vs celcius and how many second there is until the date is 27th of May. Or any other date, except you're talking to a bot.. So that's not a date, nuh-huh.In oracle mode she's supposed to be smart. All I got out of her was either ""YES!"" or ""No, no, no, absolutely not!"".Trigger-warning; Maybe it's the wrong time of the month.Meanwhile, in chat mode.. You get a response from certain words, like.. weight, boob, sex, age..And you guessed it, she doesn't understand whole sentences, just singular words. Type in ""age"" and it'll automatically write ""What's your age?"" for you, but if you type in ""What's your age?"" yourself you'll get a Hana staring at you like you wrote something beyond her comprehension. Go figure.I should write something positive here before I turn into a bitter old lady; Selling the cards will make the game free and then some. People are weird.TL:DR; There's better options out there if you're ever THAT lonely."

,Not Recommended,610810,31065350,Posted: 10 April,all,¡★Zerafalgar,"There's nearly nothing to review. This game has no content, literally.It's just that simple type of a bot that you ask a question and it mostly responds with yes, no or ""what do you mean?"" type of question. Not to mention there's nothing you can talk about with the bot. It might have a special answer for like... 10 questions?(The bot responds by ""what"" answer to things like ""howdy"" and ""bye"". That's just lazy.)There are far better free bots when it comes to that on the internet, this is just a bad one you have to pay for.The only things I can compliment is the easy 1 achievement you get pretty much for starting the game and typing one random letter in and then pressing enter. That's for achievement hunters.The emoticons and cards are also pretty good on the market right now so if you'd decide to craft a badge or just sell the cards you may get a small profit (if you get good emoticons or background then maybe a larger profit actually) or make a minimal loss from buying this game (you can always just run the game idle in the background so the cards auto-drop).I've spent 5 minutes ""playing"" this ""game"" in hopes to figure out I actually missed out on something and there's more than the same answers and ""yes-no"" type answers, and few random pictures with this thing called ""Hana"". There, however, might be more playtime displayed on this game at me because I want to get the trading card drops this game offers.However, I'm here to review the game, achievements and current market prices aren't an excuse for that there is zero content and the developers haven't really tried to put in too many special answers for the questions you ask. Unless you're a dedicated achievement hunter or feeling lucky about getting that lennyface/doge emoticon from crafting a badge for the game, I'd definitely suggest to pass on buying this game."

One is a magic 8-ball and the other is a shoddy ""chatbot"" that looks for a keyword in your message and then spits out two to ten lines of dialogue.The screenshots tell you that this is a shoddy mobile port. The meme emoticons tell you the creator isn't confident in his work's value. Listen to reason and skip this game."
