,Not Recommended,610930,30932658,Posted: 3 April,all,XJ9,"I won't lie if I say that this game is another unity garbage asset flip - EXACTLY the same game as PainTrain with a small difference.http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/recommended/5765601-now you CAN sprint and you run way faster than zombies and zombie bosses2-you kill mobs way faster3-zombies now glowing in the dark zombies and all weapons recolored into glowing in the dark ones, instead of the metro location you have the street with cloned house model, and brightness set to a minimum possible amount.4-ONLY 500 achievements to kill 500 zombies, no achievements for buggy stuff like headshots and other things.So the *developer* worked out some problems with his previous game and now we have this.Is this game better than the PainTrain? Yes.Is this game pile of garbage sh`t? Yes.If you are still not sure - compare these 2 menushttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840646265http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=898013776Cards and 500 easy achievements in 10 minutes + low price, that's why i bought this game.

Very shallow games that you won't touch again after 30min played for *cough* 500 achievements. Didn't expect much for $1 but reusing the same house for every single building on the street is taking it a bit far. If it's not just about quick cashflow, perhaps think about taking longer between releases. One bigger and better game with DLC for new modes and expansions.https://youtu.be/NJFZ_dFAaew"

While certainly not the worst game I've ever played, it certainly isn't anything more than 20 minutes and 3 hours of idling for the cards..  Zero replayability..At the very least they should include some type of instructions on how to interact with items so maybe if a person wanted too they could actually play the game and shut down the portals to actually get past wave one..I assume you shut the portals down by turning on the green lightswitches, but after pressing every button I could think of, I just got my 500 achievements and said,,, peace and chicken grease..So buy this game is you want 500 extra achievemetns and 5 cards... don't buy it if you want anything resembling a decent game...  Add some instructions on how to interact with things in game and maybe we can talk.."

,Not Recommended,610930,32741126,Posted: 24 June,all,Uncle Sparticus,"While having 500 additional achievements unlocked is nice, I still cannot recommend Phantom Soldier. To be fair, it is a hidden gem of organic storytelling: How do the portals come into being in the world of the game? What are the backstories behind all 500 enemies you'll be killing (since each of them has a unique achievement, and I bet you won't make yourself kill more than 500)? And, for that matter, why is the Phantom Solider so sticky? Every time your character bumps into an object, he sticks to it for a few moments. But why?These, and many other lore-related questions, are left up to the player to imagine up answers for. This level of creativity in writing is truly touching.On the other hand, it's a wave-based FPS with two (count 'em, two) enemy types. There is exactly one map. There are exactly three guns and one type of grenade, and your ability to use grenades disappears after the level in which you earn it.You basically have to win all the side missions if you are progressing through the game.Oh, and after Wave 7 the game just crashed. Fortunately, by that point I had gotten 100% completion and was just about ready to eat a non-phantom shotgun when I finally got the sweet relief of a runtime error."

,Not Recommended,610930,31230554,Posted: 18 April,all,A.,"I've review their previous game before called Dungeon Creepster (which you can check ithere), and this game, is also pretty bad.- You are a phantom and your objective here is to shoot the ghost as you complete your mission/side mission. Everytime you complete a side mission, you will get a reward such as the shotgun or etc. Thats it about the gameplay.- Again there is no option button which is stupid because every FPS games must have option button to set their sensitivity for example. You can't mute or check the control either. The control is only wasd to move, shift to run, left click to shoot and scroll wheel to change your weapon.- And again, 500 achievements, all the same as their previous title. Shoot an enemy, get 1 achievement. Shoot 500 enemy, get 500 achievements and it only takes you about 10 minutes.- Trading cards. Thats it.Stay away from this game or their whole company to be exact."

Seems the Unity asset flipping doesn't take too much time anymore. At least Steam Achievements look exactly the same like for Dungeon Creepster. So you mustn't rethink your strategy. I don't wanna mention this game could be an AvP ripoff because of the permanent nightvision mode enabled. Basically the Souls are the blue glowing Zombies from Pain Train floating without feet over the ground. After a few shots they explode in somekind of fireworks fountains (epileptic warning).http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=894486634Shooting 100 of them gives you the soul blaster (shotgun) which reload with 1 shell 5 shots. It's quite hard to enter a house and shut down one of the spawning portals. Strange that the easy solution is so close but inaccessable: Green highlighted lightswitches could blast off all of there soul arses. But that's not part of the game ...http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=894486675Instead you will fight eventually a ridiculous boss again: The Soul Commander. Looks like a glowing lightbug or killerbee to me.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=894486725Then immediately the next wave comes ... But unfortunately I already hit the 500 kills goal. Why I cannot hold back myself if I see a game for 59 cents and 500 easy achievements - idk."

,Not Recommended,610930,34284961,Posted: 16 August,all,P4099,"With games like this one all over Steam, it it's not a big surprise that pretty much everyone associates the Unity engine with asset flippers, crappy games, card farming scumbag developers and games that are filled to the brim with bugs.The very first level threw me onto the street with a blue blaster thingy in my hand and endless hordes of blue ghosts attacking me, apparently the titular ""phantoms"". The game wants me to close the portals these things emerge from by shooting said portals until they vanish.The catch? The two portals I could find were in houses that were basically right next to each other and the enemies were pouring out of the portals.Even if I managed to get one portal down, the phantoms would just come through the front door, the only entrance of the house, trapping and eventually killing me. That was on easy mode, mind you.A game where the first level is hard on easy mode.Anyway, gotta give the dev credit, at least it looks like he made the models himself.However, this doesn't change the fact that it just feels like this game was the result of the dev messing around in Unity for about 15 minutes before uploading whatever he had just created to Steam, selling it as if it was a profesionally made game."

,Recommended,610930,31686687,Posted: 11 May,all,GeoLuz 🎮💯👊🤙,"Phantom Soldier is a game about a war veteran who returns home to find out that souls murdered him and his family. In the afterlife, he must destroy these souls. However, the plot becomes an afterthought because it is all about shooting souls and destroying portals that produce them.The game is produced by Virtual Top, the company behind Pain Train. It follows the same pattern as Pain Train. Again, there is no manual, which is unacceptable to me. Like Pain Train, the setting never changes. Pain Train takes place in the same subway station whereas Phantom Soldier takes place on the same block with the same houses in what looks like a suburban neighborhood. The objective is to kill souls while trying to destroy portals inside each house. After destroying the necessary portals, the soul commander appears and must be defeated to advance to the next wave of souls. There are eight waves of souls and each wave requires more portals to destroy. Thus, the gameplay makes this game look like a Pain Train clone.The game runs on the Unity engine, a graphics engine that is decent both indoors and outdoors. The game has 500 achievements and would encourage players to attain all 500 achievements. The achievements are so easy: 1 kill = 1 achievement. Therefore, killing 500 monsters will earn you a perfect game. There are side missions such as getting X number of headshots and getting X number of kills cumulatively that will lead to better weapons when completed.Like Pain Train, I would conditionally recommend Phantom Soldier. If you want to earn 500 achievements and create a badge to level up your Steam profile, buy this game for $0.99. I would have given this game a thumbs down if it had cost any more than $0.99 because of the monotony of the gameplay and the environment. If you are not interested in earning easy achievements and Steam trading cards, stay away from this game. If you are looking for classic old school first person shooters, stay away from this game."

Then you sit and wait to get 3 cards, and eventually one day your booster pack. If you don't have a discount for the game, don't buy it. It is a very basic game where you run up and down a street holding your mouse to shoot a pistol until you get a shotgun. Apart from the horrible loading time and the amount of memory, disk and CPU it was flooding, I've played a lot worse ""90% off get free cards"" games. This one was okay."

Basically you play a ghost who needs to get rid of spawning locations of other ghosts, which you shoot. The AI is little more than Zerg Rush, heaps of enemies spawn and float towards you. You get an achievement every tijme you kill an enemy, which... well, it kinda adds to the overall feel of the game to be honest."

There are dozens of other FREE games that are a much much better use of your time. It's not even the type of bad that you can laugh at, it's just a buggy, generic mess."

,Not Recommended,610930,34379037,Posted: 20 August,all,Kony Kony?,"This game makes me think of some high-school programming project, never meant to be released to the public.The controls feel terrible, the guns are incredibly inaccurate and there are simply too many enemies on any ""gamemode"" (this game's equivalent of difficulty). You get a new gun (seemingly) for every side mission you complete, which does add a little diversity to the gameplay, though the guns are not very effective. You are tasked with destroying portals and not given any idea as to what a portal is and the portals themselves spawn an infinite number of ""glowing phantom monster demon satanic zombie skeletons"".Also the game itself looks better on a lower graphical setting than higher (""fantastic"" makes it harder to see things while fastest makes everything clear)I guess it's not too bad for $1, and I DID get it for 10 cents so, you know...Some gameplay on ""insane"" difficulty"
