,Recommended,611790,33523916,Posted: 13 July,all,Dune Tiger,"Loosely based on Shakespeare'sTaming of the Shrewand Milton'sParadise Lost, Eek! Games'House Partyoffers deep, introspective social commentary against the backdrop of a singular personal journey through Hell in a 50+ hour suburban social simulation RPG.  Cast as a nameless soul in the afterlife, players will find themselves in what would appear to be a normal, suburban house party of 20-somethings, but one look outside demonstrates that this is no ordinary house.Situated in a void of nothingness and fenced in with no escape, the house stands alone in an endless night as a perversion of the modern suburban ""paradise"" to which the players have been unwittingly invited.  In a subtle nod to futility, the opening tutorial message encourages players to simply explore and experiment, but plants the seed that your only option is to repeat the journey over and over again.  ""You cannot accomplish everything in one go,"" it warns you in not so many words, ensuring that players are well-prepared for the chaos to unfold before them.At first, the house seems like a quaint slice of the suburbs.  It's a 3-bedroom, 3-bath house adorned with flatscreen televisions, framed pictures of cats and random photos of a family that doesn't appear to live there.  The house is fully-furnished with a full kitchen and even has a two-door garage.  Slowly, but surely, however, the illusion begins to unravel and you realize that you're not where you ought to be and players are left wondering what sins the nameless player-character committed to be sent here.  You'll quickly realize that nobody attending the party knows you, not even Madison, the hostess (read: theShrew).Left to your own devices, you can explore and interact with the house and its guests, and that's when things begin to unfold.  The subtlety of Eek Games satire can be missed for those not paying attention - the guests at this party are 3 men - including the player - and five women, all of whom fit neatly into familiar archetypes from the idiot drunk to the shy sex bomb locked in her room; yet underpinning the surface apperance of an ordinary house party is a scathing criticism of current social justice politics -  there are no people of color or LGBT representation at this 'party' and your sole purpose, at least on the surface, is to use every trick in the book to demoralize and/or objectify the women.  It is no coincidence, then, that the inhabitants of Hell or Limbo (it's hard to determine exactly where we find ourselves in this dark comedy) are all vapid and easily-manipulated into various acts of debauchery or mischief.  Basically, everyone here deserves to be here, and each relationship between the characters can be explored and exploited for personal gain, but the trick of it is that the gain is always pyrrhic.  Even should you manage to get into bed with the woman of your dreams, you will be left completely unsatisfied and will only have to start again, as if you were Bill Murray inGroundhog Day, only instead of being in Punxsutawney, you're stuck in a personally-tailored exploration of the consequences of sin.If there is an argument for games-as-art,House Partywould be front-and-center.  There is no doubt that, like all great works of art, it will be misunderstood and unappreciated in its own time, but its biting satire and darkly-comedic look at the suburban lifestyle of the 2010s will surely serve future generations as a cautionary tale of avarice and hedonism.  While still in Early Access, there is still a lot to be discovered from Eek Games' entry into interactive literature and I look forward to the final product as it will stand as a pillar of the movement to leverage games as a tool to push for social change....Actually, the game is a bug-ridden mess with a fun premise that shouldn't last more than an hour or so, but apparently if you click on the forum link in-game and then quit it without quitting your web browser, Steam still thinks you're playing it.  The game has a dedicated masturabation button, for crying out loud.EDIT 8/1: As of the latest update (small spoiler), the L in LGBT is now present."
,Not Recommended,611790,35060569,Posted: 19 September,all,StigmataSasha,"Yes, positive steam reviews are funny. I do not disagree with that. But let's be honest here, it's not that decent of a game even for 15 dollars. It's not worth 15 dollars for the sheer value and content that it currently offers.There are a few basic mechanics that I do not see why it hasn't been updated into the game already. There is a missing continue game function on the main menu. Which is odd. It's tedious to start a new game just to load a save file. NPCs will keep walking away from you when you're trying to interact with them until you finally click on talk or give. And even when you do, the camera won't even pan towards them, if they already walked off the screen, you're talking to a blanket of air. Additionally, NPCs will just walk around with glitchy legs and clutter in rooms and hallways. And certain areas, although small are just so dark and hard to see. For example the kitchen counter, unless the object is a bright color, it literally just blends in with the counter and stove.Gameplay is super linear. As of now, there isn't much diversity in the paths you can take to achieve certain goals for the characters you want to get sexual with. Sure you can do particular steps in different orders that don't necessarily affect the outcome you want, but it makes no difference to the story. Yea it's early access, I get that. But there is a worry for the development of this game.“We will eventually call one of the versions 1.0. I can see that happening before the end of 2017. But that doesn't mean that we won't continue to update the game with new stories.”I just don't see how this game can leave early access by the end of 2017 ( as if the game could even be considered ""finished"" with the lackluster updates). At least that's what I'm getting from my interpretation. The game will leave early access which will be called 1.0. But the game will continue to be supported with updates. That's what it sounds like to me.  But don't push me too hard on that. If anyone can confirm otherwise, please do so respectfully.And I've read some reviews and oh boy the patreon thing just doesn't sit well with me. Asking for even more money when people already gave money to support the game being developed right now. I'm not the ethical police here. I'm just stating what I'm seeing. Moving on.In conclusion, wait for a sale or not buy it at all. As funny and silly the positive reviews ( as most steam reviews are), I feel it's egregious that such reviews are praised while negative ones with real criticism are for the most part ""shunned"", for the lack of a better word. Certain basic functions like the continue game and NPC walking bug ruins the most basic experience you would think a game would have implemented. I'm no engineer, but I am saying if you're a professional developer or even amateur, you'd have at least enough experience to implement basic functions. I completely respect and support Eek in the fight against censorship where it's hypocritical that video games with extreme violence and gore is accepted by most of the game industry. The game in it's current state isn't for me, if it ever even improves beyond the experience I had."

Honestly, the larger community's outrage over this game disgusts me.  Yes, it is a very vulgar game, but I agree with the dev team at Eek! that sexual content should be no more censored than murder, genocide, gore, and other forms of extreme violence.  If the criticism is that House Party is essentially a sex game just for the sake of being a sex game, I would counter that Grand Theft Auto is a violence game just for the sake of violence, and that the popular Rock Star series has not only flourished on Steam, but has done so for nearly half a dozen iterations.I urge Valve to reconsider despite the complaints.  If someone doesn't want to play the game, they don't have to.  And if people are worried about their kids having access to such a title, then they should be monitoring their childrens' computer usage and making use of parental controls, not blaming Eek! for their lazy parenting.Besides, if someone really doesn't like the fact that House Party is available on Steam, what are they gonna do about it?  Use Origin?  I don't think so."

,Recommended,611790,33142015,Posted: 2 July,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"As of July 2017, don't buy this game.WhileHouse Partyis a ton of fun if you like adult content puzzlers, it is horribly broken at this point. Here is some of the crap we have to put up with right now:No mouse sensitivity options, so you are steering your character with giant swinging arcs of your arm. Terribly annoying to say the least. Insult to injury, the game revolves around you running around inside of the house.Quests bug out randomly. This wastes large chunks of your time doing the same thing over and over to get to a certain point.Twice I've had the misfortune of character sequences getting stuck in a forever loop, causing me to have to restart.The code is unoptimized.No scroll bars in your inventory, causing a whole 'nother level of inventory management. You want to access that key? Well ya gotta get rid of stuff so you can see it on the screen.The items all nearly look like asset store stuff (that's fine to a certain degree, but gets old with games in general)But why do I upvote the game?Beyond all of the broken parts,it really is fun. The character models look really great, actually. The story and actual characters are fun and interesting. The voice acting isn't half bad either, for an indie title. I hear alot of comparisons toLeisure Suit Larry, but I'm not sure that's really what I get from this. Yeah, it has that angle of convincing women to take their clothes off, but this is much more interesting all around.Pros:+Really fun item collection based game+The girls look great+No patch needed (first on Steam!)+Voice acting is good+AddictingIf you like games with adult content that actually have a legitgame, you need to playHouse Partyat some point.I just hope it gets refined rather quickly, because the current state is fairly embarrassing."

,Not Recommended,611790,33624245,Posted: 18 July,all,Fishbits,"So I bought this game with the full understanding, I thought, of what I was getting into. I thought to myself, ""This is going to be a bunch of Unity assets cobbled together poorly with barely any story, terrible voice acting, awkward and unconvincing dry-boning, and particle effects that would make the Playstation look positively amazing by comparison. That was my mindset going in, with the understanding that that was going to be relatively fine. I could work with it.Game loading. Crash. Game loading. Crash. Game loading. Crash. Changed graphic settings repeatedly on a machine that regularly handles Overwatch with no hiccups. Game loading. Crash. Wow. Great optimization there. Okay, it's early access. Maybe it's a known bug. Maybe it'll be fixed soon in this alpha/beta state.Load it up on a more powerful machine. Barely uses any system resources, runs fine. Okay, now this is getting a bit annoying. But whatever. It's running. Let's look at the menu.""Become an Alpha/Beta Tester""...what.You mean you want me to click a special link in a beta game purchased through Early Access, a platform for alpha and beta games, to get to the alpha/beta? Okay, fine....Patreon.Aaaand there's my tolerance gone.Look, if you're going to release half-finished games for public testing, cool, I recognize that that is the present-day paradigm. If you're going to just recycle a bunch of Unity assets to make your game, so much so that the phone in the game still has the Unity logo on it? Peachy. I get that some people go through the easy art asset route to tell a story more easily and without having to gather a massive amount of funds just to get the game launched.But if you're going to take my money for an early access version of the game, then demand MORE money for the actual early access to the game? That's where we're going to have problems. And as it turns out, it's also where Steam is going to have problems, because it is against the Steam terms of service to do so. Linking out to any sites that ask for financial information of any kind is against Steam's publisher TOS, and a good way to get your game taken down.I suggest an immediate fix. Because Steam just dropped the hammer on another dev with more titles and more clout behind them for less.--EDIT--The developers seem to have pushed out a high-speed patch last night to remove the offending link, which is, while admirable, definitely telling considering the clandestine nature of the patch, with no patch notes listed here on Steam. This tells me they knew exactly what they were doing, and that it was against the Steam terms of service."
,Recommended,611790,33971110,Posted: 2 August,all,muppet,"This is a slightly odd review, as I have zero intention of playing the game, save for the 5 minutes necessary for me to post this review,  but I am indignant at the the stupid double standard that exists around the gaming industry, but is not part of that industry.After reading the ars news article on the ban and re-introduction of the game to steam(https://arstechnica.co.uk/gaming/2017/08/house-party-game-censored-steam/)I am incensed by this:In a letter NCOSE sent to Valve last week, the group complained that the game ""not only normalizes but instructs its users as a virtual how-to of sex crimes and misogyny... If anyone were to apply actions from the game in real-life situations, they could inflict immeasurable harm to others and potentially be in violation of state or federal law.""Yeah? how is this different from a thousand and one ""action"" games? Which feature stealing vehicles, using explosives, guns and actually shooting people with them, any of which ""If anyone were to apply actions from the game in real-life situations, could inflict immeasurable harm to others and potentially be in violation of state or federal law."" Duh! The key here is ""in real-life"", which this game is not.The reason why I play games is _entertainment_. But there is also an element of me which enjoys all that stuff _without the consequence_ of harm to others. I have no intention of ever shooting anyone or stealing a car, or getting another human being drunk in order to♥♥♥♥♥♥them. However, I am capable of separating films/games and the real world for the purposes of my own entertainment. Clearly NCOSE and others cannot do that, and they don't believe anyone else can.I have no sympathy with such groups that seize headlines, and pass judgement on the actions of others without actually seeing the film/or playing the game or even providing any proof that doing so causes harm to anyone.So, although I have no intention of playing this game, I bought it with my own hard-earned £10.99 to support other adult's rights to play it, and the developer's right to free speech."

,Not Recommended,611790,33546056,Posted: 14 July,all,RaggitySkags,"This game is pretty garbage, first of all, basically to sum everything up for the impatient people, this is a point and click adventure in every sense of the word; you need to get something in order to get something else, in order to get something else and there's never really any kind of pay off.Secondly, the developers have begun REMOVING CONTENT because it's too scandalous for the mature audience this game is intended for. There's a rather pain in the♥♥♥♥♥mission to get some nude pics off a girls phone in order to black mail her, but you can't do it anymore because it's been removed.Third, the developers are talking about adding 15$ monthly updates in the future (Edit: For beta/alpha access to upcoming content), why? Why try to milk this game for anything more than what it is? It's supposed to be a party simulator, the main selling point is the uncensored nudity and sex sequences, but to get to them is so convuluted and has such backwards logic that it's really not worth the original game to begin with.A final note, there are no guides worth reading on this game, it's literally just a bait game for those lonely enough to think it's going to be something in depth and worth it, yes I am included in that demographic, it doesn't mean I can't review the game and let everyone else in my demographic know to avoid it."

,Not Recommended,611790,33066263,Posted: 30 June,all,Y'vvel,"This is my first review for this type of ""game,"" so bear with me.House Party is one of the first purely-sex related games on Steam. Sure, we've had visual novels, but nothing that is just for the purpose of ""getting laid."" I remember hearing about this game a long time ago, and then just forgetting it but I saw that it popped up on Steam and decided to buy it to see if anything had changed from the old footage I saw. I honestly hate to flag this game as negative, seeing as it has potential. I honestly don't have much to say, but I will lay out the pros and cons of the game and then give a short closing statement.Pros-Good humor-Accurate representation of the average Millenial party-Interactable characters all having differing personalities and quirks-Certain choices lock you out of ""endings""-Great jiggle physics-Lesbian character that's only there to make you waste your time trying to get with her-""Game"" isn't overly difficult, but makes you work for what you want; it vaguely reminds me of HuniePop-Canvas for other stories and situationsCons-Clunkiness that probably won't change throughout it's development-Awkward physics for everything else other than boobs, (It seems like the devs put more effort into making one of the characters dance rather than making sure another can't clip a chair and get knocked out)-Awkward playable character, (you're pretty much just a sex hungry young adult who can't rationalize anything properly without sex on the line)-Sloppy animations and lack of facial expression-Lack of actual game-Awkward chatacter development-Uninteresting character interactions-Lack of overall diversity in the romantic partners, (even though the characters all have their own quirks, they're still all the same type of girl; this is further enforced by the fact that they all have the same waist and the only major difference is their breast size)In closing...I can't recommend this game just based on the humor and boobs alone. I am aware it's in early access, but the game just doesn't seem all that appealing after you finish. I can understand it's appeal if you prefer something to be from your point-of-view and control. However, you, as a buyer, would be much better off finding porn elsewhere rather than playing this game, mostly due to it's current state. Like I said, the game has potential. It allows users to create other stories and situations, but honestly you'd be better off saving your money until we see more."

I haven't seen a lof of games like this, where the sole purpose is to get laid. I'm no fan of early access, since it contrasts with my moral gaming beliefs, nonetheless I decided to try something different and defy my beliefs. I was certainly not dissapointed, but there is definetly still room for improvement.Stuff marked with ""*"" will have a short comment further down. Although I will mostly be focusing on the cons.Pros:- Interresting unique concept*- Most of the characters are quite interresting, with interresting story lines.- Neat character designs.- Nice approach to the puzzle genre.-♥♥♥♥♥♥- Nice voice acting.Cons:- Doesn't really feel like a party*- Lacking in animations.*- Lacking in objectives.*- Needs more variety in music.- Inaccessible areas & Map*Concept:The concept is very interresting and very unique. I personally at least, haven't seen a lot of games - with sex as the primary objective - that were not a visual novel, so this a rather nice change. There already is a ♥♥♥♥load of VN's making them feel very similar and generic (With a few exceptions such as Katawa Shoujo). In addition I am not American myself, and I have never been to an American house party, so being able to get an insight (although probably very inaccurate), is pretty nice.Give it some ""Omf"":First off: ♥♥♥♥. Frank. I like the idea of having some kind of resistance, I just think it is incredibly poorly executed in Frank. Who in the bloody ♥♥♥♥ would attend a party, just for the sole purpose of being a♥♥♥♥♥♥and stealing everybodies drinks. And then if he discovers somebody >>>> drinking at a party <<<< he will beat them up, in this case either Patrick or the player. And to top it all off, there is no counterplay to him (yet).Now as I said this is a party, so where are all the people at? There are like, what 8 people including the player? Forgive me if my stereotyping is completely incorrect, but every movie I have seen, every TV-show I have seen, every documentary I have seen, these American house parties are usually stacked with people. I don't mind there not being a storyline for 20 different characters, but just the fact that there are 20 different characters really boosts the atmosphere.Lacking in animations:Most of the animations are boob-jiggle animations which I don't mind of course. But having a few more facial animations that are a little less staccato wouldn't hurt. Now the game itself is revolving around getting laid, so I'd have imagined they would have more sex animations than 3-4. Of course this is early access, so it can still change which I am hoping for.Lacking in objectives:Now the ultimate goal is to get laid, which is fine of course. But that is rarely (for me atleast) the only goal at a party. Perhaps implementing some sort of buzz meter that changes the dialouge options based on how drunk the player is would be neat, or something along those lines. It's like the MC is some kind of demon-possessed sex maniac. It feels like sex is the only thing he can think about. I mean, I get it he's a dude, sexual thoughts occupy a majority of the brain but come on. It almost feels barbaric.Inaccessible areas & Maps:I will keep this short, as I believe this is very likely to be changed in the future. Being able to use the jacuzzi for one would open up for some interresting interactions. Also making the couches and the luxurious chair outside next to the jacuzzi, would be pretty neat if it was interactive (making them sit-able). Having more parties to attend at different houses would be pretty cool too, but it is an incredibly high demand, so it's cool if the devs want to focus elsewhere.Final VerdictDespite its flaws, and my harsh words, I had a lot of fun playing House Party nonetheless. It's a unique addtion to the games with sexual content, with soooo much potential. Normally I would say wait until the 1.0 version is released, but I want to see the game prosper, and the best way to do that is to give them more funding. My only fear is that I am putting my expectations too high, and I will end up getting dissapointed.Rating: ?/10I think I will wait with the rating itself until the final version is released. But it definetly has the potential to be nearing the 10/10.EDIT: I was pretty stoned when I wrote this, so I do apoligize for any grammatical errors, incorrect choice of words etc."

Characters have this life-less look to them, and animate horribly. The game also just feels really clunky. To be fair, this is an Early Access game, but I don't see these things changing ever.I think a more appropriate price point for this game would have been in the 5-8 Dollar range, with a price increase if it ever gets out of Early Access. I would have given the game a thumbs up then, and wouldn't have refunded it.I also want to add, I was turned off by the fact that Steam purchasers won't get access to upcoming beta versions. Steam supports beta versions of games, and allows you to opt-in on them if you choose. But, apparently Beta versions are exclusive to Patreon tiered supporters.I hate to say it, but the whole thing feels like an overpriced, low budget cash grab sex game, that will probably never be finished.Not Recommended at current price point.-Also, Big thumbs up to Valve for allowing a game like this on Steam completely uncensored. Hopefully this will be the first of many."

If you don't succumb to looking up the solutions, you'll sink a lot of time playing through the game over and over in different ways, ironing out the mistakes you make.If you're offput by the inclusion of sexual content, perhaps you should have read the tags of the game before purchase, or noted that it was similar to Leisure Suit Larry.

There areextremelyadult elements to this game, at a level I've never seen in a title on Steam before.That being said, it also has a very addictive structure to it, trying to figure out how to fulfill requests or requirements of the other people at the party.The thing is, it's pretty entertaining to play, though I wouldn't be showing this to anyone who doesn't already have a clear idea of acceptable sexuality. There are some things you can do in this game which are borderline unsafe, were you to do the same thing in real life.I'm an adult, I can handle it, but again... I wouldn't say this is a good example of normal sexual behavior.All that aside, my wife had a laugh at the game, so it hasn't been so far out there as to get me in marital trrouble. Then again, from what I've heard about the game, maybe I just haven't gotten very far...The puzzles in the game aren't straight forward, and there's not a whole lot of help online to point the player in the right direction. It's very easy to offend other members at the house party, and that's it, you'll have to start again if you want to have a chance to progress their storylines.There's a LOT of trial and error, there are required objects all over the house, some of them even hidden very cleverly.You know, I just can't stop wondering how the heck this game is even sold on Steam. I'm surprised... very surprised.All in all, it's a fun puzzle sort of game. It's quite on the buggy side, it's rough around the edges, and there are some dodgy things you can do in the game, but it's certainly unlike anything I've ever played before, so there's that.Don't buy the game if you're easily offended, a minor, or especially an easily offended minor. If sexism bothers you, you should probably steer clear of this game, as well.If, on the other hand, you can laugh at crudeness, and enjoy completely novel experiences, maybe you'll like this one.The choice is yours."

The story isn't very deep (and offensive to some) and graphics aren't polished at all. That said, this a very fun 'non-anime art' adult game. Despite the flaws, I loved playing the game and meeting the cast of one dimensional 'thinly developed' characters. Yes there are very graphic sex scenes, audio, and nudity (with patch). Only 2 of the girls can be laid, 2 give BJs, and almost all but one girl can get naked. Game's still in early access so improvements are gonna be made. I hope they continue to make more  games like this one."

You're wondering if you're going to get the full NSFW experience that you're looking for? And you're wondering just how ""Early"" is this access?Firstly let me just say the game is in a very playable state. The only real issue I've encountered is trouble loading my save games, but there's already a workaround for that up on the forums. Beyond that all the characters have fleshy dialogue trees and interactions. Everything works.As for the NSFW I'm sure you heard about this game being pulled, censored, then returned to Steam. Just download the patch the developer is offering, you're getting the full experience, trust me. If this game were VR capable, it would be the best thing since sliced bread.And finally my own personal thoughts... This game is good. This comes from the fact that it's characters and their interactions are good. Katherine is a total ♥♥♥♥♥ it's true, but I'll be damned if she isn't hot because of that. Stephanie is about as smart as a fence post, but she's got a great rack and she's really nice. Ashley really does seem like the innocent younger sister, but get to know her and she's more than willing to be naughty. Etc, etc...I honestly enjoyed engaging these stereotypes and screwing with their party in a number of different ways.

It's very satisfying to look back at all the tedious work of doing the work(basically a minor quest). This game is more about story lines, then about actual game play. If you are expecting to literally go to the party and f*ck someone within 5 minutes, you should turn away from this game(although you can download a custom story to do so).The potential for this game is there, because you can literally make your own story line, and download other people's stories.

This is my first early access title, as I usually steer clear of early access games, but I for one am not disappointed. I completed all the story lines in about 8.5 hours, but really only because I used guides because I'm a chump.The puzzles are actually pretty challenging, as the game doesn't give you any real hints on how to solve quests. While this may seem annoying, it makes the game that much more challenging, and gives a much greater sense of reward when you finally complete a quest. If you don't use any guides or walkthroughs, you're looking at over 10 hours. The reason it's this long, is because the puzzles are challenging, and you will restart. A lot.The charcters you meet are all charming in their own way, yes even Frank. They each have their own personality, body language, and way the talk. Ex: Madison, the host of the party, can be a b*tch at times, and wants you to prank her sister, but is overall nice. Katherine is top of her class (as she states) and is condescending of others because of it (though she is still likeable). Ashley, Madison's sister, is fairly normal (I say normal because she has no real traits that make her stand out), and relaxed. Stephanie is an airhead (though when it comes to drugs she's a genius), and what most would consider a sl*t. Rachael, like Ashley, is real normal and laid back. And Brittany is a sweet shy girl with a cute country accent.All the characters are really likeable, yes even Frank who, when you boil it down, really just wants what's best for everybody. The game is also beautifuly voice acted, and really helps convey the characters and their personalities.Now, this game is not without its flaws.For a game where the ultimate goal is to get laid, there aren't a lot of positions you can take when having intercourse. As of right now, it's only missionary and doggy style. While they are animated really well, it does get kind of boring. Hopefully they'll add more positions in future updates.There also isn't a real variety of music in this game. There is only one song playing at all times on a constant loop. But I'm positive they'll add more music in the future.Also the jacuzzi and the lounge by the jacuzzi are unaccessable, which is really disappointing, because in a game about getting laid, those spots would've been real interesting; though I expect them to be accessable in the future.As of right now you can only get it on with 4 out of the 6 girls in the game. Stephanie and Brittney's quest lines are incomplete, though will more than likely updated in the future.In a nutshellPros:-Unique-Interesting characters-Good character design-Female models are beautiful-Voice Acting is great-Challenging-High Replay Value-SexCons:-Lack of animations-No variety in music-Incomplete questlines-Jacuzzi and Lounge inaccessibleRating: As of right now, the game is a 7/10, though I expect my rating to raise once the game is finished.UPDATE: I am now lowering this to a 6/10 because as of late, whenever I try to load up a save, the game says the save cannot be loaded, and sends me to a new game. It turns out that this occurs whenever you update the game, and the save was on a previous version of the game. Hopefully the devs see this and fix the problem.UPDATE 2: It turns out the game was censored, but this is alright because Eek! games has a 18+ patch on their website."

But anyway. there r some charaters that you able to haveBJ with clothes,some of them it naked.also some of them arereal sex avaliableand some others you can let themnakedin the public.中文评论：各位在内地的同胞，玩的时候小心点，虽然没什么特别的音效，但是绝对能把你变成黄赌毒分子，高清无码，所以请锁好房门再玩游戏。这个游戏基本就是一间房子里面在搞聚会，但是加上你只有3个男的，一个是醉鬼酱油众，一个是暴力男，这两个基本把你的游戏体验延长了一段不短的时间。这个游戏的目标呢，就是“睡""尽所有女的，但是分成几种，不能脱衣服但是可以上口，可以上口上相机不穿衣服，可以 公开裸 和 不公开裸的，能真干的，能强脱了的。。。。好吧。。。还能拉低视角看裙底。。。总之，这游戏就是干一些现实中做了要么吃牢饭，要么进医院的事。。好的，这就是一个撸游。"

,Recommended,611790,34132961,Posted: 9 August,all,SPKx,"Undoubtedly this is probably one of the most controversial games on Steam right now. The game features some very strong sexual content and nudity, which would probably result in the game getting an AO if rated by the ESRB. In addition, some of the scenerios (pariticuarly the blackmail quest) results in you doing actions in the game that border on sexual assault.However, despite the obvious ethical boundries the game crosses, it is still relatively fine as a point-and-click RPG. I also like the option to create your own storylines for the game and I hope later versions of the game moves past being merely a pick-up simulator."

Animations are fine, it is still in EA. Ive played the game straight threw and I've ran around and ummm ""Painted"" on every one (Frank kills you for doing so on him, understandably).The voice acting is pretty good, especially some of the responses to messed up things you can say and do. The whole Custom Story thing is a neat idea but I really dont see anyone doing anything with it aside from more adult content, kind of a shame.Anyway, its a fun game for adults, very entertaining and I'm anxious to see what else the Devs do with it before it leaves EA or if the Nudity aspect is its only trick? We will see."
76561198049032833,Recommended,611790,34753165,Posted: 5 September,all,MrCode,"The game lets you roam around a house surrounded by attractive females. That's not to say that's the only reason to play. It contains a variety of puzzles to takle in order to get people to like you more.Such as get me a certain item. For me I seemed to get stuck on one task for ages then i realised another mechanic of the game and i solved it swiftly. It's not necessarily the nudity that is the best part it's the challenge of getting there that is rewarding.One issue is that saves don't always seem to work so you may want to save frequently. Also saying the wrong thing can close some dialogue options so you may be seeing quite a lot of restarts. But it's all in the fun of learning the little quirks of the game.Try not to fall into the trap of thinking that each character has an ending because some are unfinished as i spent a few hours on trying to figure out what to do next. As me being a person that doesn't like to look at guides i went and researched to find out that the ending hadn't been completed yet. But it's in early access so what can you expect.A lot of the story line is creative and fun. You'll be doing stuff that you wouldn't expect and it's very interesting.The characted pathing can go a little wrong sometimes with a few people stuck on the stairs, but the AI seems to always manage to get to its location which is great. You can also move people out of the way by walking into them.Also about the nudity there is a very simple patch you can apply to get it back. Took me about 5 mins to sort that out.The story creator mode is great, although a little complicated as you have to go through a few downloads. But once you understand it there's a lot of fun to be had. You don't need programming knowledge to do it either as it's done with drop down boxes where you can select what you want.The voice acting is good and they all have very distinct tones.Overall if you like to be creative and do all sorts of things then this is the game for you. Laters and happy house partying."
76561198137842067,Not Recommended,611790,35386995,Posted: 1 October,all,the2hotrods,"I can't even recommend this game ironically. It costs $15 for less than an hour of content (I literally beat the whole game in less than an hour. It doesn't give you much choice, either. You will either fail or complete most quests with almost no alternative endings), and doesn't even have much replayability.It is poorly optimized, and runs at an extremely low framerate. I am almost certain that this game was made from unity, as the house itself can be boughthere(it is notorious to fans of Jim Sterling like me for being in countless ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games). I have played other games made in unity, one of my personal favorites being Kerbal Space Program. KSP runs at about 50 FPS on my crappy gaming laptop, while this game runs at about 14 FPS. I know that it's in early access, but if a game as huge as KSP can run at a more playable framerate than a game that takes place in a tiny, cramped house with only a handful of people walking around, then there shouldn't be any excuse.The game is also buggy and broken. I get that this is early access, but still. The NPC pathfinding is a joke. Every time NPCs walk into eachother, they will pause for a few  seconds, walk around in circles, then move past eachother. If you look down at your body, you can even see your skin clip through your clothes. This also happens the the NPCs sometimes.My main gripe with House Party is that it's overpriced. If this game costed $5 or less, then I could accept that. However, its costs three times the amount it should actually cost. Not only that, but the developer(s) still think they should open up aPatreonfor their games! If you're charging people to play your games (especially at this price), then why do you need money from Patreon?If this game gets any better in the future, I will re-write my review. It may be early access, but that doesn't make it immune to criticism."

After you've mastered this guide you will not only be able to pick up any girl to your liking during any party anywhere, but you will also have the self confidence to whip out your♥♥♥♥♥♥in every inappropriate situation and just wank off to anything and anyone in matter of seconds. You'll also learn how to be a creepy backstabbing horny soap opera celebrity, running round in a total stranger's house, stealing and collecting things that aren't yours! Like stealing the host's cellphone in order to blackmail said host into doing sickly perverted stuff for you, and for some unknown reason is way more afraid of a couple of nude pictures of herself getting out there than being stripped naked by a stranger, forced down in all kind of different position, exposing everything, ejeculated upon AND forced to go around naked at her own party exposed to all her friends and guests, this girl has her priorities well figured out. So as you can see, this guide will get you places, it doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you just get the sexual pleasure you desire.Now you are probably asking yourself: What if she already has a boyfriend? Well, guess what! You'll also learn how to bypass boyfriends! As you proceed in our guide we will teach you how to manipulate and lick up to stereotypical blonde with a ♥♥♥♥♥y personality, in order to make them have revenge sex with you (a total stranger) because their boyfriend is a♥♥♥♥♥♥ So no worries, you can always make a move as long as you do it the right way. So don't let (probably steroided football player boyfriend) Get in the way of your fun, even tho the revenge ♥♥♥♥♥♥ chipmunk records your sex act and sends it to her boyfriend, who is for some reason not totally showing up at the party to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the dude who shagged his girlfriend multiple times over and over again if you so choose to.You ever fancy a quick blow job? Well all you have to do is help a total stranger who had her cloth's wet because of her ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (most likely abusive and slightly sosiopathic sister) spilled beer all over her just because she thought it was funny, all you have to do is steal a diary and a cellphone, cause it is a known fact that if you deliver the diary of a sibling to another sibling will earn you outmost respect and trust to the degree of wich the girl (who is a total stranger) will strip naked and simply just hand you her cloths by just asking if she would like you to wash her lundry, cause everyone knows that changing in the same room as the person who takes care of your laundry is necessary for this highly advanced act of physical deed to work correctly, as you stand there looking the girl up and down, wich is totally not creepy but 100% socially accepted you may pity the girl and maybe ask her how she's doing, because you are a good guy after all. She may feel thirsty and would love the soda she has stored away in the fridge downstairs, but can't get herself now as she's naked. BUT as luck would have it, you were downstairs raiding the fridge earlier (wich is also 100% socially acceptable in a strangers house) and stole a soda wich you gladly hands her wich she gladly accepts without even questioning your morals or kleptomaniac tendencies. Whatever you coulden't do before you gave her the soda, you can do now without any question, and you know it! You know how ♥♥♥♥ing important that soda is, you can just feel how ♥♥♥♥ing difference that soda can meant! So you probably wanna try persuade her to take off her panties too, because they are also soaked in beer (for some reason this girls cloths appears to be 100% soaked in beer, no exceptions like there is no dry spots at all!) And because of that ♥♥♥♥ing gamechanger of a soda can who really made you earn her trust to a so ♥♥♥♥ing intense degree beyond even people being together for mounths+ She will give you her panties, and stay in her room naked for you to return with her cloths, washed and dried. She will be very happy and thank you for saving her life (apparently she was in a serious life threatning situation) And she will show her appreciation by giving you unlimited blow jobs whenever the ♥♥♥♥ you want, as long as you are alone with her, because it's not normal to do sexual intercourse and sexual related acts around others.Also, if you fancy her sosiopathic sister instead, just make sure you put a whole bottle of eye drips in the soda before giving it to her when she finished changing, and no you don't know if it's dangerous or poisonious, you're just here to ♥♥♥♥ strangers, make sure to lock all the bathrooms with the key conveniently placed on the kitchen table, wich you stole when you arrived. And watch her sister laugh maniacly as her sister runs naked around the party, sick from the tamered soda, ashamed and stripped of all dignity, but this is okey. Cause now you will be able to have unlimited blow jobs from her sister instead, this only applies if you are alone ofcourse, as we already been through earlier, it is not normal to have sex related acts around other people.Just don't♥♥♥♥♥♥off the very edgy straight-edge guy who does not seem to be friend or know anyone but you can totally find on every single party everywhere, who has been collecting everyone else's alcohol and confiscated it because he is a vegan steroided apache helicopter who enforces his lifestyle upon others. Remember not to♥♥♥♥♥♥this guy off, he will try and knock you out if he catches you with booze, he is bigger and stronger than you, but will always 100% of the time always miss you if you move away from him. But even tho, don't fight back, you have lost 100%. Even tho the door is there and you can basecally just open it and run away or probably hit him in the groin with a well placed kick. But luckily for you, this guide offers way's and sollution to how you can befriend such a brute, by running around the house you are totally unfamilliar with, and find bottles of cheap booze hidden away in places NO ONE WOULD EVER IMAGINE, thise places are so cleaver indeed that only you, a stranger could possibly find them. By vandalizing the house, destroying electronics without anyone including the inhabitants batting an eye. When you finally find the 6 required flasks, wich you totally knew were to find, and wich he admits he oversaw because they were totally hidden on super secret locations only the gouvernment must have approved in order for thise bottles to stay hidden so well. As you earn this total stranger but  edgy guy's trust by delivering him 6 flasks of booze, he will 100% fully trust you and you'll be able to take away the thermos one of the girls so dearly missed, wich was taken from her, because as fate would have it this edgy guy is convenitnely getting ill by sniffing alcohol. So he entrusts his most trusted but newfounded stranger of a straight-edge sidekick to just sniff that thermos and tell the truth wich you swear that you do, and just like that you your quest to get laid with another stranger has began.And that's all for the first chapter of this book, please check out Your guide to I am really tired of typing for for information.Ps: This guide or it's involved participants in it's development can and will not take responsibility to possible failure or consequence due to thise actions 100% reality based scenarios and ways to pick-up a girl wich is happening all the time everywhere on all parties world wide.Also:  10/8=====D"

This is due to the fact that I currently have a MacBook Air and the game clearly does not work for this platform. And I highly recommend it be made accessible on a MAC platform as I have read a lot of reviews who are complaining it is not available for macs. Please do this as soon as possible as I have been looking forward to playing this game for so long! i love it though.It also does not work properly on the other laptop which I am disappointed in. I do not know if it is because of my laptop, but hopefully that is the case as I have seen a lot of people very pleased with the game.Apart from the previous statements, I do really like the game as I played a lower version of it which I downloaded for free. I am sure it has been further improved."

The graphics on the highest setting are pretty fantastic and the general idea of this game has the potential to be just as good.  I want more story and a background setting for the front and back yard, a skyline perhaps, and stars in the sky, the moon looks great though. I hope more goes into the game but either way it was worth the money."

Also do not save near nude people or like active cutscene type stuff it creates saves that do not work.

76561198025604785,Recommended,611790,33648483,Posted: 19 July,all,Diskmaskin,"TL;DR The game is fun, sexy and engaging, but it definitely needs further development before it really shines through. Here’s a list of reasons why:Early development:Obviously, the game is still in early access, which is an immediate turnoff for some and it is quite apparent. Characters might gasp in disgust if you pull you♥♥♥♥♥♥out, even though you are about to have sex, the surrounding area is a dark void and there is one girl you cannot currently score with (yet). I hope they continue to push towards a finished gamePresentation:Upon loading up the game, you are immediately greeted with a large-chested blonde and upon the start of a new game, you are met with a message that more or less says “lots of females, no competition. Have fun!” Throughout the party, a cheesy, funky tune loops, while you are surrounded with attractive females and a buttload of alcohol. The gives the vibe of a low-budget porno that’s about to start and helps to ratify the direction/tone of the gameThe writing:The writing is pretty damn good. It’s not incredible, but there were plenty of chuckles to be had, memorable moments and even a few breaking fourth wall moments. Not much to sayThe characters/AI:The game offers a surprising variety of characters in the game. All of them feel genuine, albeit exaggerated for the sake of the game. Each of them have a unique personality, a matching voice and is likeable/dislikeable in their own way. They respond to variety of stimulus, whether they spotted someone dancing topless, a fistfight or someone jerking off in public. They’re also not dumb, which I like. By that, I mean you can’t fool them that easily. If you conspire against or do something against their favor in their presence, you will be called out for it, which I think is a nice touch.The quests:There are 6 girls in the game, 5 of which you can get naked and of those 5, two that you can bone. In order to see some skin, you need to complete a small series of mini quests. They vary quite a bit in difficulty.  There is one girl that’s easy to score, two that are medium and two that fall into pretty damn hard to get territory. The quests in question vary in length and level of think required. I’d suggest you do a blind play through to get the most out of the game. If you do, you will mess up. A lot. But it will make the reward that much sweeter in the end. All of the quests are ridiculous and absurd, fitting in tone of the game.Custom story line:I must confess, I have done absolutely nothing in terms of checking out the player made story content, so if I get my facts wrong, feel free to screamThis could go down either of two ways, either we get a nexus mods level forum dedicated to improving and increasing the lifespan of the game, vastly improving the experience OR we get some meh unvoiced mods for the game. The idea for custom creation in a game that’s confined to 6 girls in one house feels rather limiting. It would be pretty cool if we could create custom objects, girls, house, etc. But at that point, wouldn’t it be more of a sex sim creator? I hope I will be proved wrongThe sex:So, how does the main aim of the game hold up? Well, the sex scenes themselves are a bit tame, though iirc they are getting close enough to fund an animator for smoother sex scenes. But apart from that, it’s quite engaging actually. The game offers a wide variety of fetishes; humiliation, blackmailing, exhibitionism, revenge-♥♥♥♥ing, dare ♥♥♥♥s and so forth. Further more, there is a fair amount of variety among the ladies so there’s bound to be something you like. What I also thoroughly approve of is that there is absolutely NO FORCED CENSORSHIP AT ALL. There is full-frontal-nudity, with a glorius view to it all. I appreciate thatDid I just spend money of this?:I know this contradicts pretty much everything I’ve said so far regarding the game. But, I can’t help but feel conflicted about this game. Part of me feels like an idiot for spending 15 euro on something I can get for free online, another part of me find games like these endearing. I Just feel like there’s not enough of these games around. I’m not talking about hentai games or amateur, patreon-funded games that are stuck in infinite development. I am talking about games with genuine passion and commercial availability like this. It’s like and ultimate Skinner’s box: after all that hard work, the feeling of seeing boobs is that much greater, even though they are 3d.Closing notes:Before I end this review, I would like to get something off my chest. If you find games like these stupid, fine I understand. I could even understand if you find games like these pathetic and think it’s going to be flooded by horny 11-year-olds whose mothers don’t bother checking the ESRB rating for their childrens’  games? I completely understand you. But while looking at reviews of the game, I cam across one review that bashed the game for being sexist and for that I can only say: you’re right, but you don’t get it. The game is stupid and vulgar by intention. It makes no effort to be something it’s not, it is what it is. It’s like playing the Postal series and then bashing it for being offensive. Yeah, it’s offensive- That’s how it was designed.Suggestions for improvement:The area outside the house is a dark, empty void. Make a background drop of some sort instead of pitch blacknessIt’s hinted that Britney is a lesbian, but to think that you cannot score one of the hotter characters in the game would be the ultimate troll against the players. I hope there’s an addition sometime soon that allows us to have some fun with her.Continue to improve/fix the AI"

Dunno if it's the way things like scripts are being rendered, but it reminds me of the mess Yandere Simulator continues to be, when it comes to having a program anyone with or without money could grab, though having things run more complicated than it needs to be. And that's a fact, knowing how many other games have better graphics.Not gonna refund the game though, and the fact that you're willing to have custom stories, goes to show you're smarter than both the Yandere Simulator, and Emily is Away devs. It's rare to have that kind of feature in games, especially on Steam.

They are only 1,5 MB size so I do not understand it. Even if I move some saves into another folder the game does not recognises it and still refuses to save.- if you achieved some nudity then you cannot load your save. There is a black screen. The tricks what I have found to salvage the situation do not work.- No option to load game on the initial screen. You need to start a new game and then you can load an earlier save.Again, keep your money later and buy it when it will be good and bigger game."
