,Recommended,611800,31534249,Posted: 3 May,all,auzen,"Amazing game with lots of potential, but enjoyable as f*** as is. Great customization features and can't wait for the multiplaIyer.The game is hard to get the hang of but once you learn how to tune your car properly and learn to drift OMG this game is hella fun, The game has amazing music with the likes of Night Lovell and others and it makes the whole experiance that much more pleasing. I hope the devs keep updating this game and just putting everything they have in it and it will quickly become one of the best open world car games MADE.however if you enjoy just drifting around an empty map without end for hours listening to a perfect soundtrack then this game is most likely for you. <3a few things id like to see if the devs are listening- better lighting (turns my black car kinda purple and wheels super bright during day)-driver customization (just as simple as maybe hairstyles and genders)-less obnoxious crashing sounds( hit a sign and it just hurts the ears to be honest...not fun)"

I will update as it develops.UPDATES: Sound is now fixed after the small update, I don`t have to go options and click apply to get engine sounds.I have found 2x light poles sticking up through the bridge in the 1 lane"

I seem to have a glitch where my controls keep scrolling down despite not pushing the button. It makes it very hard to set the controls for my wheel. Speaking of which, it doesn't seem to recognize my shifter's neutral mode for neutral. I know it's still in beta so I expect bugs like this, I just hope they can see my comment for their feedback.Is the 240SX the only available car for the beta too?  I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this game and will recommend it!"

Keep the hard work up devs.Almost the best 15e spent for my free time activity.
,Recommended,611800,32604108,Posted: 20 June,all,Faded Bird,"For an indie game, this is one of the best 15 dollars I've spent. The game has more customization than some of the racing games today like Need For Speed (2015) and Forza Horizon 3. Physics feel nice and fun to drift with. The map is pretty huge and nice to cruise around with, I just wish that we will get more cars in the future and a LAN option while Online is in the works. Beside that, this game is amazing! A must have!"

The game is very fun but might get old for some of you quick as there is just a base amount of conect the game is still being worked on this is the frist release of it and it looks great from the map to the skybox evein the flames are on point and with more on the way it is in my opinoin worth the money as this is going to be one of the greates racing games the PC has seen with this gameplay style. you can swap engine's put body kits on we will soon get wide body kits for cars. more cars are on the way and we have had to wait for the rest of the car becuase they are missing a few things witch I think show's of much effort Nikko puts into his work and dosent want to give us half♥♥♥♥♥work. This game is being made by one guys as of right now and It looks like we are just getting ready for the trip he's gonna take us on. 9.7/10 From me and I hope to see you guys in the mountian's when there added.
,Recommended,611800,32346292,Posted: 11 June,all,わからん,"This... looks unexpectedly promising. First of all, unheard of before level of customisation. Second of all, it already looks gorgeous. Third of all, for a game that's not even 2 months old, in VERY Early Access, it's extremely stable. The developer responds quickly to all bug reports, and works extremely hard to fix said bugs. From my experience, this could be a VERY good game, and for now it is definitely going in the right direction. Here's to hoping it stays that way.Disclaimer: If you buy this game expecting it to be flawless, finished or bugless, you are mistaken. It's definitely good, but it's still not nearly done. Come into this expecting an ALPHA more akin to a proof of concept, than an actual fleshed out game. This is obviously subject to change, but for now, don't expect something ridicuolus. It's still in development."

Great early access game just really focus on the UI, key bindings and tutorials.was easy to figure out after hitting keys haha. BUT!

I can only run the game for around 1hour, before it suddenly drops down  to 5-13fps, and the selection of cars is minimal. The graphics are impressive...but the requirments for the game are heavy, and seem almost unnecessary.Even after the game barely running, I still find myself wanting to play more of it. The ability to change so much of the car, and just drive around having fun is great.It might not be the most stable of games, but I look forward to see where it goes."
,Recommended,611800,32877012,Posted: 27 June,all,Vex lmao,"Lots of potential within this game, Probably the best game for drifting I own and it's only in early access.Every tweak you make affects your performance/handling which is cool. Some things dont work but its to be expected.Fair amount of support for low end machines such as myself, with majority of the stuff turned down I can run it at a stable 40-50fps and the game still doesn't look too bad, the cars still look great and i'm happy to play it like this. But for people who have decent PC's there are a good amount of graphic options to max out.By the time this game comes out of early access I think it will be easily one of the best car games on Steam.SummaryPros:-Good vehicle graphics-Decent sky/enviroment graphics-Fair amount of low end PC support-Vast amount of Customisation/Upgrades-Fun Physics, not so much realistic but they suit the game-Future online supportCons:-Framedrop after entering garage a few times (fixed by opening console, typing exit and loading back up)-Small wheel, car and map selection at the moment (only a temporary con as I assume these will get bigger as the game grows)-Turbo only adds Torque not HP-Few other minor bugs"

I had some problems trying to find the key that allowed me to turn the engine on which i had to find through trying different keys on my keyboard seeing as i couldn't find it in the options menu.As for the actaul in-game menus i did have some problems there aswell as when i tried navigating one of the submenus in the options screen when i tried to navigate rather than move down to higlight one of the other options, it instead decide to go to the menu that washidden underneath and change those settings instead.When it comes to performance it is usually butter smooth running at around 200 fps with a GTX970 and I7 4790K, i did however experience some stuttering every now and then, it also crashed my whole comåuter when i tried to shut it down"

It's just some empty city streets, no buildings or traffic, and nothing to do. The game crashed 5 times before I got to the game. Then the controls are so messed up it took me ages to sort them out, and even then the game won't let me bind the clutch pedal for my G29. For some reason the selection scrolls through on it's own, until I push the clutch pedal, when it stops and I can make selections. But when I try to bind my clutch pedal as the clutch, or in fact anything, the game doesn't recognize the input from my pedal. At all. I'm certainly not new to early access, and I have a 4770k + GTX980 + 16gb RAM. I'm not acting entitled or jaded. This software is not ready to be on sale, and is yet more evidence of Steam's lacklustre vetting system for new games. No one in their right mind would approve this for sale. What am I supposed to do? Drive around intersections for an hour? Look at the tree's? Stare at my car? The physics are ok, the graphics are ok, the sound is average. The framerate is high due to a lack of environmental features whatsoever. Not much else to say. I'm not even willing to buy in early and wait for features. Refunded and not recommended."

,Recommended,611800,31538305,Posted: 4 May,all,Tim The Tool Man,"Ok, I know my game time doesn't say I've played for long, but I've played all the content which is available at the moment. This game looks amazing and has some great potential! HOWEVER. The fact the home menu has only 2 buttons which work (Out of 4) which is START and QUIT is driving me nuts. You can only buy one of the 4 cars, and once you have done so you can't return to the car menu to see the other 3 cars you cant buy. The customization is quite in depth, I just wish that bloody menu wasn't an overlay as having to press P twice to remove it in order to see what bumper I am putting on is ridiculous. The engine sounds aren't very realistic, but I see you have an update planned with upgradede engine sounds so perhaps it'll be better by then. The car mechanics are strange, it seems if you do all the mods, there's enough power to blaze tyres in 5th gear on flat going straight...? Maybe for 900hp but not what you can do to these engines. The controller support is OK however I'd like it if I were able to manouver the camera with my right joystick instead of using the mouse.All in all, this game is really good considering it's freshly released in beta form, and I can't wait to see what comes of it in a years time!"

You can make this game working even on the worst ""Wooden"" PC, the possibilities are crazy!2. The Tuning... Holy S**T... What to begin with! There so many options to choose! You can SWAP ENGINES (It doesn't change the engine model in the car unfortunally), Tune It!, Add bigger turbo (I will come back for it in a sec), Suspenion, WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE! Same with VISUALS! Many options! Choosing lights set up, spoilers, bumpers, exhausts Even you can change trunk! DAMN! Wheels, Add camber, offset, change licence plate!3. 240SX is GREAT4. Lots of engines with actuall engine codes (like RB20, RB26, 2JZ GTE)!5. THE FLAMES! OHH YEA this is one of my favourite parts of this game! It only needs a 2-Step, and it would be f**king PERFECT!BUT hey, we have to talk about the CONS! There are some.1. My tuning parts (some of them) sometimes, they are not apply to the car when exit the garage, so I have to re do it.2. Turbo... EDIT: It works but in VERY STRANGE WAY! It activate as the speed rise...3. Exhaust is glitching out. I don't know why, the fix is simple, but it is looking strange.4. Engines sounds doesn't sound right. Yes, I know, I am a d**kh**d now, but Drift Horizon did nice engine sounds, RB26 sound like one (and every other engine too), I do NOT say this these sounds are ear♥♥♥♥♥♥or s**t, it's kind of ACCEPTABLE, but IT NEED improvements (I love RB26 sound, plz fix XD)5. The menu. Ok it is NOT very big issue, but it also needs improvement. Using mouse to swich between menus is pain in the♥♥♥♥♥after some time and it would be GOOD if it will be improved (The look also because those black textures are not right :/ )6. Car weight is same for everyone (exept 458) I don't know if it is a glitch or because these are not finished models, but it looks strange.7. The car camera is too low, and you cannot see muchOk, it's time for CONCLUSION!The game is 8/10. Why?I would give 10/10 as for Indie Game (and 5/10 for AAA game (IT IS NOT a AAA title, but just to show it for idiots)).The game is pretty good, I mean it really is, the possibilities that it give to us is just f**king mind blowing! The graphics also is not bad, same with optimalisation of the game which is very good as for a game the is made in Unity!There is lack of cars as for now, only 5, but we can have only one and we can choose only one, the 240SX.A bit lack of details in the car interior, but that's OK as it will have interior mods, so I guess it will be changed!Anyways the game is cool, I bought it for cheaper (7 Pounds) but it was worth it.Hope it will be improving."
