,Recommended,611980,32065117,Posted: 30 May,all,Blanchflower,"This is the 2nd game of the Oik series from the developer Dr_Crewcut. They copied the idea from the developers of the Zup! series. Nevertheless, this is an interesting puzzle game well suited for hardcore achievement hunters, casual gamers and small children. Well worth the money if you are looking for a nice relaxing casual game."
,Recommended,611980,32237554,Posted: 7 June,all,Erika {C²},"Oik 2 is a casual puzzle game, which will tease your brain and knowledge from primary school.What can you expect:* 60 levels focused on physics. Solution might be tricky sometimes and you will have to give it a plenty of diffrent point of views and count with a lot of inertia.* 365 game achievements, which are unlocking as you pass through the levels (Mostly letter pictures for adorning your beautiful profile. A different fonts from the first OIK).* 100% game completion* Chillax music if you decide to listen* Your brain will get fried as you will be closer to the end of the game. (I have to admit, that I had to find a solution for 2 levels).* Trading CardsScore: 100%If you are an achievement hunter, who likes physics puzzle games and likes to have a nice profile, this is defiitely a game for you.I have to add, that the emoticons and background profiles are very simple, BUT that's a plus, because you can use them very well, if you use mosaticon."

Only new in the sequel: They put some country flag achievements into it. Also a little bug is included: the last 2 achievements don't popup unless you open the ""-"" level and press ""R"". Brilliant!"
,Recommended,611980,30830827,Posted: 30 March,all,Jafedi,"Oik 2 is the correct evolution of Oik and the way to go for games like these.  Oik 2 is harder than Oik but enjoyable, not frustrating at any moment and not boring (like many of this ""500 achievements per 1$), shorter than 1 hour and with a good amount of achievements (but not too much).Buy it in the Double Oik! Bundle to save 0,1$. Congratulations to the developer to keep it right, smooth and funny. Waiting to Oik 3 to be harder and challenger."

,Recommended,611980,30792870,Posted: 28 March,all,"Axel ""Not the Real"" Foley","Oik 2 is a significant step up from it's predecessor, something we haven't seen in the last few Zup! games. It's surprising, and refreshing. All this considering the original only came out last month.I loved that Oik 2 focused on designing quality levels overall. At least 30% of these levels will pose a serious thinking challenge to the player. While there are a few simple levels, especially early on, the later levels will create a small challenge. These difficult sections offer achievement hunters more ways to exercise their brain to figure out the correct combination to finish a level, while still being able to finish the game in a short amount of time. I was able to 100% complete this game in just under an hour, and I believe many other veteran Zup and Oik players will be able to do the same.I should note that this game is really for a certain demographic, folks who enjoy hunting achievements/completionist games, and those who are familiar with the Zup! franchise; however, the game is simple enough for any new players, I just suggest you start with the first Oik or Zup! before you jump into this game, as I felt the difficulty was higher than any previous games.As someone who has been incredibly critical of Zup!'s sequels in the past, I urge the Oik developer to continue making strides positively changing the Oik series, adding more blocks and difficulty curves to prevent themselves from being stuck rehashing the same games two more times."
,Recommended,611980,30810115,Posted: 29 March,all,Matrix,"Compared to the Oik 1, Oik 2 improved its level design and difficulty by a large margin. Most levels are more complex and you have to try at least several times to get them right, so it's a big step up in the right direction. It actually feels like a true puzzle game right now and not just a feast of achievements.Some achievements were bugged, but the bugs are already fixed, so all in all Oik 2 is a solid mini-game."

,Recommended,611980,30814962,Posted: 29 March,all,J4MESOX4D,"Oik 2 is a fantastic sequel to what was a great little puzzle game inspired by the Zup! series. This offering contains over 60 levels, 365 achievements, Steam trading cards and some degree of challenge in the hour or so it takes to complete.Like Zup! the aim is to land a specific block in a zone by interacting with other blocks - instead of exploding them as you do in that game to create a physical chain; here you are required to interact with several blocks, balls and ramps; some of which require perfect timing to land the blue block in the landing area. Most puzzles can be solved through simple trial and error but others can be far more complex that you really appreciate the level design at times.Don't think of this as a Zup! clone - it's a great game in its own right that is well crafted and great value for money. Whether you are after raining achievements or a nice cheap game with trading cards to boot; I'm sure everyone will find something they like here so check it out and the original too."

There are two differences other than the puzzles themselves between the two games.  There is the addition of balls, which I enjoyed.  The other difference I didn't enjoy.  Puzzles seemed to be the somewhat random in the movement of these new balls and maybe in all puzzles in general.For the most part I was able to easily get through the puzzles with ease.  I got stuck a few times and what I found was doing the exact same thing on each reset would yield different results.  I would remove one block only triggering a plank to become inclined and start the ball rolling.  Where that ball ended up changed.  I didn't like that aspect of it, if it was intended or not.  One puzzle really had me getting frustrated because of this.  You had no idea if you were doing it right and just needed to keep repeating the pattern until you got the desired result or if you were wrong and had to try something else for 30 times until you got the desired result.  I went to the guides for help.  What I found was everyone seemed to do it differently.  Watching a playthrough showed someone else struggling to get it to work too.  I did his winninng combination and it took me 17 resets going through the same pattern to finish it and it finished in a different way.Having said that, the vast majority of the puzzles were very easy and were relaxing and fun to do.  I still finished the game rather quickly.  Like Oik, there is no windowed mode which I would have favored.  The music was nice and I will replay it again at a later date for the fun aspects of it.If you're considering only getting either Oik or Oik 2, then I'd go with the first because of that randomness frustration.  But I'd recommend both to anyone who likes those little puzzles.  Like, Oik, the achievements come with each level finish and when you finish them all you've completed your achievements.  No hidden random weird achievement to get.  There are guides and walkthroughs if you do get stuck."
