The pictures you get after you die were all well-made, and the game did have a few good scares here and there. The humor those well a little bit of the humor was kind of funny/ok, but a good bit of the funny comes from how bad the English translation is.Ok now for the bad.First off the story it started out strong, but then crapped out when you get to school and it went all breaking the 4th wall. I mean why do that, it just made the story suck. it’s like the creators of the game just give up haft way through writing the story, watch is sad I mean with the right writher this could have very good, but it just crapped out when you get to school. Then there is the final boss, when you beat it just feels anticlimactic like what was the point. Then you get to the ending of the game watch I won’t tell you just look it up on youtube.Anyway the ending just feels cruel pointless and anticlimactic. Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t want every game to end with sunshine and rainbows. I mean a good dark ending can do a game good if it’s done right. But this the ending to Kio's Adventure again just felt cruel pointless and anticlimactic. So in the end I would say not get this game. There is a lot of rpgmaker horror games way better than this one."
,Recommended,612070,31051557,Posted: 9 April,all,hikineet,"Honestly I came into this game expecting something like LISA. Do not get this game if you are expecting something gritty and scary. This game is a comedy game. Warning over.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kio's Adventure is a RPG game, made in Chinese and translated to English. This can be seen at times, from the ""engrish"" translation to some character names being not translated at all. (NOTE: this can only be seen in secret areas of the game. the main game is 99% translated.) The game is very heavy on lewd themes. The death screens are extremely lewd and gory. Some of the characters are fully nude at parts. One character tries to♥♥♥♥♥♥the player. One of the bosses is phalic in design and shoots out♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at your player. In addition, the game is very heavy on gore, primarily ""guro"". Honestly, this game isnt as bad as other reviews say. Once you get past the initial shock factor, you can laugh at the games attempt to scare you and gross you out. One minor problem I had with the game was that all of the bosses were annoying and felt like an artificial attempt to stretch out the game. Overall, this is a game that is ""so bad that its good"", and I highly reccomend playing it to make fun of it.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DRGameplay: Barely there.Dialogue: Engrish. ♥♥♥♥ing amazing engrish.Fun: Its so bad its good.Bugs: Zombies can sometimes trap you in a place and prevent you from killing them. Only happened once to me.Overall: Nice to play on a lazy Sunday. Be ready to cringe."
,Not Recommended,612070,31285811,Posted: 21 April,all,Funky Fred,"Keep in mind, I did actually enjoy this game.After playing all the way to the final boss, I have to say, it was at least worth the two dollars I spent on it. The game had some pretty alright pixel art, and was genuinely (at times) kind of spooky. However, those with low tolerance for Engrish will drop this game almost immediately. The tedious pace at which the main character moves is bearable, at first. However, once you start walking around much bigger areas, the speed will start to rustle some jimmies. Also, there's this seemingly out of place sexual element I will address later in this review, but if that's not something you're into, I'd say steer clear of Kio's Adventure. Skip to the bottom to avoid spoilers and for the score.Spoilers ahead boy-osThe first area you explore in this game actually made me pretty anxious. It takes place in a basement made of long winding hallways. And, the near silence of this place really made me feel uncomfortable. The environmental effect of little earthquakes and plaster falling from the ceiling was a nice touch. Paired with me seeing the first pile of writhing flesh, the earthquakes started to become much more scary to me. Almost as if there was a giant flesh demon above me, just slithering around, waiting. Honestly, the entire game could have just taken place underground, and I would have loved it.After escaping the basement, you find yourself in a library. This is where the walking speed starts to become much more aggravating. This room is huge, way too huge. However, after a bookcase falls over, nearly crushing you, this room starts to become much more interesting. At any moment, you could be killed. And at each end of the rows of bookcases, there's ammo (yes there is a gun in this game) , health, and doors. Making the pickups and exits possible traps. Spoiler warning, none of the other bookcases fall, but it at least filled the room with a possible threat. After spending an exuberant amount of time completing the puzzle here, and getting the key to leave, you'll be greeted by the outside world.It's raining (because when isn't it raining in horror games?) and you have been surrounded by some zombies amidst dilapidated buildings. Don't fret, because a fat weeb is here to rescue you. Bobo (yes that's his name) then invites you up to his apartment, where he drugs both you and himself, because he's wacky (cue laugh track). He manages to tie you up and drag you into his bedroom before passing out in his bed. How a fat weeb could do all that within such a short amount of time is beyond me. You wake up before he does, and run into the kitchen to cut your hands free from the rope. The kitchen is full of dead bodies, and the fridge has Bobo's parents' severed heads inside. An activity that I am sure all weebs partake in. Anyway, you blow Bobo's brains out and head back outside. This chunk of the game is just slowly walking into buildings, slowly walking around zombies, and not much else.The rest of Kio’s Adventure is kind of lazy, and I think the creators were just throwing whatever at the wall to see what sticked. And what lazy setting could we possible go to in a Far Eastern game, but the school. Long boring hallways with easy to avoid zombies, and a pretty standard find-the- hidden-code-to-get-a-key quest. Something you've most likely done already if you've played any number of RPG Maker horror games. There's some swirly photoshop effect npcs for some reason, and they explain to our hero that they are all in a video game (gasp) and that there is a “glitch” somewhere. This “glitch” is our exit, and the only way to reach it is to escape the school through the bathroom (where else would you escape?) and enter the aquarium that just so happens to be behind the school. After gaining the key, you are treated to a pretty short boss fight with a giant♥♥♥♥♥♥♥monster that shoots white goo at you.At this time, I would like to briefly talk about Kio's Adventure and it's sexual elements. Honestly, I don't know how to feel about them. There's these cutscenes where you watch your friend get tortured in some weird BDSM style dungeon. Also, the whole kidnapping with Bobo. Plus, some of the death screens are pretty much light guro (I don't suggest Googling that). Including one in particular where a giant spike impales our hero through her ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'm not sure if this was symbolism for some sort of tragedy that befell Kio, or if these things exist simply to exist. And I'm not here to say these things need to be removed from the game, I'm all for freedom of expression. I just don't understand why these things are present. For the most part, this game doesn't even take itself too seriously, I.e. some of the hidden rooms and character interactions. But, was I meant to find the sex stuff funny?The last chunk of gameplay takes place inside an aquarium and someone's computer. After walking down an♥♥♥♥♥♥lode of stairs, soon you’ll be walking down some hallways past some admittedly cool fish tanks. Until you reach the ice slide puzzle. If you have played a few of the Pokemon games, you'll instantly recognize this. At least the sliding is faster than the walking. After mashing the arrow keys until you guess the solution, you'll be greeted with a giant meat monster inside a fish tank. He explains that you have to shoot the wall a few times and the path will open up. That was the ""glitch,"" and now you are inside a computer. I.e. more walking. You then get to meet the final boss, he's some sort of thing, I honestly lost interest here. He gives this long winded barely comprehensible Engrish speech about how games these days are too easy. He admits, however, that you will have to sit through his ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" again if you die. Which you will. His first phase wasn't too bad, as long as you avoided the stuff that appears on the ground, and you are given enough time to do so. Then, he goes full ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mode and shoots instant death lasers. When you die you have to sit through another round of his pointless speech (I.e slam on the keyboard as fast as you can in a vain attempt to skip it), and fight him again. After three times of dying to death lasers, I promptly uninstalled the game.Spoilers are now doneFor those of you wanting a numerical score, 6/10. The game was cheap and I felt like I got my money’s worth out of it, but it was still tedious and there is no way in hell I’m fighting that final boss again. I still recommend it to those who are fans of RPG Maker horror games, and are looking for something to mess around with for an hour or two. However, there are free games like Lisa the First, Yume Niki, and the Crooked Man that are much more entertaining and more importantly, free. I would feel remissed if I didn’t at least name some projects that the devs could take some inspiration from before making another game. Kio’s Adventure isn’t bad and even though I enjoyed myself to an extent, it belongs on something like Newgrounds, not Steam. Steam should be for much more fleshed out projects than this."

,Recommended,612070,31695889,Posted: 11 May,all,e4vee,"kio was able to capture one of the most eerie, suspensful and twisted experiences i've ever gotten out of a video game. it also somehow manages to effectively throw this atmosphere completely out the window at will just to break the fourth wall for a quick joke or nonsensical plot advancement.use this carefree attitude and short game length to mask what is actually great attention to detail, unique structure, niche-appealing art style, and clever dialogue and you have what could very well be the birth of a future cult classic."

,Not Recommended,612070,31985374,Posted: 26 May,all,M.I.R.A.G.E,"BACKGROUNDKio's Adventure is a game centering around a high schooler named Kio and her friends (but mostly Kio). Use Kio to solve a variety of (very easy) puzzles while attempting to not die, and that is a feat in itself when everything and everyone is trying to murder you.WHAT I ENJOYED ABOUT THIS GAMEThe storyline for this game is fantastic. As much as I would love to spill it out here, I do not want to ruin it. The ending is a welcome surprise. I cannot stress enough what an incredible storyline this game has BUT it gets really overshadowed by the other elements of the game.WHAT THE GAME LACKEDThat 'oomph' factor. The game lacks that 'something more' that could have easily made it an incredible game. It's meant to be a horror/gore game but it tends to come off as odd. Everything feels so rushed and the execution is horrible. Scenes which should have left you surprised or appalled just comes off as 'What is that even?' or 'Okay then'. Seriously, the potential for this game is great and the idea is incredible but seriously just... I can't even.The game features a gallery of 'death scenes' which fill out depending on the various deaths you find in game. The feature is is a good idea but getting all the death scenes is probably the only difficulty you'll find with this game.The English in the game is very broken. VERY. BROKEN. While its not difficult to make out what the character is saying, if you're impatient like I am, this will get on your nerves. Sometimes you will have to read a sentence three or four times to understand but don't worry, eventually you'll get it. Eventually.The puzzles were too easy. It proves to be no challenge and that takes away from this game because the game is primarily based on solving puzzles. The game becames a 'walk-by' once you get a grasp on the mechanics and its easy to get bored of which is probably not a good thing since the game is so short itself.The fight scenes are too easy. Again, it proves to be no challenge and takes away from the game because hey, you'd think, if the puzzles weren't easy, can you at least make the fights more challenging? Right? Well RIP you.The game has these special hidden areas which you need to discover. Its very easy to find them. I don't think you can even call them 'hidden areas'.CONCLUSIONI would have recommended this game but at the same time you're really not missing out on anything much if you decided not to buy it. Its great for a quick pass time but other than that I really can't recommend it."

,Recommended,612070,32530762,Posted: 18 June,all,Zanda64,"At first its like a scary game with a dark setting. Then about halfway through the developer was like ""yeah na faq this"". After that I have no idea what was going on."
76561198067870733,Not Recommended,612070,31029420,Posted: 8 April,all,MaakuFamous,"TL;DR//Really, really boring.Barely a horror game, more like a terrible comedy game.//Pros:-Some of the art is okay-Guro (if you're into that), but there's not a lot of it and it's pretty tameCons:-The story. Amature would be a complement.-The characters. There aren't any.-This is a comedy game, not a horror game.-The ""combat""-The music loops in a really obvious spot, especially in the school-The ""hidden rooms"" (dev circle jerks)-The translation (almost every sentence is grammatically wrong or has words that don't exist)-The character walk speed-The AI-The graphics are lazy, pixel art was in no way an artistic decision-The ""Bosses"" aren't hard, but are annoying-The humor is off the mark every time without fail.-The controls are unresponsive if you're too fast-The ending, and I really can't stress this enough; the devs make way too many appearances in this game.The game starts off semi fast paced then slows to a crawl.The story is, well, there isn't one really. The developers of the game have more dialog than the vast majority of the characters.The game is essentially 4 areas:-Dungeon(?)-The City-The school-The bugThe first dungeon is the most decent part of the game, because you're under the false belief that this might be like Corpse Party. The city is where the pacing really becomes an issue, as you spend minutes on end walking along a line or a zig-zag past brain dead AI. The school is where I knew this game was bad, as I was bored out of my mind. Schools are usually a great setting for horror games, but there was absolutely nothing horrific in the school. Not a jumpscare, not a cool monster, nothing except a really uninspired boss and terrible mistranslated dialog.Now, the bug is where this game commits suicide. The characters in the school talk to you (for far too long) about how you're actually in a video game. Your character doesn't believe them, but seeks out the bug anyway. You meet a giant who makes you do some busy work, then you walk around on the Windows BSOD for a while, then onto some kind of cell-phone OS boot sequence. This really happens.The Final Boss puts an end to this nonstop excitement by announcing that he is the final boss for about 3 paragraphs. He then makes some jokes about how you have to skip through this dialog if you die and have to fight him again. The boss fight sucks, it just sucks. It goes on way too long.Finally we are at the end of the game, where the main character talks to the programmer of the game, for what is probably his third appearance so far. She asks to see her friends again, they make a joke about how the friend sprites don't have walking animations, and everyone lives happily ever after.Don't buy this."
,Recommended,612070,31047606,Posted: 9 April,all,Xenon_Xi,"Kio's Adventure is a cute(?) horror RPG! You're definitely getting your money's worth for $1.99 (or $1.49, if you've bought it on sale), especially if you try to collect all of the achievements. There are translation errors, which are easily overlooked; secret rooms with references to pop. culture; and well drawn artwork (ero guro) for all of the different death scenes. There is nudity, violence, blood, etc., and the main protagonist is school-aged, but I feel all of that is to be expected given the genre and rating of this game. The in-game jokes are quirky, the characters are two-dimensional, the pacing is a little odd, and the bosses in-game feel underwhelming, but overall I'd definitely recommend this game if you're looking for a way to kill some time."
,Not Recommended,612070,34046521,Posted: 5 August,all,"Oh, Frog?","I enjoyed the pixel artwork and the death art, however the game just got worse the more I played. It started off strong, but by the time I got to the school after wading through a city filled with zombies (which I was fine with) and seemingly random ""easter eggs"" that were pretty much EVERYWHERE by that point.. Well, I just lost the will to continue on with the game, especially because of the ""Wowie, we're breaking the 4th wall suddenly"" thing.It's a real shame, since, as I said, I absolutely adored the artwork. The gore was pretty good, and the humor made me giggle when it was present.. But the sudden 4th wall breaking plot was just a bad decision. The story was ruined for me.I was considering refunding it, by as it was pretty cheap and I DID see the effort put in, I decided to keep it out of respect for the developer.Maybe you'll enjoy it, though. I'd say give it a try if you're unphased by what I say."
,Recommended,612070,31206681,Posted: 17 April,all,Subliminal Smile,"Kio's Adventure centers around a young girl named Kio lost in a world gone mad after a mysterious earthquake ravages her hometown. Though she may appear helpless at first, our protagonist is actually quite brave in the face of adversity, and determined in her quest to save her friends no matter the cost. It's difficult to comprehend the true hell of the ""adventure"" Kio is put through in this game. I really grew to like this character with her quick-witted attitude and unwillingness to give up. I was truly rooting for her victory. But, we don't always get what we want.And I think that's part of the game's purpose, in some twisted way. The game itself, feels like an unfinished piece of art begging for interpretation. Almost as if the creator(s) were testing the waters; perhaps unsure if this game would be understood or appreciated for what it is intended to be. Showing us what they are capable of creatively: interesting design, crisp, clean artwork and animation, wonderful music, atmospheric sound effects, and creating enough of an old-school challenge and secrets to discover to keep you coming back rather than simply quit in frustration and never return. It's not a perfect game, mostly in terms of grammar/spelling errors and complete lack of story (the game is more like a series of ambiguous scenes pieced together), but it is a guilty pleasure and an overall enjoyable and bittersweet (emphasis on the bitter) experience.Some may feel offended by what they witness in Kio's Adventure. But, to me, it feels more like a parody of many banal horror tropes already present in many games today. It shocks at times but never seems to take itself too seriously: juxtaposing horrific and surreal imagery with a surprising dose of sarcastic black humor. You will gasp, and laugh. It reveals us, the player, as the ultimate puppeteer. Even in the seemingly innocent process of unlocking achievements, we ourselves may seem cruel or even voyeuristic at times; causing Kio to endure a multitude of deaths and forcing her into one terrible situation after another in our quest to reach the end. Always striving for answers, to attain the happy catharsis we & Kio so desperately need to make ourselves feel better. But, life doesn't always work that way, and neither do all games we play.I am personally impressed by what Space Light has created here, and I can only wish for what the real producer themselves say within the game itself: ""I hope I can make a next version of this game, if there will be a chance.""  Let's hope so, because I’m not ready to give up on Kio, either."

So as soon as I got a notification that this game was on Steam, I went ahead and dropped the $1.49 to pick it up.And this game is pretty great for its price tag. It reminds me a bit of Resident Evil 7, because the middle parts of the game are a lot about exploring through mazelike building environments with very little ammo to solve puzzles. I can easily recommend it at it's regular price."

I expected a good RPGMaker horror game with interesting visuals, but once I began playing it clearly wasn't either good or a horror game. I am okay with the horribly bad translations, but It almost seems like the creators gave up somewhere while writing the games story and began writing really stupid jokes instead, wich is a real shame because the game does have quite nice visuals (even if it sometimes is a bit too perverted for it's own good) and the gameplay is somewhat enjoyable. I didn't finnish the game, but from what I've seen it's far from being as visually disturbing and gorey as it was written to be on the Steam-page. Hell, even with the decapitations and guts it was actually really lame and I did in fact find most of the death scenes in the two hours I played it!I really can't recommend this game because of how it kills itself with it's ""humor"", but based on the games review-score I might simply not have the same humor as the developers.

The objective is less about playing through a story and more about unlocking the images in the death gallery, which despite being of good quality they are pretty much all weirdly fanservicey. If that was what you were looking for, there are better games for it (for free) outside of steam if you're willing to roll around google for free RPGMaker seedy stuff, unless maybe your thing is literally low-impact gorn then uh, I guess knock yourself out?While it is incredibly cheap, I wouldn't say it's worth paying money for IMO.

The inventory management of Resident Evil, the paranormal horror of Silent Hill, and the 2D charm of Yume Nikki bleed into this game.  The story is basically absent, the translation is comically poor, and many of the deaths are cheap and inescapable on a first attempt.  However, the personality of the developer really shines through their work, and a clear love for the genre is present throughout.I would love to play the next project Spacelight takes on.

You can tell a lot of consideration went into creating an atmosphere very early on. As the game progresses you notice that it takes a step away from its original feel, but stays pretty creepy none the less *trying to be spoiler free here*.I'm not sure if the creator started out with an idea, and realized by the end that they wanted to make the game more matter of fact - which I enjoyed and found hilarious honestly, or wanted to wrap it up in such a way where depending on how well it was received, it could be dropped or continued.If you enjoy horror games, and like taking a walk through some indie flavored and Chinese translated (not 100% fluid but you can definitely get the idea of whats going on) action, with some hand drawn death scenes - definitely give this a try. I'm not sure if the creator will see this, but I definitely appreciate and like what they were going for in this game. I'd really like to see either a more fleshed out version of this game, or even a sequel!I definitely enjoyed this game, and for the price I feel like I more than got my moneys worth."

,Recommended,612070,32827269,Posted: 26 June,all,Nana,"In this RPG Maker horror game you follow Kio, a very cute girl, trying to survive in a horror environment. Can't say much about the main plot other than that.I never played too many horror other than few RPG Maker ones (Pocket Mirror, Yume Nikki), but I felt I liked this game way more than any other of the genre, not that I am very fond of the game, really. But you can save literally everywhere, and that's a huge plus at least for me. Also, Kio's faces are GREAT and add great humour to the game.I would say rather than feeling this to be real 'horror' or getting scared, I had a lot of fun in the little time I played. I don't actually get scared in horror games, so it must be due to that. I also got stuck and didn't felt like playing anymore, I'll edit this review if I get to play again, but for now I can say I liked the game, just don't want to play it too much anymore as of now.Some possible spoilers ahead.LIKEKio is great, I like her reactions and the dialogues a lot.I was always happy to find the secret rooms! Really fun stuff!The english is broken, but adds to the experience.The graphics are great, I LOVE Kio's expressions and the tilesets. The enemies are great too.You unlock scenes for each ending, and they're greatly drawn!Cool animations.Ambience is good! Could be better, tho.DON'T LIKE:Some boring puzzles.Got triggered by the unnecessary sexual content on some deaths. It was just unnecessary stuff thrown in for the sake of... Nothing?The movement is not by tile, soooo, she gets stuck in walls randomly and frequently.Boring mapping. Corridors everywhere. Yay, it's horror and has corridors, how amusing.PROGRESSION:The game initially tries to borrow that Higurashi effect of introducing you in a daily normal life with your friends and then taking it away with horror elements, but I thought this wasn't really necessary for the storytelling itself, as it was too short a moment, and I already saw the steam screenshots and already knew the content of the game, making it useless. Also, please don't consider this as me comparing this to Higurashi, Higurashi is a masterpiece. Kio's is just random fun.After that you get tossed into something they call dungeon, and a lot of gory horror stuff happen. There's some really cool scenes that are greatly represented in pixel art, specially at the beginning. You can also find some hidden rooms that aren't really 'hidden', but they always have something amusing in them.  The beginning is great, I don't know how it goes after that zombie part, but until then Kio's plays out nicely. The environment falling apart is a cool touch, I think a lot of horrors do that, and I like it since it adds to immersion. Some of my favourite scenes were the one with her friend at the beginning and that painting, and the one with the ghost. Some cliché stuff, but enjoyable.CONCLUSIONIf you're really into horror, you may find Kio's not challenging in terms of puzzles, and not really horrifying. This may not be the game for you. I do recommend if you're after a pretty gory enjoyable game to pass the time."

You can still understand everything that's happening, it's just a bit off/awkward. Hopefully they'll fix the English translation in future days.[EDIT] The game was great up until the main character started to break the 4th wall and realised she was in a video game. The story goes down hill from there; and the ending was just plain lazy. It feels like the writers just genuinely gave up on creating any kind of fulfilling ending.

Lastly, the fact that the protagonist is a school girl and get's a spike up the gusset is a little off putting.Ok, that's the bad stuff out of the way. Now the Gushing. This game is awesome. It's a little retro 2d adventure with horror at it's core. Someone has obviously put a lot of time into this (someone Japanese, hence the gusset spike and the bad english). There are nice touches in the game, and for €1.50 (or when the sale ends) you have to say it's a great for the moey. There has been a lot of these kinds of games of late. From Red Haze to Dogolrax, and up to the more expensive Sally Face. These games are a welcomechange from the green lit garbage that i've had to review of late. It's not fallout 4, but it's better than 2 euro burgers from Mdondons (buy the game, and you'll get that one).

I'll honestly just list my complaints here for the dev's to see and understand.ISSUES:-Poor enemy placement, placing enemies directly outside of doors and generally in spots purely to be inconveniant to the player.-Ammunition and Health are far too scarce for the quantity of enemies and surprise enemies that I'll get to in a moment.-Gas room puzzle is not even a puzzle.-Pistol is extremely weak when it comes to handling just about any enemy, even then the shotgun struggles to kill some enemies at times.-People aren't kidding, the Engrish is really bad. REALLY. BAD. Even if it wasn't in engrish the script would still fall under very poorly written.-The start begins strong, up until you get to the first real ""scare"" then it begins to fall pretty flat.-The final boss is just plain tedious, and worst of all, the shotgun doesn't even do additional damage to him and is basically renderred useless-EXTREMELY short, I suppose it matches the $2 price tag, which is alright, if it wasn't quite so shoddily put together.-Some areas are ACTUALLY pointless, only leading to secret rooms that serve no purpose other then fluff.-Some things such as the flashlight in the kidnapping segment just plain DON'T WORK.-The ending just falls extremely flat, as does any attempt of humor in this game.-Death Traps. Godammit death traps, this is treated like a freeware RPG maker game with them, in fact I was certain going around most any room and going to pick up items I was about to be killed out of nowhere.-Having bizzare things for no other real reason then to BE bizzare.Things the Dev's did decently/right-The gun mechanic is alright, though honestly lacks the feeling of control-The death illustrations are well made, and honestly the well was a nice lead on.-The starting IDEA is nice, but the plot past the very start is just generally poorly made.-I'll admit, the music in the final boss fight and the initial boss fight are alright, not fantastic, but alright.-I like having an actual health bar in an RPG maker style game for once, but it feels so underused, like in the final boss fight where everything kills you in one hit.-Varying enemy types, the enemies in some cases look pretty cool and would be scary if the atmosphere was right!-The piano puzzle was.. at least a puzzle? Same with the note, an attempt was made but neither are challenging.All in all I wouldn't reccomend it, it's not designed particularly well, the script and plot are generally poorly written, and the ending just feels missing almost. But, if the dev's attempted to correct some of these things, it could've been genuinely interesting. Sadly, as a horror game, this at no point felt frightening, therefore I must condemn it."

,Not Recommended,612070,30990036,Posted: 6 April,all,dahayes,"Some parts of the game I can't even finish, even though some of the puzzles should be really simple, I know what to do but by the time I'm finished the antagonist or whoever catches up to me quickly, and then I can't finish the task, I asked my friends what to do and they have no clue.And another thing is, is that the game doesn't give you that many hints on what to do (And the sentences along with it's vocabulary sucks to where I can barely understand what the antagonist, or protagnist are saying. like the protagnist would mis some much needed words such as ""is"" or ""and"" or anything like that so take this sentence for example ""There is an apple up in the tree."" In comparison to ""There are an apple up in that tree.""Sure there is some good points to this game like the art style, but honestly I feel like the art style is mostly spent on the death animations, but other than that the pixel art is how you say ""decent"" not the best but not the worst either.And I'm also sure I would enjoy the story as well if I was able to actually finish it but sadly it's a bit to diffucult for me."

That is not the way you bring up darkness themes... It is a total failure. I don't know why the creator of this game thought that showing some dead naked teens/little girls is a good idea. It is NOT RIGHT to spread those hentai messages at any platform. ( How could Steam let it to be published here as 16+ ?)This rubbish does not even worth a dollar. A GOOD horror games does not need to catch attentions by graphic pedophilia images. This is a total waste of my time and money.

The tone felt tense, but with the first moment I had died with a simple press x to die type option, I started laughing either at or with the game. This game has brought about some of the best laughs I have had from a game, granted they were some dark ones. If you are squeamish to gore, this game is not for you. If you can stomach that though, this game is very funny. i dont mean this in a bad way either. I enjoyed it, much in a similar way to mogeko castle."

,Recommended,612070,30999218,Posted: 7 April,all,FuriousUnagi,"Kio's Aventure is a nice little tribute to old Nintendo games, reviving that good feeling about exploring and venturing through places, searching for hidden treasures and whatnots. It has a dark and sexual theme which is fine, but rather disturbing. It felt like some sort of 8-bit Resident Evil, pretty cool! Artwork is fantastic! English translation is not that fantastic...Spoilers up, I have to mention the ending.I didn't like it at all! After all the bs I went through, that ending felt like a huge middle finger in front of my face. I'm not too sure about games that break the fourth wall, even though it can be done right, but Kio's Adventure would have been much more satisfying if they didn't do that, specially because of its atmosphere. I don't know... it was funny when they broke it on that glitched room, but for that to be the main storyline throughout the rest of the game felt uninspired, to say the least.All in all, good game. If you're a fan of old school Nintendo games such as Sweet Home (without the RPG elements), give it a try, you can't go wrong."

The begining death scenes are ""controversial"", but honestly if you can't take that part, then this game isn't for you since the gore gets worse. The story, seems decent enough, and the only downside for this game is that some of the text is not translated, and some sentences were not translated correctly. This is a really good time killer =^)"

,Recommended,612070,31424385,Posted: 28 April,all,Frogge,"Kio's Adventure is a weird experience. It's like taking drugs, falling down a hole and injuring yourself, but enjoying it. It's a trippy game, VERY similar to the game Mogeko Castle in the way that it has lots of gore and perversion.It starts off fairly serious but over time the game basically becomes a joke. It's like the developer started off wanting to make a serious horror game but eventually just decided to go ''♥♥♥♥ it'' and made the extremely weird second half. I'll explain what I mean in a moment.One aspect of the game I really liked was the graphics. The pixel art is smooth and cute, and the animations are very well done. The Danganronpa style pink blood death scenes are very aesthetic. Speaking of the death scenes, I really liked the fact that there's a different CG for every game over. The soundtrack was pretty ok, though there were only two songs that stood out for me, the title screen/trailer theme as well as the final boss theme. The main character, Kio, is very likeable. She is strong and determined yet witty and kind. None of the other characters were particularly interesting, though one of them, Bobo, did deliver the funniest joke in the game. The gameplay and puzzles are ok. I was never bored but it wasn't the most unique game I've played gameplay wise. There was one puzzle which made me go ''what the ♥♥♥♥?'' The puzzle basically asks you to identify which buttons belong to which game console. It was really weird and out of place at the time (near the beginning of the game when the things weren't so ''♥♥♥♥ you here's 4th wall breaking'' and more serious). Speaking of the weirdness, again, I think this is a good time to move on to the story.The story is what killed the game for me. It's just... depressing, and not in a good sort of way. It breaks the 4th wall a lot near the end and everything the final boss says is basically a big ♥♥♥♥ you to both gamers and developerssaying how modern games are too easy and that players nowadays don't have the patience to sit through a hard game (the game is pretty easy for the most part btw)There were also grammar issues, which I usually don't mind, but considering the game is asking for money I'd assume devs would at least bother getting a proofreader.Speaking of the final boss, he was absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. His first form is easy to defeat, but very long winded. His second form is much stronger and if you die you have to repeat the first form all over again. Not to mention the battle ends quite abrubtly and then you are greeted with a disappointing ending.Kio's Adventure is a fun little experience despite its flaws. I recommend you buy it if you don't mind weird experiences and perverted jokes, but I'd suggest you steer clear of it if you are looking for a more serious experience."

I enjoyed the jump scares, problem solving puzzels and surprising twists and turns this game had to offer.  For the price, I would recommend getting.

There's some weird♥♥♥♥♥♥in it. Has a fairly entertaining english translation and some pretty tasty guro depending on how you die. I enjoyed most of the puzzles, none of them are very hard though. Not sure how I feel about the story, it's not bad, but it isn't great. Sort of was hoping for something different, and I didn't enjoy the story as much in the later school stages.Everything looks and sounds pretty average.Pros:- decent puzzles- sperm uncle- the guro is honestly a big part of why i like this game,it was a pleasant surprise- decent art- sort of funny- engrish- fun to explore the cityCons:- the story just sort of devolves into nothing- i was even kind of immersed then it sort of just breaks my immersion- crashed once, whatever- music is ok, gets repetitive but that's sort of to be expectedIt's worth the two dollars."

,Recommended,612070,31847756,Posted: 19 May,all,Sinful Sorcerer,"Kio is a somewhat short game, but for such a low price it is defintitely worth every penny.If you enjoy survival horror, puzzle solving and explicit cartoon violence this should be right up your alley. Some may be turned off by just how gruesome many of the Game Over artworks are, and the english translation is far from perfect. But if you enjoy morbid pixelated horror games like Corpse Party from time to time and you don't mind the shoddy dialogue, then I highly recommend this. I do not wish to spoil the story, because it is quite something... But let me just say that this is a horror game through and through, so don't let the ingame artstyle fool you.Combat feels reminiscent of older Resident Evil titles; you move slowly and there are hordes of zombies and other enemies swarming towards you from every direction. You also have a limited amount of ammunition and healing items, so you have to proceed with caution and use your resources sparingly. I should also mention that the game might be a bit on the difficult side for some, I personally didn't die too much but as I mentioned previously you may want to take things slowly and save whenever possible.In conclusion; if Resident Evil set in a Corpse Party-esc world sounds interesting to you, then give this game a try! I think you may find it to your liking."
