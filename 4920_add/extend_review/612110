I mean, I've posted the best of the CGs, so there's no need to buy the game unless you simply want to pay for the artwork."
,Recommended,612110,31025376,Posted: 8 April,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"This is a short visual novel focused on yuri (girl x girl relationship). The art style is really cute, the story is simple and the English translation is… funny. I’m not a native speaker of English, and those mistakes didn’t bother me too much (they in fact made the game even funnier lol), but I don’t know about other players. I enjoyed it, and I’d love to see more works by this developer!6/10. If you want a light and simple story to read, you might like it. But if you want something deeper and you can’t handle grammar mistakes at all, I don’t think you’ll enjoy."

After returning back to Amethyst with mushrooms or flowers, Pumpkin will discover a recipe for a love potion. Pumpkin decides to gather 4 different ingredients for the potion hoping that by making such a potion and slipping it into Amethyst's food, it will make Amethyst fall in love with her.The game has more than 100 positive reviews at the time of this review and is a short game with simple storytelling mechanics, obvious plot choices and storyline implications to help get all achievements in less than 10 hours. CGs are good. Recommended for those who like yuri comedies with fanservice and when at large discount or good bundle offer as it takes less than 10 hours to get all achievements."

Did I enjoy playing it? Yes. Well, mostly.  Perhaps the tried-and-true Pro's and Con's list is the way to go.  Then we'll see where we land.So first, the positives:The art is pretty.  The backgrounds are vibrant and colorful.  The sprites themselves are beautiful, and the women are certainly attractive.  CGs are plentiful - especially given the length of the game.  There's obvious care and effort put into the artwork, but is that really enough?If you like Yuri, that's basically the whole plot.  Pumpkin is in love with her boss and wants to sleep with her.  That's essentially it.  I mean, there are some minor details in how we get to that point, but let's be honest; once you realize that's the objective, that's all most of us (guys) will care about.  Let's make it happen!On the negative, the story is insanely short. I was able to complete all the achievements in a little over an hour.  I'm a fast reader, but even still.  Many of them are for random choices in the middle of the game, so in essence there are actually only 4, or perhaps 5, endings. And one of those can be reached in 5-10 minutes.The translation is . . . wonky.  It's certainly not the worst I've ever played/read, but the grammar, verb tense, etc. is all over the place.  Now, I've had games with horrible english be almost a positive for me (check out my review forSuper Star). But this is in that gray area.  It's bad enough that it's distracting to me, but not so far off that it's adorable.  If you're reading this VN in Russian, this obviously won't apply to you.In the end, I feel as though the playtime and general blandness of the story are enough to have me tell you to hold off on this one.  At $4, I'm not sure it's worth the money.  In a bundle, on a 75% sale, or received as a gift? Absolutely worth a playthrough.  But just the once when you have an hour or so to kill.  And you want to see green and purple nakedness.P.S. In the game, hit TAB then type the word 'code' to unlock the nudity options.  It's not exactly vital or game changing, but I mean . . . boobs . . . so . . . yeah. Might as well look at them."

,Recommended,612110,31040989,Posted: 9 April,all,Dengekiko,"Sweet Fantasy is a short visual novel where you play the part of Pumpkin, a tree nymph that has been down on her luck as of late. According to the story, dryads are notorious for being clumsy and unreliable, and poor Pumpkin is no exception. Her main objective in this story is to make her current employer ""happy"" -- in more ways than the word initially implies! With this, Pumpkin will go to great lengths to get Miss Amethyst (her boss) to notice her, which is the premise of this story.As with most other visual novels, progression through this one is no different. You will be presented with various options throughout the short story, which will ultimately lead to one of four endings. The choices you will make determine just how ""lucky"" Pumpkin will be in her endeavors~ as this story fits into the yuri genre. While it is no overly explicit once you have managed to take the appropriate route, there is definitely no mistaking its intentions as a whole.In Pumpkin's pursuit of true love, she will wander through a dense forest, attempting to collect certain ingredients for a love potion she happened to stumble upon. In her quest, she will encounter a few unsavory characters along the way that possess the items she is avidly searching for. The choices made affect whether Pumpkin comes away empty-handed or not. Either way, what transpires will lead to one possible ending, so you will be returning to choose another option once that route has been completed. Ultimately, the route that Pumpkin wants is to gather all needed ingredients and make Miss Amethyst fall madly in love with her! But will it truly lead to a happily-ever-after ending?!My own impression of the visual novel was that it was a rather cute and, sometimes silly, love story. To complete all four endings should take roughly around two hours, so it is no where near on par with may other VNs out there; but then at the price point that is to be expected. If you are not a fan of yuri-type stories, then this may not be to your liking. Also, the English translation is somewhat off many times throughout, but you can ultimately determine what each character is trying to convey. However, if you enjoy looking for love and listening to catchy nursery rhymes such as ""London Bridge Is Falling Down"" and ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"", then this story might be perfect for you!So, will poor Pumpkin succeed in her life-long dream, or will she fall flat on her face and fail miserably? That is for you to decide!"

The software is solid, works well, supports most VN features (gfx options, gallery, scrolling back, skipping, etc.)  This feels like the type of product that should be given for free to promote another, real, paid-for game.  It's cute, worth the time to play it, but probably not worth paying for (maybe a buck?)."
,Not Recommended,612110,32753292,Posted: 24 June,all,Kithanye,"I play this sort of game fequently, and I found this one to be rather boring. The translations were terrible and the story was uninspired. I've never skipped text on a first playthrough, but I skipped nearly all of this one. Even the naughty scenes were boring. The only things I liked about it were the character art and the occassional joke when I did stop to read it. I would return it if I could."
,Recommended,612110,34389246,Posted: 20 August,all,MAGIC IS EVERYTHING,"This is a somewhat detailed review. For TL;DR and quick tips, scroll to the bottom.Short and sweet VN. Shouldn't take more than 1.5 to 2 hours to complete with all endings and achievements without a guide. Just be sure to check every branch and you'll eventually get all the non-ending achievements with ease. See the bottom of this review for some tips and a quick rundown on how to get each ending (there are 4). Now, onto my thoughts on the actual game.Pros:+Cheesy humor.+Nice art and CGs. Some CGs are censored with scenery: check the bottom of this review on how to remove them. Other than that, lots of eye candy *cough*.+Music is decent. I particuarly enjoyed its rendition of Itsy Bitsy Spider. I'm being completely serious.+Story is cute, if not short. Granted, the plot barely scratches the surface of what could even be considered an engaging story, but for a game that's not meant to be taken seriously and can be finished in a single night, it's completely fine.+Main character is cute and clumsy. Her boobs are nice, too. Again, check the bottom of this review for how to uncensor the censored CGs.+YURI ANIME GIRLS!+Playable in English and Russian.Cons:-I honestly don't think this should be bought at the full price of $4. It's way too short and there's not really much substance aside from the good art and decent music. I bought it on sale for $1.60 and think that's the sweet spot. At most I'd pay around $2.50 for it.-As another reviewer mentioned, one of the endings (#4) is easily the worst one. Not 'worst' as in 'something tragic happens in the story', but 'worst' as in, it's recycled many, many times, depending on your degree of success. You'll probably be seeing this one a lot.-The English translation isn't 100% gramatically correct. Not really a con for me, as I've played other games with less-than-stellar translations before, but some might have less tolerance for errors.TL;DROverall, Sweet Fantasy is a short and charming VN. It has decently good assets *cough* and was enjoyable the whole 1.6 hours I've played. Story doesn't take itself seriously, so if you're looking for a VN with a somewhat meaningful and/or deep plot, look elsewhere. This is just a cute, pure grass nymph trying to gain her crush's affections. Nothing more, nothing less.I'm looking forward to the developer's future ventures.=================TIPS (no story spoilers save for the start of the game):One ending can be achieved nearly straight at the beginning by coming home emptyhanded (no shrooms nor flowers). Going home with no ingredients for the potion earns a second ending, while going home with between 1-3 ingredients nets another ending (this is the notorious Ending #4 I mentioned earlier). The last ending can be achieved by getting all 4 ingredients.Whether you bring mushrooms or flowers for the love interest at the beginning doesn't affect the rest of the game, so long as you don't go home emptyhanded (I tested this out myself). I thought that collecting all 4 ingredients while handing in shrooms at the start (and thus satisfying the love interest's first request) would give me a different ending than collecting all 4 ingredients while giving flowers at the start. Both eventually led to the same ending.There are 3 CGs that are conveniently censored with foreground scenery. Nothing sexually explicit in these CGs (just anime tiddies), but still certainly very nice to look at in all their glory. To remove these censors, go into the gallery, press Tab, and type in 'code' without the quote marks. The CGs should now be uncensored in the gallery and in story mode as well. I highly recommend doing this before starting the game, for very obvious and bodacious reasons."

The story is funny though and the graphics are actually pretty good. Wish there were more encounters, especially since the story gives a few set ups that could have been used, like the chase scene after Pumpkin destroys sunflowers in the field of a sorcere and when she visits the ruin of a sorcerer who was experimenting with a potion that could change someones gender. Definitely worth the low price."

,Not Recommended,612110,31693667,Posted: 11 May,all,Retrophilippe_QC,"You play as a nymph servant named Pumpkin and your goal is to find ingredients to make a love potion to seduce your Mistress, Mrs Amethyst. Not a lot to do in this one... Don't bother with this VN unless it's on sale and only if you are a big fan of this kind of schlock. I would rate this a 4/10 (consider it a 3/10 if you hate VN and a 5/10 if you love them).Cons:- It's too short, even for a visual novel. Expect to complete it 100% in 1 hour  then to let it open a couple more hours for the cards and then to never play it again (good for achievement hunters I guess).- The music is generic as hell. It uses at least one very recognizable public domain earworm. It's lazy and boring.- Very few choices, extremely predictable story and basically every endings are the same.- Not a lot of wanking material (only one scenario results in a sex scene and the writing is not erotic at all).- Characters are bland clichés and the writing is uninspired.Pros:- The art is charming and good at least. It deserves to be in a better game.- You don't need an adult patch to see naked boobs. You only need to got to the ""galleries"", press TAB then type the word ""code"" and voilà! It's still very tame though.Neutrals:- The tongue-in-cheek humor is charming but too seldom used. A lot of waste potential storywise.- The interface is ok.

There is no story here other than Pumpkin (the main character) trying to seduce her mistress instead of trying to make her fall in love with her. But the game is fully aware of that and doesnt try to hide it and make excuses. Its a meaningless but full fluff of girl/girl lovin.

This is on sale currently as a promotion, at £1.11 (reduced from £2.79) and I decided to give it a go after it was sat on my wish list for a while.Pumpkin, a young nymph, has fallen in love with the woman she serves, Amethyst, and goes around a secret plan to get her mistress to fall in love with her. Help Pumpkin along the journey by making decisions for her, unlock trading cards, screenshots, and achievements.First of all, I feel like £2.79 is a bit steep for this game. It took me under an hour to complete and wasn’t as immersive as I would have liked for a game of this stature. I feel a little like I wasted my money, as the story is pretty much the same whatever route you take, even with four different endings. It was fun going through the game to collect all the different achievements, but it got boring pretty quickly – I’ve never been more grateful for the skip button over routes you’ve already taken.The story itself is pretty generic – servant falls in love with master, tries to get master to love them, by use of magic. It’s something that’s been used in a lot of different games before, a lot of different stories, and this one wasn’t really much different. The character designs were nice to look at, and the some of the routes (such as the raven) did make me chuckle. However, it didn’t hold out all the way and I felt that the game was lacking when I finished the game.It was a disappointment, especially as this game was so highly positively rated. I feel like I wasted my money on this, and I would refund it if it were possible. I’d personally recommend skipping this one. There are plenty of free yuri kinetic and visual novels on Steam that are much better to play. I’m upset I didn’t really like this one. I just wish it had been better."

Getting the good ending requires a lot of playthroughs but that's part of the VN experience, there's no auto-scroll option but it's such a short game I didn't mind that much. Felt like there was just the right amount of decisions to be made consdiering the game's length."

The translation is a bit laughable at times, but whatevs. I played through and got the first ending in about 12 minutes, and then the 4th ending in a bit longer ( i was speed clicking a bit lol). First ending playthrough is here:https://youtu.be/fWzx_po1l_o"
,Not Recommended,612110,35203411,Posted: 25 September,all,GT   r a v e n V3,Kinda had an idea of what to expect going in but was pretty dissapointed. The game is pretty trial and error but it's extremely short length makes up for that. The artwork itself is probably the best part of the game as it's really nice to look at but I think my favorite part of the game was taking a tally of all the times the broken english props up throughout.Admittedly I thought I would kind of enjoyed the story but honestly it's the worst part of the game since when it bottles down to ityou're just collecting ingredients to eventually drug a woman into having sex with you as the end goal.I'd really only recommend this if you're looking for a quick game to 100% or if you're a fan of anime like art.

The English localization could have used more work. Odd wording, and grammar issues are all over the place. But nothing that ruined the otherwise enjoyable experience."
