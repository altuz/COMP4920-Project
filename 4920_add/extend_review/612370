But unlike the first game(Pako: Car chase simulator), where your trying to stay alive as long as possable while adoving on hiting anything including the cops that are chasing. But in this game is  a Big Homeage of the early days of the driver series on PS1. Now starting feel to feel the nostalgia is within me now! I will be looking for new content because I'm soo hooked to this game."

,Recommended,612370,34088390,Posted: 7 August,all,Blind,Great car chase action with a nice 70s-80s action movie atmosphere. Gets good updates regularly. Especially good for short or longer sessions on lunch or coffee break.

I'm eagerly awating more maps and a solution to aliasing.GAMEPLAY TIP: upgrade armor early on just in case you need to launch off a cliff to evade the fuzz.Currently giving this game an easy 8/10Keep it up devs!"

Brilliant graphic style and music, too. Can't wait to see how much content and ideas get put in the final version, this is a very complete early access title!"
76561198195502290,Recommended,612370,34012039,Posted: 4 August,all,wtfcnote,"This game is addicting. I like how simple the mechanics flow and the intensity of each run. different game every time. you never know what might happen. I have nearly struck my computer due to rage though, a simple mistake can really♥♥♥♥♥♥you off when you get pummeled by 30 cops after snagging a corner ruining a otherwise perfect run. Developers are adding new content regularly and i like what they've done so far. I am biased towards certain loadouts however because some weapons i cant seem to operate effectively due to timing issues. Sub-machine gun all the way! Perks for completing jobs are great all except for ""Death Touch"" i really hate getting it, and vote to remove it alltogether. It doesn't help you in the slightest. In fact it has killed me more times than crashing or making critical errors.One more thing and i know this game is early access and maybe my rig isn't the fastest, but i have turned all graphics features to minimum and still experience a fair amount of lag. I hope in the future i am able to play this one smoothly because i know ill be a real badass at this game with proper control.This game has great potential and consider it one of my best buys on steam. After wading through piles of half♥♥♥♥♥cookie cutter crap that has become the steam catalogue i have found a gem that somehow makes it not so bad. Keep up the good work Tree Men Games and give yourselves a pat on the back for actually caring about what you created.rating be 9/10 solely because of lag issues."

Those Saturday mornings when you can't be bothered to involve yourself in intense 5v5 matches on games like CSGO. This is the perfect little game. Wonderful idea, executed wonderfully and the 80s-90s feel is just a bonus on my behalf. Thank you devs for making this game."
,Recommended,612370,32371869,Posted: 12 June,all,GrijzePilion,"Something you can play everyday. It's a fun little game with decent driving physics, relatively big maps, an 80s-esque VHS-laden aesthetic, and fitting music. There's also some sense of progression, with a dozen or so different vehicles to purchase, and many upgrades and bonuses for each. There isn't a ton of content yet, so you'll have seen it all after an hour or two, but let's not forget that it's far from done."

I got it on sale for like $5 but until the full game is released it's well worth the full price."

76561198048755783,Recommended,612370,31559279,Posted: 5 May,all,roboteka,A bite-sized GTA. This takes all the good things from the original PAKO and builds upon them. Played with a 360-controller and had a blast. Shooting is hard - maybe players could unlock a partner in crime who'd do all the shooting? Looking forward to seeing more content.

,Recommended,612370,31545212,Posted: 4 May,all,Zaliku,"Man this is awesome!This game hasn't much in common with it's predecessor. It's more long-time focussed and it feels like you have a deeper progression.But I don't only want to compare. I really enjoy the gameplay and I love the idea of the fast (maybe a bit to fast sometimes) gameplay. The motto ""get in - get out - get paid"" really matches the gameplay.I also really like the retro graphics and the view reminds me of games like GTA (the first one).However I wish there was a third person view. Not only because some passages would be easier then, but also because I want to see the beautiful worlds from that perspective.Another thing that I would really like to be added is multiplayer. I also think that an online multiplayer (not via servers but maybe so that one player is the host) would match the gameplay better than offline multiplayer.I know that this is early access and a lot of things will happen to the game until it's final release but nevertheless I decided to sharey suggestions. I hope that's no problem ^^All in All I really love the game and I can't wait to see what future updates will bring to it. I totally recommend to buy it!"

Could use a mini-map or maybe a third camera view, say an eye-in-the-sky view further out then the current ""high"" setting. Looking forward to new content!"
76561197989849057,Recommended,612370,34455411,Posted: 24 August,all,Cricket,"Honestly I really want to like this game. Matter of fact I have installed and uninstalled it many times because each of those time some adjustment had been done, so I thought maybe it is better now. Except that for awhile now the moment you do your first pick up, your car basically turns into a cop cars magnet. Literally you will have like a dozen cop cars chasing you and if you stop then they just start piling on top of your car until you blow up, that makes no sense. If you had done a few pick up and then the number and aggressiveness of the cops increased, this would be fair. Plus the pick up are like for a few hundred dollars. If the money is that low, you don't need a getaway driver, you need a brain. So once again, it has been uninstalled.***UPDATE***The most recent update ""week 35"" resolved a lot of issue. So much the game is now playable and so much more enjoyable. I will give them credit for keeping the game updated and also to keep working on it. At least now I can recommend the game.The other thing I wanted to correct was that before the latest update, you could maybe do one run before your car exploded which meant earning a few hundred dollars per job. With the recent update, you can do a lot more jobs as the difficulty just keep on increasing which makes a lot more sense and that will put also more dollars in your pocket."

Retro styled, Adrenaline filled, and hits that GOD DAMN RETRY ONE MORE TIME PLS feeling. I really like the game. But just one thing, i've been playing for a short time but i have noticed the cops being well a bit annoying to fight, especially when you get trapped in corners. NEVER get trapped in corners, you might as well stop hoping at that point. OVERALLGREAT ♥♥♥♥ING GAME, TREE MEN, YOU ARE AWESOME"

Sufficient content to make your money well worth. Only critisism is that I'd loveto have specific paint jobs or weapons only unlockable by challenges. Also this game DOESN'T HAVE MICROTRANSACTIONS!

Vehicle should be outlined when behind things that obstruct the camersa view. You can't use your cursor to click arrows, the paint function uses space to cycle the different themes but everything else uses q and e.

This game feels like a crappy free arcade game that you used to play online back in elementary school. SOOOO NOT WORTH $5!!!! DON'T BUY IT.

Thanks for ruining the name Pako!  Tree Men Games can't even fix bugs on their mobile version much less Steam Pako and now they wanna make a game in a completely new direction.  Sounds like Jesse doesn't know how to manage his team!  Update Android Pako with last vehicle used is first available like previous versions, and low camera angle and fix gamepad support on Steam Pako as it has serious bugs and an auto spin glitch where the user can't turn their vehicle!   Then maybe a sequel is up your alley."

Quick, fun, and very robust gameplay along with nice visuals makes PAKO 2 worth the cost, which is actually pretty low to begin with.For an early access game it feels very well rounded with no major issues, I've only driven off the edge of the world once so far.My only negative comment is that since the visuals are so heavily stylized it can be difficult to tell what's what until you get used to it. As such I've found myself driving along only to come to a halt, having hit a slope that was pretty hard to see.All in all, solid game."

I have quibbles with the progression structure so far, and the first real map has some issues with hard to see obstacles and hills, but still a very positive experience.Not sold on cop cars waiting at so many of the drop offs either, mind.For all that, I keep wanting one more go and I'm not screeming at the screen."
