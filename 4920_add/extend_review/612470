,Recommended,612470,32408563,Posted: 14 June,all,Bad Whippet,"Poor John Smith.  His only crime was to become MY patient.  I did try to listen to all his symptoms with sincerity (I really did) but as his condition worsened, I began to panic as I promptly forgot all the simple things I'd just learned during my medical tutorial and realised I'd not saved up enough points for further diagnosis.  Never mind diagnosing then, just click a treatment - ANY treatment I can afford...Poor John Smith.  Luckily, I could afford one treatment: an intensive stress management course!  Unluckily, he died of Parkinson's, Angina and Hypertension, none of which benefitted from my inspired choice of cure.  Still, I have learnt from the demise of poor John Smith.  Yes, I have learnt my lesson.  I will promptly fire the tutor of that excellent stress management course...Now, if YOU think John Smith didn't deserve such good treatment (or if you think you could do better - tip: you can't - my stress course should have been an ideal solution for Parkinson's and Angina...), then this game will give you that opportunity.  Bio Inc Redemption is an enhanced version of the mobile Bio Inc game - a game that shares similarities with the equally excellent Pandemic and Plague Inc games.  Bio Inc Redemption is a game that mixes up time management and puzzle solving with some RPG-like upgrade elements.  You can choose to play from two campaigns: to cure or kill your patient based on his evolving symptoms and the complete toolset of every diagnostic process available.  Collect points to spend diagnosing and curing (or alternatively developing the symptoms of your chosen illness), or to invest in various upgrades to make those processes quicker and cheaper.  It's then a race against time as you battle to spare or end your patient's life.  The game creates a real sense of urgency, but in a fun way.  It's not pretending to be medically accurate (though it doesn't do a bad job at all), and the game is a lightweight and fun challenge despite its subject matter.  I found it equally as good as Plague Inc, but sufficiently different that I'll continue to find both games enjoyable.NOTE: the game is currently in Early Access form and could therefore change, but it is already a polished experience that feels finished.  Highly recommended!"
,Recommended,612470,32192322,Posted: 4 June,all,Randaru,"I've bought this game when I've heard that there's a PlagueInc-like game out there somewhere in early access. I've played through it for quite a while now and beat every level on maximum dufficulty. It can be a lot of fun for a player who seeks for a slow, but challenging puzzle/strategy gameplay.-----------------------------------PROS:>Wow Plague, much Inc.>Pure logic-and-common-sense based strategy-puzzle with a good amount of guessing done JUST RIGHT.>Despite looking much like Plague Inc, this game has much more dynamics to it's gameplay that tests player's reactive strategy much more often. More precision-demanding.>Two game modes, each with it's own features. Be a savior, or be a scourge.>Progression and player perks. Helpful for either making some of game's aspects easier or building around a specific playstyle to make the best out of it.>Difficulty levels, variating from a cakewalk to make-no-mistake-or-lose.>Many different playstyles are absolutely viable on the highest difficulty.-----------------------------------CONS:>Not for those of you who doesn't like this type of games, obviously, duh.>Still in early access. Expect getting stuck in loading screen or losing FPS quite frequently.>Player perks are unbalanced. There are no obviously overpowered perks, but plenty of useless ones.>Resource collecting done wrong. The mini-game is OK, but balancing is not. You can barely see resources over ""muscle"" system. And who the hell levels up resource gathering anyway?!>Asymptomatic stage. Seriously, guys, ♥♥♥♥ that challenge! Absolutely unbeatable in some builds, absolutely boring guessing game in others.>There is no way to see the exact damage on any system if you have lifestyles that affect this system. Which makes asymptomatic stage suck even more, and overall guessing in LIFE campaign gets harder.>Diseases don't make any sense. You don't just cure (or inflict) one or two lethal ones - your guy is the unluckiest mofo around and he usually has half of entire available disease roster in his body, including numerous lethal ones.>Lifestyles don't make any sense either. Not only they can be a legit way to win without even curing anything (which is funny and I like using it, but still), but they also can be mutually exclusive and still work. Ten non-smoking smokers out of ten, developers, ten out of ten.>Campaigns are very short, no scenarios. I hope more will be added later.-----------------------------------In conclusion, the developers have a lot to work on till the game makes it out of Steam early access. But even now, I can recommend anyone who likes this type of games to play through both campaigns, especially if you are into games like Plague Inc and alike."

A more close in depth approach to the human body and health and how to incite or deal with a such a crisis. I hope to see more from this game. The overall UI is intuitive using simle WASD movement and/or point click mechanism. Easy to understand explanations. Very nice graphics. and yes they have an easter egg.Playing as the hero or villan, is a nice toss in there too."
76561198062930115,Recommended,612470,31923893,Posted: 23 May,all,DG Dobrev,"If this game is based on real stuff (as it seems to be) it should serve as a warning point to many people about their habits and what can they change to do better.In this game you either kill or heal a person. It's that simple. Two ways out - with a twist...No, no, I am not some crazy person proclaiming healthy diet and life (God knows I havent done that since 28, and I have been gaming since 16, and for creep's sake, I climbed a 3 story building to unlock a friends's door from the inside just to play Karateka on his 8 bit COMP!!!) but I have enough knowledge to know what is happening here.Ok, now the GOOD.Disclaimer: I played at work offline. My steam hours are less than the play time because I was forced to play offline. If you find out where I work and I haven't quit yet, go ahead and rat me out to the manager. See if I care.1. After a confirm/check wiki-ing from a person knowing a wide variety of things, this games looks to be on the point. Watching Dr. House did help a whoole lot as well. Geez now I know why they always check for Lupus. Aaand, what Lupus is (I wikied that 5 years ago, and I remembered, so sue me). And why I should always target it. Was that a spoiler? I hope not...2. Great strategy layer. I like how the game tries to counteract the stuff you do. Sometimes you feel like House that episode when he cooled off in the fountain and realized that the wheelchair guy didnt commit suicide, but tried to save himself. Revelation at its best. Or not. And in that case you fail. Oh for F'S sake that was a spoiler...3. If you like to play games AND PAY ATTENTION - and I capsed it for that matter, it is a game that can teach you a lot about yourself. I love the devs for it. You will learn - as a person - a lot. How your habits have positive and negative sides, and how to go the best way. And how crippling diseases can kill even the most upstraight member of the society...4. I like the atmosphere and the music. Cryptic, and it goes both ways. Not bad at all.You know this reminds me of a joke.A guy who likes eating, drinking and smoking sees a funeral procession from the apartment block nearby. Goes over here and asks: I am sorry for your loss, but who was the person? They answer: he drank a lot, smoke a lot, did drugs a lot and ate like a pig!! He goes back, thinks... did smoke, overate and drunk and sheeesh Jesus!! I dont want this on me....Next day, anothe procession. He asks what happened? Did he smoke, drink, ate a lot?  Oh he was a saint! NO drinking, smoking, always faithful to his wife, he's been granted the paradise for sure!!!Our guy goes home, lights up a cigarette, pours himself some whiskey, whips out the beef and says - if the difference is only a day, yo... Don't care!Apart from the joke, the game has some glring issues:1. Not enough vusial feedback. Yeah you get blood splats, visual degradation of organs, but I can't say whats happening still, unless I pay close attention to the % meters.2. Huge learning curve on some diseases. While some maladies areextremely easy to manage, others are hard as hell, and the docs will give you a run for their money.3. I just wish it had more of the Dr. House Balls-Girl episode - people who watched it will know. That was a big plot-twister - and this game could use a few. Let's say, healthy people who jog regularly, go out morning and nights, work, etc. Let us kill or save really healthy people the same way we aspire to be - or make them drink, smoke, take pot and ruin them. That would be good! But then again, it would have to add a serious psychological layer - and while the devs added it, can they bring it up to it's full potential? Let's wait and see.Conclusion:For an early access game, this one is worth a shot. Concerning the people who know me, I never go ahead half-blind or half-cocked into early access games unless I know that the game will net me its full price hours 1=1 in bucks. This one will in its tutorials and campaigns. After they add free mode, like the other Inc. games, it will hit even higher boundaries.I urge you people - take my example. I used few points on purpose, in an attempt not to spoil (if I start quoting wiki, it's a sure-fire win) and not to ruin your experience. Play, learn and act. If a game can help your own life at the price of half your personal weekly exspenditure - it must be doing something right - right?But then again, remember the bottom line: no person on this earth is always right. Especially doctors. Enough said..."
,Recommended,612470,31834656,Posted: 18 May,all,reyjr77,This game is great as an Early Access game. I wanted to leave a review because this is a brand new game and I wanted to help fellow gamers that are on the edge of buying whether this game is legit or not.IT IS!It's a well developed game that you can interact with each branch set. Plenty of options to play through with different type of game modes. It hasn't crashed at all for me and it's a pretty stable game.Only bug I've noticed so far is that sometimes certain icons become unclickable as if your click pointer isn't getting recognized. It's pretty annoying when you're in the middle of trying to evolve certain branches but can't because it's unclickable. An easy fix for that is to just close the application and restart it back up. It will work again and your game is automatically saved.Have fun!

I feel this early access game can develop to something more interesting only if they make it even more accurate and realistic. If you're not someone who cares about medical stuff, you are going to enjoy the game for sure and have so much great time buying it.Thing is:As someone who studies in Medicine, this game is totally not accurate to some points and the developpers should review some aspects of the game.- I've never seen anybody getting all of his systems failing because of Fibromyalgia. Even more, how can Fibromyalgia can actually kill someone ?- How can Chronic Fatigue kill someone ?- Fever should be a symptom of an Heart Attack- A Cirrhosis Crisis can lead to jaundice or splenomegaly- When there's no symptoms remaining, why is the patient dying when he got stabilized ?-  Lethal Mode : Totally impossible cuz not enough BioPoints, even if we treated all the most important diseases and making no mistakes (I tried playing with a doctor we didnt even beat the game with no mistake).- Leukemia should lead to Sepsis or Kidney infectiuon, not Chronic Kidney Failure (at least Kidney infection should come before the other).Some diseases shouldn't be killing your patient, some should strike faster than others (heart attack vs leukemia).Some symptoms should be added to right diseases in the game, etc ..."

It's similar to Plague Inc. except instead of trying to end the world, you're just trying to destroy one person's biological systems. Or save their life. Whatever floats your boat.I used to have the mobile version of this game, which I loved but I had to uninstall it as it ate through my battery life like you wouldn't believe. So I was really happy to see this game up for sale. Now I can kill/cure people to my heart's content without having to charge my device every two hours!"

Definitely a fun game that stands up well against games like Plague Inc. while remaining refreshingly unique. And it's always nice to know that you nearly completed a really good game and that there is still more to come since this is an Early Access. I look forward to seeing what more you have in store. :)I only have one major complaint, though. I completely hate the Assymptommatic level in the Life campaign. It is absolutely cheap and a whole bunch of shrugging your shoulders and hoping you get really lucky. There is SOME strategy to it, but it's mostly luck."

,Recommended,612470,34695103,Posted: 2 September,all,Gahshunk,"Augh! I've already finished what's currently out, and I need more!Build your disease, combo different diseases, apply risks to worsen damage, all while trying to develop your disease with a super annoying medical AI performing diagnostics and treatments on your dying victim. Have the satisfaction of naming your victims and taking out your frustrations, strategize the fastest and most effective ways of collapsing all their body systems, make them go HNNNNGGGGGGG.But I much prefer saving the patient. Become that annoying doctor who diagnoses and treats diseases, and work against the disease AI. Diagnosing and treating everything can become a difficult puzzle, but you will perservere, because that's what a good doctor does. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices for your patient that will help them lead a relaxed, fit, and poison-free life. Perform surgeries as a last resort to save your patient and get them back on track with their life.This is the game for me. Having played the phone app for while, I immediately picked this game up when I saw it, and I was not disappointed. My only problem? I need more... Every achievement has been collected, and I need everything the developers will push out in their next updates."
,Recommended,612470,34093663,Posted: 7 August,all,Sunset Doge,"I've only played the death campaign, so I'll be reviewing only half of the game, and I can surely recommend it.Similarity to Plague inc. is one of the reasons I bought this game without a second thought.Building up your own ""meta build"" by trying out new paths and correcting your mistakes is very satisfying.The challenges are quite fun, I especially liked one where you compete against an AI in terminating your patient without any silly restrictions like doctors and recovery process.The interface and general audio/video is perfectly fine, with a little bit of humor there and there. I haven't encountered any bugs or issues either.The game is still in early access, so I'll probably spend a lot more hours after they add more content."
,Recommended,612470,32887104,Posted: 27 June,all,Dominus,"Bio Inc. Redemption - Spread your own disease!From the DryGin Studios' mobile app""Bio Inc."", the Bio Inc. Redemption is, much like Plague Inc. Evolved,  a Real-Time Strategy Simulator where you either save or kill a person!Stunning visuals, the gameplay mechanics, the outcomes and variety of stages will definetly make you stay for awhile!For the game that's currently on Early Access, I'm genuinely impressed on how this game works currently.Dunno if I'm able to review this game while I only played 5h by the time I made this review, but here we go...The CampaignAfter you launch your game, you'll have two ways to play. You can Choose Life, or Choose Death. What would be your path?I choose my path as DeathAnd with either campaign that you've chosen, firstly you'll be met with a rather explainable basic tutorial for either of the paths. Then you'll have variety of different levels, the more you progress with your campaign.Choose LIFEThe path where someone's life is depending on your hands. Your main objective is to recover your patient from random disease, in which YOU need to diagnose and treat the sickness from your patient. Mistake can cost lives! Start saving lives, Doc!Choose DEATHThe path where you become Sadist and kill your desired victim, as your main mission! However... The Doctors will try everything they can to stop you from ending your victim's life! Prove it that you have what it takes to become Death!Customization and OptionsWhile it has the basic customizations, such as naming your patient/victim, The Bio Inc. Redemption is currently in lack of it. Same goes for options. Basic quality settings of the Unity Engine. By the time you read this review, the devs might implement more into that game regarding of customization, such as gender(Yes, I know they've stated it in the desc, too...)GameplayWhether you're curing or killing the person, you'll always have lots of ways to execute your plans to do so. And so will the AI! The basic things you need to be aware of is the Overall HP, HP of each system, Recovery percentage and your ""Bio Points"" (Game currency earned by collecting bacteria/immunity in-game). Collecting Bio Points lets you to spend it on various things in a Bio Map. Be aware on how you spend the points though. The Bio Map contains 3 basic categories. Diseases, Risk-Factors and Recovery for ""Death"". And Diseases, Lifestyles and Intensive Cares for ""Life"". Disease is the main part of the Bio Map. Spending points on that category will affect the Health of the System you've chose. You have 8 Sytems to look upon (Circulatory, Resperatory, Digestive, Skeletal, Nervous, Renal, Immune, Muscular) and each system works on their own unique way. System Health affects the Overall HP of your victim/patient. If one of the System HPs is critical, the person will be put to Hospital and their HP and other Sytem Health will significally drop until it reaches Zero.Either of the side you choose, if the Overall Health reaches 0% or if the Recovery process reaches 100%, unless the certain objecive is made, the game will end. And depending on a side you choose, only one of them is your goal!As LIFEYou have 2 ways to use points on Diseases. Diagnosing and Treating. Knowing what to Diagnose AND when to treat can lead to the sooner recoveryThe Lifestyles category will let your patient's certain Systems recover the small health. Use it to slow down the health drain, or even stop and/or regenerate health of the system.Intensive Cares will boost your productivity of diagnosing and treating your patient. It also contains the ""Last Resort"" actions for when a certain System reaches the critical point! You can only use any of the System Recovery ONCE! Make sure it comes out as a success on your side!Altough the Hospital might give you less Bio Points cost, you should be aware that your patient is also close to dying! Your job is to recover them ASAP! So make sure no hospitals are involved!As DEATHRisk-Factors will drain the System HP much faster, depening on what you choose. Use them to benefit your disease's effectiveness!Use Recoveries category to your advantage, but also very wisely. You can prevent your victim from even starting the recovery process! Slow down the Recovery, or even stop/degress the percentage!Keep an eye on Treatments! Depending on one, your diseases might get locked down from evolving, if their process is finished!Your job won't be any easier, if your victim goes to Hospital! Act fast and prepare for the rapid Treatments that your victim will receieve! The doctors will even perform Last Resort actions preventing you to kill your target!All the sides have dozens of ways to playYou can choose to hoard up your ""Bio Points"" and strike whenever you want or exact opposite. Your call, honestly!BoostersYou have the ability to choose the boosters that will help you along your journey. The further you progress, the more XP Points you'll get in the future games. Don't be afraid to use any of the boosters, because the XP Points are permanet and cannot expire. Each booster will aid your mission differently. Choose the right ones for right mission.Forgot to mention... This game can, surprisingly teach you about some intresting facts while playing the game. However, they won't guarantee you to become a Serial Killer or a Doctor...THE CONCLUSION! WORTH IT?Overall a pretty solid game! But is it worth it?I, sadly purchased it when it was on sale. It is definetly worth a shot for a full price, if you ask me!"

I think an online mode would be very creative and go very well.So, to start off, this game is NOT a rip off od Plague inc. or any other game I know of. It puts its own spin on all of the ideas. Rather than looking at a map and tapping specific areas, you go to a certain body system and hold click on the area of the various resources. You have the option to try and beat the doctors and kill the patient or be the doctors and try to save them. An online mode pitting you against the disease/doctor would be very cool, but might be a bit difficut to do. More on ideas for that at the bottom.Then of course comes some of the bad stuff... As an early access title, you can expect a few problems. For instance, in some of the later ""Life"" missions, during areas of high stress (lots of diseases taking a hold and very limited resources to make those last few diagnostic tests for what you have narrowed it down to) once you click to collect a resource, you will get a 1-3 second lag spike. If a +3 or even a +2 (or any of them if you are on a higher difficulty as the time given to collect even the +1 red blood cells is only 2 seconds if that) resource appears during this time, it will likely dissapear before you can collect it. This can obliterate any chances of survival if you desparately need thos diagnostics/treatments when you have only 5% left on a system.There isn't too much more to comment on, as it is subject to dramatic changes through the early access process.So, to get back to those online ideas. So, for the doctor player, it would be a bit boring at the beggining, as the disease team needs time to get their illness to the point where the patient decides it warrants a doctor's visit. That is, unless, the patient starts off with a set amount of problems already, then they both start at the same time. After that, it's game on! Race against the opponent to cure all of the diseases before the sickness kills them, or to develop new illnesses and kill the poor shlub before the doctor can cure them."

76561198007865501,Recommended,612470,31927308,Posted: 23 May,all,Suonar,"Since this is Early Access I wanted to give a review to help the developers and anyone who may be on the fence about purchasing this game.This game is brilliantly detailed with the symptoms, risk factors, treatments, tests, ext.  Both the being death and being the Doctor has different challenges.  One major issue I see is a very difficult progression system.  After completing 2-4 attempts at both I don't see much advancement to move to different challenges in the Campaign system.  Although its very interesting such a difficult game advancement will make this game repetitive and it will quickly lose its replay value.For example, I have played the Death campaign a total of 7 times on the two levels that I have unlocked.  After completion of each one they give you a rating in skulls yet I only seem to achieve 1 skull no matter how fast the patient dies or how many symptoms the AI doctors cure.  This doesn't seem to add to my already existing skulls which means I am stuck repeating these two campaign scenarios.  I would not have a problem with this if there was clear descriptions on ""how"" to earn more skulls.  This is further complicated with a XP bar at the bottom of the screen which only adds the possibility of adding pre-game perks which even with this doesn't help to gain more skulls; as these perks definitely help kill the patient faster.In my opinion this game is defiantly worth the price since it is in the early access phase.  I have no doubt that the creativity they put into this game will only get better as time goes on.  I just hope they make the progression aspect clearer."

76561198039267144,Recommended,612470,32128331,Posted: 2 June,all,Boomknight,This game at first came off to me as riding the sorta dated hype train of medical upgrade type games or infection sims. I'm glad to know that I'm wrong on this.The Death side you plan to make your moves and feel like a true villain as you try to under mine the doctor and find or make weaknesses in the target.On the Life side is more stressful then the Death side as you scramble for a game plan that may change around depending what Death goes after. No idea what is going on with him you have to put your best guess to use and hope it pays off. Feeling like a true hero because most heros react to the Villain and work on undoing the damage they are doing.If you can't tell yet this game seems to be based around the relationship of Hero and Villain with that being shown pretty well. On top of every thing. At 6/1/2017 I have not been having many issues with the game with it being in Early Access. Yet one issue I've been having is random hitching as the games go on. It likes to hitch around when points spawn which in later levels makes it hard to pick them up fairly which chances are is based on my system if anything. Yet this is something to note.There is different modes/missions that feel as if they play differently even if it's just a rule set change. Mixing it up to make it into an rather enjoyable game over all.

Many will complain regarding difficulty but as you play you will find you become more efficient as a player as well as earning in-game buffs as you level up.As an early access game, I am not surprised that it doesn't run perfectly, but I have encountered little that would be considered major. While I recommend a lower graphics setting, you can function well enough even on the highest, but will experince interaction delay.This game features two sides of the same ""story"" so to speak. The disease and the one treating it, with poor John Smith caught in the middle. Gameplay consists of collecting objects that pop up for decreasingly small amounts in order to gain points to either treat the disease via process of elimination or cause it in a way to slow the AI's progress in curing you.While the concept may sound repetitive, there are several different goal types unlockable as you progress the game with varied difficulty. These will always keep you on your toes. Replay value remains decently high and gameplay is either tense, frustrating, or satisfying.Definitely worth the buy, but you have to be into this kind of game. The difficulty curve is steep, less than 1,000 players currently have made it past curing 10 patients, so obviously this will not be the game for everyone. I do however you give it a shot, if all else fails set a timer for an hour and a half and get a refund from steam if this isn't quite your fancy."

It still needs some balancing, because whith the boosters, the Death campaign is too easy even on Lethal, but this surpasses any expectations from a game still in develpoment!

I thoroughly enjoyed playing as the Doctor as trying to find the many different disease was a challenge at times due the symptoms being linked to more than one disease; the symptoms being this way was brilliant however challenging as it is a very realistic model.I did enjoy playing the Death mode as well, However I thought that it would have been more fun had you been a paticular disease or if there had been more abilities in terms of focusing on one area. I also would have liked to have been able to name a disease, and possibly change more features of the patient such as Gender which I am aware is an Idea The game developers have already noted. I also think a cool feature would been different background settings and perhaps different challenges to do with specific diseases. Overall Death mode was fun and I did enjoy how realisticaly the Diseases are  described as I feel this makes the game very educational as well as fun.Overall it may still be in Early access but it is more than worth it to pick it up now as it is still very fun and educational and suitable even if you are not keen on the disease side of things as you can save people instead.
