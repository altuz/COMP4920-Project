Im sure most of us who are interested in this game probably came because of that. Don't misread this though, this game is a lot more unique and is far from a copy. Though it is slightly buggy the game so far has been really fun and I can't wait to see where this goes! Good luck to you StardogEdit: For those of you wondering why my time is so little, its not :PInternet company had a power outage over the past day and a half but I have been playing this game for well over 9 hours now!"

It's pretty far along already and a fun experience, and I'm excited to see where it goes.You can jump right into playing a character, building a  business and trading.  There's a lot that I either haven't figured out how to do yet, or that isn't yet implemented, but definitely worth jumping in if you're a big Guild fan and can handle the Early Access maddness."

Have you ever wondered about the lives of the npcs in the games you are playing?  If so, then this might be just the sort of thing you've been looking for.I'm the kind of guy who wonders about that woodcutter swinging his axe at that same log, every day, rain or shine.  Instead of riding past him on my magical, fire-breathing destrier, I now get to be that guy!This game reminds me of what I love most about history: the little details that are important to little people.  I love worrying about the cost of ale, or how I'm going to find enough fruit in the winter time to make some for myself.This is an exerpt from a forum comment that I figured should be in a review,""So, I've done a couple of playthroughs now. The first was learning what not to do, the second is a raging success.This game is a wonderful breath of fresh air. I've spent many hours playing other games like Skyrim or Mount & Blade, etc. trying to be a normal person who works for a living. After over fifty hours in Saelig, I haven't even seen a weapon yet.The very idea that we can play a regular human being during such a fascinating time in history, is actually a fantastic learning opportunity. This is how history will be taught someday, I do believe this...but, we are a long, long way away from that day. This is an impressive step in the right direction however."""
,Recommended,612720,34850200,Posted: 9 September,all,CapitalVoodoo,"Fist off, if you're going to play, do yourself a favor and play through the tutorial. Most of the questions I had myself and found others asking are answered in the tutorial (this cannot be overstated). I played through 40+ hours without going through the tuturial, and based on others' questions I believe they did as well but it was all unnecessary as most confusion was cleared up by simply playing through the tutorial. The developers have done an excellent job at intermingling several different genres into a single title, however, there is a learning curve (again go through the tutorial) but it is extremely rewarding overall. This game is very promising for early access, it is intricate and has longevity that many others fall short of. This game is easily a five star in my book and hopefully the development team keeps in mind the same spirit, moving forward, that brought us this initial but amazing release."

,Recommended,612720,33069919,Posted: 30 June,all,Mr. Moonshine,"I bought Saelig because it's a spiritual successor to The Guild 2 which I loved years ago. There's a good framework here for a game that could eventually be great, but right now there's not a whole lot to do. What is there is good, the basics of The Guild style trade, production, and dynasty mechanics are in place but need a lot of fleshing out. I will keep my eye on this as it develops.I'd also like to mention I love the choice of setting, not enough Dark Ages strategy games, especially ones set in Danelaw era England. I will come back to Saelig specifically for this, even with The Guild 3 on the horizon."

Played this game on friend pc for least 12 hours . just bought it myself.It feels like a combination of both Kenshi , Sims and The Guild . I can see there even will come multiplayer to the game in the future!.Still tons of features could be added to the game and it still missing alot . Even this is very early acces , In my opinion it is very playable and there is alot to do .. One of the best alpha games i have bought for long time!"
,Recommended,612720,33468480,Posted: 11 July,all,Catman Rules,I found out about this game through Youtube. I saw a fun game with lots of potential.So I bought it of course and gave it a shot.The game itself has lots of bugs which is expected for a Early Access but the bugs can easily be fixed over time.I myself have only found one game breaking bug in which my character got stuck in his house door (this was at the very start of a new game so I lost no progress)Ever since the game has been fine and I've taken up the life of a theif and a robber... or a house burner maybe for that family that hates my stealing habits. I've married a woman who's like 20 years older than me.. annnnnnd we have a son.This game has lots of potential for the future. For now it has about a few hours of fun and some achievements to grab. It's pretty fun and of course I do recomend this game.Hope this helped.

But the dev seems to be updating regularly, and is active in the community forums.  This game has the potential to be pretty great if things stay on track.Basically, you play a single person in a Banished-esque town.  You buy a business or two to start with, then try to make money and improve your social standing.  You can get married, have kids, hire and fire employees, trade, etc. The pace is pretty slow.  I wish the dev would increase the speed control max, because still around at night gets a bit boring.  Overall, though, I think it's well worth the $15 risk."

MAke sure you have many hours to devote to this game. You will need them. Survive, own a business, be a shady thief, cause mayhem or be a good citizen and help your town flourish. The choice is yours."
,Recommended,612720,33896081,Posted: 29 July,all,rodeorogue,"As a fan of both The Sims and all things Medieval, this game has been enjoyable for me. It's casual and low stress for when I'm not in the mood to play something fast-paced or combat heavy. There are some bumps and gaps that need to be smoothed out, but that's exactly why it's called early access. Overall, I think it has a lot of promise, and I look forward to seeing how it develops from here. I have thought of a couple of things that would streamline playability and prolonging my interest in a single character that also might interest other players:A more developed objective system. It by no means needs to be story heavy, but a little more direction might keep it from getting aimless a couple hours in. Maybe errands or tasks on the side from NPCs to affect relationships, that sort of thing.One of the more consistent frustrations I experienced was trying to click on people. As they move around, you have a very, very small window to click on them and access the available interactions. Most of the time I miss and end up telling my character to walk to a new location. I think refining that mechanic would make gameplay much smoother.I'm sure the developers have a lot of ideas and plans as this game grows, and I'm excited to see what they are. I think my main interest would be to see more options for customization of the towns, characters, etc., but I also understand the time and effort required to make those sorts of changes. All of these things aside, I think this game is entertaining and enjoyable, and the replay value will only increase as it gets more refined."

,Recommended,612720,33395268,Posted: 8 July,all,AMECP,My Review as of 7/8/17Pros-Alot of bussiness you can play as like (Blacksmith / Farmer)You can try to burn your neighbors house down (Take Note you will have to pay a 200 gold coins in fines if caught)You can bum your way to riches by begging in street. You can also entertain with an instrument.You can get married and take your wife/husbands property/money.Child Labour is allowed (12 year olds and up can work)Cons-The game right now is limited two locations but will change as more updates roll down the line.Time still goes slow even though on 3 speed.Bare Bones as of right now but things will change when updates come out.My Recomendation-You should probably wait at least 3 to 6 months to see where the game is headed but if you want to support the developer then get it.

,Recommended,612720,33672320,Posted: 20 July,all,RabbitsPC,"Game is still in early access at this point so keep that in mind. This game is similar and different than ""The Guild.""How it's the same:* You need a family to keep playing the game as you progress.* You have a business that you grow as well as your status.* You make and sell things.How it's different:* You can actually go out and pick things by sending your character there. ""The Guild"" has you choose the option through the business. Picking things can include harvesting food (a plus).* Buildings are blander but considering the price, I wouldn't complain.* Faces, etc. are limited, but not bad.* There is no politics.* You can't give gifts and their are limited interactions (a minus).* You can eat at home by placing items in your home's stock (a plus).* You can't train skills or work at your places. You can only supervise there (a minus).* You can't get into a lot of the buildings so you can't buy at those locations, only the markets (a minus).* Everyone you meet goes into your list of people which is just an entry full of photos. It's hard to tell who to romance, but the colours allow you to tell whether they are your friend, a lover, enemy or neutral. At the moment, I have found it very difficult knowing who to woo (a minus).All-in-all, this is a good game and worth the money. While there are still some minuses and glitches, I think the final product will be a great game."

Married the other town thief had a kid and forgot to buy wool coats for winter.This is a really cool game that I'd recommend to anyone I play with. Lot's of different things to do so far even though it's early access. It's definately the best early access I've purchased in recent history and has a great developer and community to boot.For the price tag if you have $15 laying around I think this is well worth a try and I believe as the game moves forward it will really amaze everyone!"

Love it."

While its still in early access and lacks many features I did find that the game runs smoothly and bugs are squashed in the test branch before going to the main one. At this point you can get a few hours out of it. Once more features are in I expect it will have  more playability.
,Recommended,612720,33491362,Posted: 12 July,all,SillyandStrange,"A lot of people have said the game is feature incomplete and that patches are small....The game reached Early Access less than 2 weeks ago.  You have to expect it to be feature incomplete, you have to expect the patches to be something small...  The developer simply hasn't had the time to put out an insanely large update.The game is fantastic.  It's very Guild-esque, which is something I've wanted for a very long time.  As a matter of fact, it plays VERY similar to it.  So if Guild is something you loved, you'll love this also.No, there isn't a terrible huge amount to do in the game yet, but it does exactly what it states in the store page.  The developer is very friendly and helpful, and as you can see, there are plenty of small patches that were put out since reaching EA.The only thing that I can complain about is that I don't believe there is a political system in.  Maybe I just haven't seen it yet, but everywhere I look I see no mention of it.  That was my favorite part of the Guild games, and something I would like to see in this.If you like these types of games, then it's worth the investment in my opinion.  Then again, I invest in Early Access games quite a bit."
,Recommended,612720,35250097,Posted: 27 September,all,Mercy,"Careful: Niche-genre.You might want to do some research before jumping on this title while being the wrong kind of gamer.This is a difficult one to judge.When looking at Early Access projects in early stages of development,one of the biggest factors of a recommendation is whether you can trust a project to be successful anddeliver in a timely fashion.Careful recommendation as it's a ratherveryincomplete game as of right now.The current pace of development and the potential of actually achieving the goals of this specific niche-genremake for a promising Early Access project though.The game shows a working and very functional gameplay concept and the gameplay itself in it's current state is also already functional.It has working gameplay - That's something not every Early Access game tends to achieve this early.One of the most interesting parts of this Early Access project is that you can very, very easily reach the developer as he is quite actively searching the forums, using a youtube channel, etc.If you have been interested in The Guild 3,you will be interested in this game as well.The Guild 3 kept you waiting for years and years and this developer almostseeminglycasually stomps this game out of thin air and progresses rapidly towards his goals.I'd say someone who actually delivers in such a fashion deserves the trust."

My biggest gripe with the game is how barely anything is explained, there is no information about how the Thieves' Den operates, or what's the deal with social classes. But apart from that, it's a solid project, the graphics are as goofy as they get, and that's fine for this type of a game. The production chains work, and are nicely thought out. I'd reccomend to pull the trigger on the buy button if you're fine with waiting some time before this project resembles a full game."

Very fun game and great replay value. Updates are coming a lot with great new options. This game was made by ONE person and this is the exact type of indie dev we should all support. Just give it a chance and stick with it. I have been trying to make my family rich. I have 2 children and almost own an entire town (small) Great game and really should be more money with new updates and systems that are coming online.Ok so this is an edit after a few more hours into the game and I can't wait for more. Anyways I just bought a game that was x2 the price as this (guild3). I did a solid 24-hour stream of it and I can say with 100% that this game will fill that space. You have got to keep going with this game because there is a lot of depth and strategy to it. Not to mention the updates and a Dev that listens and is just as much a part of the community as we are. If you have any questions or want to see it via streaming just send me a PM and I will gladly jump on for you if I am not already streaming it :DI will also bet you anything that you can't own the map from starting in Nomadic. It's a serious challenge just to even get going in that mode lol. I have tried many times with lots of fails......Got skill? Show me!!!!

Further to this though the setting, the very apparent time, care and love the dev (who iirc is a one man show) has put into it will make for a fantastic and enjoyable finished piece.

,Recommended,612720,33072966,Posted: 1 July,all,mgk | brutha,"This game right now (at launch) is still really really alpha. It basically aims to be a clone of the Guild games (which is a good thing in my opinion, I loved these games), but right now there is not a lot you can do except buy a business and let it run on its own. You can't (yet?) build a new business to compete with the other families, you can't complete a production chain because AI will buy a business needed so can't farm wheat, make flour and then make bread.What I loved most about the Guild games was multiplayer, this is completly missingand appearently not planned. Edit: According to the answer of the developer below, it is planned :) The map itself is big and beautyful and the game has a lot of potential.So I'm giving the game a chance and a thumb up and wait until you can actually do anything.Edit: So far updates are coming often with bug fixes and new features. Game is very stable, but still tons of features are missing. My biggest complaint right now is that the game runs very slow ib the highest speed setting."

Everything in this game feels incredibly slow, even the camera controls feel like they're bogged down in tar when they aren't being clunky.It is, at present, very very early access. You cannot build any buildings or structures and are restricted to being able to buy a handful of businesses (two, maybe three if the NPCs don't scoop them up first and there's no way to buy businesses off them it seems). Character interaction is limited and there really isn't much to do outside of slowly shuffling around the map to move lethargic employees around here and there while occasionally supervising them as they slowly produce goods. There's very little content and everything feels, well, rather lacking even for an early access game.There is potenial for it to grow and become something quite good but at present it is too incomplete and unpolished to be enjoyable and as such I cannot recommend Saelig as is. For most players I would suggest checking back in 6 months or so to see if the developer has made significant progress or if it has become yet another early access game forever stuck in development hell.If however you have $15 to spare, would like to support the developer, know full well what you are getting yourself into and have plenty of spare time to test and play various iterations of a currently very barebones game then I would encourage doing so and giving feedback to the dev as this game could potentially become something much better down the road if supported by a solid community and developer."

I can't emphasize enough how much I want this game to be great.This is very early access so most of what I say should be fixed eventually but as of 15/07/17 - Suggestions/Feedback:- Criminal activity needs a lot of work, I shouldn't have to babysit my guy not to hold someone up in front of a guard, if this is too complicated to implement for now because it affects pathing & event ticks etc then maybe just a bribe guards feature to give you immunity for a period of time?- Production automation is non-existent, again why do I have to babysit my workers to sell their goods? Am I hiring neanderthals?- No building placement, you have to buy pre-existent buildings, this is the main thing that needs to be done.- User Interface, it's not that I care about having a fancy UI but like I said you have to buy pre-existent buildings, to do so you need to find the building you want, to do that you have to click through every single building and there is a 2-5 second lag until it pops up and there are hundreds of buildings, unless the building is distinct like a church you're gonna be sitting there clicking buildings for 20 minutes, building clicker 2017.If the dev wants to fix this quickly without doing a whole bunch of work on the UI a tooltip for the building info on mouse hover would be absolutely fine or just some icons over the buildings.- No political system, so if you want to gain a monopoly then it's arsonist or bust.- Can't buy a wife, so in the Guild II's late game there was a feature where you could simply purchase a wife from their family this was super useful because at that point you're managing a lot of businesses and you don't really have time to go chase a wacky NPC all around the map, it doesn't matter in the early game but late game this is a big quality of life feature.- Character Classes/Skills, I think this game could really get ahead of the Guild II in terms of character creation by removing the restrictive classes but since your character does a lot of activities I think a skills stat/tree system is needed. A butcher shouldn't be as good as a thief at thieving and vice versa.- Balance, it's early access so a lot of it isn't balanced.Okay that's all my suggestions/feedback, as for what's good right now?- Runs better than the Guild II and looks better too.- Carts & AI pathing is miles ahead of the Guild II's glitchy moonwalking.- AI workers don't randomly decide not to come to work like in the Guild II.- The whole arson process is amazing, I set a competing farm on fire and it all went up then everybody in the village ran out of their houses at night to put it out, so much cooler than just setting of a random (medieval?) bomb and nobody caring like in the Guild II.- Guards actually patrol in units to a schedule rather than wandering around.- World interactions don't require props/titles, basically there's no artifical 'this is locked' behind experience/milestones, everything is open from the start.- Fewer loading screens than the Guild II.I recommend it but only if you want to support this games development, as of right now it's not worth getting but I do hope people support this game, it has so much potential and the developer seems to be very responsive."

It is so small that is almost impossible to read.  Also the text blends into the background.  It should contrast where it would be very easy to read.  Reading over what has been discussed about this problem, it looks like this has not been addressed.  So, as of this date I cannot recommend this game.  Unless you have an electron microscope!"
,Not Recommended,612720,33731423,Posted: 22 July,all,Ostracism,"Would like to give the game a full review but I played it twice and both times the game fell apart very fast. First time, my workers stopped working and all just sat around the fishery making merry until my money ran dry, despite being properly assigned. Found out that unassigning them and reassigning them fixes this but a bit too late. Second try around got my workers working but my player character decided to stop listening to his overlord's right click to move orders and just stood still. Could make him enter buildings but nothing else. After a few minutes more and more features rapidly fell apart until the audio tore up and the game crashed to desktop.Early access isn't really an excuse to charge me $15 for a game that CTDs from standard gameplay. Especially in the first 30 minutes. Maybe if the developers put the game into a state that I can play without worrying about CTDs and instead worry about actually playing, it'll get a real review. Until that point I stand by the statement that it's lazy to use Early Access as an excuse to charge money for a game that cannot be played normally. Using alpha and beta like buzzwords is one thing, but if a game is available to the public for money, regardless of what stupid prefix you shove on it (alpha, beta, whatever) it should be playable. End of story."
76561198030754781,Not Recommended,612720,33870086,Posted: 28 July,all,shames,"On an average. I don't like to be negative about a game that I have played for only two hours, but for Saelig I make an exception. In the current state, the game is unplayable. Why I am able to make that judgment within two hours? Because the game is too dark and has an interface, which bucks like a bronco.Darkness. The Dark Ages were dark. I get it. It's supposed to be dark. Then again, I truly wonder why I have to explain to a programmer, that players have an individual affinity towards the darkness of their games. Is it even remotely possible, that there is a reason that I cannot adjust the darkness at night an in the shadows to my liking - I mean, other than shocking oversight? I am not just asking for a gamma correction, which on its own does little to alleviate the problem. And please, pretty please with sugar on top don't tell me to use a torch.Which brings us to the interface. I haven't seen an interface this catastrophic in decades. It's as if the game doesn't want to be played. Let's put aside, that I actually have to learn a key command to open the map. First problem is, like every command in this game it may not work on the first attempt, which makes learning to play sheer pain. Now, that the map opened, it turns out, it matches the darkness of the daytime. I guess, in the Dark Ages maps did that. Of course, the map is not centered on the character. Of course, the house I own looks like every other house on the map. It turns out, I have a better chance to find myself and the way home in the tea leaves of my Earl Grey than in-game on the map. I can click a button and the screen centers on my home? Cool. I just learned I don't need a map... I guess. So let's not stray far from the abode and begin with something simple. Talking to people comes to mind. Then again, just because the option is offered doesn't mean, that a conversation starts. Is it that the target character was busy just showing the option for kicks and grins, or did the command not work? Who knows. What I do know is that it is unacceptable when I have to go through ten different targets to find someone who stops running away from me or simply ignoring me. Imgine all the possibilities, when my own character is no longer the one I command - not that the interface informs me or, alternatively, I figured out that it does. In the tutorial the bakehouse comes with a cart. The last time I had this much fun learning a functionality, I listened to a drunken brain surgeon at a New Year's party explaining a cat scan of a giraffe.Aren't you happy now, that I only played this game for two hours? I wonder what all wouldn't have worked for me if I had stayed for a third.Make the darkness adjustable, and for crying out loud completely redo the interface. Yes, I see the potential this game has, but potential means buttkus, if the game is unplayable."

Often times the thieves will steal about 32 gold a day but it costs 100 gold to employ them. Not a good deal.I had difficulty just buying things. I guess the game is like starting your own family merchant business. I had a huge cart but no horses to buy, sent my character to the market but couldn't purchase anything.It was hard to establish relationships with other NPCs. You can't tell one apart from another other than their clothes which you hope you're talking to the same person if you're trying to romance them to make a family.The game is really slow. You can turn the speed up to 3 times faster but it's still so slow. Especially at night time when you can't see anything and can't do anything because everyone is asleep.Consensus:I really like the idea of this game and what it's trying to do but this game is just not ready for prime time as of 22July2017. It's difficult to accomplish tasks that you would think be just point and click, drag and drop."

My experience: At some point in the game my workers started sleeping day and night and not coming out of their hut. I think they must have had sleeping sickness! This was concurrent with the appearance of white, yellow and green glowing sprites randomly appearing and growing and then disappearing. Later, my character became vegetarian and would only eat fruit and veg. Also, the giant glowing yellow & black worm started crawling around everywhere and eating the screen and then randomly disappearing. Things started getting worse when my workers refused to go anywhere near the market and who could blame them. Instead they delivered the good to the wrong places and lost them (and the money). Finally, my character shaved her head, refused to eat anything and soon after she became ill and died. On her death, her husband stood over her. I thought he acted a bit shifty. What bizzare stuff!Other issues with the structure of the game are:1- The main screen is not really useful and the overview screen is the one used most. But the character shows ups as a small grey radiating dot on a very grey overview screen. Finding the tiny grey character on a grey screen? Really clever and hard on the eyes too!2- There is hardly any time for character chatting and socialising etc when all that the character is doing night and day, is shifting goods between places to flog them. Otherwise, will go bankrupt.3- Having nights is pointless. It just time wasted making the game longer/slower and is very annoying. There is nothing to be done or achieved, except for the character to shift goods to the market.4- When you upgrade anything (workplace, shelves, carts etc) often the money disappears but there is no upgrade made to the item.5- Once you have a particular shop there is no point in producing all the goods available. The best strategy is to make the most expensive one, and sell it to the market which pays highest. For example, the farm produces many goods but producing carcases produces the best profit. Also, by not making certain goods it is possible to push others like the bakery out of business, and take them over.6- Camera view direction randomly jumps on changing between overview and main screen. Also annoying.Overall, I think the idea/structure of the game is poorly planned, there is far too many things wrong with the game-plan, and from my experience, too many bugs in the programming of this game."

So far at 16+ hrs in (at the time of this review) I have really enjoyed where my money has gone. The developer seems to have high aspirations for this game. I just hope they don't abandon this project I believe it has a lot of potential.

You can play as a normal guy starting with a small business and eventually work your way up to the top. You can own 4 business at one point and rely too much on wheat and the price drops and so does your wealth. A very good game for how early in development it is"

The developer is very active in the forums and listens to the community. However, there is still a few bugs which is expected for an EA game. Overall very unique and good looking game."

,Recommended,612720,33971760,Posted: 2 August,all,Bizzle,i enjoy this game very much but after a few hours becomes very boring as all you are doing is creating products and resources to sell to the market which never really changes currency wise only gets worse the more you sell. even on the fastest speed this is a very painfully slow game and needs alot more detail and things to do. has alot of potential but atm is no where near even the first guild game. hold off on this game for another few months and aslong as the devs keep bringing patches out for it and adding new activities then it has the potential to be a fun and solid game.
