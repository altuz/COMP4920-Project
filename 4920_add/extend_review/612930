,Recommended,612930,34869653,Posted: 10 September,all,Metalyger,"I just bought this game, what got my attention was seeing YouTuber Maximilian Dood play the full arcade mode on very hard as Jesus. It looked like such a quirky game, and I saw it's on sale for just under $5. So I decided to play just a little, and I ended up playing through the arcade mode in one sitting, and having a lot of fun. The roster of the game is good, plenty of character options, and everyone plays unique from each other. There's also a menu that has bios for each character, which is useful since there are some Gods that I didn't know about, like the Chinese god of war, for example. I played using the Hori fighting commander controller, and it was very good for this game, I had no problems with the default controller input. The only real bugs I noticed were on the menu, sometimes it can feel a little unresponsive, like changing the resolution to 1920x1080, pressing right many times, then it changes and makes the click of the button sound for as many times as I mashed the button. Thankfully, in combat, everything feels responsive and doesn't feel like there's a lag or delay to your attacks. Back to arcade mode, I played as Athena, and I think already, I've found my main. She plays like a hyrbid of Wonder Woman and Aquaman in the first Injustice, pretty much take WW's sword/shield mode but replace the sword with Aquaman's trident, and that's how she plays. It only took a few matches on very easy mode to get the hang of her moves, and they do have the full move set on the pause menu. The game goes from very easy to very hard, and on very easy, I never lost two rounds, so it's as welcoming to any player skill level as you want. Casual to hardcore challenge. So far on this build, there aren't individual character endings, but I'd imagine later they'll have text endings, because they do have bios already, so it seems like they have an idea of a little more post game story planned. The game does look really nice, very detailed character models, faces never change expression, but that's fine. Each character has their own very detailed background, very much like classic Street Fighter. As for the game play, I would say it feels the most like Samurai Showdown IV, a little slow paced, like floating jumps, but it never feels sluggish or anything, and of course the weapon based combat. There's also very easy to string together and flow combos, which does remind me of Killer Instinct. For an indie fighting game, it does have nice polish to it, in it's current state. Not flawless, but a very good value for the price, because you do get plenty of content, take that Street Fighter V! It does have some completionist incentives. Every God has 2 skins to start with and 4 to unlock, plus it does look as if the final boss is an unlock, probably by beating the game as every God. It does have plenty to do on single player, and it does have 2 player mode."

,Recommended,612930,34750197,Posted: 4 September,all,TF.3pro5you,"Bought this for the memes, but actually ended up with a fairly satisfying fighter.  It's gameplay is surprisingly fun. It feels almost like a slower KoF XIV to me. Some of the specials are lackluster (Sif's DP motion), and while I can definitely see the potential in some character's kits, sometimes it seems like the devs don't know how to make the moves interact with eachother (Odin). Another comment would be that the magic series doesn't seem to work with some characters because their normals are stubby (specifically Sif's M).Combo damage seems very high, which is not a bad thing. For instance, with Jesus I was able to find a 50-60% combo within about 15 minutes of picking him up. If I had to compare it to something else in this regard, I'd probably call it similar to street fighter 2. Scaling seems a little wonky too, but they can fix that in a balance patch.The game has two meters, a super gauge and a DPS meter.  The super gauge is only used for your super, and the DPS meter is essentially a V-trigger from SFV. I'm really hoping that, as the development of the game goes on, they create additional uses for these meters, as right now options feel kind of limited.Overall, I really like this game. It's definitely not perfect, but it's a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to following this game and seeing where the devs take it. If you enjoy fighters, I'd definitely recommend picking this one up."

I play mainly fighting games so I was assuming this to be the usual jank stuff that gets uploaded from time to time.Pros:Interesting cast, pulls from a bunch of mythologies.Combo system seems to have some thought to it. Moves have juggle values and limits for the most part. I noticed some things seem to go against this. Zeus DP move seems to allow juggles forever.Some good aesthetics; music and stages are pretty good for what it is.Cons:Hit detection on some stuff seems wonky at best.Very choppy animations on jump in, lows, assorted moves. Stuff like Sif stand Medium doesn't hit when chained.Movelist is pretty homogenous for everyone.All in all if this is just early access and they're planning to touch up stuff I'd say pick it up while on sale for some quick fun, and maybe a neat little FG once the finaql product is out."

You won't confuse this game for a AAA affair like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat... But the base gameplay is there despite some tech issues (I couldn't find any way to adjust video settings or play full screen).I really expected this game to lean in to the humor of its insane premise... But even when Jesus says ""I'm back... For da people"" and starts dropping sick combos using hunks of the cross, there's no discernible feeling of satire.It's not what I wanted, but I have to recommend it anyway... It just seems unfair to penalize a game for being serious and mostly competent when what I wanted and expected was a stupid piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥"
,Recommended,612930,34779672,Posted: 6 September,all,Endyo,"I usually try to avoid reviewing Early Access games, but Fight of Gods seems to warrant an exception.  There’s no shortage of fighting games in the world and plenty featuring odd characters throughout, but I don’t know of any in the past that have exclusively featured actual gods from various religions.  Fight of Gods doesn’t just go for the notorious godly brawlers like Odin and Zeus, but chose to add in some spectacular juxtapositions like Moses and of course Jesus H. Christ himself.Punishment Fist!If you strip away all of the ridiculous aspects of Fight of Gods, you have a pretty standard fighting game with dated graphics and a tiny move list relative to nearly everything else out there.  Even the more casual fighting games are more complex.  It reminds me of the original Mortal Kombat with how limited it is.  Perhaps even simpler considering every character’s special move is accessed via the same button combination.  However, for me that is a *blessing* since I am notoriously bad at fighting games.  Yet, if you are overlooking the cheese factor of the design and voice, you’re missing out on one of the best parts of the game.  The first time you see Jesus descend on a cross, then snap the ends of it off while still nailed to his hands and proceed to use the remnants as makeshift boxing gloves, finishing with a heavily accented catchphrase of “I’m back for da people,” you’ll probably do what I did and laugh uncontrollably.  Not every character is a nutty cheese log, and it honestly seems like the developer didn’t intend for that to be the goal, but the ones that are really make it worthwhile.  Going forward I hope that they embrace how silly it can be and add more gods and correspondingly wild intros and stages to spice things up.Justice Punch!Fight of Gods isn’t a long game and, as I’ve mentioned, not all that difficult.  Combining the limited moves with what is currently a small cast of deities, I went through and beat the final boss aptly named “BOSS” in a little under an hour.  I did it faster the second time, both times on Normal difficulty.  I’m sure ramping up the difficulty would have the expected effect, but if I’m able to succeed at the base difficulty that quickly, a more seasoned fighter player may not be challenged at all.  In addition, there weren’t any limitations (as far as I could tell) on how many times you could retry after losing a fight without having to restart the whole process.  I also encountered a few issues with hitboxes, sometimes hits not connecting when they appeared to or just oddities in how characters reacted, but it wasn’t as prominent as I would have expected.  These are all things that are to be expected in an early access title, and all things considered, Fight of Gods may be on the more complete side of the crazy scale that is early access progress.The 11th CommandmentI don’t want to make a habit of recommending or not recommending early access games, but given the small price, no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t presentation, and fairly bug free experience, it’s hard not to at least recommend giving it a shot.  Since you can experience most of what the game has to offer in under an hour, Steam refund shouldn’t be much of an issue if you just don’t think it’s worth the $5 sale price.  Fight of Gods might not be the next Evo 2018 title, but it’s worth checking out for the comedic value and decent enough to play through a few times.  A functioning online component (which is slated for the future) would really add a lot of value, so that may be the one big thing to wait for in deciding whether to purchase.If you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EndyoGaming#curationhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1128433888"

Also I want to say that my reviews are a little disjointed, but I try to talk about as much as I can.The game's not bad. I paid about $6 AUD and I got a good laugh out of it. The simple fact of playing as Jesus in a fighting game proved humourous and quite enjoyable. I went into this game expecting quality. I'd heard alot about it on news sites and I saw that the publisher was Pqube. Pqube distribute quite a few high quality fighting games to Europe and the west so my expecations were a bit high.For an early access game, it has quite a few characters, 10 right now. There's no online as of yet but for an early access product I would expect it in the future.Game looks  rough in many areas. It has a long way to go before it looks decent compared to other fighters. The developers also need to make sure they translate the entire game. One particular section was still in chinese.The game has supers, combos, instincts and many special moves. All the moves are executed in a style similar to mortal kombat and street fighter.The game has arcade, vs, training. There's not much to do right now. But the combo system does not appear shallow. Also I swear I saw some OTGs in here.I'm going to mark this as a positive review because I know I'm going to laugh about this with my friends in a weeks time before I forget it. And I got to do a few combos along the way/"
,Recommended,612930,34746024,Posted: 4 September,all,Ranshi,"I bought this game for a laugh, but I'm suprised it works so well. Fighting games are probably the toughest type of game to get right and this one gets it.The game is pretty simple and it might feel a bit stiff when moving around your character and while blocking, but the combo system is pretty fun, it's similar to marvel/anime/kusoge type games where you can cancel your basic attacks and then cancel them into special attacks, ut you can't cancel special attacks into supers. You can pull off some pretty silly air juggles that might seem infinite, but the game doesn't allow you to repeat the same move more than 4 times in a combo, so you don't get into those types of situations. Your character also has a special meter which gives you an unique buff when you fill it up, some recover health and some enhance attacks, I didn't mess with it enough, but it's neat.I do have some things that I found somewhat annoying foe example: you can't do backwards throws and all of the characters have a similar move list, only a few have command normals, but these don't work like so, they're more like extra attacks you can cancel a normal move into because you can't do them by itself and the game doesn't really explain that. Another thing is that the dragon punch/shoryuken motion isn't your traditional (forward, down, down forward), instead it's done as (forward and quarter half circle forward), and a lot of times I'd end up getting a fireball and not the move I wanted, but I guess it's a thing I have to get used to.Other than that the game is pretty fun, it would be nice if it had online, even if it was a p2p type of thing, but it's still a pretty ok game for what it is, if you need a small fighting game for killing time it's an ok purchase."

There are tons of ways to combo and juggle. However the game does use NRS-style inputs (zero diagonals for special moves) with no option to switch over to stick-friendly input methods.My DirectInput controller (PS4 arcade stick) was supported instantly. I can only guess the same holds true for XInput devices.Right now, there's an arcade mode, offline versus, and training mode with a roster of nine characters. For the price of five bucks as it is right now on sale, it's already a good deal in my opinion. If this game does not get abandoned by the devs I can see a very fun fighter in this game. Give it a shot, it's fun and the game will need feedback and a playerbase to thrive in the future."

,Recommended,612930,34768997,Posted: 5 September,all,FROYO battlekiller,"I bought Fight of Gods expecting a dumb joke game to entertain me for half an hour, and was pleasantly surprised to find its actually sort of decent.The most appealing part about this game is the character design. Between Jesus still having chunks of the cross nailed to him, Buddha's constant statuesque pose, Moses swinging the ten commandments themselves around, and GuanGone leaving brush strokes with every swing, the characters are all very creative interpretations that still feel relatively true to the gods they're supposed to be. The stages too are very visually appealing. the game as a whole has a lot of style.Unfortunately, the gameplay itself is fairly subpar. I'm no fighting game expert, but its still easy to tell whats off. Lights all feel slow to start up, and a lot of mediums do as well. I'm curious to see the frame data for this game. Motions also feel unresponsive at times, which I suspect has to do with the game not using diagonal directions. With some tweaking the game would feel a lot better, but as is the gameplay feels rough.Along with that, characters feel a bit samey. A lot have your standard shoto movesets, with a projectile, anti-airs, and forward moving attacks, all with the same motions. the shoto archetype in itself isn't bad, and even slight variations on it can make them feel very different. Ultra Street Fighter 4 had like ten different shotos, and each felt unique. Like my other complaints, with some tweaking this can be fixed. Something simple, like giving a character a new move, can make all the difference. Giving Zeus a grapple would be cool, as would giving Buddha a teleport. Things like that.The game is currently in early access, which is not a promise that this game will ever get better. That being said, I would say the price is right. At only $5, you will likely get the entertainment you've paid for. Even as is I like it, enough to write a review of it. I hope to see it become something really good, and I think it could."

I was instantly sold by Jesus' win quote and intro animation, for example:)It's a very, very standard 2d fighter, even to the point of being instantly accessible - which, regardless of whether the game is good or bad, is a pretty good thing for those who want to access fighting games from point zero.Resources and specials are simple, movement is simple and the game is slow-paced. Here I can point out a negative thing, which is lack of fluidity and also what seems to be a noticeable input lag. So, the gameplay feels pretty clunky. That said, I actually think that's a good thing for a beginner.So, real talk, if you want to play fighting games and don't have any experience, aside from googling and getting a ""real"" fighting game to start the grind with, you can pick up this and get the basics with movement, combos, punishing etc.I'd say the game is enjoyable due to its simplicity. In that regard I think it's actually very well done. For example, Fantasy strike is more bare bones, being on the verge of... not being a ""regular fighting game"". Fight of Gods is still being a regular fighting game. Very regular in fact:) You still have motion specials, supers, resources, dashing, crouching and even launchers and stuff like that. But it's still very simplified. Hilariousness aside, I think it's a good beginner's fighting game.There's no online multiplayer as of yet:( Luckily, I've seen a thread about in in the forums and a dev responded that they are planning to implement it. Which is great news. Now, there is a possibility of, due to the game inevitably being a niche product, player base's skill bottom being highly elevated very quickly, as it happens with every skill-based niche game out there. But, there's a chance for that to not happen, as the game is simple. On the other hand, I've already seen infinites on twitter, so... I guess that ball is in devs' courtyard:)At this price (ha!), I'd recommend it, if nothing, then for it being a fundamental 2d fighter and having a training mode."

The cast of characters will obviously offend many, but it's still a really cool cast of characters and the special moves are very creative for the character that is  chosen. Graphics are very decent (In my opinion this game looks better than the $60 triple a released King of Fighters XIV. That game just came out last year and is considered a big triple a game while this is a indie!). Gameplay feel and speed reminds me of classic 2D Street Fighter, which is great. The maps look so great, from Zues's colorful stage to Moses's stage that displays you fighting within the parted red sea and many other great levels.  The game is easy enough for  people that don't play many fighting games to pick up and have fun with some basic combos and special moves, while having a lot of depth for hardcore players of the genre with cross-ups, immense juggle combo potential, and a training mode. The move list for each character is usually pretty short and simple (it is not Tekken 7 where each character move list is the size of my high school senior paper), and the devs even have annotations on the move list to explain certain special moves and what they do, not even Street Fighter devs have the patience to do that.Overall, it's a great purchase and I insist you pick up the game for it's creativity, affordable price, potential for dozens of hours of fun, and also so the devs could implement an online versus mode so we can all play against eachother via the internet? I give it a 4/5"

I know it's in early development and it's probably already in the works, but it needs to change.  At the very least, change the name.  Second, when you beat the arcade mode, there has to be different endings for each character.  With that, I would say to add a way to view them once they're completed a la Mortal Kombat.  It could be added to the profiles after you beat the game with the character to view their ending.  Beyond these 2, I think it's fun and worth a try.  There's a lot of potential with this."

She also seems to have a 1-FRAME FULL SCREEN super which can be comboed after her INSTA d.p.s (the revenge system). In addition, before the opponent hit the ground, ALL HER ARROWS CAN JUGGLE!!

Characters all have really neat cute little animations for their movements. Some moves could use a bit more... something. Just to let players know what's actually happening. Like how moses has a move that puts a snake on the ground but I could hardly see the snake and just thought my opponents kept magically taking damage.The characters are all super neat with their entrences and victory based things. Moses (who I picked) would read his book which is just the two slabs of the ten commandments in like a ring binder and a chain. He swings those around and I just loved it.The roster is... not a bad size for the price, though I didn't touch everyone. Everyone looks nice on the character select screen.Combos feel... not terrible. I enjoyed learning my moses low poke into low medium( which launches) into ten commandment swing into shoryuken commandment thing. I found that on my own in like 2 minutes and I found the combo system lets you find more nice things like that. I like a nice, open, combo system and what few characters I did play (jesus and Moses) felt super duper fun with the combo variety.consNo online mode. I don't know if one will be added later, but online mode is never going to not be an absolute must in fighting games.The VO sounds like 1 or 2 guys who all don't speak english speaking english. That and the voices get drowned out over the music.I wouldn't have minded more religion variety. I can't put my finger on it, but the roster seems to heavily favor norse. Let's get some figures from other religions. There are tons. Let's get muhamed in here and really go to town. You don't even have to actually include him. Just have a giant sensor bar ala South park and all his moves are just muslims getting mad that he's in the game, rushing the stage to do either peaceful protests for defense or violent protests for offense. You can get really creative there. (Sorry, I just know that if I say ""you should do this"" and you don't know how, suddenly I look like a jerk for making it sound easy.)The game could stand to look a bit better. it's rough around the edges, but I can see that being fixed over time.Jumping feels super terrible. The jump arc feels like it is designed to make you feel like you have no control over your character now that you're in the air. You jump, and you are now trapped in the air. If you want to attack, you can and may as well, you're not seeing the ground again for a while.ConclusionThis is a good start (as this is early access) I hope to see it improved. More characters, better graphics, online, etc. I think you guys can do it. You showed this game far more care than I thought you would."

So, I know this is in early access - super early access, most likely - so I'm hoping it gets tweaks and things to better the experience. There are a lot of interesting ideas here, but there are definitely technical issues:- It started Not Responding when I loaded it up- It takes a looooooong time for battles to start, so you're either on the ""character vs character"" or just a blank white screen for a while.- Hitboxing...hahahaha. Watch moves that touch the opponent not actually hit while their supermove thing can hit you while you're behind them, with the animation on screen showing them attacking NOWHERE near you and still sending you flying.- None of the faces are animated except for Anubis, from what I'd seen. You just get to watch characters talk without ever moving their mouths. Jiggle physics apparently superceded that as a priority on Sif.- Damage balancing is all over the place. Sif, who I played in my first half hour experience, does basically nothing compared to Jesus, Odin, or Buddha. Why is the damage so inconsistent?I know that's a lot of complaints - it's probably not even all of them - but, I still say pick it up. It's cheap right now and, hopefully, will be tweaked and tightened as Early Access moves along. Like I said - the ideas within are interesting, the execution is just a little weak right now."

There's so much missing, so much that's actually integral to fighting games nowadays - why can't I interrupt a rising animation? Why do I have to wait until my character's fully stood up and that animation has finished before I can start entering the commands for a special? Why can't I grab an enemy who is one frame away from fully standing up? I watched the boss character rise, standing up through my special grab because his animation wasn't finished and he was invincible, and then duck the grab even though the frames that actually grab him had missed because he was invincible through them. I've launched enemies into the air, hit them once with a light attack, and they immediately land in a standing position because I guess there's no animation to knock them higher or away or have them hit the floor and bounce from that sort of hit, eff knows why!Playing it will only make you want to play something like Guilty Gear, Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, and if you already have those you should play them instead.I really hope the devs manage to tighten this up to a decent standard, I'll happily change this review if Fight of Gods leaves early access and feels like MK9 or MKX, because right now it feels more like MK4."

The hitboxes are wierd, sometimes jump attacks can miss, and sometimes while you're doing combo you move to the other side of the enemy. (hint to the dev: while a character is in a juggle state, increase it's bodysize [not hurtbox] to the ground so combos are more consistent and you wont move to the other side while doing a forward attack.2. The controls are not polished, 623 hard to perform when crouching, always goes into some wierd auto combo thing or 236 , ALso some combo routes have strange restrictions which makes it even worse (e.g. Athena H can ONLY cancel inth 236, M only to 214 or 623), why not just add some kind of proration to the game instead of restricting all the posibilities the players can do? (for example, in Blazblue, recovery time is shorter if you start with an A attack, in GG, the push back increases as the combo progresses, in MB, theres a limit of 3 wall bounce so you can't loop forever.Overall this game is not fun, the only thing I like about it is the special cancel system where you can cancel special moves into each others."

Some of the current characters aren't gods and I'm sure future characters won't all be gods either. So maybe take that out of the title?The concept of the game is amazing, the fighting is really good as well, but needs tweaking as some combos are just not fair.The art style is really cool, but the graphics need to be upgraded which will probably happen over time.Online play should have been part of the original release but i'm fine with waiting a little bit for it. Gives players time to practice the characters and moves I guess.The keybinding setups are really bad and need to be changed, Borderless windowed, more resolution options and some hitbox tweaks are all needed.The game needs proper english in every category. Some things are in chinese and things like ""option"" instead of ""options"" on the main menu.Overall. Really cool game. I'm loving it so far, it's addicting and will be more so when there is online play.

It's all pretty clearly satire. Same with all the characters, it's not really that big of a deal. Anyway...The game is alright. I was pretty surprised with what the game has to offer right now. It has 10 playable characters (as of the time of writing) and each character has their own unique stage with unique music.The game uses 3 attack buttons (light, medium, heavy) and a grab button. Most of the special moves are the basic Street Fighter specials (Hadouken, Shoryuken, and Tatsumaki motions). It's pretty simplistic, but you can still make some very cool and flashy looking combos.Most of these next comments can be lent to the fact that this game is early access, but should still be noted. The controls are not always very responsive. I played through the arcade mode, and I had a lot of trouble trying to activate my super (double quarter cirlce + attack button) when I was trying to make a flashy combo.The voice acting, which I'm pretty sure is intentionally bad, is incredibly obnoxious. It's funny for about 5 minutes, but the poor voice acting is distracting. Again, I'm certain that this is just a placeholder, but as it currently stands, it can be hard to play with.Most of the fighter animations are pretty good, but on some stages the background characters animations are super clunky.Overall, if you are a fan of fighting games, keep an eye on this. I'm interested to see what they do with it. It's a great deal for it's price (4.79 at the time of writing) and it has a funny gimick. In it's current state, it's a fun novetly to show your friends and play for a short while, but doesn't have a lot of staying power. Hopefully, with more polish, it'll be a great indie fighting game."

I love the creativity that was put in to every character, Zeus having Thunder Gauntlets and Moses using the Commandment Slabs as two of my favorite examples. Also, ""Turning the Other Cheek"" being a counter for Jesus is pretty clever. The aesthetics are a bit stilted and janky, something to be expected of an early access game.

Almost like fithing through Molasses, and he deals a very small amount of damage for this slow speed. In fact, he seems to do the least amount of damage, and be the slowest. So some pretty serious rebalancing needs to be done there.His super move, frequently does not register the hit on the opponent.While the number of fighters is very limited, they are fairly well though out in terms of move sets. Except anubis. Making a sarcophagous appear from under ground, when I don't know, say summoning a jackal would make more sense.It is a bit off putting, when a greek or norse character speaks in an asian accent, however I will assume a lack of availability for properly nationalised voice actors.Over all the game handles fairly well, it is not a chore to play through, but some balancing is required."
