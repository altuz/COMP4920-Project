76561197966262950,Recommended,613270,33422928,Posted: 9 July,all,AEon,"Overall feel:If you have a soft spot for the jungle-ish tropical-island feel with modern set piece ruins adding a dose of mystery, like I do, this game could be interesting. It reminded me of the awe I felt when first playing the Far Cry demo back then (fun fact: the original Far Cry was intended to be a dino hunter game initially). Admittedly the game is a lot simpler, since after all this was made by only one person.Survival:Your main goal is not to die from hunger, so hunting dinos for meat, is a central point. You have to fry your meat at campfires that you can pretty much set up at any point. This satiates your hunger, increases your health, crafts a few arrows (for your crossbow) and most importantly also saves your game progress. So camping is essential. Avoiding getting eaten by the dinos would also be essential. And a handful of weapons that you find along the way should help with that. I am not so sure about the potential stealth aspect of avoiding dino encounters, since I pretty much killed everything in my path.Exploration:It is a ""wide linear"" game in a lush setting, not really open world where you can go anywhere at any time. Meaning your path is mostly linear, leading you to a few scripted moments and areas of interest. At any time you can fully backtrack, e.g. go back to the very start. The ""wide"" part means you can verge off the more or less clearly defined main path to find extra weapons or collect eggs from bird nests. The latter yield health when eaten. Over all you should discover something interesting even on a second playthrough.Story:It is fairly vague, dropping the player into a survival situation without knowing what happened to him, or what happened to the world he knew. Small tidbits piece together some form of post-apocalyptic setting and drive the protagonist on to explore the world.Episode 1:This apparently is only the first episode of the game, with more coming. Makes sense, since even a very complete exploration will yield no more than 5 hours of gameplay. Well for me at least.Issues:The game has a few technical issues here and there, but as we speak these are getting fixed. Nothing major though.Fun factor:Well, I pretty much enjoyed the exploration experience. And taking out a T-Rex will be scary as heck... so you should have enough ammo for your weapons when you try that."

For the low price this game asks, I say go for it. This game can only improve from here, and the time I spent to finish the first chapter was worth the money I paid. Entertaining, and a good base for future updates. Congratulations to the dev for making something funGraphics/Animation- Acceptable on both accounts- Resolution and Anti-Aliasing seemed to have little, or no obvious effect on jaggies, even at 4kFramerate- Pretty good, not sure how it fares on lower end systems thoughWorld- Reasonably populated with Dinosaurs- Unless you're on the main path, the game loses a lot of polish (floating tree's, unrendered spots, etc) but I expect this to be fixed via updates, so don't let that dissuade youThings I'd like to see improved/added- Less need to kill/eat Dinosaurs- Perhaps a small map with 'fog of war' so you know where you've been- More loot options (containers, enterable buildings, etc)- not too much of an issue- Reduce Herbivore aggro, I found myself attacked more by them, than the actual Carnivores- More clear signs on how to get Crossbow ammo - this was a diceroll for me on when I actually got them- Better/more looping sounds, which I'm sure you've already got covered, figured I should say it anyway- Guns seem reasonably balanced against the Dinosaurs, although I personally think a T-Rex shouldn't be downed by two clips of Rifle ammo - perhaps a slight buff to the Rex?- Option to not consume meat if at full health/energy but wish to save- Egg consumption seems bugged, sometimes I can eat them, sometimes I can't. Other times,  I can only eat when doing another actionOverall, I rate this game a high 8/10 for what's been accomplished so far. With time and effort on the devs part, I'm sure they can score even higher - so keep at it, I'm rooting for you :DI got this game for myself, and quickly gifted one of my friends a copy as well after enjoying myself. So, if you've enjoyed this game, share it around with your friends!"

76561198173606567,Recommended,613270,34648394,Posted: 31 August,all,KeinSchiesse,"Although I wasn't expecting to see Dinosis Survival's environments be quite so large and impressive, I also wasn't expecting to see my character miraculously clip into and out of solid objects often, including boulders (seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1124344212) gas cans, pallets, and other various inconsequential objects scattered throughout the environment.That and some other goofy glitches aside, this game does two things very well for me that make me enjoy it when approaching it in search of an affordable, immersive ""dinosaur game""It captures the mass / size of the (at times, scary/imposing) dinosaurs, and has a ""living"" feeling jungle area around it, whether it be through the ambient noise of bugs, a pterodactyl flying by in the distance, or  shadows being cast from the surrounding foiliage.The level variety you encounter is a lot more diverse (and large) than I thought it would be in the game itself, including a variety of waterfalls, rivers, open grassy areas, cliffsides, and outposts. Unfortunately, you eventually run into ""invisible walls"" preventing you from navigating further up a cliff, for instance. After having wandered that far along the edges of the game area, I tried to return down the same cliffside, fell about 3 feet, and somehow died. The dinosaurs are placed sporadically (thankfully) throughout the levels. They seem to match their habitat and their scarcity / absence from the game world makes for tense, ""too quiet"" scary moments when navigating the jungle before seeing a large one nearby.How much you fight the dinosaurs inbetween the areas is more or less up to the player as the game tries to incorporate a stealth system with only marginal success. You can sneak around the dinosaurs if you want (which I did through a field of raptors and alligators...) but even if you try to pull a ""stealth kill"" (stealth hit?) with the crossbow on enemies while undetected it didnt seem to do anything other than♥♥♥♥♥♥it off and get it to swarm me. If you engage in combat it's a bit clumsy and unrewarding, consisting of just holding down the fire button and watching the enemy hopefully slump over before you run out of bullets. You have no dodge / evade so if they get close you're screwed. Ammo seems scarce.The save system seems to throw a lot of people off in the forums, you hit F to set a campfire/checkpoint at that location. You don't get to save in different spots (or fast travel or anything like that, all on foot, no map...) it's just this one recurring campfire location to respawn from during your playthrough. Not having a map I'm surprised I haven't gotten more lost on the game, despite its large outdoor environments. The hunger / survival system seems much ado about nothing but maybe I'm in for a rude awakening. As far as exploring the terrain with much gusto all you'll really do is find an occasional keycard to open a door to progress to the next area, or a new weapon on the ground.The player model (and some dinosaur models, including a creepy grinning stegosaurus..) could use some work. The player model does some WONKY♥♥♥♥♥♥sometimes, including his 1000 yard stare as he crouches, before somehow slipping his left arm under his knee... it looks super awkward and is hard to describe without seeing it in person but stay crouched long enough and that will inevitably happen. Maybe he's a contortionist. It's another of several graphical glitches in the game that break the immersion.This game has its share of graphical glitches, including the clipping previously mentioned, and the player character model's arm goofily tucked under his leg while crouched, and another that breaks nearly all immersion toward the game, which is occassionally the dinosaurs will just get stuck mid-walk in a hillside and stand there unmoving in one location while doing their walk animation. It looks pretty shoddy in an otherwise graphically-immersive game. There is no first person view which is kind of a bummer, as is a lack of ANY controller support. The mouse and keyboard controls are logical (spacebar to jump , shift to run , WASD control,etc...) but not having controller support of any kind sucks.Looking past its budgetary limitations, for its low price, large, varied jungle environment, and immersive (if not at times graphically comical due to glitches or low-res / simple models...) depiction of a jungle with dinosaurs, Dinosis Survival pretty much delievered to me exactly what I expected of it and I'm glad I bought it."

It's just about go, kill, eat, make arrows and that's all.I like the concept uninhabited island or what with dinos but it should be a bit more and has to be more creativity.It's not worth yet the 4.99€ what I spent for it but I trust in the developer (if I know well he's making it alone) and that's why I keep the game and hope he'll make the game better and better and it will be a really good game as soon as he finish it.But until I don't recommend it for anyone."

The reasons why i still can't recommend it are simple (from minor to big):-The voice acting-Flaws with the engine (beard dissapears and appears at the campfire, stairs aren't accessable whithout jumping, etc.)-Sometimes the subtitles doesn't even say what the character is saying-Whether this guy is just VERY hungry or the hunger system is slightly off but you are even hungy after eating a wholet-rex-Dinosaurs like the ankylosaurus should not be able to walk through narrow spaces-Dinosaurs aren't acting like they should (herbovoirs attacking you on sight, raptors hunting alone, etc.)-bugs/glitches: pretty much what got me to quit the game to name a few: got eaten by a dead t-rex, got stuck between stairs and a corpse, ankylo bashed me in a house and i couldn't get out againTo be honest it feels more like an early access title but if you are ok with starting a game over and over because of bugs and glitches it could be enjoyable to the point you killed every dinosaur atleast once."

This first episode will last you around an 1 1/2 to 2 hours depending on how much you like to explore. The graphics are pretty decent and the game ran smoothly for me without any framerate/crash issues. I feel like the animations could use a bit more work but are passable. One thing I would like to see personally is more interactivity with the buildings and world in general. For the price its a fun little game and I hope the Developer keeps improving the game and I can't wait for the next episode."

,Not Recommended,613270,34775659,Posted: 6 September,all,-<TSG>- Velociforce,"the first thing I haft to say about this game is that maybe yes it's cheap, but this is my opinion so sit down kids and let me talk you through this gamethis game is literally the worst dinosaur game I've ever played, well second worse, it's still better than PCE (that isn't a compliment though), but my point is that it's broken, buggy, but it's kinda bad in a good way, you really shouldn't buy it (should be a free game really) but its balancing just so perfectly on a so bad its good level in terms of the environment being very occasionally so.the voice acting is lazy and sounds like the voice actor can't be asked half the time, like he's really not interested, the models are buggy and don't look right or glitch out on kill, the animations are broken and really don't seem to have that much time put into them, just to skim over that quickly.another thing I have a problem is seemingly having to extinct the entire raptor population to get a few bars of hunger, yes that's an exaggeration but you haft to kill a lot to refill even half your hunger, the mechanic isn't bad since most survival story games don't really have that very often but it could still be so much better and fixed to a point where it does not take so damn much to have full hunger.one thing good about this game is the constructed and visible scenery, I know it's not that HD and cinematic but I kinda like and can appreciate the look and style of it.the story is why I cannot recommend this game, it hints at being such a perfect and constructed story, not many dino games have backstory that's visible (only Jurassic Park clone games, but they ARE Jurassic park clones) but this game kinda made me feel it could have a deep and interesting story, it was as I said hinting on something deep and interesting, why is this guy here, why did their plane crash-[!!!!SPOILER FOR STORY PAST THIS POINT!!!! what little there is of it]-in the future? why are there dinos, what are these weather- oh wait, you are robbed of all that BY A STUPID CLICHE 'ITS A TRAP' ENDING!!!, but still there was hope even past that originally when I saw that it was a trap at the end, when the loading screen came up I was interested to see what would happen next, after the loading screen, what I could possibly be caught for? maybe some sorta revenge? but no, just a 'the end' screen and pretty much a very unsatisfactory and terrible ending to a actually good concept for a story, it just ruined and wasted the great opportunity, I felt cheated, like everything I had done was a waste of time, I made no impact to the universe and felt like I left before I really even begun, I also learned jack s*** about the world except for it being the future and that nature had reclaimed the land with dinosaurs for some reason roaming.I'm sorry developer but you need to do better, this story and the ending that robs you of finding it out in any form just really ruins the game, I ask you to make something of an extension to this game or a remake with a longer story with a ton of time and effort, the scenery isn't even that bad, the models and glitches are somewhat passable (but would also need a lot of work) but the terrible presentation of the story and the way it is really stolen from you before you get a chance to really actually get into any of it is really bad and dissapointing, and personally what makes me despise this game as a whole product.the game has some interesting ideas and could become a great story if you just put a lot more time and effort into them, and help make the player emerged and deep into a great story and universe, I really hate seeing wasted potential in dinosaur games cause the only good ones we ever get are Jurassic park clones, (well only one made by Telltale have I seen some actual good story in) and other than that one product all dinosaur games are basic survival with claimed story or just complete flops."

It's full of stock unity assets and looks like a polished mobile app game, but never once while playing did I find it tedius or a chore. It was satisfying and quite easy, but in a way I liked that; its fun to play to unwind. The story is actually quite good, and I was engaged every minute of gameplay. I hope to see the next episode out soon.Despite the looks and rather ugly models, the story was interesting, the gameplay fun, and the concept surprisingly original. For only $5 it makes for a quick but enjoyable romp."

It has a ridiculously small team but it's fairly impressive what has been put together. This game isn't without its bugs, but it's playable and has a decent plot. I had a lot of fun playing it and I look forward to seeing where it goes later down the road.

Responsive controls, excellent dinosaur variety, well made prehistoric atmosphere.Like Trespasser youre propelled into a world dominated by prehistoric creatures of a bygone era through unexplained circumstances. You have a health in in many cases a more important hunger bar that must be satiated from time to time as you trek your way through the jungle, work quickly to get over hostile rivers and eventually cautiously make your way though abandoned human structures as you work to find survivors like yourself.There is environmetal variety, including everything from dense jungles, to open plains, to lakes and rivers, to mountains.Everything needed to make the game playable is already included and at this point I dare to say all thats necessary is some technical improvements. After that its just add ons like new dinosaurs, or weapons. Also, if you think youve explored the entire map, trust me, you havent.Overall a good buy. Cant wait for more updates."

It reminds me a lot of Jurassic Park Tresspasser and the trailer footage of the canceled Jurassic Park 3: Survival game. And for a Unity game, it's looks great, especially with how open it is and how many dinosaurs are on screen at once sometimes. The story is a little laughable, and the voice acting cracked me up so many times, I just love the actor's voice, but it didn't stop me from enjoying it. This is not a game for everyone, I can see why people won't like it. However, if you are a Jurassic Park fan or like old action adventure games, check this one out at least. It's $5 for crying out loud, which is not bank breaking.I hope the developers keep up the good work, crank out the bugs, and have a solid product soon, because if I'm enjoying it now, I can't wait to see how much fun it will be perfected."

To give this developer credit he does give you a few pointers on the gameplay on how the game works this was enoungh to make this game a lot more fun to play but i still stand by the issue  of  how it lags when you aim its heard to even shot it needs to be a lot smoother but it works very well on low graphic settings. I am now surviving now do to i use hill an just my bow shoot an run is the key up hills to lose them and around big trees. You seem to lose them this way the raptors, It's a good game once you do all the setting right and use hit and run to survive.  It still seems to be a little gengric or some what basic but over all it is fun.NEW GAME IDEA MAKES THE DAY:I would like to say one more thing at first i hated the idea of one key for doing mutiple things at one time.  I also thought it was a bad idea but i was wrong this developer is smart.  There is to much micromanagement in games made today that take away the fun.""Using the F key"" to build a fire when you do it makes arrows and eats and saves the game all in one, is one of the coolest idea yet.  Don't get me wrong i do like the other things that added to games like opening chest or build a base as long as it is simple.  I also like collecting item to make things as long as it stay simple and not to much micromanagemant to it. (But this idea is the boss..)Just fix the game play smoothing out setting so we able to play on high settings with out the buggy issue.ADD ON: One of the biggest issue i found was the lack of turning off the back ground sound the noise is way to load and you can not post this on You Tube i was very upset with this because i had played it for over Six hours to reach the end recording it to put on You Tube to show off this develpers game but after it was done the jungle sound drowned out all voice recoreding.It is a short game but it sure was fun to play a few issue i have found like i feel it could of had a little more interaction to objects.  With my setting on graphic to low it still looked very nice.I really like this game and will get the next epasode when he finishs it.  When i got to the end of the map i was lost for about an hour or more not knowing where to go this was also a little bit of a pain because the creatures here did responed if they killed you and in this small area i got a bit upset the key to finding the end is over the bridge down in town over around the lake in to an opening see a lot of cars.  When you reach this area it triggers the end of game video.Thank you in advance for listing and working on our game."

The graphics are okay but they need more improvement and of course there are glitches with the graphics like holes in the rock you can see through or the roots of the trees not connected to the ground and the same goes for the buildings. The dinosaurs are really cool but there are some problems when you kill them their bodies just fall down like ragdolls and don't have weight, they just spazz out. The gameplay is simple, you have to find survivors and hunt dinosaurs for food, which is okay but I think there should be more to the video game than just fighting dinosaurs. Dinosis Survival maybe in early development but don't let that put you off, If we continue to support it. Later on the developers will make it even better.

Dev - please listen and fix that as is rediculous !Finding health packs and more ammo would be good. Also the need to drink would be good and have to watch out for crocs. The graphics are not too bad - the game mechanics just needs an overall polish. Item interaction like trying to open cars, doors of any building should ahve an appropriate sound and speech to go with it. Have the ability to find a crow bar or something to force entry into some houses and find loot.Killing T-Rex should be way harder than it is - far too easy and should have a stamina bar also. Running too much should comsume more food but still les than what it currently is...basically you need a inventory to store stuff and limit on what you can carry unless you find a bigger bag.Larger map areas with more loot to be found and need to sleep might be a good addition also. I really wanted to go searching all the city buildings but you cannot. Also I encoutered invisible barriers across the river near triceratops which prefer to check out more.Dinosaur content is pretty good actually - just need difficuly level with little lizard things attack on mass on higher difficuly level and harder to kill everything else also.I hope to see more content soon and the next episode also !!"
