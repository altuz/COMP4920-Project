76561198050433002,Recommended,613390,35041745,Posted: 18 September,all,rcjenn40,"This game is a well-made homage to the old SSI gold box AD&D and Dragonlance computer games that us old foggies remember with such great fondness, but without the curse of those friggin' code wheels and adventurer journal copy protection.But here it is almost 4am in the morning when I finally turned it off, so that curse is still there, and happily so. I am thoroughly enjoying this game and plan to spend many long hours with it.There are some differences though. Everyone only moves one square at a time, the loot system is more Diablo-like, enemy AI is a bit smarter, enemies are a bit beefier, and opposing units can pass each other without penalty hits.But all in all it's a solid, well-made, strategic turn-based title that fits in very well with those old classic look, style, and gameplay of the much-revered SSI gold-box adventures."

It strongly romances the classic titles such as Ultima 1-5, SSI's Gold Box games (Pool of Radiance and the rest), Questron, Demon's Winter, Wizard's Crown, etc.  Combat is mostly automated with extensive customization and the ability to go fully manual at any point.  In short, I've been playing this game on Android for months and I enjoyed it enough to pick it up on PC today.  Highly recommended!"

If you are looking for manual party creation, attribute tweaking, battle tactics, and controlling a group of murder hoboes, then this is the game for you. And it's all in a classic-looking UI from my days of yore (the 80's-early 90's).Get it, play with the default party for a while, and then throw them away and make your own custom party. Keep rollin' til you get the feats you want. And, when the game starts, tweak skills, spells, and attributes to your hearts content."

The intricate class and party mechanics, RNG-like loot elements, skill leveling and XP system make it an interesting experience. I have played many hours on the Android version, and am very happy this came to PC.The dev is very responsive to bugs and very respectful and appreciative with any feedback.If you love old school RPGs like Ultima, Bloodstone, etc, then this game is a definite buy."

Its one of the greatest time wasters I use at work, it looks mediocre, but once you get into it, its actually pretty damn amusing, I had to pick up this game for Steam just to support the Dev and his hard work to make a great oldschool RPG. I've gone through the game 3 times now (first 2 chapters, have yet to do the 3rd), and I look forward to a few more playthroughs, its worth the money"
76561197999923452,Recommended,613390,34982410,Posted: 15 September,all,bcdarks,"This has been my absolute favorite mobile game since I stumbled upon it about a year ago.  Since then I had devoted many hours (some of which probably should have been utilized for more life-sustaining pursuits) to this fantastically addictive game, but have not regretted so much as a minute.  Volker Elzner has crafted a true labor a love, a homage to the glory days of pixel art strategic RPG's that echo the best of the Ultima games, Demon's Winter, and SSI's beloved Gold Box Series.  If the words ""Create New Party"" stir fond memories of all-night adventuring and exploration, you would be doing yourself a disservice to pass this one by.  Two thumbs up...way up!  Now excuse me, I gotta go unlock that ""Dragonblood"" birthfeat, those dragons aren't going to summon themselves, after all..."

First few computer games looked like this - with almost none of the humor. Frequently makes me remember D&D with buddies - only I'm not 3/4 baked and wanting a large pizza with ham, bacon, and pineapple. Quite a few books that I've read over the years, some were even worth reading. Yea.. I was a nerd. Get over it.Initially found this on my Android phone. Loved it from the moment I started rolling a party, even though I had no idea how to translate half the feats then... Did at least 2 full playthroughs  and about a dozen partial ones before I realized that even my near 6"" phone screen is too small and holding the phone was killing my hands.  So I waited and hoped for a PC version (or to find an emulator that would work on my comp). Finally it's here and after a minor stumble initailly.. I'm in and up to my 4th team rolled. why? Because ALTITIS!almost forgot to mention the community that we have developed over time on FB. Lots of tip trading, suggestion, and out and out help when you need it.and Should you have a game issue? (like I did the 1st day or 2 it was out on Steam) Not only is the Dev right on it to try and help but those in the group try to help. But the Dev has pushed out bug fix patches within 1-3 hours of an issue being reported."

So far spend 2H rolling my team, and most of the day training Perception. Now to venture forth and slay the Rats ;-)Reminds me a lot of my youth spend in SSI Gold Box games, lots of min/maxing possible and after completing ingame tasks new options for restarting the game.Amazing community to help shape your journey, but pick what you like give it a try, and adjust on the next playthrough."

Actually got a steam account again just so I could let eveyone know how great this game really is! If you're into Retro RPGs, this is an A+ purchase. Never played the old Ultima series or the like, but as a fan of old school jRPGs I figured I'd give it a shot.. and it was so worth it! Great replayablility along with near infite class/feat setups, this masterpiece could keep you entertained for quite some time. And with a wonderful community, any issues/ questions you may have are answered in an amazingly timely manner. For a game created and operated by one man, Volker, I couldn't ask for more!"

Tons of customization options as far as parties and equipment, it simply put is a great game to play! I would recommend this game to anyone looking for an old school RPG! Can't get enough and I was glad to be able to purchase this here on steam to crush my enemies on my PC!"

76561198007479341,Recommended,613390,35266018,Posted: 28 September,all,lochinvar1,"DoC harkens back to the classic era of gold box games. You create a six member party with a range of traditional fantasy professions--fighter, barbarian, ranger, archer, rogue, monk, cleric, druid, mage--and sally forth to fight the powers of darkness (and acquire phat loot).Character generation and rules are simple; development of skills, powers, and talents is more complex. Character professions can be changed or upgraded deeper into the game. If you enjoy leveling toons, tweaking equipment, and obsessing over the perfect party composition, this is your jam.Clean simple graphicsTurn-based combatDeep customizationHandy automation featureServicable storyServicable to good soundVerdict: Excellent. You'll spend many an hour molding your latest party into the ultimate engine of destruction"
76561198026827806,Recommended,613390,35392975,Posted: 1 October,all,Tarsis,"Better than the phone version. Don't let concerns of port from other devices worry you on this one! I've got hundreds of hours into this little gem on my phone, and this version on Steam only makes it better! Keyboard shortcuts alone show this dev is a slave to his craft.Deep gameplay with tons of replayability options should you desire. If you prefer a bit lighter play, premade parties are available, and character specific autobattle is optional if you don't want to control all 6 (or any!) of your party in tactical battlefields.Loads of different weapons, with different learnable attack styles, many different spells and skills. Most of which can be trained up using talent points gained every level and also by usage. Achievements that actually ADD something to gameplay, different difficulty levels, ability to grind for gear or experience if desired.Boatloads of gear... boatloads.Infiniteinventory space, and infinite stash space, which you carry around with you. I put all my trash/unwanted items in my stash on my adventure, when I get to town, there is a ""sell all items in stash"" button.... I go back to town when I *want* to go back, not when I collected too many geejaws.I get a kick out of trying different party combinations. All trolls, or all dwarves, or all clerics, or monks. Most of which actually seem to be viable, just in varying amounts of difficulty.Developer is consistant in his outlook for the game, updates, and in responding to questions. I have no fear recommending this game toanyonewho likes RPGs."

The achievements give bonuses that allow for faster play throughs, and it's fun to make completely different parties. Pretty much any group is viable to play through with, which makes for endless fun."
76561197970679463,Recommended,613390,35096287,Posted: 20 September,all,ironmaiden,"I've only put between 2-3 hours into the game so far.   While this isn't enough time to give an in depth review I can say that that it has old school charm and it is addictive.   It has that one more turn quality to exploring and combat.   The UI could be cleaned up more, and that is improving as the developer is EXTREMELY responsive to suggestions and changes.    This game has just been a pleasant experience so far and it has been enjoyable to interact with the developer.   I will post more thought as play time progresses.   Easily worth $8.99 in my opinion."

76561198010444011,Recommended,613390,35132322,Posted: 22 September,all,Patrick,Love this game.  Been playing it on my IPad and have been eagerly awaiting the PC release.  Definately worth a looksee for you old-school RPG crawl lovers.  Volker is active and takes into high consideration all player requests and suggestions.highly recommended.  Caveat Emptor:  this is not an easy-mode RPG.  Save often as you WILL die.
76561197975592611,Recommended,613390,35215580,Posted: 25 September,all,Firefly,"Im so hooked.. this genre is so rarely done well anymore (since the old goldbox AD&D games or Gurk), but this game delivers.. it sat on my phone for ages and I was put off because I wanted to roll a custom party and understand my choices, and also I had a really small screen.... but now that its on PC, I did some web research and have been rewarded.Note: You can choose the default party to save all that pain if you like lol.The game has some really cool classes (and advanced classes later), you can change the difficulty to suit and kind of just wing it if you like, or if you have played some tactical grid based RPGs before, you can make a party and fight the way you prefer. The depth of strategy is there (if you want it), a lot of players play it from scratch again and again with different classes and go for achievements and such.. the randomness of items and the flexibility for how to level your class means no 2 runs should feel the same.Anyway, need to wrap this up so I can get back and play it, oh and any new players wanting information, its a little hard to find, either the wiki, the facebook page, there is a touch arcade forum.. there is a basic amount of info out there, but heaps more to learn as you go, you will have some questions, but thankfully there is a strong community of players on facebook to help eachother."

I stopped playing on my phone because this game really needs the ability to move by keyboard and use keyboard shortcuts to shine, and now here it is here even better :DClass balance, dept, good story, this game has it all. Try it, you won't regret it."

76561198019860912,Recommended,613390,35445326,Posted: 3 October,all,Quickshadow,"This is, and has been, my game of choice for most of this year. I started playing it on iphone/ipad and have now moved onto my pc. It is a great game, reminiscent of old school games like Final Fantasy, Ultima 1-4 (especially 4) and others. I have probably put in over 1000 hours of playing so far and it hasn't been boring once. The creator and team are top notch and super helpful. If you haven't joined the gameplay group on facebook I urge you to do so. Even if you haven't bought it yet, or are on the fence, this is a great resource. The youtube videos are great too and super helpful in overcoming some of the more challenging aspects of the game. You should go buy it right now, no serious, it's les than $10... you know you want to, go go go go go"
