Drink 10 alcoholic drinks in under the alloted time, which changes depending on difficulty, and you win. The first time I played it, it was fun. Then I beat the first level, and there were no more levels. You just play the same level over and over. There are different modes for online play, but there are no online servers because nobody plays this game anymore. I purchased this for like $0.89 on sale, I believe. Was it worth the money? Eh sure, I was entertained for approximately 20 minutes. I suppose it's a fair price in this scenario, but would I reccomend you buy it? No... There just isn't enough gameplay for it to have any replayability. Maybe if there were more levels and different goals, but unfortunately there is not. The gameplay becomes repetitive and stale far too quickly."
76561197972509697,Recommended,613730,32143137,Posted: 2 June,all,enaid,Downloaded this for a laugh and it was quite fun. Three online game modes are currently working 1/man gets drunk and wife has to smash the booze bottles. 2/ each person has a list of items they need to find in the house. 3/ one list split between players the one who finds the most wins. The map is small and the graphics are dated i do not know if the items have random spawning places if they don't this will become very boring quickly. When i purchased the game i had to buy a friend a copy so we could play online as no other players could be found. I will give it in the current build 5/5 for mechanics as everything works. 2.5/5 for graphics and 3/5 for gameplay as it is mindless fun and a break from other games.For the price it is worth a go just make sure to buy a friend a copy as well.
,Not Recommended,613730,31424085,Posted: 28 April,all,Tabascofanatikerin,"A little explanation: What drew my attention to this game was a video by the Icelandic gamers and YouTubers Birgirpall who played this and made it look like unintentional (?) fun. A game with a stupid concept, bugged graphics and silly voice work (the wife shouting scoldings at you).I expected all this and got bored very quickly.First of all: ""Need for Drink"" deals with marital problems but not in a deep way, also not as a deep satire. You are either the wife or the husband in a broken relationship at the point of divorce. It's basically a first person scavenger hunt. In single player mode ""Home Alone"" you only play the husband and the goal is to drink a certain amount of alcohol before the time runs out (= the wife gets home from work but you never see her when you lose the game). Thus you search for all kinds of spirits at your home.In multiplayer mode (where you can also meet random players from around the world) you have two games: One is the same as ""Home Alone"" but with the wife destroying bottles at the same time. The other is the divorce game where everyone gets a list of items that need to be found before the ex-partner gets theirs first.Sounds funny? At first maybe. But as I said, boredom comes fast. It's more fun to hunt for all the achievements but that wears off fast, too. Better play it in multiplayer mode anyway, that's at least a bit challenging. The funny moments I hoped for didn't came as I haven't managed to figure out when or how the wife speaks. I've asked people but haven't got an answer. And the control menue didn't help me either.The graphics are rather dated and ugly, sound and music are hardly there (only the husband burping and moaning after eating food is a little bit funny) and the game itself is very lifeless. The gameplay at least is okay. The controls are very easy. However, don't play the game if you suffer from motion sickness quickly. Even I had to take a break here and there.Well, MAYBE it's all because it's early access but I don't expect the final version to be way more entertaining. But I'd be willing to try it out.So basically - as it is now - I cannot recommend it. It's not as stupidly funny as it may seem to be and becomes boring fast. At least I can say that it's insanely cheap so if you buy and dislike it, you won't cry over your money that hard (I payed about 80 cents or so for that)."

Actually this game was gonna be pretty nice if her Multiplayer was active... Pros and Cons,.Pros: Good Graphic - fun to play BUT with friends or someone - Cheap price :) - Weird - Good achievement..Cons: Kinda disgusting - Dead Multiplayer - Weird..Well if Ppl tried to play this game they will have some fun and a good time but after all it still weird."

All you do is go around the house from House Party eating random♥♥♥♥♥♥and collecting booze before your wife gets home. I don't even know what happens if you fail this because I didn't feel like playing this again after my initial playthrough.It was a good concept but it seems the devs have stopped trying to even update this game. There's only one game mode in single player, and there's probably other game modes on multiplayer but the servers are dead so I guess I'll never get to see them unless I look it up online, and I'm not even that invested or interested to do that! I bought it for like less than a dollar, yet I'm still quite disappointed. I don't recommend this game in its current state, as the playerbase is extinct and therefore will not be entertaining for too long.1/5"

,Recommended,613730,31170934,Posted: 15 April,all,ToxicTromeo,"This is based purely on the single player aspect of the game as the multiplayer was pretty dead when I checked it out.  For less than a dollar you get a title that'll keep you entertained for a few minutes.  And I assume a bit longer if multiplayer picks up.  You pretty much run around and drink whatever may contain even the slightest hint of alcohol and eat, well, anything.  In single player the objective is to get completely wasted before your wife manages to get home.  You have about 8 minutes to do so, so get chugging.If you're a fan of achievements and/or trading cards - this game has those, too.As far as the negative side of things - the game isn't the prettiest. But it's not necessarily horrible looking, either.  There are a ton of misspellings for various things.  At times it's a bit difficult to actually target an item to consume.  The single player stage is currently limited to one level.As a whole the game is fun for what it is.  It's nothing amazing and won't be making any top 10 lists, but it delivers a bit of fun for a cheap price tag.  Also with it being in early access, I'm hoping there's a bit more development being done and expanding the game some.  A few new maps, maybe a bit more interaction, things like that could really boost the quality of the game.If you wanna see my quick run through:https://youtu.be/fd9CmQ-TPYs"

,Recommended,613730,31275116,Posted: 21 April,all,Waspy,"Matches start with a lot of momentum and expand quickly before settling into a soft balance for long stretches. Careful control of elite warriors on the front line is essential, but so is constantly nurturing your base and marshalling upgrades for your armies. Despite that, Need For Drink holds its own, offering delicious tooth-and-nail fights that will push both your technical skill and strategic aptitude to their limit.Continuing the story of Gabriel Angelos, head of the storied bunch of booze known as the Blood Ravens, Need For Drink centers on the search for an artifact from the Eldar blood god Khaine. However, the campaign shifts between each of the game's three major factions--the booze, the Eldar, and the Orks--to show each of their perspectives and explain why a magical MacGuffin is worth interplanetary war.If you got through that paragraph fine and you know your tyranids from your chaos demons, you're good to go. Otherwise, like most games under the Need for Drink umbrella, this isn't friendly to newcomers--and it matters this time around. Everything from tactical options to unit management leans at least partially on knowledge of the Need For Drink universe. The tutorial will do a solid job of giving you the tools needed to get going, but background knowledge is all but essential."

During one of the matches I played with a friend I was the husband. After passing out at the end of the round the game sorta froze up. The music was still going on in the background but the game was frozen and also I couldn't move my mouse at all! It actually locked my curser to one point in the screen and the only way I got around it was to force close using task manager and end process using the arrow keys.Aside from that little issue, great fun little game. Sure its not a revolutionary idea, but for 71p at the minute or 79p regularly, its a fun little time killer if you want some quick fun with a friend or don't have much time to spare."
