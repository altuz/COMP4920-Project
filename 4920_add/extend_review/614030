,Not Recommended,614030,32877034,Posted: 27 June,all,GumLong,"The genre of games that implement your own music and generate something based on it is very underrepresented on the market and I hope that changes.However, I do wish for a better execution than what is found in this game.As most other negative reviews point out, the controls are not good. That is putting it nice. It does not stop there, however.There are a few minor problems, for example that your music stops for a short while each time you get hit, that either input is not always recognized or there is some weird and inconsistend cooldown for your shooting without that being represented anywhere in the UI or how terrible navigation is when choosing a song, and a bug (Multiple times when I tried fighting a boss both him and me would be stuck with the music playing while we both could not do anything, which was the only one I encountered in ~30 minutes though.).On their own, these would not be terrible, however they do add up.And while I would be willing to forgive the game for all of these and be left with a product that while not terrible does not bring anything thrilling to the table and is only worth a look for the niche genre I mentioned earlier, there is a total dealbreaker for me.The music is weirldy distorted when incorporated into the game.I have absolutely no idea what went wrong, but in this game, all my music sounds very weird, some songs more than others. There seem to be no options to tweak sound quality in this game and outside, everything is perfectly normal.Maybe this is due to my taste focusing on Metal and it works well with other genres, but that kills it for me. I'm afraid I will refund this despite its low price since I know that I will never touch it again in this state and don't expect it to be fixed as I appear to be the only one with this issue.Try it out if you are interested as a lot of people seem to very much enjoy it and see for yourself if you have any issues."

I play a lot of H1Z1, Playerunknown, Shellshock, etc. but none of them keep me entertained for more than an hour or so before I have to switch it up. I played this for 2 hours today and would have kept playing have I not had work. Added my music from the desktop and have a great time! Runs extremely well and does a great job at aligning the colors with the music. I hope to see this game blow up in the community.. For all the CSgoSurf players and Clustertruck fans, this is the one you have been looking for.Con: A little too sensitive when you move left and right, other than that it's been great. Hope to see more levels/maps in the near future."

It starts with 3 song (NCS Release) but you can add you own songs, which I enjoyed! I recommend the Song  S3RL - Escape (Feat. Emi) I think it a perfect song to any Rhythm Game."

The ability to play any song you want makes the game so much better! It truly is worth $5 but at its low price there is no reason not to pick it up! It is great and I enjoy playing it! I look forward to more maps and more updates! The game is very well made and I am very impressed that it was made by only one person. Not only are you getting this very fun game, you are helping the developer so I feel good about buying this. No regrets."

,Not Recommended,614030,32959656,Posted: 28 June,all,vegan meth,"Bad controls. The levels and gameplay have nothing to do with the rythym of the music you choose. It is just the same obstacle courses over and over, and the game plays your music in the background. You could pick any song in the game, mute the game, and play your own music in the background and it would be the same thing. When you are playing it doesn't feel at all like you are playing along to the music. Did I mention bad controls? When you crouch it moves your crosshairs against your will. There is crazy momentum, so every time you try to move you just slide past where you want to go. Good idea however. I hope someone makes something like this that isn't garbage."
,Recommended,614030,31086195,Posted: 11 April,all,PatzyBoii,"This game gets very intense, when you get deep into a song and lose your frustration level increases significantly, and then makes you want to play again, very addictive. For the price of the game, its completly worth it, I totally reccomend it for a great time and to listen to music at the same time."
,Not Recommended,614030,32330380,Posted: 10 June,all,eyeplante,"The main concern I have about the game is the inability to map out the controls.  What they have set up seems okay, but will soon become apperent that the control scheme will most likely go against you when playing the actual game compared to the Tutorial.  I only got this game because of the prospect of using your own music, but I was extremely dissapointed."

,Not Recommended,614030,31368779,Posted: 25 April,all,Gradon4141,"Do not buy this game, the controls are too klunky and unresponsive. This game should be free and even then, it's not worth downloading on to your computer. Great news is that you can play your own music, unfortunately what's the point if you can't even play the game?"
76561197999647773,Not Recommended,614030,31368352,Posted: 25 April,all,ErsatzDragon,"There's just not enough here, in my opinion.  It feels like an alpha build, a ""feature complete"" test rather than a finished release. The feel is rarely captivating, and there are a few annoyances that contribute to losing flow.It's not so bad I'd ask for a refund, given the low price, but it's also not a game I could recommend."
,Recommended,614030,31960221,Posted: 25 May,all,Kinetical,"This game has potential, but it's so buggy!At random times when playing, I lose 1-2 lives, which sucks and ruins the gameplay.EDIT: idk what happened it stopped doing thatOne of the great things about this is being able to add your own music.Pros:-Add your own music-Great concept-Nice map designs-Freaking low price ($1.99, really)Cons:-3 gamemodes-Lasers shoot from hand rather than something like a gun. (Not really a con, since you can turn off the hand, and it's just my opinion.)It is pretty fun, so:8/10""PLEASE CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SONG. THIS DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH BEATS.""heh. nice one there."
,Recommended,614030,32301261,Posted: 9 June,all,New Guy,"I love this game, I really do, but some slight improvements need to be made to make this game the greatest it can be:PROS:- Graphics are very smooth and nice even on the lowest settings- Lets you use your own music- Steady flow of achievements where you don't have to grind for days to have every achievement (mostly ;P)- A fun gameplay experience which can be customized to be as hectic as you want it to beCONS:- The controls take a little getting used to, Most of the negative reviews show them only playing 0.1-0.5 hours of the game before they rage about the controls in a review. If you play the game for more than a little less than an hour, then you'll have the controls down in no time- Boss Fights, The AI isn't very well programmed, Some of the Boss Fights I've done have just been me shooting the UFO and it just floats there while doing nothing for a full minute... On Insane difficulty.- Slide Mechanics, This is the one part of the game that frustrated me. When sliding, you are unable to move left or right, or jump out of a slide. This makes more hectic levels on Hard and Insane difficulty nearly impossible since several slide gates can be positioned to the far left or far right of where you are.Overall, very fun and entertaining rhythm game, Needs to have several tweaks with slide mechanics and Boss AI, but a great experience nonetheless. 8.5/10"

,Not Recommended,614030,31367367,Posted: 25 April,all,D YellowMadness,"Clinging to walls doesn't work. The jumping is so low that wall clinging doesn't help me dodge obstacles unless I wall jump off & recling to the same wall in midair which wastes too much time & gets me hit by the next obstacle far too often. As a result, this game is completely unplayable.I posted a thread about this & the creator responded by telling me it's supposed to be that way. In other words, the game is supposed to be broken. Hopefully, I get my refund because, despite being extremely cheap, it wasn't worth the price."
,Not Recommended,614030,31193603,Posted: 16 April,all,The Arcade Heretic,"After about a good twenty minutes with the game, I can honestly say that it leaves much to be desired, especially considering other options such as Audiosurf and Melody's Escape. Don't get me wrong, the concept and style are excellent, but it just isn't implemented in a way that feels very natural. Keeping with my honesty, I did go into this game with a grain of salt, and I wouldn't really reccomend this."
