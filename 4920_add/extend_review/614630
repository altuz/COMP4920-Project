,Recommended,614630,34100956,Posted: 8 August,all,SnowMew~,"I've been playing the mobile version of this game and I were deeply impressed, just didn't have the storage for it. Now it's on Steam I was incredibly interested to buy it and try it. The £7 initial price might put off some people since it's F2P on mobile, but it makes up for it.For one there's no microtransactions so everything's reliant on just the ingame currency, and there's also no waiting times for upgrades for the train, and a whole new gumball system which relies on progress rather than just RNG. Though there's mroe interactivity and it feels kinda forced, for instance cars are now a constant drain on gold since they need maintenence, and earning gold form your train now requires you to click on it, it feels a lot more fun and enjoyable rather than just watching it. You still have access to the marketplace and you can still meet market demands to get some great bonuses.The pixel art always has been fantastic, and to see it scaled up nicely is a treat on the eyes. I've always liked the design of the trains and cars, since a lot of them stick to conventional designs whilst others show off a lot of cool creativity, and even mix and matching with a train or sticking to a theme is fun. There's a lot of neat characters to meet and Valarie is easily the best wiafu.If you're a fan of idle games or management you will enjoy this game, a lot. I've been watching it develop and every update is a treat. Watching the map expand more and more, who knows what's next. We haven't been to Australia yet, I think.tl;dr Good idle game about trains."
,Not Recommended,614630,34618851,Posted: 30 August,all,Bumblechubs,"Tiny Rails is a PC port of a mobile game of the same name. Similar to an idle game you spend most of the game doing absolutely nothing, and yet somehow despite costing ten dollars this game manages to have even less satisfaction than any other game in the samre genre.The story is the first thing you're thrust into, something that attempts to be charming but ends up being your typical 'there is another guy doing the thing you are doing and he is mean because he's doing it better grrrr but you're the good guys because you like green energy and your grandpa' pandering affair that has absolutely no impact on the game unless you count distracting your eyes as they roll so hard they risk coming out of their sockets. Mission objectives sit there and no matter how fast you are the story progresses the exact same. Quest cargo is invisible, so it has zero impact on the game world as well.The primary gameplay feature is your singular train. As you go between stations you accure passenger fares and have the option to buy and sell goods. These can be spent on ""gambling"" for new train cars, or purchasing upgrades. Gambling is in airquotes because every tier offers 1 engine, 1 caboose, and 5 cars all set and static, so you always know what you're going to get because they're the same things that everyone else bought. Your train is limited by number of cars and the weight of each car, but these limits are quite generous and you will rarely find yourself going over the weight limit even when you max out the number of cars you can run on your train at the same time. Engines and cabooses often have set bonuses, which range from completely overpowered [such as automatically maxing out entertainment or food happiness] or completely pointless [+5 speed, if your train is under 50% of its weight limit, where +5 means less than a 2% bonus]. Most cars are repeats of previous cars, you'll find tons of boring cargo cars in oil, water, and many varieties of fruit that are all essentially carbon copies of each other; surely, they existed only to pad the actual gambling feature of the mobile version. Cars can be leveled up several times and accrue experience as your train goes between stations while you are actively playing the game. You also have the option of double clicking your engine for a paltry speed bonus that goes away after a few seconds or if you open any menu element. Resources can also be used to craft unique train cars not available in the Gumball Machine; most seem to be absolute trash but I recommend the Turret Car because Utilities is a hard demand to meet.Trading is the staple of pretty much every train-based game that is actually a game. If you're looking for a cute version of Railroad Tycoon go somewhere else, for every single settlement in this game lacks any sort of dynamic needs and production system. Stations will request a single good up to a certain amount, upon which being provided you are given a pittance of a reward that often adds up to about a single stop's worth of passenger fares. Stations always generate the same spread of goods, around an hour or so, and never in any significant amount. Ergo, to meet the requirements of the larger stations you'll have to go around and just buy up everything available and either store it in your warehouse or sell off a little at a time. You can also upgrade stations, which range from very cheap to ludicrously expensive, and all get the same bonuses regardless of cost which is simply a monetary fee based on the size of the population at that station.The UI is atrocious. Hands down. UI elements will often get stuck enlarged, your currency will overwrite how many passengers you have, the screen will skip and jitter around as you try to select a train car in the train editor. If you have auto-depart turned on you can't even open the map at the 3 second break at each station. There's plenty of pointless busy-work in the UI that the developers also seem to think qualify as gameplay such as requiring you to scroll slowly to the back of your train to collect your fares else they disappear into nothingness, or opening the clean/repair screen to... clean and repair your train. There's no option to check the map when buying goods, there's very little control or information given when actually trading goods, mission goods will often swamp stations and prevent real goods from spawning as well. The game's framerate will also dip down into single digits per second while big rainstorms are occuring, which I discovered during the part of the story where I was delivering water to drought victims [hey guys we're the good guys yeah] and the text took almost a minute to parse. Oh, and the offline component of the game only works if you specifically turn it on in the options menu, so make sure you do that when you log out or you will lose out on up to 350,050 gold.I can't recommend this game. There are far better clicker/idle games out there that are free to play. If you consider the monument snapshotting and little secret clicking things to be gameplay [I don't], then there are also far better hidden object games out there as well. I'm normally very sensitive to the Skinner Box of idle progression games, but the only station Tiny Rails sends me to is Boring, which is apparently a real town."

Trying is going to be much better than reading 100 reviews.The mobile game is very good, casual, relaxing, and requires minimal interaction.The mobile version is dual currency and relies heavily on watching ads to progress and get gumballs. This PC version on the other hand does not offer and in-app purchases, is more interactive, offer more things to do, and gumballs are progress based instead of RNG.Paid $5 on mobile, and $7 more for this. Definitely would spend $12 for this game again rather than on 2 hamburgers."

The graphics are simple but pleasing with some nice effects particularly the moon.However there are quite a few bugs, the game froze three times and the graphics dropped out afew times. The worst ones were to do with the money system the amount you get paid for a journey seems to have little to with the number of passengers or the distance travelledand about ten percent of the time the payment either did not appear or went into the total and then disappeared.I would not let this put you off as the game is more addictive than Adventure Capitalist and hopefully the devs will sort it soon."

No micro transactions but why should it if I am paying $10. Early game is great just figuring how the game works and unlocking different cars. However, it quickly becomes boring and tedious. This is a game that you would check on before and after you start a gaming session. The cargo system is very cumbersome and the cargo depots are out of the way. Why can I only buy a limited number of items in each city? It takes for ever to collect enough resources to turn in. You either have a train with a lot of passenger carts to make money or cargo carts to complete demand in cities. Very grindy. It would be nice if you can unlock multiple of the same carts or at least make your train look uniform."

But the game is realy fun to play!Pro's-Fun and adictive gameplay-Fun strory. Its generic. But fun.-Lots of things to collect. God I love collecting things! I MUST COLLECT-Fun and cheap. The Phone version is free. But some game Machanics are diffrent on mobile devices.-Fun art style-The background in the game chances depending on where your driving whit your train. This makes the game alternately qual sight.-Easter eggs. Lots of Easter eggs. ( Not gonna spoil anything )-Large variation in railcars.Con's-Game progression slows down a lot after around a hour or so.-Making Money is a pain sometimes.-The Distances you sometimes need to make are to long. Causing long waiting times. This is a aspect from the phone version of the game. It should be tweaked is my opinion.-You cannot sort train cars out when looking trough your rolling stock. Making it difficult to look for certain train sets.-Is repetitive after a while.-The economy is kinda Is not well optimized. as you progress things cost so much that its more waiting then playing.My tips for Tiny Titan Studios-Add more tings to do when the train is driving long distances. So the player won't get bored that fast.-Add a way to sort trains on their speciality. Like Passenger, Food or cargo car.-Shorther waiting times when driving to diffrent stations.-More ways to make money.-Chance the economy and prices of things. It needs to be tweaked.-Is There a Tiny Titan Studios train in the game yet? Add that too. A littlle nod to Tiny Titans Studio!Oh one thing that I would love to see ingame.  it would be cool if you could let more trains run at the same time. because then you have something to actually mannage. I have all thse carts that I cannot use because my train cars that I can't use.being able to hop between trains via the map would be cool. And it would make the gameplay more intersting.TIny Titans Studio created a game that has a good base for further devolpment. I can't wait see see what things they bring to this game in the future."
,Recommended,614630,34134390,Posted: 9 August,all,Chibikuma,"I've stumbled across this game on mobile awhile ago and fell in love with it! It's definitely one of the rare games that kept my interest for a long time and still not done with it! You know you're serious about a game when you start finding yourself making excel spreadsheets for in game info (yes I made one for it! lol)I bought this PC version on day one and I gotta say I'm loving it even though I've already played and own the mobile version. There are lots of changes compare to the mobile version and so far they are all good changes. Not saying the mobile isn't good but it makes the game a bit different and not just a copy/port of it. Given that this is still in early access, I'm very curious to see what the devs have in store for future updates etc. Thanks again devs for making this game and hope to see great things for it!"
76561198008734431,Recommended,614630,34330569,Posted: 18 August,all,vonduus,"Hi TinyTitans, it is a dangerously addictive little game you have come up with!!!! I just played 24 hours in a row, before I fell asleep on my keyboard. I don't remember last time I got so addicted so quickly to a computer game. Civilisation 1, perhaps, your game has the same ""just one more station, then I quit"" quality.But instead of focusing on what is good about the game - which is almost everything - I will just come with a few suggestions, as the pc version is still early access:- put the money from passengers in the engine, and not in the caboose; when you get a very long train it gets annoying to have to scroll all the way back to access your newly earned money. (Especially because there is a glitch, where the graphics (not the HUD, but the train) sometimes disappear while dragging the screen around. It is easily solved: Go to the main menu and push ""continue"", and you are back on track - until next time the glitch occurs).- let cleaning and repair be automatic (perhaps as an option), in the long run it gets annoying to have to click not only one, but two buttons twice every 200 kilometers, and perhaps let cleaning and repair be more expensive - right now it is dead cheap, so why not repair and clean the train, when your passengers so obviously like it? or give me a reason NOT to repair and clean the train, and I will perhaps think a bit more of it, right now it is just a no-brainer so it becomes a pain to have to push these buttons all the time. Or at least combine them into one button that I click once every now and then, instead of hiding them in a submenu, where you have to click two times two buttons, first to choose repair or clean, then to choose ""all"", and then one more time for the other option.- also the trainopedia could need a little love, especially some more intuitive sorting options,- also the train editor would benefit from a scrollable carousel, using the mouse wheel to scroll through the vehicles (like in WoT), and it would be so very nice to be able to sort your trains, so that related wagons show up together with their related engine and caboose- the missions tend to be the same, at a certain point I had five different mission set by the woman engineer, who asked me to have the train travel at five different very high speeds, all of them far beyond my possibilities in the early gameAnd that's it, I think, I have no more bad things to say about your game. The graphics are just awesome, if you are to retro pixel art, and the challenge of getting the right merchandise to the right station is a classic time waster. After 24 hours I am still stuck in the US of A, but I can see, that there is a whole world waiting for me, as soon as I get enough money to buy some of the more expensive stations so I can begin to make some big bucks.I can heartily recommend this little gem of a game!!! But beware, it is highly addictive in a way, I did not expect."

76561198056471030,Recommended,614630,34991576,Posted: 16 September,all,ondra.kurin,"If there was an option to give a neutral review, I would. There will be more cons than pros in the review, some a bit nitpicky, as I'm hoping the devs will listen to some of them, but overall I still like this game, it is better than the mobile version at least.+ Nice pixel art graphics+ Good diversity of engines and train cars, including some rather out-there creations+ No microtransactions+ Stable, hadn't have a crash yet.+ Very playable at its current state, though there are a few bugs and glitches.+ All upgrades and gumball rolls are instantaneous.- There is not much to do while traveling between stations, especially when they are more than 300 km apart. Having more than one train would improve this issue while requiring next to no rebalancing, as you would still be limited by the amount of cars you have, and high level gumball cars are expensive. Plus, you're supposed to be a train company and what train company would have only one train?- The scenery frequently does not match reality, it shows mountains where lowlands are, like the Baltic, while not showing mountainous terrain in the Alps. Sometimes it also shows stations that should be in cities outside of cities, so don't be surprised to find Indianapolis in a swamp.- Maps of certain regions (North America and Europe especially) consist of a loop connecting the cities with few if any other connections between them, which means you have to take some ridiculuous detours while traveling, like from Southampton to London via Galway and Edinburgh, or London to Paris via Amsterdam and Zurich, or Atlanta to Montgomery via Miami, or Milan to Rome via either Lisbon and Barcelona or Athens and Valetta. Russia, Mexico and East Asia (Japan and Koreas) have fewer of these network gaps.- Many cool engines require 100% region completion to obtain which takes a lot of time and money.- Many cities are not there. While I'm certainly not expecting all big cities to be there, some are rather big omissions, like Venice, Lyon, Manchester, San Diego, Veracruz, Munich, Gdynia, Linz, Thessaloniki, Varna, or Cologne. At its current state, Europe is pretty empty, which certainly does not reflect reality, as it should be full of cities close to each other.- As yet there haven't been many updates, but I will give the devs the benefit of the doubt for now, as they are working on adding the missing regions, which takes time.- Engines do not level up, which means that their patterns/colors stop matching that of their respective cars once you level those cars up.- All engines sound the same, no diesel produces any smoke, electric engines do not show any effect either."

And that's not to say this game is an Idle game, because trust me, you can actively play it for hours on end, but, it can also be played as an Idle game. And I absolutely love it for that.Granted, it has some glitches and bugs, but what do you expect from an Early Access game? Sometimes the screen turns light blue and everything in the HUD (including the train) disappears. Restarting the game fixes this issue, though. And I have only run into it 3 or 4 times.And sometimes some money disappears (i.e. earning 1000 bucks, but only getting like 200, despite your vault not being full), but those are minor bugs.The graphics look cool, the conversion from mobile to PC looks good and the slight changes to get it to work as a PC game are amazingly done.I absolutely recommend it, if you love casual games that relax you instead of stress you out.Thumbs up!"

Going from station to station takes a long time and you just repeatedly click the same food cart not to lose money during the first hour. The aquisitions of the cars is through the gumball machine, which would add a nice randomness, if you didn't need to complete a set of specific cars before unlocking the next set.I can see how this would be good on a mobile device while on a train or bus to work or something, but not fun enough for me to enjoy it while I'm home on my few hours off I can play on weekends.

I actually love this game but decided to mock irreputable reviews of other games with this review.ReviewFirst off ignore every single negative review because they are lying fools paid off by the AAA game industry to sabotage smaller devs, or have never played a proper sim game before.I first fell in love with this game on mobile, and nearly a day later swung out the 9.99 to buy it on steam.This is a fantastic game with a lot of humor, the script is very well written, and there are a ton of pop culture refernces, oh yeah the scenery is drop dead gorgeus too.To be honest my only gripe about this title is that both versions have an idle mode which the game could really do without, especially when there is so much to look at on the journeys. The devs obviously put a lot of work into the railside scenery so why they would put in an idle mode which allows you to quit the gameand misssome of that said scenery is beyond me.PC or mobile?Honestly both of these versions have a different flavor from one another. The mobile version is free, but does have microtransactions (which are thankfully non-intrusive), but does seem a bit less fleshed out despite coming out before the PC version.The PC version is arguably the best of the two, being more fleshed out, and having more features such as train maintenence (which I actually like unlike those players who are too lazy to repair their trains until the last minute).So honestly take your pick.GameplayThis is a game that i consider a strat/sim game, there is a lot of grinding involved here that wouldn't be too out of place in your typical JRPG, if you want to get money faster I would suggest going for items such as Steel, which while pricey cargo items generally net a solid profit. You upgrade your train through the UI, and get cars through a gumball machine,There is also passenger happiness that you should keep tabs on should you want to go about making profits that way, however it is much more harder to make a profit off of passengers than lugging cargo around, and a smart player (like me) would haul both cargo, and passengers.As i stated before there is an idle component which is quite ill concieved, but thankfully it isn't as intrusive in the PC version as it is on mobile.Score9/10"

Gathering the new gold currency from the train cars and maintenancing (clean and repair) the train cars is a bit tedious, but it keeps you occupied while waiting for the train to get from point A to point B...So far, my only complaints are that there is no 200% speed option at each station now (costs 5 diamonds or an ad view on mobile), and the PC specs on the store page don't specify that you need 64-bit Windows to play...In my opinion, it is well worth the $10 to get a game that will one day be a full and complete game that goes far above and beyond it's original mobile counterpart...tl;dr -- If you have 64bit Windows, you should buy this game..."

Just a strange game play interaction with no work around that I could find."

If this is your first time playing it, you will love it.Overall, Comparing it to it's origin, the phone app, this version is... different. I wouldn't say worse, but I would not say any better.Major Pluses For Steam -1. No In-app purchases, Just the 1 payment and you get the whole game.2. No ads, really just no mobile game B.S.Unfortunatly, There are a few downsides from my perspective.They include -1. The train gets damaged and dirty, which requires constant cleaning. ( Advertised as an exciting new feature, but it is really just an annoyance that requires constant work )2. You can only get 1 of each train car, which makes the gumball machine feel less exciting when you get that really rare, cool car. It's just 1/5 for each of the levels. It really detracts from the excitement value of the cars in my opinion. I remember playing the app, and being beyond happy, when I finally rolled a rare car, this game has absolutely no value in the train cars.3. The amount you can get while logged out is less than it was on the app. You have to constantly keep checking up on it.All in all, it is similar to the app, but not really. It would have been MUCH better, if it ran just like the phone app, with the ability for the paid cars to show up randomly in the gumball, and left it at that. The whole addition of the gumball levels, ruined the excitement of the entire game for me. I suggest, if you have the ability to, download the app instead of buying the steam game. I loved this game on the app, and it's feeling still carries over a little, which is why I will still give it a thumbs up, but it is very close to not being so."

,Recommended,614630,34245084,Posted: 14 August,all,Bitcherina,"Basically rewriting this whole review as I originally said I didn't recommend, because of a major bug.There WAS a giant bug with the area progress where you could only see overall & distance traveled/passengers served/etc were all stuck at 0. However the bug has been hotfixed! Gone!!With that out of the way, the game is great, casual fun! Perfect for people who like collecting-quest type games. You collect different train cars & specific ones can give you different train effects. You take on jobs to go specific routes, and trade certain cargo items. The pixel art is super cute & the sounds are satisfying to listen to. If you get tired of hearing the train engine (I sometimes do), you can just scroll a little farther down the train & the sound is quieter, which is where I prefer my restaurant/shop cars.There are still a few little bugs, but they're very minor & with how responsive Tiny Titan has been about the first bug (fixed within days), I'm sure everything will get fixed in time. I know most people are wary of early access steam games these days, but I don't think you'll be wasting your time with this one."
,Recommended,614630,34164732,Posted: 11 August,all,coloradogambit,"A very thoughtful PC-adaption of a fantastic mobile game. The game promises a lot of fun. My problem with the mobile version was, that the ways where getting too long. Future in-game-progress will show, if the PC-Version fixed the issue. The price ist totally ok, you get many, many hours of gameplay for your bucks. And the pixel-art is just fantastic. At the moment there seems no possibility to upgrade your favorite engine, but the car-update-system works perfectly and is much better than the 3-level-update-possibilities in the mobile version.Tipp: Don't ""waste"" all of your gold on the car-unlocking, buy (cheap) stations and upgrade them to get more gold at the beginning. You'll see that it doesn't take long to get a decent amoung of gold. Still, I hope to unlock my beloved Silver Steam soon :-)"

I enjoy playing it while browsing Reddit, and sometimes even just play it without multi-tasking. It has many new features over th mobile version and no microtransactions. You can manage the ticket prices, all upgrades are unlockable with coins, etc.$10 is definitely a reasonable price for this game, and I don't regret buying it at all."

,Recommended,614630,34264500,Posted: 15 August,all,Kit,"There is a bit of a shortage of casual relaxing games on Steam - ones that can last a really decent amount of time.  This looks like it has the potential.It is built to have the look and feel of Stardew Valley.  The artwork style isn't my favourite, but it is nice enough.The premis is to go around stations delivering passangers and buying and selling cargo.  You get to put different carriages that have different statistics - such as better entertainment / cargo capacity / passanger capacity etc.The progression speed is about right in the game - I still haven't reached 50% competion in the first area after 10 hours and I'm fine with that.  I do want the game to last, and I'm not in a hurry.  This is a game I want to play in the evening to relax and switch off.A few problems:- Going between stations is a bit too slow, although it gets better with time as you buy speed upgrades- There isn't enough active things to do while the train is rolling between stations.  You click the repair and clean buttons sometimes, and if you have money collecting carriages you click on them now and then to collect coins.  There are some special things to click such as rare passing helicopters, but it gives you a reward the first time and then never again.I feel like I need more things going on to enjoy this as an active casual game.  Such as some birds landing on the carriages that need to be shooed away otherwise they make it dirty at a faster rate, perhaps mopping dirty spots that I can see rather than one button to click, clicking individual wheels that make sparks etc.  And some small bonus things to collect in the background such as clicking flying geese to collect some eggs that have some sort of long-term collection bonus.- There are passanger conversations that pop up.  One face appears and say 1-2 words and another face appears to give a 1 word response.  I don't really think much of them - they seem to detract rather than add to the game.Despite those problems it's enjoyable enough to play in the current state.  There are a few obvious bugs around, but from developer responses it looks like they will be cleaned up soon enough."

,Recommended,614630,34638730,Posted: 31 August,all,Poutini,"A fun little way to pass the time. It looks great and plays great with a simple interface. Maybe still needs a little work in places though-- pretty sure even Vermont doesn't get snow on July 3rd. And as an Oregonian who has ridden between the two I'm pretty sure the train ride from Sacramento to Portland isn't sandy beaches and palm trees right up until you hit city limits...My biggest gripe though is that it straddles the line too much between an idle game and an active game. Would be nice if either time could pass about 50% faster or vaults were about 50% larger. Preferably the former, as I'd rather play the game than ""check on it"" here and there."

,Recommended,614630,34725224,Posted: 3 September,all,BritishRabbit,"For £7 this is an alright game.I won't lie, it's very mobile-esque (granted it is completely devoid of any micro-transactions) and it is VERY grindy and if you don't put all effort into upgrading your caboose's gold storage things become problematic.However if you need something fun, casual and pretty easy to play with the added fun of getting to put your own train together from a variety of sensible and downright wacky carriages then definitely give it a try. It's barely more expensive then a meal from McDonalds and you'll get far more mileage out of it.Also as an added plus it has a train in it that's basically a copy of the A4 Mallard and although it's not shown on the screenshots above its tender is in fact one of the carriages you can unlock. (In fact you unlock it before the train itself I believe.)"

I originally came across it about two weeks ago after watching a video on it and decided it looked fun and worth the ten dollars. After I booted up the game for the first time, I fell in love with it. The 16-bit art style is amazing and although there are only two pieces of music in the game, they are wonderful. Although there are a few bugs, the music gets a bit repetitious after a while and it can get a bit grind heavy, I still love the game and personally  give it a 90/100."
