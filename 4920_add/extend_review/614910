,Recommended,614910,32861172,Posted: 27 June,all,Papa Wasi,"Perfect game for keeping my hands busy while listening to audio books or watching videos. It drops all achievements within a few minutes, has tradable stickers and it's cheap. The only improvement I can think of is a scalable windowed mode to make it fit better with other windows, but that's pretty minor. 9.5/10"

Unfortunately the game is too hard for me or I haven't figured out yet how to turn the double tiles vertically. But for achievements it's pretty easy. You can unlock all 118 even on the first attempt since the multiplier is insanely high to reach the neccessary 1.600 points. So after 5 min the fun was over."

Rules of game are simple combine your monster cakes to get highest score as possible. This game also features steam inventory items, you get 3 stickers per day by playing game.Features:- 118 achievements- Trading Cards- Fun- Steam Inventory Items- Leaderboards- Great soundThere are also some bugs such as:- Movement feels clunky and sometimes pieces don't match properly- Packs sometimes need minute or 2 to unpackRating: 7.8/10"
,Recommended,614910,34969693,Posted: 15 September,all,Helevorn,"I never write reviews for super short/achievement collecting/card farming games, and this is clearly one of these ones, but it has actually a concept that could have been developed way better and still it's playable - of course, most of the achievement collecting games are supposed not to be played, but to be idled (or to perform something dumb 1000 times).It's basically a match-3 game with new tiles emerging from uniting 3 tiles of the same color, and you can only put new tiles of 2 different colors at a time, just like domino.It's nice to play even though it's of course a stupid game full of flaws, I can't review it negatively or (worse) forget about this completely, could have been a lot better but it's worth those 0,20€ you get with your medal-completing discount!Funny thing. This game has 118 achievements, which is in my country (Northern Italy) the emergency medical service number (911 for Americans? XD)"

,Recommended,614910,32965025,Posted: 28 June,all,boosted [<o>],"Instant achievements, if you've played this type of game before you'll probably enjoy it. It looks cheap and there are probably free apps that do it just as well if you just want this type game.Its a game by name but it seems more like a vessel to showcase achievements and the unnecessary virtual items you can buy through it.If you want the showcase buy it, if you want a game like this just find something online or download an app for your phone.Again, it looks very cheap and there are probably more proffesional looking options out there."
76561198004190775,Recommended,614910,32702989,Posted: 23 June,all,MissMardybum,"This is a cute little game where you match 3 or more blocks to change it to another colour, till it gets to final color and pops the surrounding squares. Object of game is to see how high you can score without boxing yourself in.Game gets easier once you know the pattern of colour they change to next after matched up.Nice simple game to 'lose' some time to.Also super easy achievements, all based on score - i completed them without realising/trying."
,Recommended,614910,34477364,Posted: 25 August,all,Flying Shisno,"Like the description says, a cross between Match 3 and 2048. You don't slide them around the board, but when you match 3(or more) those pieces upgrade to a single tile of the next level. I believe it goes: Skull, Purple Thing, Green, Blue, Red, Jack-O-Lantern, and Reindeer. When you match 3 Reindeer, all tiles surrounding the Reindeer you placed are destroyed, clearing space, and you gain a power-up tile that can be placed at any time. These either clear the entire row, entire column, row+column, adjacent diagonals, or all surround adjacent tiles depending on which you get.My only gripes are that you can get all 118 achievements in like 5 minutes, though I think the Letter Achievements were a bug. And that you can't save and quit, which I find annoying.I definitely recommend this to any puzzle, match 3, or 2048 fan."

I got it for 50 cents during the summer sale, and made a small profit off of it.Pro’sAchievements are all unlocked just for running the game.Free drops per day, 3 in total.Free steam card that sell for 8-12 cents each (ATM at least).Nice time killing game, if you’re bored enough.Con’sPictures sometimes will not stick to the board without a few try’s.No real tutorial, but it’s easy to figure out.If you like matching games then this one is simple enough, game isn’t the best, but it’s not the worst either.You can sell the steam items or collect them if your into that."

,Recommended,614910,35472280,Posted: 4 October,all,GlockTheDoor,"Fun game, though the tile registry is slightly off. I've had several occasions where I go to drag a set of tiles, and it places it in a different spot (usually 1-2 spots away from where I dragged), causing me to lose. The game itself is fun, though. They just need to smooth out that tile registry and I'd consider playing it more."
