,Recommended,614950,33900909,Posted: 30 July,all,Real,"I usually never buy games on early access,  but I have to say that this one totally worth it. Right now you have access to the whole first island which represents 12 levels. This game is a clever puzzle platformer with a retro 8 bits aestethic that reminded me of course Super Mario, but also somewhat Metal Gear Solid and Rick Dangerous. Each level is quite short, but if you want to get the Jars (there is one on each level), you will have to find how, and this is pretty rewarding.Pros:Great clever level designAwesome music tracks, with a B-movie feelNice pixel art and funny sprites, also 8-bits rag-dolls and good physicsCon:The game mechanics were not very manifest the first time I played despite the tutorialI don't see any other Con to list, apart maybe the price of 1$, because this game totally worth 4x the price."

I am using the Xbox 360 controller and it works flawlessly, movements are precise.  This platformer is like a black Mario with guns.  The levels and music/sounds fit well togeather.  With 50 levels for less then $1.00, Shootout on Cash Island is definately worth it and deserves a lot more attention in the indie world, there might be more levels added also.  This game is better then a lot of indies that are 5-10 times the price.  10/10"

,Recommended,614950,32932938,Posted: 28 June,all,Stevie Scoop,"Shootout on Cash Island is a casual side scrolling shooter. The game draws from any sides scroller you can think of (i.e mario, duke nukem, donkey kong, etc) and it has elements of puzzle solving.What you see in this trailer is pretty much what you get with this game (but that's not a bad thing). The action is fast paced, the art style suits the game well and the difficultly progesses at a nice even pace throughout the game, introducing new items and weapons. Using the weapons was very satisifying especially when there were was lots of action.What we feel this game is lacking is levels that force the player to be uncomfortable. While there were moments that did this, the game pushed the pace back into your hands which felt like the adrenaline was over. Also, while there are different varations of enemies we found they got repetitive.Obviously still this game is in early access and the delevopers Quantized Bit have done an awesome job at building a solid base for this game. The hours we have on log is pretty much the time it took us to finish the game, but needless to say we are looking forward to seeing what else this game has in store. Had a lot of fun playing this game, we play a lot of Steam games and we think we got our monies worth.For some casual gameplay check out our video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH07XUBWQeM- BIg Fams Gaming"

Constantly having to restart from the beginning makes it tedious, and not being able to take on a lot of the enemies makes it annoying when this game could be pure fun.Check out my Let's Play:https://youtu.be/jMXDv22Inj8"
76561198030367984,Recommended,614950,32184573,Posted: 4 June,all,ExaltedDuck,"At time of writing this, the game is still in early access and has 11 levels.  I really can't wait for more.  I've played the other games from this dev, Prison Run and Gun and Hot Guns, and I've loved both.  This one plays very similarly to both but the level design is sort of a medium between the two.  Prison Run and Gun was a find-the-widget-to-unlock-exit style of sidescolling puzzle game.  Hot Guns was a shoot-through-several-sub-levels-to-beat-a-world kind of game.  Cash Island has the shorter style of level like Prison Run and Gun but with the more sidescroller/platformer type of level design of Hot Guns.  It's a really happy middle gound.  The game itself is very true to the trailers.  If they look like something you'll enjoy, you probably will.  The controls are very tight and the music is excellnt (kind of a late 80's/early 90's funk and synth rock vibe).  Overall, the gameplay falls into the very delicate balance of being fun yet challenging, with repeated deaths usually evoking laughter instead of frustration.  I hope this dev keeps up the amazing work.  All three of these games bring me right back to the joy and comfort of the warm glowing CRT television that was my usual afterschool companion so many decades ago."
