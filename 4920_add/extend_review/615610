,Recommended,615610,32784281,Posted: 25 June,all,combatsheep4,"I bought this game in the sale because I really enjoy playing Bit Blaster XL for a few minutes when im bored. I have high opinions of Bit Blaster and saw this game hoping for something similar.I may sound negative here but lets start with the poistives:PROS:-Great gameplay- Gameplay is smooth with no bugs to my knowledge and sensitive controls-Very aesthetically pleasing-Good level design- has some depth with the incoming planetsNow for the criticism.CONS:-The gameplay is repetetive after 20 games and you've seen all the mechanics-There is only 1 song (a good one albeit)-Unlocking new player planets has no purpose. By the last 20 minutes, I was just grinding points to unlock the last few expensive planets so I could get all the steam achievements.All of these cons arent in Bit Blaster because of its depth. In BB there is reason to play again because of the random elements, there is reason to grind for coins because the ships do things differently, and there is a different soundtrack for every ship.If you could implement these changes in some update, that would be fantastic, and probably make this game as enjoyable, if not more enjoyable than Bit Blaster.Overall I do believe this game has a lot of potential and was worth the 39 pence I spent on it for an hours gameplay.TL;DR, If you have a choice, get Bit Blaster XL instead, but this is still a fun little game"

,Recommended,615610,34183049,Posted: 11 August,all,Endyo,"There's not a great deal that can be said about Orbt XL, and that is probably the best thing about it.  There's no frills here, nothing to weigh you down or give you anything to think about.  Orbt XL is, simply put, an arcade game, but even that might imply there's more to it than the single button it takes to play.What you do:Well first you pick your control method.  You're only using one button, but you have to decide if you want that to be your left mouse button, the space on your keyboard, or, my favorite, the A button on my  Xbox controller.   Once you've managed to make that tough decision, you get into the real meat of the game.  Your objective is to orbit around a black hole as many times as possible without a) falling in or b) running in to the many things hurdling toward that very black hole.  Each successful circumnavigation nets you one whole point.  As you orbit, you fall continually toward your demise.  This is where that shiny button comes in.  When you press it, you move away from the black hole in the center and your orbit widens.  Getting closer to the black hole has you moving faster around the orbit and thus gaining points more quickly, but this also gives you less control and room to maneuver as the other celestial objects rain inward.  The objects you're dodging have a variety of sizes, speeds, and special traits.  For instance, some may explode creating small black holes that function like temporary land mines.  Others instantly change your orbiting direction and can be very disorienting.  So even as you get better at the game, you're going to keep running in to new obstacles that shake things up and make it hard to rack up that score.It sounds simple in writing, and in practice it's not really any more complex, but doing well is very challenging.  I immediately had flashbacks to the craziness of Flappy Bird with the single button tapping for avoidance and instant death of collision.  In a way, I think this game pushes some of the same addictive (and sometimes anger inducing) qualities of that game.  Except here as you progress and gain points, they are added to a pool that can be used to unlock new orbs/planets for you to take control of.  So even if you aren't keen on just getting high scores, you can also work toward achieving these neat little cosmetic goals.  Yet the principle nature of the game seems to be just working on your score and enjoying it.  You can easily jump in and play for 30 seconds or sit here for 30 minutes trying to do better.  It's a tough thing to do well, but one that feels really rewarding when you finally catch on.What else is going on:Visually, what you see in the screenshots is the majority of the game.  Only the cosmetics you can swap in really make any difference.  Sound is forgettable, but adequate.  My only real gripe with this game is that it literally features one song, and it's not all that great (or at least it isn't for the short duration that you often get to hear it).  I kind of wish that it was like this developer's other title, Bit Blaster XL, where every ship features it's own song.  It would be a tall task and probably an expensive one to have each cosmetic orbiter have its own song, but it would add a lot if there were even a few other songs in the game to shake things up.Do I recommend this?Yes, definitely.  It's a great little arcade game to jump in to and tally up a score.  You get a leaderboard with both global and friends and, if nothing else, you get a nice little time waster.  The most it can set you back is one US dollar and in just about any sale you can pick it up for half of that.  Just like with Bit Blaster, you'd pay more for 30 seconds in an arcade these days.  If you pick up enough games like this, load them up on a custom arcade box and you'll be the hit of your living room.If you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EndyoGaming#curation"

The mechanic is addicting in a 'one-more-round' kind of way. There is a nice little unlock system that is quite satisfying. And then you have your achievements and low asking price.I like that every little aspect is clever and is clearly well thought out. It's the simple things - like how it shows ahead of time a warning for where the meteor is coming from. Also, time slows down when you play it safe in the outer rings. That's cool. Easy to learn, impossible to master.Good title that is fun in quick play sessions or during 'pass-the-controller' parties."

,Recommended,615610,33102377,Posted: 1 July,all,MPO,"After the developer kindly responded to my negative review, I decided to buy a second copy and give the game another chance.  I spent an hour and got a high score of 93 while earning all of the achievements.  This will probably be the most informative review you'll find.Things I liked:- The graphics are well-made and very pleasant to look at.- The gameplay fantasy, which is spontaneously and creatively drawing lines with your orbiting planet while balancing risk and reward, feels great and fresh when achieved.- The variety and strong effects of projectiles make play exciting and surprising.- The inclusion of many unlockable skins, which are fun, referential, and look great.- The music eventually becomes very intense and exciting.- The achievements provide good goals for you to have.Things I didn't like:- The initial experience is repulsively repetitive on several levels.1. You earn more points by being closer to the black hole, and there are discrete tiers of distance from it.  The closest tier is right next to the black hole, and you can stay there by simple button-mashing.  It strongly perverts the core fantasy of the game, turning it into a clicker.  This becomes less of a problem when more projectiles show up, but early gameplay feels cheap and tiresome as a result.2. The music begins with a highly repetitive and cheaply produced loop that lasts until you get 30-40 points.  It detracts from the early experience, and amplifies the feeling of repetitive, cheap gameplay described above.  The player is fooled into thinking that this is all there is.3. The sound effects can be grating to hear, but they also become less offensive with time.- There is a small bug where theDogeplanet doesn't fully load its graphics.Orbt XL does not put its best foot forward, and may not have lasting power.  But overall, the good outweighs the bad.  Therefore, I now recommend Orbt XL, and thank the developer for being classy."

It might seem very easy at the beginning but things pick up pretty quickly. It takes a little while to get the hang of it, but once you do you'll be zooming around and weaving between planets. I put repetitive for a 'con' because some people may hate just doing the same thing over and over again. Personally I liked it, to see if I could get further then I did before. Now, I am not proud of it but this game caused me to rage quit a couple times. If you are looking for a good, cheap game that's pretty enjoyable then I would recommend this game.This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curationIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

Played tons of this on Mobile and it is nice to be able to play this on my laptop. When you're waiting on servers to reboot or install software nothing is better than a pick up and play game like this.Nickervision studios hits home again with another great title that both doesn't break the bank or shy away from being challenging and incredibly captivating.

Certainly not like any game I've played before. The cosmetics are fun (spot that plumbus) and give a larger goal to work towards, which is nice.My major criticism is that the difficulty can vary incredible from one run to the next, some of them you'll be hit with little in terms of obstacles for a large amount of time, while others will slam you with unavoidable obstacles within the first fifteen seconds.Dev seems like a really nice guy, he pops up on Reddit a bit and seems passionate about what he's doing. Game gets more attention from the dev than many AAA titles do, and I think that's a really great thing. Hope to see some larger/deeper games from this guy in the future, maybe some mobile ports of these games as well."

However, I think I like the steam version more. It's fun to kick back with a controller and just play. It's also great if your waiting on matchmaking, or other similar things. Also I have to give major props to the developer. He's a really awesome guy, who's just very passionate about making these kinds of games! Through all of the numerous minecraft rip offs, flappy bird clones, and generally buggy, awful games. His series of games stands out as a diamond in the rough. And I mean, for a dollar, its pretty hard to not reccomend it. The only complaint I really have is that there seems to be a bug on the menus, where sliders will drop down without even touching them.Gameplay is simple, yet fun and rewarding. Essentially, you pilot a planet that orbits around a black hole. You gain a point for every time you make a full circle. The closer you get to the hole, the faster you go around, but the hole will suck you in if you gettooclose. There are different astroids that get thrown at you, some are big and go slow, some are small and will shoot out at you. Some create mini black holes, and some make you go backwards. You really have to plan ahead to make sure you don't run into the asteroids, as simple as it seems, when you get 25+ points, they really start coming down.Graphics: 8/10 - Simplistic and cartoonish look without being ridiculousGameplay: 9.6/10 - Pretty much a perfect example of a laid back, fun game with interesting mechanics.Music: 7.5/10 - Gets you hyped to play and keep going, but it repeats a lot and gets a little repetitive for longer sessions.Value: 10/10 - Honestly for a little under a dollar, you can't go wrongSeriously, if this looks like your kind of game, and you have at least a dollar to spare. Pick it up you won't be dissapointed.OVERALL SCORE: 9.3/10"

76561198275056869,Recommended,615610,31613874,Posted: 7 May,all,Scott-E-Cheese,"I believe this to be the second game from this dev that I have reviewed, and again I have found it quite fun. Short rounds on a simple concept that provides you with a good little timewaster. Also there are plenty of achievements for people who like getting those, and they arent too difficult. Plus, it's cheap.Only negative is that the planets you unlock are merely reskins, it would be nice to have seen certain powers unique to certain unlocks, like the blackhole being able to absorb planets you run into, instead of just exploding like everything else, and possibly also make it necessary for you to do so as if you dont you will just shrink away into nothingness, or having the planets be different sizes.Apart from that it is fine, the beta holds a bit more content (changing rotation after each respawn, and a new planet) so probably use that to play."
76561198099704746,Recommended,615610,32796605,Posted: 25 June,all,Terrahex,"Orbt XL is practically perfect. It's such a simple concept executed to such a great degree that it really is almost perfect.Playing a planet cirling a black hole and avoiding asteroids coming in from every direction doesn't sound that hard, but it's surprisingly difficult to wrap your head around the circular orbit (no pun intended), and much of the challenge comes from planning where your planet will be ahead of time while figuring out what each new type of asteroid does before they manage to kill you.The only negative point I could probably make about it is that the music is pretty forgettable and inconsequential. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's annoying. It doesn't distract you while playing the game. Every time you die, its pitch lowers an octave or two and slows down to help take some of the sting away, but better music would probably improve the experience.The visuals are also very nice. the colors are bright and make everything pop easily against the blue of the background sky, and the stars being pulled into the black hole while you're trying to survive are a nice touch to make everything feel more intense.The game is so fun and simple, and not a word of tutorial needs to be spoken for you to understand what you need to do. It doesn't have a lot of gameplay to offer, but I believe it's worth the price, especially if you get it on sale. It'll easily waste a good ten or fifteen minutes of your time, and you'll be racking up points before you know it."

Then again, Bit Blaster is a much more in depth game. Both are casual arcade, but this is even more casual. This is the most gripping game that uses one button. I think my favorite part about the design of this game is that it stays casual without resorting to dirty tricks. No microtransactions, noskinner boxes. Just you, skill, and some time to kill.Only complaint I can think of is that the circular planets should be a bit higher in poly count, but then again this was originally meant to run on mobile.While I'd go for Bit Blaster XL first, if you want more of this man's games, then this is a good next step, and for the price of $0.99, and on sale (as of this review) for $0.49, I'd say this is a much more value purchase, than the one credit cost of a run of Cruisin' USA for $.50 at my local pizzaria (which isn't a bad way to spend $10 before you realize it.)"

And when the player doesn’t hold down the game’s one button, the Earth orbts in towards said black hole; while when the player holds the button, the Earth orbits away from the same, big, naughty black hole.I like black holes, for the record. Holes in general.And because it may seem like my taste for holes may be coloring my opinion, I want to take this moment to emphasize that that’s not why I’m recommending this game. Though, if you like holes the way I do, then there’s that.The game also features an excellent scoring system, and various deadly objects hurtling straight towards that beautiful black hole. Meanwhile, said scoring system works by awarding you points at a faster rate the closer you are to said hole, which is in the center of everything, the screen that is. And, ratcheting up the thrills, is that orbting close to the hole is dangerous, if you know what I mean ;)I mean that you could get so mesmerized by the hole’s beauty that you fail to hold down the button, and thus get sucked in, ending your run. Plus, when you’re orbting close to the hole (which is the center of all that matters) you have less Space to dodge incoming Space Matter, with which near misses award you extra points, but with collision destroying the Earth.And all this is brilliant, both in a gameplay sense and in a meaning sense.For the Earth is our home. It is our existence.It is fragile.Yet, it’s imaginable that we and our Earth might be special enough that the Apocalypse gets postponed. And we can go on enjoying holes for a very long and hard time. Orbt XL is saying that, if we focus, and get good, we can perform some amazing hole action (a high score) before the end finally arrives. Simultaneously the game is saying that, if we want to have fun in our finite lives, well we're just going to have to orbt close to that black hole, and flirt with the planets and comets and other space matter, who themselves exist so dangerously that they plunge straight into the hole without delay, lacking all self-restraint when shown the amazing, throbbing hole, that is black.[Speaking of throbbing, there’s a space object in the game that I particularly like, which temporarily enlarges the hole! And then it gets tight again! Neat stuff!]So Orbt XL is charged with meaning, meaning about both existence at the cosmic level, and at that of the individual’s. And on top of this, it really sucked me in, and not just into the hole, which, again, expands when a certain object enters it; I got sucked into the gameplay itself!All thoughts of my life left my mind as I tried to increase my score, and see how often I could barely pass by space matter, and see how long I could orbt the hole.But, what keeps Orbt XL from being a classic is that I laughed zero times while playing it; and I smiled just a few times. The game often had me in a state of Flow, and had me think about the ultimate purpose of life, but not much more.And that’s fine. As Orbt XL is really good, and most-certainly worth half-an-hour of your time. It certainly is a great step forward in the development of its developer (Adam). He’s clearly on track towards making a great game. And though his previous game Bit Blaster XL may have been like seeing your pet python eat your dog, it was definitely effective practice, much like a first child. And though I feel like his not including other colors of holes (such as white, brown, and asian) is an obvious missed opportunity, I have no difficulty awarding Orbt XL a score of:8/10"

,Recommended,615610,32968481,Posted: 28 June,all,Nintenbro,"This game is what you'd expect, but much, MUCH more. It's a simple game where you orbit around the black hole in the center of the map, while avoiding different kinds of asteroids falling towards the black hole. The asteroids come in different form, with some being smaller but faster, and vice versa, but some do more - and different - things, like exploding. (And yes, there is one that explodes in the game.)There's a sort of risk/reward factor to the gameplay. You can get closer to the black hole to earn points faster, though have not much wiggle room to avoid asteroids, and your planet moves faster, making it even harder to avoid the asteroids. You can also get close to the asteroids to earn extra points, adding to the risk/reward style of the game.There are different planets, some you cant even call planets, for example you can play as a thing that looks like the black hole. Depending on how many points you get through playing, you can get these different ships/planets.There's also controller support, and if you have a controller that vibrates, use it. There's a jolt of vibration when you respawn and die.Overall, the game is great for the price. It's a very fun thing to come back to when you bored, and just fun to try and beat your score. If you have a dollar lying around, get it. If you like simple, arcade-style games, then it's a steal. Especially if you see it in the Steam sales, It really is a great game."

76561198029040552,Recommended,615610,35166622,Posted: 23 September,all,Nawzgool,"I bought Orbit XL after trying Bit Blaster XL.  This game follows the same formula of simplicity and replay-ability as its predecessor while also delivering a unique game experience.The gameplay is fairly obvious from the demo video, keep your character from entering the black hole while accumulating points for circling it without dying from either entering the hole or being hit by asteroids – the closer you are to danger the faster you accrue points.  Despite the simple one button gameplay, the game ups the difficulty by adding more frequent and varying dangers that you can only avoid by going over or under.My only major complaint with Orbit XL is that this game was easier to play than Bit Blaster XL and took less time to complete.  For a game that relies on escalating difficulty to encourage continued replays it took less than an hour and a half for me to unlock all the skins and achievements – eliminating any progression (apart from my best score) and thereby limiting replay value.  The game could be improved with some balancing and a few more skin unlocks would be welcomed as well.Orbit XL is perfectly functional and fun to play and I look forward to future projects by Nickervision Studios.Pros:- Simple game design- Colors! Animations!- Parody Rick and Morty skin- But it’s $0.99- Achievements- Steam CardsCon:- Shorter game life than predecessor Bit Blaster XLVerdict:If you want to buy a game for $0.99 (barring a game coupon or a Steam sale) and you already have Bit Blaster XL, this game should be next on your Wishlist."

I would not buy this game for full price, even if it is still only a dollar.The idea is pretty much the same as Flappy Bird, except you're a planet orbiting a black hole. You gradually fall to the center, and clicking your mouse raises you up away from it so that you can orbit it, the same as falling/flapping your wings in Flappy Bird. You dodge these asteroids of varying sizes and speed, and every time you orbit you get a point. Simple enough.I still wouldn't buy this at full price, but for 25 cents, honestly what can you expect? It's not bad at all for what it's worth. It would probably make a very successful mobile game, if it isn't already."

I recommend grabbing the bundle with the Dev's other game, it's a cheap bundle for 2 fun small indie games!"

76561198294558453,Recommended,615610,32524269,Posted: 17 June,all,Commissar Maverick,"Some games earn their legacy by featuring brilliant graphical capabilities and complex gameplay, but this isnotone of them.Orbt XL is as steamlined and simplistic as the laconic name implies. You control a planet threatened by the presence of a central black hole, and although all it takes to survive is to reverse the gravity until you reach the edge of the gravitational boundaries, that is not the point of the game, as points are obtained for daring to remain close to the hole.However, the black hole is only half the story, as its excessive gravity affects more than just your planet, as rival heavenly bodies arrive from nowhere, threatening to smash your orbiting planet to pieces as you weigh the risks and consequences on when to reverse the gravity enough to find some breathing room at the expense of a comatose point timer, or drop down and brave the tighter spaces, with the promise of a faster point acumulation.Starting off is fairly easy, but it gets highly difficult at a swift pace as you wrap around the black hole time and time again, as the gravity picks up not only planets, but in addition to glowing green orbs that shift the orbit the other way, throwing you off course, little astroroids that take some serious maneuvering to survive, and even swirly things that morph into mini black holes!In short, you will not survive. The good news is however, that you can restart with newer and shinier planets with the very points you collected from your time spent orbiting. There is quite a variety to choose from, with all the planets from the familar solar system most of us reside in, to the sun, the Borg cube, Doge, some plumb thing, and even the black hole itself!Overall, Orbt XL has very little steak to so speak of, and not a whole lot of sizzle, but it is simply a lot of fun to just top your score and feel proud of all the little split second maneuvers you piloted while the going gets rough. The achievements are fairly easy to acquire, and even the harder ones can be overcome with a little persistence.Lastly, the graphics are clean, crisp, and colorful, and accent the straightforward objective well. The satisfying 3D effects used by the planets are too worth a mention. The music isn't really much, but it simply wouldn't be the same with a modern pop song or just silence.And as I wrap this up, remember while the scenario of a carefree planet orbiting around a playful little black hole sounds fun and all, don't forget that the gravity of the given situation would be very grave indeed. Perhaps it would be wise to repeal the law of gravity, too."

Main issue: some obstacles pop up randomly inside the circle, sometimes right on your trajectory with no possible anticipation --> the score is limited by luck and not by skills. Other minor issue: cannot fix the screen aspect ratio in game. There is no clear contrast between the many different ""levels"", and the ""great soundtrack"" tag seems misleading for this game (it's all in the demo video). It could still be improved into a nice arcade game, and I would have kept it without the above main issue."

Therefore, I will make this a bit more detailed.Didn't know about the mobile version.

Not a surprise. Replayable.Light. 300MB is not a lot. You can keep it on your laptop, and kill time without worry.Con:The cents you pay, for the mere minutes you get from this. As it is replayable, that doesn't mean that it I will press the *retry* button. The consumer gets bored, so did I. ):Overall: as you can see, the ""Pros"" dominate the ""con"" by number, but that one con was enough.The gameplay is fun for a bit and the graphics are funky.So, dear Dev I can see the work put into this, and the game isn't bad. You just can't make me love this game forever. I am just not fond of the whole concept. This definitely isn't for anyone, and I understand the people looking for a more casual experience.

It is the basic free mobile game, you play to try and get a better score and you use the coins or points you earned to buy different color or shape sprites that don't help you further in the game. I have played better free mobile and computer games than this, and at its price, I do not recommend. Thank you for understanding."
,Recommended,615610,35401091,Posted: 1 October,all,Blargedy,"when you get in a zen state where you are one with the planet and the blackhole, one with the universe and attacking moons and meteors, there is nothing that can stand in your way. The scores climb as your excitment threatens to break the oneness. You break the high score and keep  going, the rythm of the game beating with your heart as you push that score just a bit higher before game over. Then you die and try to do it again. The concept is amazingly simple, but it is glorious in the beauty of simplicity, like a perfect glass of iced water with a splash of lemon on a hot day.Ok I think I got lost in the metaphor somewhere there, but the game is good. For a dollar you can't really go wrong, and it is fun."
