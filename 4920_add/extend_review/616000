Once you made it past 3 stages, you will fight a boss, and advance to the next zone.You're offered to mix 'n match your combo system to create a verity of attack patterns - these greatly change the gameplay so I advise trying them all out.So far so good, but here is the catch for the completionists among you: prepare for the most unfair experience you've ever faced.In order to 100% this one, you'll have to beat hard mode.Hard mode entails:- 1 heart, can be upgraded to 2 with an RNG shrine buff.- No stat upgrade upon killing bosses.You know when they say ""Don't try this at home?"", well this is it. The game is not optimized for this nature of a run, here are some things you should be aware of if you ever decide to attempt this:- You cannot precisely aim your attacks.- Enemies are hard to see sometimes.- Leaps of faith / charging towards an offscreen enemy just in time to get insta-gibbed.- Cheap telefrags.- Cheap deaths due to transition straight into an enemy.I did this because I can, but cannot recommend anyone else to attempt it unless you really like pain and suffering.Here is a montage of the brutality I went through:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbuYQTBoKvQ"

If you are looking for a fast-paced, indie, oldschool, retro 2D-action, then Riptale is your game. It is well executed and made with love & passion.I haven't clocked much on Steam (yet), but I managed to play it on beta, so I'm familiar with it and immediately bought it when it was released.For a price of a small pint, it's well worth the money and good fun for several hours."

76561198035718532,Recommended,616000,31533530,Posted: 3 May,all,Harley,"This is a really cool minimal hack-and-slash roguelite. The combat is probably the most satisfying of any game ever, which is great. My complaints about the game don't even begin to overshadow how fun this is. For $5, it's a must buy.However, I have some complaints with the game, and I think my biggest complaint is that there's no sense of area progression. Areas are randomized as far as I can tell, so your first level could be any of the game's levels. The red and white theme also makes sure that all of the levels really blend together. I played for over an hour and at all times I could never really tell you which level I was on or how long my run had been. None of the areas ever say ""Level 2"" or anything, so there's no way to know how long your run has even lasted. The fact that there's no sense of progression really hurts this game in my opinion.The artstyle is a bit difficult to get past for me. Although it definitely looks cool, restricting the whole palette to three colors gives serious limitations which hinder the game's enjoyment. Having different areas be different colors would be a great way to differentiate them, which would solve some of the progression issue. However, I'm sure the developer is married to the style they created, so the most I can ask is to PLEASE make non-interactive scenery pieces a light gray rather than a white. It would be so much easier to interpret everything going on on screen if there was at least a little bit of differentiation between the important objects and the scenery.There's a few other improvements I'd really like to see patched in. First of all, the D-pad doesn't work on controllers, which I'm sure would be simple to code in. Secondly, the antialiasing on the homing attack looks INCREDIBLY out of place compared to the rest of the tricolor graphics. There's also no way to see your health unless you get hurt, which I think is a mistake. I understand that this game is trying to stay minimal, but you can even see your gold at all time. Your gold count only matters when you're in a shop, but health matters *always*. So, that would be a good improvement.The mechanic of switching out your gems is cool, but there's a few ways it could be made better. First of all, there's no way to rearrange your gems unless you're in a shop. This seems like something that would give the player more choices without affecting balance, so I'd really like to see it added. Next, there isn't much of an explanation as to what each gem does. I'd love to see a menu when you press select that lets you rearrange your gem and see a more detailed description of their mechanics. I admire the simplicity of ""show, don't tell"", but I honestly can't tell what some of the gems do compared to normal gems, even after playing with them for a while.I really hope the developer(s) keep working to improve this game. The combat is so cathardic that I'll probably play this all the time, and I'd love to have some improvements to the rest of the game to top it all off!"
76561198083405157,Not Recommended,616000,31888766,Posted: 21 May,all,Alkyri,"Almost a great game, but the controls are genuinely awful.They're somewhat sticky, so that directional commands do not always register in time. Half of the time, you will find it impossible to hit an enemy, having to attack multiple times to finally register a hit.The restriction on how many attacks you have makes this particularly frustrating. Though you get more attacks with combo attacks, the level design and accuracy you can achieve make this mechanic less than prevalent.Ironically, the most fun I had playing the game was when I found the powerup that gives you three extra gems.I've barely touched the bosses, but from what little experience I've had, they're even more infuriating to fight. The Twins, especially, due to their small size, mobility, and large attacks are almost impossible to hit.The level design is boring; the washed out, colorless pallette is boring to look at, the levels themselves get repetative and are difficult to traverse, and the amount of times I've accidentally fallen into the pit to the next level while there's still more enemies to kill and money to collect is just annoying.The other attacks you can get are also almost interesting.... If you could ever live long enough to afford more than one. Most of the attacks, I find, also tend to be either really inaccurate or they ♥♥♥♥ up your rhythm. Maybe with more time to experiment, I would find them more useful.Overall, my impression of the game is: annoying."
76561197967490296,Recommended,616000,34892291,Posted: 11 September,all,Sylas420,"Wow... This game is an Absolute Gem!!! (you'll get the joke if you play the game). It is aMust-Playfor Fans of Rogue-like, Samurai, Sword Play, Minimalist Aesthetics & Gameplay, and Pure Fun!!!TL;DR - BUY IT!!!First off, the price is Spot On. There's no reason to wait for a sale, get this game ASAYCAI(as soon as you can afford it).It is very fun, easy to pick up and difficult to master. The difficulty comes from some design flaws, like the fact that enemies can cheap shot you with a clairvoyance that is utteraly ridiculous, right as you enter a room... or that controls are in facttooprecise.You do have to aim at your target before striking, and while it may seem like the controls are a little off - they are in fact incredibly pinpoint, almost to a fault. The angle and timing really matter, even more so given that you only have up to 3 consecutive attacks. If you have good spatial awareness, you'll get used to having to adjust your angle by literally a fraction of a degree. This could mean the difference between executing a sweet combo... or just getting executed.The biggest issue I have with the game is the BG Music for the main levels. It's the exact same looped track and it does not really vibe well with the music in the Menu, Shops and ""secret"" Lore Rooms. It's way too fast-paced, and bass drum heavy to be the song that you're hearing throughout most of your playtime. The 16-bit Midi feel is great, but every other song in the game is much better than the main track imo. It wouldn't be so bad if it switched every 3 or so stages after you find the lore room.Would also be nice if you had the ability to switch the locations of your abilities at will, but maybe in a future update?  Anyway, it's a great game and I Highly Recommend it. Cheers!"

76561197998404588,Recommended,616000,32860139,Posted: 27 June,all,HawkRyan,"a very rewarding and punishing rogue like game, simple controls, move left and right, dash in 1 of the 8 directions, seems simple yet doing it all properly in the heat of battle is very difficult, you choose the wrong direction and you might just get hit, get hti 4 times and game over try again so you gotta be careful and as such is a very fast paced game, if you like punishing but at the same time very rewarding gameplay then you will like this game.what I don't like is that when you go to the next room there's the possibility of getting hit right away which you can't do much, same case with off screen enemies, some enemeis can dash or teleport to you and when they do that off screen then you can't do much in the way of not getting hit by that, definitely the biggest frustration I had while playing"

The levels vary if you so it makes the game feel less repetitive if you die a lot.Generaly a fun arcade type of game"
,Recommended,616000,32403157,Posted: 13 June,all,Gravesnear,"Never have I played a game that has caused me such consternation as Riptale. Every time I play I think to myself ""I hate this game. It sucks, it's too hard, there aren't enough pick-ups, there's no checkpoints or the ability to save progress so I can go about my life.""And yet, I play it. I play it all the time. Almost every day out of a library of more than forty games I love, I play a game that I hate. It's flaws make it's perfection. It's difficult to describe how I feel about it. Perhaps this piece of art intends for me to reflect on the duality of man. Perhaps I'm supposed to find meaning in the hypocrisy of my choices. Perhaps it's just a really good game.10/10"
,Recommended,616000,31917083,Posted: 23 May,all,LivePastTheEnd,"Overview [/1]Riptale is an excellent game with an extremely tight game loop and inspires a zen-like gaming experience. However, if you do not have a controller, hate dying repeatedly or are looking for deep gameplay or story then I would suggest giving this a miss.GameplayYou start with 3 gems which you can expend to perform various slashing attacks. After each slash the game slows down briefly allowing you to chain together attacks and after a gem is expended you must wait for it to recharge. Your goal is to descend each cavern system and take out the boss at the bottom. You can get hit by enemies a total of 4 times before dying.Sounds fairly simple, yes? Well it is. However, the controls make it much more difficult. To aim the attack, you've got to point the left-stick in the direction you wish to strike however you also use the left-stick to walk meaning that you've got to aim reflexively (Not to mention there's no reticle either). Personally it took me about an hour and a half to become comfortable with the controls, YMMV.Scattered around the levels you can find boxes and vases which can be broken to find coins and hearts (monsters also drop these). The coins can be used at shops to replace your current gems with new ones with different attacks. This adds a little bit of variety to the combat as it allows you to adopt different styles of move differently.Occasionally you may find rooms off to the side which contain a stone tablet which give you some kind of wacky effect (From 3 extra gems to impossibly fast and slidey movement) or a challenge room which allows you to unlock various collectables.Once you reach and defeat the boss you will be given a power-up (an extra gem or heart IE.) and released onto on of the other dungeons to defeat that boss. The power-up is temporary and will be lost after you die or restart the game. Looking at the achievements there also seems to be a ""main boss"" that I assume you would fight after defeating all the dungeons in one playthrough.Death isn't a really big deal in this game. When you die you just simply hit restart and you'll respawn at the top of a random dungeon. I never felt like I was waiting around for the game to start again. Though there's probably about 5 seconds between dying and respawning, which might be too much for the easily frustrated.The dungeon layout seems to be random, which makes sense given the number of times you're going to be replaying it. However, I feel like this game would benefit from a slightly more structured approach. I'd definitely be interested in a metroidvania with the same mechanics.GraphicsAt first the graphics are rather harsh due to their start black/white style, though after some time it doesn't really bother you. However, if it does irritate you, you'll quickly start unlocking filters (Faded, Green etc.). The graphics can get rather repetitive, however, they're still quite well done and look great with blood splattered all over them.Enemies look pretty good, the black/white/red aesthetic and animations differentiate them from the background however they can blend into the background sometimes, however this seems intentional as the ones that are often hard to recognize tend to be smaller, less troublesome enemies.SoundThe soundtrack is awesome. Everyime I start up the game and I hear the music kick in it really gets me in the mood to slaughter a room of undead, cultists and dragons.The sound effects used in the game are really well done, however I think a sound for when you run out of gems would be helpful in addition to making the sound of gems recharging a lot louder than they currently are. More feedback sounds in general would be helpful.StoryThere isn't really an in-depth story as such. It's basically summed up in the intro as ""dragons show up, kill everyone and can only be hurt by certain people able to use magic gems, one such warrior is questing around to exterminate them"". It's enough to give you context but nothing that drives the experience, though I think it would subtract from the experience if they focused too much on the story.Apart from the intro scene you can also find books scattered around that provide you with snippets of lore. Some of them are quite entertaining to read.Conclusion [\h1]This is honestly a very solid game. I've got no reservations to recommend this game to anyone provided they have patience and a controller. There's certainly some room for improvement but it's mechanically complete and satisfying.Though. I really would like an option for more blood."

This game seems to have very similar visual designs to Downwell, and I LOVE Downwell, oh, and I haven't even gotten to the soundtrack. This game has one of the best soundtracks that I've listened to in a while, It's absolutely wonderful. So if I were to give this game a ranking between 1-10, I would gove this game a solid 9/10. The only issue I found with this game was the fact that you couldn't change controls (but I think that could be fixed later), no question, you should buy this game, and come on, it's only $5.99, if this game were being sold for $20 I would still buy it with an open heart and an open wallet. This game is the most perfect defenition of a hidden jem. In the end this game is amazing and I HEAVILY reccomend you get it."

With exciting and fast gameplay, a great soundtrack and a low price, this game is everything you could want in a rougelike action platformer.

76561198126121616,Recommended,616000,31545172,Posted: 4 May,all,Örmynkörmy,"Riptale is a fast paced rogue-like action game where the emphasis is on quick movement and chaining combos. Fluid and simple controls make the game easy to learn and the fast fighting means it remains an intense experience throughout. The game is not without problems though.Sometimes the enemies can hit you just as you're falling down to new room, and the black and white color palette - while aesthetically strong - can sometimes make it hard for the player to see what part of the scenery is background and what is a stationary snake ready to kill you. Also while the soundtrack is well made, a lack of variation meant that I turn the volume down a little more each time I start playing the game.Ultimately whether you should buy the game or not can be summarized in two questions:1) Is the game fun, and2) Is it worth the asked priceI can quite safely say ""yes"" to both questions. In the grand scale many of my issues with the game are nitpicks, and despite sometimes being ruthlessly difficult the game never feels truly obnoxiously annoying. Plus everytime you strike an enemy down the sword makes a pleasing slashing sound, the game stops for a moment and you see the enemy get cut  in half with all the pixelated blood spraying around. And really that alone is quite enough for me."

There are trinkets you could collect by winning special challenges, but they do nothing (I'm sure of it, developer told so).At the actual state of the game I think it could frustrate/bore you very quickly, but with some extra effort maybe it could be good as much as other titles like Downwell.VERY IMPORTANT: The twins boss is very unfair, at this point still haven't been able to beat 'em. I think it's the small arena, the limited control over the player, the randomic nature of enemy projectiles: fix it please."

Boss fights can be a little annoying sometimes, but don't feel unfair or anything.
