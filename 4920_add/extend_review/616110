Spaceplan is unlike anything I've ever played in my life.  Everything about it hooked me instantly, from soundtrack to gameplay to mood to colors to story.  So if you love space, clicker games, and a phenomenal soundtrack, Spaceplan is specifically for you"
,Recommended,616110,31663104,Posted: 10 May,all,EdenStarGazer,"An out of this world clicker that serves up a Sci-fi narrative, Spaceplan give us a computerized space age sim with fully automated potential. Is it a Rocket? Is it a Science Fair Project gone awry? No, it’s a potato-driven effort at time travel.A totally unscientific look at the Science behind shooting potatoes into the sun, Spaceplan has you clicking a button to launch spudniks into orbit. With a clean, humorous interface, with self-effacing generic titles, the narrative becomes the focus of the game. As you add to your potato arsenal from the items on the left, and upgrade with research ideas on the right, more spud power is generated to propel your starchy voyage to return a dead earth to its former glory.What I liked most about Spaceplan was that it left out the drag of hand-numbing clicking. There are no set number of clicks required to complete the game. And, the ability to upgrade means that the power continues to generate even while you have the game closed. Clicking speeds up the generation rate. Of course, macros work here too if you really want to speed things up. So, you are totally in control of the narrative.Most importantly, it is a clicker that you really can’t stop playing until the end… or is there an end? The story is circular, and could keep going. So, theoretically you could keep playing forever. Seriously though, I see absolutely no replay value once you’ve reached the beautiful ending. That ending is fantastic enough to make you close the game with a happy feeling until you realize there is not another clicker like it to fill the new black hole you’ve created.I highly recommend this pseudo-science clicker for all fans of the genre… and for the rest of us who’ve never clicked before."

,Recommended,616110,33810750,Posted: 26 July,all,Protoss,"What is SPACEPLAN?SPACEPLAN is a story-driven incremental game (also often called Idle or - in my opinion wrongly - Clicker game). The player explores the solar system by using the usual mechanics of incremental games - that is, clicking a bit at the beginning, buying things, buying more things with the money generated, etc.The storyline is interesting.There are a few times where waiting for big sums is necessary, following the typical Idle style, while clicking is optional but increases the resources gained, which are measured in Joule - or, if you desire so, in kcal.After building your armada of potato buildings, you eventually reach a story point, and here the game got my attention. The second half of the game plays almost identical to the first part - i.e. idling or buying things - but the story advances until it reaches a climax, after which the game is over. The final cutscene can be replayed, alternatively the save deleted and started anew. New Game Plus, Resetting for more gains, etc. do not exist here - so after the around three hours long experience there is really no reason to play on, which is kind of sad.Gameplay wise, there is certainly not much unique - it is almost a typical incremental game - and the most unique thing would be a minor spoiler. There is a kind of building that does something when bought in the second part of the game.More unique than that gameplay bit is the graphics and storyline. The graphics are to a degree an integral part of the experience, as you probe different planets. Sadly, there is not much of an exploration aspect other than flying from here to there and experiencing the story.I had the sound and music turned off, as I always do for this kind of games, so I can't say much about it here. The soundtrack is available for purchase on the Steam Store, and it has one positive review without any others, where it is called ""incredible"", but I haven't heard it yet personally, so I can't vow for it.Overall, the game was a nice experience to have, and I do not regret playing it. If it justifies the asking price is however left to how much you are willing to invest for a three hours experience that you already know how to play.Recommended: Neutral, as it is a paid game and even on a sale it is up to you to decide if you are willing to pay for this genre. There apparently is an early browser version, so you might want to find that and check it first. As there is no neutral option, I will click ""Yes"", as clicking ""No"" would be completely unjustified, seeing that I enjoyed the game. If there wasn't a plethora of free incremental games, I would recommend it for 1.50€ or less."
,Recommended,616110,32731295,Posted: 24 June,all,Nellodee,"I loved the writing, visuals, and music. Sometimes it's nice to have something you can just put on in the background and check occasionally between other tasks, and unlike other games in the 'clicker' genre, there are no microtransactions, so there's also no forced progression slowness or drawn-out length. My one quibble would be with a section near the end, which requires both active participation and good timing. I'm sure there are a lot of people who enjoy the little bit of variety, but I just got more frustrated with every failed attempt to hit a target. However, even with my impatience, and bad hand/eye coordination, that section is fairly short; and the ending was more than worth the aggravation. I'm anxiously looking forward to whatever the dev makes next."

The music does so much for the atmosphere of the game, and by the time I'd finished the game, I felt like I had gone on a space adventure.The game also has a fair amount of humour to it, and I found myself grinning with a childish sense of delight at a lot of the jokes.SPACEPLAN is certainly worth the extremely modest asking price, it has style, interesting clicker mechanics, and a soundtrack I'd probably buy on CD, if that were still a thing.Certainly recommended."

It's actually more of a visual novel gone through a nerd filter and a great electro soundtrack on top.

76561198038906088,Recommended,616110,31539574,Posted: 4 May,all,Zrixzes,A fun and indepth clicker with an intriguing sci fi mystery story set as the motivation for progressing.The art style is I think very appealing and fits the theme of the game well. The upgrades you get through progressing the game give little tidbits of story here and there which compell you to keep playing and unlocking the next tier.Very cheap to purchase and very much worth your time maybe even if you're not a fan of clickers but for $3 how can you go wrong?
,Recommended,616110,31924638,Posted: 23 May,all,Rudymeow,"Intresting short idle clicker game.Don't expect a lot of grinding or contents, but watching a little story and a bit humor while not likely to brothered by overdone grinding is good.Balancing might be an issue but it is short enough to not care about it.Worths the few dollar it asked."
,Not Recommended,616110,31564999,Posted: 5 May,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"In the idle clicker spectrum of 'heavy management' to 'completely idle',SPACEPLANis much closer to the latter; there isn't a ton to do other than sit around and wait.There also isn't a lot to look at. The minimalist graphics are nice, albeit... Well... Very minimal. The UI is nice in a functional kind of way, but again, nothing groundbreaking. The humor is cute.I like my idle clickers to have a bit more meat-on-the-bone, with some choices and management.If you are looking for a great modern clicker, check outIdle Evolutioninstead.Again, I don't thinkSPACEPLANis horrible per-se, there just isn't enough to it as far as what you are doing at any given point in time. It's less about spending the money with this game than it is about spending your precious gaming time.Finally,SPACEPLANuses the top right of the store page to state exactly one sentence to describe the game that includes a comparison to Stephen Hawking's bookA Brief History of Time. OK great, I love that title. I love idle clickers.A match made in heaven -  I am sold. Too bad I can't see any of that bookin thisgame. The dev did respond to a forum post I had with this conundrum, but I'm still left a bit underwhelmed at the abstract connections (and yes, it is an abstract book lol). I just think its fair warning to anyone whose interested was piqued from that first sentence.SPACEPLANis not the worst idle clicker, but I did not find it engaging enough to recommend my friends go out and spend money on it."

I have too much free time.What I found was some fairly humorous dialogue and satisfying gameplay. The sound effects combined with the simple visuals make for a really crisp experience. The game doesn't take too long to complete, as most clickers are seemingly endless and the ending is very satisfying and thought-provoking."

It's like a clicker game, except there's a story. So you build some solar panels and plant some potatoes to generate power. You can close your game and come back in an hour if you want, power will still be generated. Once you have enough power you scan the planet...Spoilers Ahead, Watch out!!!And you discover it's Earth and your a few hundred years in the future after something catastrophic.

,Recommended,616110,31622269,Posted: 8 May,all,NuMbr23,"What can i say about this little gem of a game?I went into this game not thinking much at all. It really looks simple but I was wrong. I'm not big into clickers but once you get the ball rolling on resources, you're set. I was kind of using strats to what i should purchase and how much of this will equal the other source of power (watts or jueles), so I had enough watts for other purchases. The story took me on  a ride I didnt think where it would head. it surpirsed me to say the least and I was surpised with a cutscene being which added some more humour into the mix.The eh thing about this is waiting for power. You need a lot of power the more you progress and it gets quiet ridicules. I left my computer on all night and day so i could get through the story with enough power under my beltOther than that, I do reccomened this game to anyone who like story based games and dont mind waiting around."
,Recommended,616110,31809095,Posted: 17 May,all,inkfild,This game took me only 13.4 hours to beat but it is so very good.  Clickers and idle games usually only provide excitement with ever growing numbers you can gain over time.  What spaceplan has done is provide a fun story that uses the elements from clickers and has a great soundtrack that I wish I would have purchased in the bundle offer. I would suggest this to anyone who likes clickers/idle.   I hope the developer will continue to produce more content for this game but if not then I will keep my eye out for what they do next.

SPACEPLAN was a truly awesome experience.  It drew me in right from the begining and didnt let go. Instead of going through it as quickly as possible i took my time and accumulated huge amounts of watts, more than i would need to complete the game, enjoying the simple yet effective graphics and music.

,Recommended,616110,31685466,Posted: 11 May,all,E-200 Paragon,"While I do not enjoy Clickers, this one's got enough to make it memorable.SummarySPACEPLAN is a space-themed Clicker based on potato puns..........Yeah, that's pretty much it, it's literally a space version of the iconic Cookie Clicker.The only difference is the cookie puns are now replaced with potato puns.It has a story, but it's so ludicrous that I can't take it seriously.For those of you who don't know what a Clicker is, Clickers are games where the whole objective is to rack up points by clicking on a single object, hence the name, and then buying upgrades with those points to earn more points.They're simple, repetitive, and literally drug money due to how addictive they can be.Once you start playing, you never stop since it keeps playing even if you turn it off.The only way to stop it is to erase the save file. (this resets the game back to the start)Each Clicker has different themes and mechanics, but they're all the same game at their core.Most Clickers don't have an ending, but this one does and it's worth playing to see.ConclusionI can't really say much about this game.It has a great idea for its story, but a Clicker is still a Clicker no matter how fancy you make it.I'm only recommending it because at least some effort was put into it despite being a Clicker.The game hints at the idea of a sequel, but this could just be a parody of a trope.Important Note: Don't let Jacksepticeye know about this game or we'll never see him again."

,Recommended,616110,31913704,Posted: 23 May,all,Eastman51,"This game looks like a clicker on the outside, but its far more than that. While the very basic gameplay is very similar to cancerous clickers, its not overly time consuming. Once you get some groundwork stuff laid out you can leave it to build up power and eventually have it generate power while you exit the game to do something else. The story is pretty weird, and its definitely unique, I enjoyed it. There's lots of jokes about potatoes, so you'll get some laughs here and there. The ending is quite interesting, I really liked it, and there's a big underlying message to it but I think that message might differ from person to person. The story, as with most stories, is open to enterpretation. For the price its definitely a few hours of fun. I definitely recommend."
,Recommended,616110,31640940,Posted: 8 May,all,Stalinbrad,"Only thing wrong with it is that it's a little too short. However, it accomplishes everything it sets out to do in a very neat and clean manner. It isn't overly wordy, it isn't too sparse. Everything has purpose, and as far as a clicking game goes, it's pretty entertaining. The visuals are minimalistic, so if that bothers you, you might not want to get it, but for three bucks, it's pretty hard to want to pass it up. It's not exactly meant to be a very intimate experience. Like space itself, the game has an innate charm to it, but it's utterly stoic.Anyways, it's a clicker game, so if you don't like those, don't get it. It's not a very long clicker game, but it is interesting and it feels nice to play. Definitely not a waste."

,Not Recommended,616110,33566162,Posted: 15 July,all,Psyringe,"Spaceplan is a clicker game with a whimsical sci-fi story and an actual ending. The story is very short, but fun to read if you like absurdist humor - the ""potato"" theme got old very quickly, though.Gameplay is typical for a clicker: Clicking earns you energy points, with this energy you can buy items that make your clicks worth even more points, or items that produce energy on their own over time. You'll successively unlock more expensive items and will eventually get access to the ones that are required to win the game. You can play the game actively via frantic clicking, or you can put it in the background and let it play itself. Towards the end you'll have to hit moving targets with projectiles, so the game includes a dexterity element as well.Graphics are very minimalistic. Your spaceship is a dot, other items are also dots, planets are monocolored circles. The music sounds sometimes like a track that a TV broadcaster would use together with a ""program will resume soon"" screen, and sometimes includes trance or techno elements. I found it mostly boring, and in the techno elements the beat was annoyingly strong, but it's probably a matter of taste, I don't think the music is bad per se.If you like clicker games, give this one a go - you already know the mechanics, and the story might offer a new and refreshing angle for you.If, like me, you don't like clicker games, then stay away. I played this game because it had a story, and I wanted to find out whether the story would carry the game despite my dislike for the mechanics. It does not. The story is decent, but not good enough to wait for the next bit while stupidly clicking your mouse.I suppose it's a matter of ""different strokes for different folks"". I can't really fathom why anyone would enjoy a game that consists of repeating the same, mindnumbingly simplistic action over and over and over - this is practically the exact opposite of what I'd call fun, to me it feels like working at the worst part of an assembly line, where you have to do the same move for hours while you die inside of sheer boredom. Yet, there are obviously people who like this type of gameplay, and to those, I can recommend this game. Click to your heart's content! :)Personally though, I just wanted it to end, and I found it particularly annoying that it went on even after completing the first big task. To me, Spaceplan is simply a decent story that's worth 15 minutes of somebody's time, stretched out over 5 hours by implementing a mind- and pointless, repetitive, terribly annoying game mechanic. I've rarely been this happy to uninstall a game. Good golly."

I was wondering how would a narrative clicker work.TL;DR: It’s hilariously mind bending.Without spoiling anything, yes, there is a story. The game has a conclusion. The narrative is well written, pokes fun at science-fiction and plays with the expectations of the player. The music is awesome, combing various ambient electronic themes with some sick beats. Now, stop reading this and get SPACEPLAN. It’s a steal even at “full” price."

That's when I ran it and it made that section a breeze.

When I searched for answers I found (a minority of) others in similar situations.  The player ultimately needs to overcome a hardship, but my game gets stuck.So, for me, the game is broken.

The story was mediocre, but was enough to keep me coming back to finish the game.

I sat around waiting for the sake of this game to progress, only to realize later on that the game can progress even while it isn't running. This, along with some of the gameplay toward the end that required a ridiculous amount of accuracy in timing, was exasperating for me. I thought this game would help me relax--it did just the opposite. Again, the true downfall of this game for me was the gameplay. The soundtrack is awesome, the graphics are minimalistic and the narrative is fun and humorous -- but it didn't compensate enough for the gameplay.

Meaning you click on something, get money, use that money to buy something and then click the first thing again. Repeat 100000000000x times.Spaceplan adds a story, but in 30 Minutes of game time, that's all I'm willing to state. Everyone talks about the clever writing, and yes, I giggled at the options menu and liked the trailer up there but ingame you 1. dont have that much writing, maybe one sentence every couple of minutes and 2. it's not consistently funny. It's the ""school of funny"" which believes that randomly placing potatoes or replacing random things with potato ('cause we're so random) is enough of a joke to be made 100 times. (Starships powered by potato?! That's not how you power a starship! LOL,ROFL,GG)In Contrast to some other (free...) clicker games like Adventure Capitalist, the game seems shallow, (for a clicker!). In the time I was playing, I could only buy 2 ""Moneymaking"" things, and about 2 Upgrades for each. Also, you buy probes (sry ""Probetato"", cause were random, remember?), which are the games way of making you advance the story, though it failed to advance for me even at first because the first 4 (!) probes burn down (maybe more, wouldnt know I stopped). 20 Minutes of burning down probes and telling you to try again seems a bit much for a game that doesnt expect you to pay for superfunbucks to advance quicker.I like the sleek presenation and the nice, though very simple music, but it still makes me wonder why this game costs money when theres literally HUNDREDS of these games for free on the internet."

If you know anything about Devolver Digital, you know that they like to publish unique and interesting games that usually have some humour in them. SPACEPLAN is no exception.The gameplay is based on the simplistic 'clicker' genre, but I would categorise SPACEPLAN as more of an adventure game. Over the course of the game you will click a button to gain energy required to build satellites, probes, and other buildings that will in turn increase the rate at which you gain yet more energy. This is the gameplay loop that acts as the vehicle from one plot point to another, and while it is in itself quite addictive, its the witty and mysterious story that is the most enjoyable aspect of the game.Taking things at a leisurely pace, the game took me 7 hours to complete. Considering that the game is only £2 at full price (£1 on sale for me) it is very easy for me to recommend SPACEPLAN. Its a small, minimalist experience, but its definitely worth it.8/10A quirky little adventure that is definitely worth your time and money."

It doesn't take itself seriously be any means and that silly tone keeps you smiling.Unlike most clickers, this game has an ""END"" that the narrative pushes you towards and depending on how you play, it can be completed within a day's worth of play. It is worth it. The ending cutscene is quite beautiful and brings to mind the abstract awesome that was classic 70s and 80s sci-fi films. Unfortunately, once you have seen this ending, there is really no reason to play again.Overall, if you want a clicker game you can play for days upon days, weeks upon weeks, this is not that game.

I hope to see an idle/clicker RPG style game like this with this kind of concept. Unlocking the story the more you progress. But most of all, the soundtrack is absolutely awesome, having spent my early 20's listening to new age space music. Best soundtrack for a clicker ever so a tip of the hat going to the music composers. I just let it run when I want to listen to the music.The more stuff you change/add effects the planet's behavior.This game is now my favorite clicker of all time.

However, it is neither life affirming and thanks to the small detail of it not actually revealing anything at all about what happened I can't say I was captivated. Rather, whenever it looked like it would get into the backstory of the game it was just time for another disappointment. Did kill a good deal of time though.As to revealing the secrets of five different planets; Together with the promise of a captivating story this sounds as if you're going to learn something fascinating about them, right? However, what they mean is ""Do a minigame with the regular game mechanics and watch a few seconds of the planet doing something neat."" There is no exposition behind these ""secrets"" that tells you anything about them, you only get told what they ultimately do and not even why or in what way they help.So, all in all, very disappointing story wise, but because it's still a neat idle game for a very low price I don't regret the purchase. Looking to kill time? Go ahead and get this. Interested in the ""mysteries""? Don't bother."

I literally let it run overnight while I slept.  Of course, the idea is to harvest power, and you can (mostly) only do that while you've got the game running.  There's an unlock that allows the game to continue to harvest power after you close but that's not really the point.  The point is, I couldn't stop playing it.The references to potatoes were priceless throughout the entire game.  It changed in subtle ways that was fun to experience.  The sound effects were great.  I just loved every thing about it!This is definitely something I want to see expansions or sequels too.  Too much of the universe to explore to leave it in our own ""solar system"""

I played it on the side during matchmaking times and when i was waiting for frineds to join up for other games. I did like it, and It was fun all the way through, story was easy to folow, just read the text on the right, and I finished it after 10hours so id say its worth it. Is it amazing? no. but it is interesting. If you plan to sit there and focus on it this may not be the game for you.

It takes the player through a short story involving mostly potatoes and metaphysics, with basic (potato-based) clicker mechanics driving the progression as you generate more and more energy to power your ship through all the root vegetable shenanigans.The story itself is wonderful and silly, and though it's unlikely to spark any deep philosophical discussions, it's absolutely worth your (small amounts of) time and money to experience it. The game is also aided by a fantastic soundtrack, and the fact that you can continue generating resources with the game closed (for a little while). This means that, when you come to a point where you need to wait for more energy before continuing the story, you can leave the game completely alone while you do so, which keeps the progression from falling too much into the grind inherent to clicker games.If you have some time and money to spend, and you want to experience something unique, bizarre, and not at all serious, I definitely recommend SPACEPLAN."

,Recommended,616110,32732319,Posted: 24 June,all,But Nobody Came,"This is a clicker game, but as someone who has played many clicker games, this one I found to be more fun, and some great humour.  It's more interactive, there's a story, and there's an END.  You could finished it in 1-2 days if you have a key-bind, and a few days if you play casually.I purchased it for 50% off and already played the web version.  I felt there is enough additional content added that this was worth buying and playing again. There is a 2nd half added and a new mechanic added.If you like clicker games, but looking for something slightly different than the standard setup, I recommend.  If you played the web version and enjoyed it, I recommend."

Perfectly designed UI.Part 2 really sells this for me. Its Incredible to play, and adds an entirely new level of depth to the idea of a clicker game. Not sure if a sequel is planned, but I'd pay far more than this to see an expansion of it."

,Not Recommended,616110,33594587,Posted: 16 July,all,CB007,"This is a clicker style game, of which there are a variety of free or mostly free examples on Steam. The difference with this one is that it's supposed to have a linear story instead of an endless or near endless gameplay loop.Unfortunately, the story is extremely minimal, told by some text on the uper right corner of your screen. And the actual clicker gameplay is functionally identical to what you'd expect from this type of game, except that offline earnings are much more limited.I found myself barely engaged with this game, checking in every once in a while to complete some tasks but not particularly caring about any of it. And then it ends with a boring series of trippy space scenes, I've seen this all before, next game please."

However I'm not entirely sure about that ending even if it was cool considering there is only 5 planets and said ending was basically a montage of things you can't shoot potatoes at (lol).If you like clicker games but want something short then I can recommend it but otherwise you'd probably want to wait for a sale.

Spaceplan is the perfect length and if it was an hour longer, I would get bored. It is perfect in its presentation as it is clean-cut and beautiful, while remaining funny and cartoony. It is perfect in the way it takes the idea of an idle clicker ""game"" and makes it into an actual game. It is perfect in how it presents its story and plot and I wish other games took the same approch. While it is perfect, it is not my favorite game just because I like other games more. That being said, I recommend this game with the utmost vigor and for the low price it is sold for, there is not much reason not to buy it. Hope this review persuades you."
