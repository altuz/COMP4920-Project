,Not Recommended,616360,32332886,Posted: 10 June,all,Foosball,This game is unfinished. Period.The buildings hover above ground. You are firing some type of full automatic that shoots like a shotgun.Some of the positive postings are a total joke and I wonder if they have been paid.A far superior game to this is Nation Red.Edit: Refunded requested and granted.
,Not Recommended,616360,32379861,Posted: 12 June,all,jeebs,"Whoa a buggy, broken, Unity Assest flip, zombie shooter on Steam, save some innovation for the rest of us... This game is your standard zombie shooter affair you can find on littered Steam. It's only saving grace being it isn't as bad as say The Slaughtering Grounds.Starting the game it was hard to not notice the bad hit detection and the horrible aiming. Where you aim your mouse cursor to where the bullets go can be 2 totally different things at points and even when you manage to get a headshot, sometimes it wouldn't register it at all. At points I could visibly see the player model facing a complete different direction to where the crosshair was aiming. It also features ammo pick ups which will only give ammo to that weapon you have equipped.The level design is broken at best. From areas you could easily walk through objects to areas your player character would hover in the air with the falling animation on an infinite loop. Ultimately there are only 3 different maps with spawn points the game counts as levels. Plus you're able to just up and leave the spawn area you're in and walk around the rest of the map which wasn't being used at all (for example The Bridge level allows you to just walk around an empty map).The music is just generic rock/metal (royalty free I assume). The sound effects are nice at least (though that credit should go to the creator on the Unity Assest Store). You will also notice the sound effects will continue to play even when the game is paused. The game also doesn't have huge fps drops, albeit crashing when there were too many zombies on screen.It's ironic that this game was published by Bloody Mess Interactive because I feel that it would of been a more appropiate title for this game."

The zombies can't decide whether to run or lumber towards you & the hit detection is terrible.  Multiplayer is non-existent, despite having that option.  Furthermore you run out of ammo for your primary & secondary weapons way too quickly & the pickups are almost nowhere to be found.  Even as a zombie fan, I can't, in good conscience, recommend this game."

I strongly urge you to take down this game. it has SO MUCH  potential but you goofed up. Its not finnished. please, I had high hopes for this game....especially being  an avid 3rd person shooter guy. Your maps have tons of no clip, ammo consumption is way to fast and the hit detection needs work along with some other bugs that I'm sure if you actually look through the comments you'll find more. But dude, this game could really go somewhere if you just take your time.

76561198119183115,Not Recommended,616360,32343982,Posted: 11 June,all,[(Jo)],"This game has it’s pontential. The gameplay it’s not the worst i’ve seen, the character it’s nice, movements and weapons skin/sounds are really nice.But it’s sold as complete, while it should be an early access.For some zombie-game lovers it’s all about shooting: that’s what this game is. Even if i’m more into state of decay a-like, sometimes a game like this it’s appreciated.But after 20 minutes it’s not worth it. There’s lot of stuff to fix:- strange gameplay: weird camera, very few actions, no crouch,  no jump, no rolling- ghost objects, ghost roads, ghost bridges, whatever- weapons sometimes stops working. There’s plenty of ammo but they get stuck on reloading or simply don’t shoot- character get stuck in the air acting weird, after you try to jump down from a place….shooting or changing weapons sometimes fix the situation- ridicolously big map, where you can find absolutely nothing. If you run off the dead, after a certain distance, they stop chasing you: you start exploring the map, which is big but with lot of bugs…..and you find nothing, not even zombies. I mean really a lot of wasted space- sometimes you can kill a zombie with one single shot in the chest, sometimes you need 6 headshots- after using an explosive option from the actions menu (i.e. missiles from the sky, even if you are the last man on earth, but ok…), zombies spawn in the same place….all together- the menu appears the first time you play, then disappears forever- no customization possibilities, i mean nothing: commands, sound, graphics, etc...- very few weapons- ridicolous multiplayer: no interaction with other player, no missions, very random zombies, gigantic map with nothing (like before…). Nonsense. Just people randomly shooting until they get bored.- repetitive missions: clear the area. The number of requested kills (after you reach the goal you can keep playing for a while) increase between levels. After you get all weapons what’s left-- no character customization"
76561198170078649,Not Recommended,616360,32347338,Posted: 11 June,all,SCIMITAR,"Where do I begin with this one? How about this: when the feature in your game I am most impressed with is that it has an option to exit on the home screen, consider removing your game completely and go think about what you've done.I'll start with the one positive I can think of: the graphics are, honestly, pretty nice. Granted, the modelling and textures are a bit sh*t but the lighting and colours are actually quite nice. I found myself simply staring at the enourmous, sun-like light coming from the sky, shining onto the, obviously, crimson earth that makes up the bulk of the map as if it were a lens flare in a JJ Abrams film.Sadly, everything else is crap.My biggest complaint with the game is the way it controls. The gameplay should rely heavily on an expansive, third person view whereas the shooting mechanics would work best with an over-the shoulder perspective. Instead of simply compromising one of the gameplay features and settling for one of the options however (namely, the former), the developers make the downright idiotic decision of combining the two. Some may argue this gives a clear view of what you're aiming at but the fact that your character is on the far left of the screen at all times means that controlling, the presumed, him is an absolute nightmare with avoiding zombies and weaving through or going around thing more difficult than it should be. And the camera wrestles with everything!Another issue is that the game lacks any form of polish. You can glitch through structures, others hover and there are some points where you literally cannot progress because the character is in a constant state of falling.The zombies are also terrible. By themselves, they are not a threat. They do very little damage, move at any speed from a snail's pace to a clumsy jog and can be completely dismembered by your guns. That being said, they do take quite a few shots to kill and move in swarms, approaching from all angles. This is another point where the camera is a big issue. You can't see anything behind you and your character can, due to his poor placement on the screen, easily get stuck or lost which results in being swarmed on with no hope for survival.I thought that ripping and shredding your way through zombies could be fun but that is where another issue comes in: the gunplay is boring. One of the reasons the zombies seem pitiful is because they are practically bullet sponges. That, grouped with the guns' weak sound effects, slow fire rate and the fact that ammo is so hard to find, make the weapons in this game feel ineffective.Finally, the levels are huge but totally boring. There are a few ruins and small industrial areas where zombies are commonly found but everything else is barren and desolate and painfully tedious to explore. Even ammo packs are largely absent from the map and what few structures there are seem to be purely cosmetic.Boring, poorly designed and ridiculously buggy, Crimson Earth is not worth the two quid they are asking for it. However, watching the zombies getting torn to pieces is mildly fun.Crimson Earth gets a 3/10. Don't buy it. Don't even accept it as a gift."

,Recommended,616360,32328378,Posted: 10 June,all,Tomwazere,"So let me give a good run down of the game from what I've seen:Gameplay wise, it's fun, almost relaxing. You pick a map, get given the objective ""kill X amount of zombies"" and then you're let free to do exactly that! You have three guns from the outset and complete levels to unlock in game currency to get more guns.There's a 'perk system' which is more like a killstreak type thing from COD, in that you kill zombies and unlock abilities based on the map you picked that you use to kill more zombies or help you out etc.Bug wise, I only experienced one where I couldn't stop my character sprinting at one point, but having said this, nothing game breaking so far! And this is pretty good going for a £1 game.Otherwise my only other comment is the third person has your player in the bottom left of the screen, which is strange and leads to shots not aligning sometimes, but easy to get used to.I'd compare it to a cross between Nazi Zombies and Left4Dead, a fast paced horde killing kind of game. And, again, you really can't go wrong for the price, I'd genuinely thoroughly recommend if you're into killing zombies!5/7"
76561198085441094,Recommended,616360,32328922,Posted: 10 June,all,The Bird of Hermes,"A great zombie slaying game for a great price.There is no story. The gameply focuses entirely on clearing a given number of zombies from the map. The weapons are satisfying and varied and the ""perks"" are things like airstrikes, incendiary rounds for your guns, and more ammo for your loadout. If you just want to kill some zombies and not think too much then give this a try.Don't expect much difficulty. If you have half a brain this is not a difficult game. Just don't allow yourself to get overwhelmed. Achievements are pretty easy and are exactly as described. Kill x number of zombies, get x number of headshots, use x number of airstrikes. It's going to take a while to get 500k kills but it's doable if you just like to mindlessly slaughter zombies.The only bugs I found were some lighting glitches and on some levels the zombies will spaz in the floor a bit on uneven ground. You can occasionally clip through walls and under things that you're not supposed to but you have to do this intentionally and it doesn't break the game.EDIT: Since I wrote this review they changed the achievements so there isn't as much grinding ridiculous numbers of kills to get them."

You can play solo or in multiplayer. I cant beleive it's only 3.99 and I got it for the special promotion price of 2.39. It's worth it! I also beleive so much more will come of this game once it get outthere!  No glitches!I could see this being a game where you just spend hours and hours killing zombies.

But not just feels empty, it is. Some models (like house) is hanging in the air, looks like ""meh, no one will see that""...Yes i did! I checked many segments of the map, because it's kind of freeroam game. Also you can stuck easily.Also I see that the ammos and zombies are ""centralized"" in small area, the whole map is just unused! (wasting)- AMMO: well...hardly managed to hit even the 100 killed zombies, because this game just SAVING the ammo from you. You won't find enought to finish the game. Best of all: I think the game is broken. I just killed the 100th zombie, and NOTHING HAPPENED, the game goes on. I just suicied, wanted to see the results. NOTHING. No credits for new weapons, nothing unlocked.Couldn't try online yet. I'm not sure that nobody plays it, or just doesn't connect.What I love in this game?- Actually, the map.
