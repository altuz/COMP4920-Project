,Not Recommended,616560,31222231,Posted: 18 April,all,Danlo,"This is a very early title with an (apparently) active dev, so keep these things in mind as you read this review.The GOOD: This game is extremely entertaining...The BAD: ...for about 10 minutes.What begins as a fun battle sandbox to test different troop and formation scenarios against each other on a massive scale quickly devolves into little more than a customizable stress test for your graphics card once you realize that there is no AI, there are no tactics, and the only difference between the various units available are their HP, Attack value, and the size of their hitbox.Spartan hoplites don't fight like Spartans. Roman centurions don't fight like Romans. Midieval knights don't fight like knights. In fact, the only unit that behaves even remotely like they might in ""real life"" are the zombies, but that's because EVERY unit fights like a zombie; melee units advance towards each other in a straight line unless interrupted by an impassable obstacle (like another unit), and swing mindlessly towards the enemy cluster until they die. Ranged units stand in place and fire in the direction of their enemy until the battle is won or they are killed.There is no flanking. There is no retreat. There are no timed cavalry charges or intelligent battlefield maneuvers of any kind. All you do is place groups of units on the field and hit ""Play."" This means that you can predict the outcome of every battle with 100% accuracy before it begins using nothing more than your phone's calculator app. If unit X has enough HP to tank the attacks of 5 unit Ys until it kills them all, but not 6, then a troop of 1,000 Xs will always win against anything less than 5,001 Ys. The math for ranged units vs melee units is much the same once you factor damage taken to cover distance.What all this means is that, after placing the various unit formations on the map, watching the fight play out contains about as much excitement and surprise as watching sand fall through an hourglass. Even if you didn't bother to do the math (and why would you?), the outcome becomes immediately apparent as soon as you see the kill ratio take shape in the first 10 seconds of battle. It does not change.This title is called ""Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator,"" but there is no simulation happening, it's only ""epic"" in terms of scale, and the result hardly resembles an actual battle. I can't recommend the game in it's current state, even for $14 USD. A game of rock-paper-scissors has more depth to its mechanic than UEBS."

,Not Recommended,616560,31147965,Posted: 14 April,all,Kyubey,"I think it's a cool concept that, if continued to be worked upon, can turn out to be a truly wonderful game - but for that to happen, they must drastically improve the AI and control over battles. As it is now, you can watch a fight break out, but the results are rather predictable and variety of fights are minuscule.Fight dispersity isn't great - it's more 'follow the nearest enemy until it's dead"" ""head on""- No amount of strategy or intelligence is happening during these fights, which means the only interesting aspect of this game is the sheer size of the battles, which admittedly, is pretty cool - but grows old fast.I'd like to see more complexity in the AI or group maneuverability.Specs: i7 6700k, 1070 gtx"

Definitely needs workshop support, a lot more units, and more features for me to recommend it.For example, there is very little variations between melee units apart from their models and animations. Ranged units similarly differ by their models and animations but also their projectiles. After reaching the point where you'll have a Super Chicken fighting an army, you'll already be bored."

It's handled by a single dev which I think is fantastic but it needs alot more beef on it's bone before it can be considered worth the price. However its groundwork is great it just needs some UI improvements and things like more God powers and units before I can give it a positive review.*In response to Dev* 7/6/2017Your game has now reached the 1.0 standard and is marked as a full release title, your game is now ""complete"" by your standards. My review simply states this game is not complete, there are many things that need to be looked at and refined and if you cannot take constructive critism then thats poor practice. In response to your comment about units 3 hours is plenty of time to see all units in action because theres so little content to cover :)"

76561198302793116,Not Recommended,616560,34152915,Posted: 10 August,all,johneafc18,"UEBS is a great idea for a game, but I dont think it was executed as well as it could have been.(quick final verdict at bottom for those that dont want to read all of this)Full Review:PROS-crazy battles. here are some examples:  Zombies vs. Dwarves, WW2 soldiers and Spartans fighting tables aided by an army of santas, etc.-customization. although very minor at this point, you can customize stats like health, attack, speed, and projectile. This would allow you to have super speedy zombies that run like mad fighting very powerfull roman soldiers.- Theres some minor details here and there that make the fun, but I honestly only mention it because I cant think of any other major proCONS-lack of workshop/modding. I know that its being worked on at the moment, but it should have been released ALOT earlier in development, or at least before this game went into version 1.0 and left early access. The whole point of this game is to have big crazy battles, but at the moment the variety is very low. Workshop support could also add things to the game that couldnt be officially added for legal reasons ( Star Wars units, DOOM units, XCOM, Minecraft, etc.) which would of really kicked this game off.-Simple AI. The Ai in the game only has two real modes: stand still and go towards enemy. You also only have any control over this if you go into leadership mode, but the design of it is still not the greatest. I think a system like how the Total War games work (where you macromanage your military coulumns) would of added more to the gameplay. The AI in its current state is too simple and will not strategize in any way.-lack of complexity. You can only have a certain number of ""groups"". You can change what unit,team, size, and layout it is (one big line or compact), but because of the group limit you cant create big complex battles with many different units and multiple fronts everywhere. You can still attempt it, but it will not be too complex.-limited unit types: there are long range(arrow and gunfire), melee,catapult (units that can attack long range over walls or the enviorment), and heroes. It may seem complex but melee all do the same thing, longe range just has a projectile change, catapult is, well, a catapult, and heroe units are just unique looking melle/long range units with alot more health (the customization kinda ruins them, since you could just give a regular unit a ton of health too).-FPS: some people have huge fps drops, and I too have exsperienced this. Its kinda exspected since you could have literally thousands of units on screen, but seeing as that is the point, there should be optimization to fix this. I do understand the devs position though on this subject, since FPS stablization is difficult to maintain with all the different computers and such running the game. Computers are complex machines unless its what youve studied for four years plus. Even the big guys in the tech industry have trouble keeping up with it all.( now getting back on track..)-released too early. I followed the game way back before it was on steam. I watched the videos on youtube while it was being developed , and ended up buying within its first few weeks of release. I really wish the developer wouldve spent more time to finalize his idea. Once games are realeased, they are open for the very opinionated gaming public to judge, and people natuarlly dont like paying full prices for incomplete games. I took the risk and bought it to support the game, and myself aswell as many others understood that the game was still early access and get better, so we held back our opinion. but know the game is out of early access and by all definitions can now be judged as a full game.Final verdict:UEBS is, at the moment, what I call ""youtuber shovelware"". basicallywhat I mean by this is its a game thats fun for 3-5 hours but gets boring fast, and could just be watched by some youtuber for free without actually missing anything. The game left early acces way too early, and it might of also needed more development time before it was released on steamSCORE: 4/10.  Wait until Workshop support kicks off and more updates roll in to buy this gameIts a fantatic game idea that was not executed as well as it could have, and at the moment just feels like some copy of TABS. I also want to quickly note that i am not hating on this game. I have followed it for awhile now and I do hope that it gets better. I am just trying to inform the public as to whether they should buy the game now or wait till some more updates and workshop support rolls out. If I was ahting on this game I would not spent as much time as I have writing this review.  Constructive critiscism is never adequately given, and I do hope UBES has a better future."

76561197997397982,Recommended,616560,31185108,Posted: 16 April,all,AntiSocial,"I really enjoy this simulator.  Quite frankly, I've always wondered how 25000 chickens would fare against 1250 WWII soldiers.  Spoiler Alert:  Not well at ALL.The graphics are pretty good, though not amazing.  But I'm ok with that on the grounds that this is one dude grinding out code and .... well ... this exists.  The simple fact that Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator exists at all is just amazingly fun.From a technical standpoint, this game is not as resource intensive as I had thought it might be.  However, it is still quite hungry.  According to the Steam overlay, the 25K chickens battle only averaged about 12 FPS until about half of the chickens were dead at which point it started coming back up slowly.  This may be chicken-related and I'll have to test some more.  THen again, rendering the map along with almost 27000 entities is going to cause some performance issues.  Regardless, my 6-core Xeon and R9-390X happily ground its way through the simulation just fine.There are currently only 3 maps and a fairly limited number of units available.  I suspect more are coming and I look forward to that.  More things are always better, of course.  But, in this case, more is everything.  Personally, I'd rather see new units prioritized over new maps.  I feel that the addition of more units will produce better replayability more quickly than new maps since the map takes a distant back seat to the units in these simulations.  I have to admit, though, that a map creator would be nice.There are some technical issues.  The most infuriating issue is that the game does not capture the mouse.  this is probably not a big deal on a single-monitor game rig, but it is kind of a big deal on multiple monitors.  Once the mouse leaves the game, if you click on ANYTHING else, the game minimizes itself.  Now you get to play ""find the mouse pointer"" and then bring your game back up.  It sounds like a small thing, but good LORD is it irritating.The next issue is that the game engine isn't very smart about the way it spawns in units.  At one point, I was facing off soldiers vs. chickens on the World of Thieves map and trying to use the castle as cover for the soldiers.  I tried to man the walls of the castle.  However, when I started the battle, it spawned the soldiers INSIDE the walls (I think) and they immediately died.  In another instance, on Avalanche Canyon, I placed the soldiers at one end of the canyon, and the chickens on the other.  When they spawned, I immediately lost ~300 soldiers who spawned inside the rock of the mountain.  It seems strange that they cannot spawn on top of a mountain that they CAN walk over.All in, I'm enjoying this game.  I recommend it as a time filler.  Gotta clean the house?  Set up a MASSIVE and ridiculous battle and throw it up on twitch.  Watch your battle unfold while you clean.  Makes the world a better place!"

,Not Recommended,616560,32224022,Posted: 6 June,all,[REDi]1R CAPT Owlcoholic [A D],"Fastest I've ever seen a game with such a big scope rushed from prototype (on the Unity forums) to early access to full release.I'd be fine if the game was feature rich but at the moment there's not a huge amount of units to pick from, there's a severe limit on amount of 'teams' (ie amount of different units), there's only 2 base level commands (hold ground, in which they literally stand still and never move and attack in which they charge at the closest enemy unit) which could quite easily be expanded to accomodate things like, hold ground until enemy close, delayed charges etc.The thing is, when people suggest these things the moderators simply say that these features should be coming once the dev starts working on proper commands etc etc.If he still has entire areas of the game he has barely touched development-wise and has plans to include these basic features that people would expect then why is the game considered 1.0 and out of early access? To me it looks and feels like a beta at best. An early beta.I definitely have hope for the game in the future though and I will be happy to change this review once the game is polished and includes the kinds of features one would expect.And before anyone says, I know it's a single developer and I know the main idea for this game is to show an example of having lots of models interacting at a huge scale but that's all the more reason to stay in early access longer and use some of the money he received to actually hire some modelers, animators, coders etc and make the game feel more like a game and less like a side project that went viral on youtube."

Don't get me wrong it's pretty dope that you can have tons of enemies on the screen at once fighting it out but It's another one of those overhyped Unity indie games. The AI is VERY basic, all they do is run towards the nearest enemy and attack or shoot if they have ranged weapons and literally just stand there until they get killed and have simple pathfinding. The game gets boring real fast, it's cool the first few times.

The graphics haven't been improved at all, the AI is only slightly better, and the UI is still terrible. How this is a full release is mind boggling.Since this full release, the developer has added ~10 more units to the game. Sounds cool, right? No. None of the units have any variation in their animations, designs, or ♥♥♥♥ing anything for that matter. It is the exact same model fighting other twin models with the exact same attack swing over and over and over and over. This is a complete embarrassment. And to touch on these new units, they are the same♥♥♥♥♥♥quality as the other ones. More and more free/one dollar Unity assets.AI is slightly better, that means more epic battles, right??? No. That's not what it means at all. Some of these units like the catapult and the cyclops are lazy and half finished units with only one means of attack. You're telling me that this giant cyclops is just creating rocks from the ground and hurling them 24/7? It would be really cool if you could switch him from ranged to melee, but that might actually require something more than a♥♥♥♥♥♥Unity asset you picked out from searching ""big ogre guy"" on ♥♥♥♥ing Google.But what about the maps? IIRC there are about 3 new maps. These maps aren't anything special at all. The ""city"" map is just a few skyscraper models placed on a desert with some roads connecting. I don't know what kind of cities this dev has been looking at, but this is not a ♥♥♥♥ing city. Not to mention that the terrain and buildings look like something out of a Spiderman game from 2007, with really lacking detail and just tiled all over the place without any interesting geometry on any of the buildings. The only good thing about these new maps is that the AI doesn't get stuck on sides of buildings anymore.The UI/menu of the game hasn't changed. It's still the same helmet sitting in the sand that some high school kid made within five minutes on Blender. It's still painfully low quality. You can't change anything other than the number of the units, the location, and what direction they're facing. Granted, the game has implemented a ""stay or run off and fight"" mechanic, which is appreciated. But that doesn't make up for the lacking amount of units you can even put on the map. There are 8 teams, and no more. It would have been much better for there to be more teams, so you could make a large, complex battle. But really, that's not what this game is about.This is not an ""Ultimate"" battle simulator by any means. This is an ultimate disappointment with epically terrible graphics. The AI is only slightly better with the addition of working pathing, the units still have no variation, no editable stats past their health, and look like a fever dream inside of Maya 3d. The new maps are simply low quality assets plopped over some hills with a texture on them. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. 3/10.Old Review:It's fun for a little bit, but as of right now, there's a real lack of units, maps, and things you can actually do in the game.With the game still being in beta, it is understandable for there to be some issues with it's current state. However, some of the issues in this game cannot be overlooked. For one, the AI's pathing is simply broken when it comes to cliffs and villages. Whole parts of the army will get stuck trying to run towards the enemy through walls or buildings, breaking immersion and fun. It's an especially large problem since most of the maps feature cliffs and jutting walls everywhere.There is a varied amount of units, but it doesn't quite feel like the ""Ultimate"" battle simulator everyone expected. There are Medieval units, Ancient Greek units, and a few standalone units like zombies, orcs, and WW2 soldiers. It's a nice touch that it isn't just ancient warriors, but why just American WW2 soldiers?The animations and model quality in this game are sub par at best. I mean, with the spartans looking like they were ripped straight from some five dollar Unity asset pack of ancient warriors, it's hard to actually feel ""Epic"" watching them fight. Most of the time the units display the exact same attack and it becomes monotonous watching these rigid animations play out over and over and over again. And on that note, the WW2 soldier's rigging is absolutely embarrasing. If you look closely at the units, they aren't actually holding the gun. The gun is simply clipping through both hands. Not to mention the awful muzzle flash which for some reason you can see across the map.In conclusion, the game is a bit of fun for thirty minutes or so, but after that you begin to see the cracks and flaws which make up a huge part of 'Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator'. I would not recommend this game in it's current state, as it is boring for the most part"

I pack a bridge full of spearmen, with a cliffside packed with archers as support, and then had enemy cavalry try to take the bridge. In real life the cavalry would almost certainly be incapable of taking the bridge, but in this game the cavalry had no issue getting across the bridge just riding straight into the spearmen. If you can't atleast use the most basic of battle tactics then what's the point of the game? Just watching digital morons(edit* Simplistic AI with mathematical values determining strength) pound into eachother isn't fun(edit* in my opinion). And the posses ability did not work properly for me either.Edit: To make sure people get what I'm trying to say my issue with the current version is that the AI  and combat interaction of the NPC's does not in my opinion accurately represent the advantage that certain unit types should have over others. I would probably give this a meh rating if I could as it is not inheritly bad, but rather that I see little value in the current build with it's seeming lack of strategy."

But this one game I played fully met my expectations of what this game was going to be. I've been following the dev on youtube and subreddit for a while now, and nowhere does it include anything that I didn't witness myself in this early access review.What prompted me to write such an early review was when I was reading negative reviews, mostly about system issues which I completely understand. But I did see some about content. The content in this game definitely is lacking, but I know this dev has been updating his game constantly before release and he seemed so excited about releasing this. I can't stress enough that THIS IS EARLY ACCESS. This means this isn't a full game, and that the developer has every intention of adding MORE content before final release.I am very much looking forward to more content and supporting this dev. He is the most transparent indie dev I've seen in a while, and I'm excited to see what his game will bring to the simulator-game table.Edit- I know people don't like it when someone makes an obvious edit, but I need to say this.I stand by my word on this game. Since I've made this review, the dev has released another map to play on(test map, not much, but still), and tons of new things to battle with! Honestly great game to waste some time on."

,Recommended,616560,31107905,Posted: 12 April,all,[PR] Riddick,"I've been following the development of this game for a few months now, and it's definitely doing a good job on delivering what it promises.My PC can handle thousands of characters duking it out, and the ranged projectiles seemingly have no impact on the performance.The unit editor is simple but, in its early state, allows for just enough customization to keep things interesting.There are NO RTS-like controls. CURRENTLY, the only way to control units is by posessing one (which is another one of my dreams; to fight as a disposable unit in a massive battle), and rallying units nearby to give them orders, which they stop following if you cease to posess a unit.I do hope to see RTS controls in the future, as that would only increase the control and unique scenarios possible.I also sincerely hope that moddability is a future addition, as I am a fan of things such as Star-Wars, which holds the potential for many amazing battle scenarios.OVERALL--------------------The game is in an early, but highly enjoyable state. I have very high hopes for the future of this game, as even in its current, early stage, with only 3 maps but a decent variety of units to send to their deaths, it is very fun."

The idea of having large-scale battlegrounds with units of all varieties of time periods and if it is a fantasy creature of not. However I can't say that the game is all that grandiose as it suggests it might be.Now, here is what I will say about it: It has a fairly nice first impression for those kind of folk who like seeing large-scale battles play out, but it is poorly optimized. It simply does not run well if you have a computer that may not be ""Cutting Edge"". I consider my computer to be able to run pretty much anything on high settings, so I am quite certain it shouldn't have problems running this game (Also I am currently away from my main computer so I cannot relate the specs I have on it). Also, the game is essentially ""Watch battles play out"", which is actually quite fun, but if you are looking for more than that, then I am afraid you are out of luck.Do I suggest the game? I kinda do because of the novelty it has, but if it runs so poorly on a number of people's computers (From what I have looked on the forum, there seems to be a few people having problems with it despite having decent computers). I guess I might have to refund the game until I hear word about it getting optimized better."

,Recommended,616560,32416744,Posted: 14 June,all,"Oaesiir, Beloved of Heaven","Be warned: this game is not for anyone not running a seriously fine-tuned gaming machine. My laptop runs most games at high fidelity with 60-80FPS, but even this game puts it to serious strain. A lot of this is the Unity engine I think, given how it was originally meant for much smaller games and this one really pushes it to the limit in terms of processing and graphics. I say this because that really hampers the experience when this game is intended for you to screw around with massive battles but your CPU can't handle your attempt at recreating historical battles on a 1:1 scale or any other massive battle you really want to try. Even on Potato the thing is still visually appealing, but not as much as you see in the trailers and it will still lag due to the sheer amount of what is going on in the game. In spite of these things I still find it visually appealing and fun to play, so make your own choice. Frankly I think the game doesn't need to be as high fidelity as it is, and the poor optimization for machines will hurt its sales in the long run. However, so far the developer has kept all his promises so I'll hold out for him to continue to update the game and open it to the modding community - which if he does this game will have an infinite amount of potential in sales.The game is as simple as it gets, really: you pick a map, set army compositions and teams, customize units stat-wise as you see fit, and then let them loose to see who wins. Just turn on that cinematic camera and enjoy some serious eye-candy. I find the game strangely cathartic; it's all the high octane action large-scale games might offer but without you actually having to do anything but sit back and watch the fireworks. If you want to get involved, too, you can! The game allows you to possess any unit on the field and like that you're right there in the action. From your possessed unit you can even issue commands to your allies that might completely change the course of a battle. If indirect influence is more your thing, the game gives you access to ""God"" powers that allow you to inflict changes upon the map and destruction on the armies on it. These abilities cry out for multiplayer functionality and while I'm not sure how it works it would be hella fun to play with my friends while we both command absolutely ridiculous armies.I mentioned unit customization earlier and it allows you to make some seriously insane units. Sometimes you'll find it necessary as the balancing seems a bit off in some battles. For example, there's no reason the Wehrmacht are so ridiculously OP compared to the US soldiers even considering the models. There doesn't seem to be any account taken to the fact the US models are equipped with Thompsons which could fire 700 .45 APC slugs a minute, meanwhile the Germans are equipped with their standard bolt actions. Whatever your position on World War II, the armies were not so stratified versus one another. You also can't customize heroes at all, which is a downside. Unfortunately this means most battles do come down to unit stats, but sometimes formation discipline and tactics will make a big difference between an army winning and losing. But sometimes the real reason an army loses is pathing; they get stuck somewhere and can't move, leaving them hopeless against their opponents. The AI doesn't need to be too terribly smart, but their pathing detection could use some serious work. However they do tend to do what you want them to in a battle to the death, so it's not that big of a problem. What can be upsetting is a lack of unit diversity; some more unit types for each race and maybe vehicles would be fun.The maps offered are good but the game as I've said before begs more: bigger maps, actual functioning sieges, historical-based maps or ones who's theme is pulled from famous fantasy franchises like Lord of the Rings.In spite of the criticisms I level at the game it is still fun for what it is; all it really needs is consistent updates and to be open to the modding community and the game will only get better. It taps into this boyish spirit of fun that motivates one to get a huge pile of army men and make them stand off and wage epic battles with one another while you throw firecrackers into the midst of them. It's fun to make your own stories and campaigns and let how the battles play out decide who wins and who loses. It's a great way to chew up time and enjoy copious vidya violence without having to actually do any of it yourself. With some optimization and mods, the game has serious potential and that's why I say it's definitely worth your purchase if you've got $15 laying around collecting dust. I'd love to see the game and its community grow, and with tons of YouTubers picking up the game we may see just that. It also has serious potential for the historically inclined; with realistic physics and, again, more units we could get some seriously sexy recreations of historic battles. Unfortunately so far I've only been able to get a few to actually work within the confines of the game, like Agincourt. But the game is still highly enjoyable as I said and is worth your time and money if you've got nothing else to spend either on."

This game is going to be fully released soon and currently it is NOT worth the price. You can spawn in a small subset of characters (about 20ish) some of which are ridculously overpowered (see catapults, cavalary, spartans, US soldiers, zombies) unless paired up against extremely unbeatable odds (15 million US soldiers).I would like to see this game expand on content. Perhaps add in some sort of campaign or challenges, a la Beseiged before this game is worth the price it's asking. Right now you're paying $16 USD when in reality, what you get is more worth 5.99.

As you can 10s of thousands in just one battle, feels amazing.- Large variety of troops to choose from such as Medieval to anicent such as Persian, Roman, Spartan just for the historic perspective, they are tons more to choose from.Cons- Graphics could be better, like I know this isn't a grahpical game, but they are not impressive by any means.- Lack of maps, In my opinion they are only 2 good maps to choose from.- It never spent that long in Early Access so, as you expect some of the game is far from finished, such as the animations and some basic things.- When using high number of troops, the frame rate goes down a lot, even if you're running on a high end PC- Lacks of control over battles, you don't get much of a chose to control what happens in battles as if you're a commander.- Also the AI are pretty dumb sometimes and they just do stupid♥♥♥♥♥things.Verdict: Overall, Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator is a fun game, it's just enough that I can recommend it, but most people would get bored of this game in a short time, I myself really enjoy strategy games like this one, I just really wished they kept it in Early Access a little longer as they still need to add a lot of things to make this game complete, because as of now, if feels unfinished. overall I would recommend this game, but only just"

The maker is creating constant updates with having new maps and more characters to battle. I couldn't get into the Total War genre because they are fairly difficult with being new to PC gaming, however I wanted to experience what it was like to have massive armies battle it out and this game nails that perfectly. I simulated LOTR battles just to see how it plays out and with the ""possess option"" you can even play as 1 of the THOUSANDS of characters on the field to give you a feeling of what it would be like to be one of them. So with all of my nearly 9 hours in the game and STILL having fun here are the pros and cons.Pros:*Simulate what it would be like to have massive armies battle it out*This includes having WW2 soldiers fight againts/with Spartan soldiers if wanted*There are: santas, penguins, kangaroos, T-rex's, chickens, Chuck Norris, zombies, turtles, tables, dressers, and much more that you can play as in this game. (and those are only some of the weird ones)*The combinations are seemingly endless with choosing which characters that will fight with or against as well as deciding which map to select (and I believe that there are 7 or 8 maps at this time.*You can also create your own character giving them any stat boosts or defects to however you like*You can play as ANY soldier on the battlefield*The developer is very active with updates*So far I have made 50,000 vs 50,000 battles (do not recommend doing that however)*You can make bodies piled up to nearly a mountain*AI is fairly detailed for having so many troops on screenCons:*Can get boring after a while*AI can be a bit stupid and just bunch up at times*Food is not a character you can choose (yet)All in all I HIGHLY recommend this game even at its current price. This game alone has justified my PC purchase because this is exactly what I wanted from a massive army simulator but most are too serious and/or difficult to have fun with (subjectively). UEBS is the perfect blend of silliness and seriousness when it comes to strategy games since you can be as serious or stupid as you please. So personally I give the game the highest 9/10 that is possible."

Also hopefully most of the negatives can be changed in future updates.Pros:-Simulate battles with tens of thousands of men made up of a wide variety of troops.-Great looking models considering the huge number of units.-All units are customisable (can speed their movement/attacks speed and buff/nuff their stats.-Can slow down/speed up the battle whenever you want.-The maps are varied and nice. They are large allowing your to fight in the forests, mountains or open terrain (up to how you place them).Negatives:-Currently load times are terrible when using a lot of troops and using high/ultra graphics settings. Also FPS drops dramatically when using these settings. Luckily the medium graphics settings are perfectly fine and improve performace significantly.-Commanding troops is terrible, you can only rally a small number of random troops at a time and they seem to do whatever they want anyway despite your orders. There is no RTS style command system for units (a la Total War).-AI is very basic. Either they will stand to their dying breath or charge maniacly like berserkers swinging their weapons over their head. There is no inbetween like an ordered march or tactical retreat.-Range troops are very powerful and nearly 100% accurate. You can nerf their stats but that doesnt stop them from being crazy accurate. I did a test and 2000 archers on their own slaughtered 4500 big charging orcs losing only a handful of men (flat terrain).-Lack of maps (only 3 current;y) and most teams have very few units.-Combat consists of swing and block. I didn't expect 'Mount and Blade' finesse but taking control of actually units seems pretty pointless right now since its so simple.All in all I would recommend a buy even at this early stage. Like many I've been burnt by early access in the past but still think this is worth the price and can see a great future if it gets the right support. Community mods I imagine will be very likely given the game engine and it was cheap enough for me to take the risk. If you have a lower end CPU maybe avoid until things are further optimised or just be prepared to stick to a 10,000 units or fewer.As a side if you do get the game make sure to nerf the zombies, no way 250 undead could slaughter 1000 roman centurions."

I can't even imagine what this game will be like once it's completed and once mods are supported in the game. You would probably have the crossover battles or battles you always wanted in a game like the Roman Empire vs Han Dynasty China. For crossover battles it might be Warhammer 40k vs Star Wars or Sauron vs The Lich King from Warcraft. This game has a really great potential to be truly ""epic""."

Already, there is a handful of nicely varied and massively sized maps, along with a good selection of units from different era's/ origins.  If this is what the game is like in only version 0.2, I can't wait to see what the developer will add as time goes on! At this point, I believe the game is definitely worth picking up, and it's plain to see this game has huge potential to be truly incredible as future updates are implemented with more maps, units, and smoothing over some of the smaller issues.

First thng i dislike about this game is the pathfinding issues, many times people will try and go through a mountain instead of arround it because an enemy is on the other side. Another problem i find is that archers will (most of the time) fire right at something instead of firering over it, this leads to them not hitting an enemy but a raised hill. I think that it is cool that you can get a group of people to follow you but, I would like you you could single out a type of unit and bring them, lets say you have some archers behind some heavy knights, but your arches do not have a good angle, so you want to bring them off to the side. You choose an archer press v and then rally, you have 50 arches but also 15 knights, this can hurt you defense and add extra obsticals for your arches  to get into position.

I spent thousands of hours playing on the map building mode of Stronghold Crusaders as a kid creating random armies and castles to fight each other. This is game is a lot like that. It's important to keep in mind it's a sandbox game with a single developer and not an rts from a large studio.Pros:1. replayability - (if a review says they're bored of the game they have no imagination.) There is unlimited replayability on a single map.2. Self awareness - Santa and inanimate objects are units. This game knows it's not serious and doesn't try to be.3. Unit customization - I'm hoping for more here in the full game but so far I'm satisfied. You have almost an unlimited number of different units with this ability but can't change skins.4. Single unit control - I wouldn't have asked for this or expected it but it's actually a lot of fun, especially since you can take on the role of squad leader and drastically change the outcome of a battle.. Or never use it5. Responsive developer - it's a single guy and I've watched him add specific units and other things as people request them.. It's impressive he's coding the whole game whole also responding to the communityCons:1. It's not an RTS - I'd love the ability to control units from a commander type position and put units into squads2. Attack/defend - in the setup screen you can only place units on attack or stand in place. I'd prefer more options like defend an area or hold for 10min and then attack3. Currently no steam workshop/mods4. Customization - everything needs more options but remember it's still in beta and just a single guy5. AI/Pathfinding - no game is every amazing here, but it's already drastically improved since the first release so I'm hoping it keeps getting betterWaiting for:1. More units/ability to add/create unit skins2. More maps/a built in map editor3. Commander view (but I'm not holding my breath) I want to be able to click and drag to select a group of units and give them orders or even a hud like in Total War would be amazing4. An ability to see more of the unit stats. For example: you can change the attack speed multiplier of a unit but can't see what the base attack speed is5. More than 8 teams.. there needs to be 20 or infinite6. End of battle stats.. How many kills per unit type on each team, etc7. Battle replays.. I'd like a recording so I can watch what happened from a different angle/part of the map and share it with others. I prefer battles with armies that start in various places8. An ability to add objectives like king of the hill or king mode where each team has a hero and that team dies if their hero dies9. Moral that can be toggled off/on for each unit type before starting a battle10. Buildings/structures/walls that can be toggled invincible or destroyableAll in all this is a great game and with such a dedicated dev I only see it getting better. If you think the game doesn't have much now just wait a week. There has been a major update almost every week since it was released."

However this game does have several issues that need addressing.PROS.Endless unit stat customization.Easy to use unit placement on a minimap system for scaling.While unit differentiation is currently small the characters they do have create a fun atmosphere (Romans, Chickens, Spearmen, Archers, T-Rex's, Penguins, Santa, Ogres, etc.).System is straightforward in its playstyle as of now so anyone can pick up a game and start playing/customizing.Maps are relatively large and scaled fairly despite there only being a few of themCons.Limited Units (Only a handful of Medieval, Fantasy, Animal, etc. units in each catagory).Player controlled units lack response to commands.Unit Control in-game is unresponsive/nonexistent.No customization of unit characteristics (stats only).Limited stat customization (Speed, Damage, Health, Range, Block) no customization of Damage Resistance, Dodge capability, etc..Units limited to Attack/Hold Position and ingame commands seem unresponsive/nonexistent.Player Controlled units have commands such as fall in/rally/on me/move/etc. however they have not been responding for me, not sure if this is a widespread issue or a potential bug.Only 4 Maps currently exist (they are rather large and possiblities on them are vast though)----The game thusfar is fun despite its flaws and I look forward to seeing how the developers add and change things in the future. This game could benefite greatly from Steam Workshop content, if it makes it to that point the possibilites with this game will literally be endless.Overall: 7/10"

May compete with other simulators out there.3. Because it is battle simulator, there are many ways game developer can edit and improve the game.But there are always negative thoughts and predictions.1. If developer will stop improving game by adding new things and features, game will be forgotten immediately.2. So far game is really vague and weak. No improvements = no players interest which will lead to what I wrote in point 1.3. Game price is way to high for now. I would decrease it for at least twice. It will be better if it will be worth 10-12 euros. Why? Income in short run is lower but outcome in long-run will be way higher because demand for buying game will increase which may lead to increase in it's popularity.

While the game runs well and the unit customization is nice, there is content lacking within the game. Is it the unit amount? Not at all. If anything, UEBS has a nice variety of units and is competent on placing them throughout the map. However, the game currently does not offer in-depth, in-game options.While I enjoyed having large groups combat each other, I would like to have seen the option of selecting individual units and moving them around, i.e. lining walls with archers or positioning certain knights in lines on certain steps and pathways to represent a castle on guard about to face a siege.While taking over units is a cool feature, I found the combat for some units to be janky and slow. If you choose to increase movement or attack speed, then prepare for some wonky looking movements to compensate for a slightly more natural DPS feel.The unit AI is basic. I do not know if this is because more advanced AI may hinder performance for larger battles; however, I would like to see more than units simply lining up, waiting for the next to be killed then moving forward and repeating the vicious cycle.At the moment, I cannot recommend UEBS. It has fantastic potential and I cannot wait to see where it goes from here. However, for the moment it simply lacks enough flesh to justify anything past toying around with a few scenarios. Currently, UEBS feels more like a tool than a game - and it needs more options and flesh to be a great tool.Either way, I look forward to revisiting this potential gem in the future after a few updates and see where it went."

The game is constantly updated and has a plethora of customizable units and large fun maps to make them do battle on.The premise of the game is somewhere more closely related to the deadliest warrior tv series.

Or customize your own super character and watch them still get their♥♥♥♥♥handed to them by Chunk Norris and fall damage.Most decent computers can run the game well enough.

Personally, I have thought of 50+ characters and 5+ maps. Also I think there should be a multiplayer(kind of). What you should be able to do is play against or with a friend on steam and be able to create even more massive battles where 4 different players have armies. Also you should be able to create your own maps(may be limited in map options). It would still be cool to make your own maps because you could have tons of your own unique maps.One bug I have found a lot is that a lot of the times troops get stuck in mountainous areas or fall of of cliffs instead of going around.10/10"

THE GAME CAN CRASH if your computer cannot handle the battles.It is totally worth the $15 I spent to get the early access version, and hopefully the developer will soon improve on the slowness of its loading times."

,Recommended,616560,31115601,Posted: 13 April,all,[IL] Excelcion,"In my two hours with this game i have managed a true progression arc that many games lack.My story started simple enough with a battle between persians and spartans. This then began a chain of escalating battles including... Spartans vs US WW2 Soldiers -> Spartans VS Wildsmen VS Footmen -> Spartans VS Zombie Horde -> Spatans VS 1 Chuck Norris. The story then begins to branch from reality as this last battle sets in motion a chain of events that ends with the unravelling of the fabric of reality.My progression continues to 1 Chuck Norris VS Massive Catapult Army which is where i discovered you could edit units stats. This obviously meant I was going to make a man eating turtle who chewed through men like a lawnmower and many others.The end began with the creation of a weapon... the ultimate weapon that was rather was simply named... 'Super Catapult v2' which had maxed stats all across the board except movement speed. I then tested a single catapult against massive armies of orcs, romans and chickens and none even came close.From here i continued my superweapon development with the 'Slick Rooster' Which was an extremley hard hitting and fast chicken yet had only 100000 health (Which is tiny compared to the Super Catapult V2) so was more of glass cannon for quick flanking attacks on superweapons like the Super Catapult.Everything reached a head when i decided it was time to unleash my new army against the mighty Chuck of Norris. So it came to be that i marshalled 10 of my finest Slick Roosters and 250 of my Super Catapult V2's on the other side of a bridge just outside a castle and waited for Norris to finnishhis pillaging. When he arrived i unleashed hell on him with hundreds of thousands of boulders pelting him each second from my catapults and yet he refused to go down. It was here i sent in my best Slick Roosters to sneak up behind him while he was distracted by the rocks.It was then, on that unassuming day in April that the whole of reality collapsed. Suddenly there was a bright flash and my catapults stopped firing and chuck stopped advancing with my roosters stuck behind him. Then, like the hand of god, my catapults started floating away moving through solid objects in all directions and my roosters sank into the ground yet chuck stayed where he was, frozen in time for even this mighty unknown power could not move Norris. Then, when everything calmed down, All that was left was a few catapults, still frozen in time and chuck stuck staring at them for all eternity. These two titanic forces had proven to be too mighty and all of reality broke in a bid to silence them.This story is why i must give this game a hardy 10/10 for it's amazing story arc, well done devs."

With a decent imagination and some messing around you can create very fun battle to watch, take part in, or command. Over time I have learned many ways to mess with the AI and make my troops act as productive as possible and even go as far to win battles against armies I have made much stronger. The landscaping of the maps is very diverse and leads to interesting battlelines. The many different locations an army may hold out is also a plus. The creator did a lot of updating during early EA and added a lot of things. That has slown down a bit, but there are still a lot of different troops in the game. While it could use diversity, I personally think it is good where it is at. The addition of mods will make this game great.I have 2 wishes for this game.The ability to add more army slotsA little better pathing. The troops bottle neck in places where they do not have to.I fully recommend this game if you can use imagination well and don't mind a low framerate."

Right now it's very new and is getting updates regularly, and I'm extremely excited for the new content planned by Robert! I definetely recommend this game, and for anyone who wants more specific details, here are a few more reasons why you should buy the game:1. The ""possessing"" feature seperates this game from all the other battle simulation games that have been coming out. It may be a little glitchy and not fully immersive yet, but it's new and I'm sure it will give any third person shooter/fighter a run for its money!2.

You know the one mate? I was at the battle of Avalanche Ridge. Yeah, the textbooks get it wrong mate, You wernt there! Let me tell you how it all happened; a true account from an old vet like me:We were a force of about 2800 strong, mostly infantry. Armed with basic rifles. Poor sods. We were against the Penguin Empire and they had a major force on the other side of a freezing mountain pass. Our leader, General Clucker, ordered us to charge through the canyon and regroup at the base for an attack. Those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s were waiting for us! A whole line of them opened fire as soon as we entered, and then, I saw it. Someone screamed out ""T-REX!"" to try and warn our Mortar team, but it was too late.It tore straight through our lines, flinging bodies left, right and centre, and it took 5 mins of constant mortar fire to stop it. Then the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s fired bloody volleys at us. Trooper after trooper fell. The bodies stacked up in huge piles. Our guns were useless against them. The stench of death was unbearable. And then the avalance came. It swept up about half our force. I was lucky, since I was quite far back in line.Our mortar team tried to saturate thier lines, but they all fell short. General Clucker called for a retreat and then, moments later, a sniper got him. He just turned into a fine red and white mist with an abrupt ""cluck"". Only 200 of us were left, and we were getting destroyed. Then, there was a white flash. The sky turned red and a huge mushroom shaped explosion rose up from the other side of the canyon. The penguins and any other guys left in the canyon were burnt to a crisp in seconds. The government deiced to nuke em to♥♥♥♥♥♥In the end, only 60 of us surivived that hellish battle. There was no reward for us. No glory, no congratulations. ""Just another day out"" they said. ♥♥♥♥ em. I went AWOL after that. They're still looking to court marshall me y'know.

The fighting units are basically one of the same replicated to the number you subject the 'team'. Their movements are lemming like and without life. Some have even labeled this as 'zombie'like' actions during gameplay. Even though there are more than a dozen of different type of unit, they are seem to be similar to each other in terms of hit power, life, etc..[spoiler alert] The exception is there is Chuck Norris, who is the Ultra Fighter who just won't die and can take down an army of 10,000 of anything.Bullets, stones, or arrows are the ammo types for a range unit vs melee ... well... it's just melee, and nothing to it.In the game, the player should be able to, for an example, toggle through the units by pressing 1, 2, 3, for a quick switch from one unit to another, instead of relying on the zoom, tilt, and pan functions that feels very much an outdated way of navigation.This game can also use more maps to allow more platforms. Otherwise, just 4 maps are just boring. Also, on the maps, it is dissappointing that no units can be placed on top of the towers for a little 'range attacks' from above... leaves very little room for creativity and... FUN!!!The background music is decent and does make the player 'ready' to jump right in. But, once the game starts, the music goes away where the sound FXs kick in. Unfortunately, the SFXs need some improvements as well. It's just does not tie in to how EPIC and/or ULTIMATE the game advertises to be.The visual demand by this game can be extermely taxing to one's computer capibility. Typcially, great games are associated with the demand. However, this game requires a powerful video card and processor for a smooth play. Otherwise, this game should not be considered. The Frames Per Second will die on you if you have a low performing setup...There is a lot to be desired for this game. And, one of the many things this game is desired for could be the simple fact the price the seller has set. It's too expensive for where the game is at the moment. Perhaps, one should continue to hope the creator of this game will find ways to justify the cost a lot more..."

These cannot be hit or selected for control. Keep your total sprite count within a few thousand. Check your system specs and start at 10k total. Make note of ghost sprites and post your sprite count stability in the thousands range.

This is for people to add and share their own troops, units, maps, castles, scenarios etc. With that feature in, I could see this game survive for a long, long time.Sure the graphics could be better, it could be more polished, there could be more units or more maps.

76561197966661634,Not Recommended,616560,31714454,Posted: 12 May,all,kingofblahs,"The idea is great and will be worthy when fleshed out, but at the moment it just doesn't offer enough strategic depth.  Although there are over 20 units to choose from, they are essentially just modified stats of either melee or ranged types.  There are several stats there, but the units themselves don't play differently.  You won't, for example, get a super tight phalanx structure from Greek units.  You won't get a tight formation from ranged units unless you set them to hold position.  No hope of setting them to ""attack"" and them staying in formation.  Shields also do not block projectiles apparently.  Shields seem like little more than just part of the avatar itself, as spearmen running into archers were still dying even when behind their dhields getting hit in the front with arrows.The AI is also very questionable.  Deal breaker for me was when I had 10 T Rexes against 1200 archers.  The t-rexes just spun around in circles while in the middle of the archer line as the archers picked them apart.  I set up a battle royale and had to end the battle early because some units didn't know how to path toward one another.This game does have some great qualities.  The maps are extremely large.  The battles can be a little interesting if set up right.  I especially loved watching urban warfare when I put heavy knights in the middle of the city and they essentially fought to their deaths to defend it while a swarm of catapaults came in, Spearmen trying to flank them and getting cut down.The problem is that this game is $15, and once you've seen that great battle, you've pretty much seen what the game has to offer.  Sure you can tweak it and see who would win if you did x or y, put another unit closer to the city or in a different spot, modified amounts, or like that, but that's all it is, just altering stats and numbers.If this game had units that behaved uniquely, like setting up volley AI for archers and angling their shots where they aim for the center of the troop line as opposed to the front line, making shields block projectiles, giving units more physics, adding support units like medics, a few things like that to flesh out the game would make it worth it.  Right now, the game is only worth half of what is being charged, and that's only because of potential.  Gameplay wise it's about $5."

I wish I had the control of total war but still be able to take control of that one unit and actually make a difference. It is really clunky in actual control at all whether macro or micro. I even think its not a very good simulator at this time.. total war is just better. The one thing this game does well is large scale battles with low fps but that is probably because the ai has very simple commands and path finding. I refunded it because I just dont see how you could have more then 2 hours of fun with this in its current state. Cool idea with very mehh execution.

You need a pretty good computer to do large battles 20000+ but it still runs pretty well on most things. Battles can run long and while you can speed up the battle the increase is limited to double speed so large battles can take 1-2+ hours.

Lots of the units are simply just retextured and given different stats rather than being unique.

US Soldier has no firing animation, has one walk animation used for all movement speeds, and one death animation. Check out the screenshots...notice how everything falls in the exact same position?

It's awesome. I have a decent rig and it ran pretty smoothly for the most partThat said, and as much fun as it is to have 500 T-Rexs face off againt 10000 chickens, the novelty fades quickly. It needs a modding community and a lot of new content to stay fresh (more units and more maps). It also needs technical work and more features. More god powers would be a good start. Otherwise it's a fairly interesting ""what if"" scenario generator, best started and then left unattended to see how it would play out if in fact a platoon of penguins were dropped into the zombie apocalpyse"
76561198208845752,Not Recommended,616560,34549101,Posted: 28 August,all,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡ °) Darth Zan,"This game is lackluster in these categories:- Not much customization in the fights. They just run at each other. No strategy, No thought.- So little content in the game that there are as many maps are there are teams.- Each character is just a skin of the last. One ranged character is the same as the other one, just looks different. Heroes are just buffed versions of whatever generic thing it is.- Anything you see on youtube is all there is to this game. You can explore most of the content within the first 30 minutes of playing.- So many load screens that it isn't even funny. You launch it, Load screen, you get into the game, load screen, you select ""Start Game"", Load screen, you select your teams and start the game, Load screen.In the long run, this game is lack luster and not worth $16. Its not worth more than $5 as something small to play around with. The addition of Workshop doesn't change the fact that these new teams people create are still only reskins of the game's main characters. This game is just a sad excuse for what its hyped up to be.You also need a highly beefy computer to play this game which leads to the problem of little to no playability. You get 30 - 45 minutes of play in before you get bored and about 67% of your playtime is in the load screens. The fighting is short and pitiful and in the end its over before you know it and its just not worth the cash you just wasted to buy it.I suggest putting whatever money you'll be putting into this to get something that is fun. I can leave recommendations for some games that you COULD spend the money on!- AVGN Adventures I or II- Mega Man Legacy Collection- CS:GO- Rainbow Six: Siege- Squishy the Suicidal Pigor buy yourself a nice dinner somewhere... That will be much better anyhow.Treat yourself better than the price tag of this game will.tl;dr- Lackluster in many aspects- 67% of game is load screens- Fights are short and take up less time than a single load screen- Price tag is x3 more expensive than what its worth- Game Recommendation List- Treat Yourself to a Dinner if none of the games tickle your fancy."

,Not Recommended,616560,31349877,Posted: 24 April,all,VaeVictus,"------ EDIT ON AUGUST 16th ------My thoughts haven't checked at all. Still the very same blank ""game"" that is very boring after a brief time. Modding has been implemented today, if anything, modding will be the key element to save this ""game"" from its abyssmal lack in gameplay. Even if it DID change I would still give it a negative review and that is purely because of its price, yes, nowhere near its value. Consider purchasing ONLY on sales.------ INITIAL REVIEW ------I liked the game a lot, it was very enjoyable... 112 minutes was the mark that made me realize the entire potential of the game was used up already, so I don't find it necessary to back this project unless a major update and more importantly interactive features are implemented. For the moment, I will refund as I fear most of the devs simply sometimes put ""1.0"" mark on their unfinished products. This developer seems active enough though, I hope he will continue on being so.One minor detail is that, the price for the game's current development stage is not quite balanced. For the moment, and mainly because it is an Early Access entry, it should be priced half I believe, then again, what's the point of early access if you're not going to support the dev right?TL:DR;Good game, amazing potential, going good so far as well, but too shallow and empty for the moment to enjoy more than 2 hours, not worth taking the risk of buying, would be better to wait a bit more to see how it turns out."

It is by far my favourite game at the minute, all of my childhood dreams have come true in this one title, large scale battles!If you are a fan of the total war series, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this title, it really does blow the doors off the genre in my opinion, and for £10, can't go wrong!11/10 just because I can put chickens against ogres!"

And if you want battles, Total War does it better.This is perhaps only product that could eventually compete with Total War. At the moment, it does not. But i hope in future it does. I hope dev gets money and can add s to end of dev, and make this better and better and more and more refined with more and more features and mechanics etc. I hope they aim to compete with Total War in long term.Way i see it, devs of this game could work on this to create engine, user interface and basic gameplay which they could eventually use as base for their next game, and that next game could get crowd funding and become competitor to Total War.Since this is developed buy just 1 guy, early access is perfectly acceptable way to fund the developer. If you buy this, remember that you are not really buying a game, you are funding a project. If you buy this game, don`t expect to get a good game. Think of it as funding a project. It is gamble, you may get good game, or you may be disappointed.If you are fine with gambling, then sure, buy it. But otherwise, don`t. There are no quarantees we ever get anything more, there are no quarantees that this will ever even aim to compete with Total Wars. It is always a risk. I have chosen to buy this, and i hope one day we get something that competes with Total Wars.But once again, at the moment, this is not a good game.

I really reccomend this game and you should get it now if you are thinking about getting it because you never know if the price could rise in the future. this game is gonna turn out good hopefully. Anyway I got some ideas for some heroes and some units. For the heroes maybe add some influental figures in history. Like maybe add Leonidus, Xerces, Alexander the Great,Joan of Arc, Atilla the Hun, Genghis Kahn. You get the message. For regular units you should add some type of archer character maybe in the ancient greece or medieval branch. Their should be a crossbow unit in the medieval branch and maybe some guys on horseback. Im not sure if horseback would ruin the game but if not that would be an awesome feature. imagine having a row of horsemen on the frontlines with infantry behind them. You should add differant units based on different ethinticity, Like add some Aztecs, Zulu, Spaniards,etc. You should also add where heroes should be able to get on horses. Add some more maps maybe one in like Egypt with alot of pyramids or one on the outskirts of Tenochtitlan or at least near so you could see it. maybe in the future add ocean combat with ships and artillery. There is endless possibilities for this game and i cannot WAIT until i see what you are gonna do with it. Know i fully support you on this game and im really looking forward to updates!"

As such, I can't recommend this game unless you are just blown away by the concept.Also, the only reason my playtime is so high, is because I left a simulation running for an entire day because that's how long it took for everything to run, and I've got a beast of a machine, most people will never be able to run battles of that size.   I couldn't even actually watch it, set the whole thing to record and skipped to points in the video, which was neat.   I got my money out of it, so I'm not even mad if it is abandoned, but I still wouldn't recommend it to a friend, or even a stranger in the state it's in."

,Recommended,616560,31128173,Posted: 13 April,all,Kidd,"It's a great game, but my only critique would be this:- Units need more animations. Corpse piles are made unrealistic if one side is swords and the other are boots. Add variety to the attacking animations as well, it's odd watching them all swing the same each time.- Add a bloodied armour effect to the units that have died or killed another unit. Heavy Knights especially would have bloody armour, it breaks the immersion seeing a group of heavy knights that just left the battlefield with perfectly polished armour.- Some of the units are suicidal in areas, like in the Crusader Town map, they seem to love jumping off the southern cliff closest to the town. Another issue is that sometimes the units get stuck in certain areas. To use the same example, some of the units get stuck and can't move near the south cliff as well, as if their legs stopped working.- Grammatical issues with certain words and phrases. An example being ""footmans"" instead of ""footmen"".I hope you take my comments into mind, loving the game so far. Keep it up!"

Theres nothing really to this game but set down some units and make them fight.Yay?Add some random objective/hard points for the computer to go after.Add some quests or something.If you really want to get at it, add some even at best-rudimentary multiplayer support(they did it with starcraft back in 1998 dude, you can too).In the end, this game, as it stands, gives about 2-3 hours of giggles but quickly dies a horrible death because it quickly turns into something that is about as entertaining as watching paint dry.Fantasy Football players, if they are also into strategy unit combat, will like this game, but not much else..."

However given the pricing, and the amount of bugs involved in custom units, lack of modern units, and limitation to 10 groups of units, i cannot give a positive review. If more unit groups are allowed and modern units are added, I will change my review status. Quite simply, I don't think this was justified in coming out of early access. There needs to be more maps, and more units, more unit controls. More god powers. I personally would like to set up many small squads and see how they interact and also take control of them at times. This is my reasoning for wanting more unit groups."

I bought it only a few weeks after it was released to the public Sadly, this game is optimized for a hardcore gaming computer, and my play sessions were bogged down with frame rates which never exceed 15 Fps, and a virtually unplayable 1st person, even during battles that only had about 1000 units. However, my biggest complaint about the game, is that every time I loaded a battle, 1 or more of the armies would not show up in the roster, only on screen, even if they were in a team of their own, they would not be counted in the battle, in some cases a team would simply not show up entirely. I was also plagued by musical and sound glitches, and when I attempted to return to the menu, my computer nearly crashed.This game has clearly had a lot of effort put into it, and I enjoy seeing all the new updates on Youtube, but I cannot recommend it as it is, because it is sadly unplayable on my usually very capable PC."

Great for as the title states: Battle Simulator. The $16 it is currently worth I wouldn't have paid it but it enticed me enough but needless to sya it bored me after 2hrs of gameplay. Sure setting up massive battles is fun and all and for a sandbox game it is  enjoyable.So the Pro's of the game currently:~Change weather and time of day~Fair selection of men to choose from~A few maps~Able to create your own soldier (via what they have currently)~Allowed to use as many men as wanted (too many though reduces FPS)The con's:~Small maps, currently 3 available to play (would like more or the option to create your own maps/share)~AI is subpar only having a charge or hold position thus no real flanking/orders.~Maps are a little dull.Overall would I recommend this game to people? Yes and No. No for the fact its still in development and there is not a whole lot to do (besides watch 30,000 penguins vs 400 footmen.) And various other things.

I am pretty certain anyone could make this by themselves over the course of a couple of weeks and YouTube videos on coding. This game was designed to impress and immediatly disapoint.The maps are huge, yes absolutely and unnecessarily huge. It would take the fasted unit in the game over 5 minutes to traverse the map from corner to corner. At first you would think that would be cool but it's a pain to load and you use maybe 10% of the map, 20 if you do a 30,000 vs 30,0000 but that's because of how many things are on the screen.Unbelievable lag, a 250 vs 250 you can easily get over 120 frames, 1,000 vs 1,000 that's pretty decent but you take a huge frame hit. Anything more than that however, goodluck.I have no idea or where I saw it but I did see the developer talking about pathing, he said himself he has ""greatlyimproved pathing"" but they still struggle round a corner but good for him for pretending to try.TL;DR This is a cash grab, not a game. It is barely worth $5 nevermind what he is asking for it."

This isn't specifically a UEBS issue, it's a steam issue, but if I had a little more fun with UEBS I wouldn't be looking for a refund in the first place.  There's no purpose, not story, no intent... There's no goals, and no measure for learning or progress.  This makes the game about as fun as opening Notepad, typing in ""YOU WIN"", and saving it to your desktop.Sorry for the brutal review, I can tell a lot of time went into making this, but it's been unsuccessful in amusing me & makes me angry that I spent money & now can't get the money back.  My advice: don't spend the money in the first place."

Obvious plus.Game loos okay in qualityCons:Not made well, at all, and I can see why this game is in early access.I'm not trying to personally downgrade developers quality, but to be honest this game is worth to me at 5 dollars maximum price.Here is why:Gameplay includes pretty bad framesGame runs on unity, not dissing the engine, but work on quality and optimization is deffinitely neededGame models do not varyPathfinding is very bad (for ranged units anyways)Units have no differing animations or textures besides what the base unit isAnimations are sloppy and pretty gross to look at even practicallyGame has no direction for using the interface and how to control the game basically there is no helpSo here is the verdict, don't buy the game at this stage. Why? Because there are a lot of early access problems, and this game is barely resembling an alpha at the stage as of now. I love the idea, and hope to see a game from out of, what it is now,..."

,Not Recommended,616560,31163038,Posted: 15 April,all,Hyphen,"Personally, I think this game sucks. For $15.00 it's kind of a ripoff. There's barely any content, the controls are terrible, and half the time, you can't even make some of the battles in the trailer. The game is so laggy and huge armies cause nothing to do, but watch. Controling a troop is stupid too. There isn't a jump button, and the pathfinding is terrible, so half the time your not watching, your possesssing troops to rally other troops to new locations. The nuke option sucks too. what's the point of an army versus army game, if all your gonna do is wipe one of the teams out completely? PLUS it's an extreme copy of TABS. Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. The devs changed the ""Totally Accurate"" to ""Ultimate Epic"". There isn't a campaign mode, making it completely sandbox, and TABS has an amazing pathfinding. TABS is toony and fun to watch with the strange mechanics. People flying in the air and ragdoll physics. I don't have enough middle fingers to show how much I hate this game."

I thought since I can play most games on medium with it being at a reasonably high frame rate that I could play this game at least at low and have the same results. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Perhaps my battle was too large but I simply don't see the fun in a game like this without making each battle huge and exciting. (The battle I made was MAX 2500 entities) However, I've seen multiple YouTubers play this game and with beast PC builds like theirs, the game looks incredibly fun.

,Recommended,616560,31266347,Posted: 20 April,all,TriggerMeTimbers,"Honestly a very interesting game. I know that everyone is excited about TABS but this game gives me high hopes. Graphics wise, I think that they are very solid and all of the characters and animations look really well done. The gameplay is very intersting to watch; seeing how enemies fight and how much damage they can really do. One feature that made me fall in love with the game is the ability to control a character that you spawn in. Watching people fight can only be entertaining for so long but that one little change makes it more fun. Being Chunk Norris and walking around slaughtering people is very very fun. I like that there is an active DEV who genuinly wants to make this game something that is truly amazing. An update was just added that put Dwarfs in the game and its really funny to watch little people kick the crap out of spartans and what not. TABS will be a good game but UEBS has a very high chance of being something that is better than TABS. I can not wait to see what else can happen to this game, what other creatures and people that will be added to the game. More maps are coming and that is another exciting thing. A great game I would give it a 8.5/10 and i have a feeling that that rating will go up to a 10/10 in no time."

I DO have a high end machine and I bought it for this very reason. to be able to play such content like this to compose a battle of my own to my own delight. I am amazed at how smooth this runs. I put in 40000 soldiers (10k to 4 opposing teams) and then let them have at it. The screenshots are amazing even. There really is a lot one can do with this simulator by getting a better understanding as well of how the numbers might play out in strategy for other gaming battle platforms.Right now it might be a toy for some , but for others it could be a tool.

My PC could handle 6000 vs 6000 units with 55 frames, which is impressive. But it has definitely some drawbacks.Pros:+ runs very smooth even when thousands of units are on the field+ cool diverse units, from ranged to huge to just crazy+ 3 huge maps+ some maps have hazards on them apparently, like rolling boulders+ time and weather settings for the map+ fast forward or slow motion+ unit customization+ change the units position and formation on the map+ let multiple teams battle against each other+ bodies wont despawn+ bodies pile up+ freeform camera+ statistics of the battle, how many died so far from which team+ cinematic mode for minimum HUD+ you can control individual units and give other units orders!Cons:- playing a unit yourself isnt very fun, it has no depth to it, you basically can only do the same thing the unit would do anyway- the controls, for a unit you posses, are way too stiff- NPC AI isnt the brightest, they tend to walk against walls or get stuck or shoot at walls- everything has only one animation, like attacking or dying, which makes it look very awkward when hundreds of units lay on the ground in the same position- no ragdoll (I know this would probably crash your PC if it was there, but still)- there need to be way more units and maps, but since its Early Access I guess they are coming- 16 bucks is definitely overpriced, it should have been 10A very fun sandbox to play around with. I liked the multitude of options and possibilities you can try out. Seeing a huge amount of NPCs fight is very fun. I actually gathered around some friends and we started betting on certain teams. Very unique sandbox, definitely check it out, but if you want a strategy kinda gameplay experience, you probably should get a Total War game instead."

This is not a game to sit down and play hours at a time. This is a game that you'd get on to either show your friends some cool/funny stuff, or to play for maybe 45 minutes. At the way it is right now, it's ideal for playing if you're waiting on going out for the evening, or just need a little relaxation for half an hour or so. I'm not saying it'll stay that way forever. The developer is adding, and may very well keep adding new content (for free I might add) to continue adding substinance to the game. I would consider it a complete game at version 1.0 to be honest. Some say that it shouldn't have been considered finished at the stat it's at right now, but I disagree. This game wasn't meant to be a different form of Rome: Total War, or Age of Empires. It was meant to play around.FYI to all negative reviewers: If you flood up over 10,000 units on the battle at once, you WILL get FPS drops. The fact that it can render that many units with the impressive graphics they have is pretty cool and I'd gladly sacrifice my FPS to get a kick out of it. It's a sandbox. It's meant to try and break your computer on.There has been a recent update to add Laser Knights as a hero unit and Tornado Troopers (they shoot laser rifles) and Mech walkers. It makes an awesome sci-fi feel to it seeing all of the lasers flying around.So if you are skeptical on buying it right now, fear not. I am sure more content is coming and more playable units will be on the way for more fun! I hope this helps! I think it's worth the 16 bucks right now. I can think of worse things to drop a 20 on."

For example a Bridge, a castle, a field, forests for battles.-Slow motion.-Customisable unit stats, such as Damage multiplier and speed, so you can tailor your units to make cool boss battles or 300 scenes etc.Cons which will most likely be fixed over time- Animations are poor (Nothing serious, but a refined animation update or something will be nice. However animation quality affects the lag so i suppose it could be justified)-A few grammatical errors.-Sometimes crashes and stuff on load up.-On slow motion, animations don't look smooth, but jerk around like your playing a low FPS game.

Firstly a point system would be cool, each troop could have a strength value so you can make armies with a specific amount of points, eg: archers 5 points, Giant ogre 15 points. This would be cool for if you wanted to play with a friend and balance your armies more.secondly, I think that certain troops should combat other troops, eg: spears should have an advantage if the enemy charges into them and certain armies will retreat when they have  lost a certain mount. eg: footmen 65% ; orcs 92% ; zombies never%overall 9/10 Really good"

I instantly bought and downloaded it, i have to say though -brief disclamer- this game will ♥♥♥♥ing slaughter your pc...so, the concept is simple AF, you can choose up to 8 teams of units, (around 20 types at a guess?) and then pit them against eachother, doing cool♥♥♥♥♥♥like changing unit width, rotation and of course, starting location. Currently there are 3 maps, a field, a city with a cool as ♥♥♥♥ bridge (try putting a 20000 chickens at width 0.2 vs 1 chuck norris at the other end) and an arctic map, which i haven't tried. I think the map variation is cool, keep in mind this game is in beta, and i'm almost positive there will be a plethora of maps by full release.Unit wise they're cool, maybe a little unbalanced as chuck norris (one of the two heroes) is a god and the golden night (the second hero) is honestly bad... However, you can customise units (tied to base models but given as a different unit in the unit selection drop down) with attributes such as speed, damage, ats modifier etc. This is a cool feature, you can make your own hero units, for example i made a leonidas spartan and a che guevara US marine (irony intended kek)now i'll talk about some things the dev should consider adding to the game:-match history-more maps/units (i'm positive these will come anyway)-more cool abilites (currently you can press the ''n'' key to nuke the location you're looking at, which is cool af), for example a healing aura or a lightning strike?-downloadable scenarios-set scenarios (for example, the 300 or themopalye)overall i'd reccomend this if you're considering it, good price point and it's functions (besides crashes if you stress your pc)  as a battle sim, lots of fun to be had. :mrb:"

I have also discovered that orcs are just unkillable which then got my thinking, it would be nice if there was a larger assortment of fantasy units such as dwarves, goblins, elves, etc. I also wouldn't mind a couple more unit types in the other categories such as maybe an option for evil could be giant spiders.With this game only just being released I did expect some bugs. The horses are extremely buggy when you take control of them but that is only if you decide to jump off of a hill side into a moat. As far as scale of units goes, there was no limit to the number of units I could generate which was absolutely fantastic. My PC isn't the most advanced but it could handle ultra graphics and over 10,000 units without any problems. 15,000 was also completely fine, it was only when I started going over the 20,000 mark did I released how much my PC could handle but frankly 10,000 units is all you need for one hell of a good war.If I was to improve anything then it would be the customise unit options, I wouldnt mind being able to change up the actually character model a bit more to make them easier to spot in the battlefield. I noticed a fair few units had capes so being able to change the color of those or maybe adding some trim to units armour would really help in knowing who is kicking whos♥♥♥♥♥This game is fantastic, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to watch a war unfold. Since this is still in development and will be changing in the future I am really looking forward to seeing what can be added and what the developer will do next."

However, there is a bug that causes my game to crash. I don't know what it is either that makes it crash. I understand this is a beta version, thus, the reason I am not very upset about it. Although, I wish this would get fix. It is not my computer's hardware as I have a 1080 and a cpu that is fairly decent (i5 4690k OC'd) so It is not my hardware. I am going to try putting the game on my ssd to maybe help with loading...but I doubt that is the issue with the game's crashing.

This is a very early version at the time of this and definitely needs more added to it. To start of with some positives, the games looks pretty good for a Unity game. Now the name Unity will often drive people away from games as it is seen as a simple and basic tool for basic games. This game unitilizes it very well by making large enviorments and models with good amounts of details. This game does have pop-ins though, but only with shadows it seems which is acceptable. The game has a large amount of units to choose from. Whether it be Legions or U.S. Soldiers and even Chickens, you can do a lot of crazy battles. You can also change the way the units are positioned and wether they attack of hold their ground. You can even make custom units with custome stats.Now on to some negatives i have about this game. The biggest one is the lack of unit commands. Once you choose whether they attack or hold, its like that the whole battle. What's even worse is that the units completely break their formation when going to attack someone which really ruins the battle tatics of the game. There need to be many more options in battle so that you can have truely epic battles. Right now you can only control one unit at a time which doesn't really add to the enjoyment of the game. Beyond that the UI is just ugly and primitive looking. The UI is very basic and stands out in a bad way.Overall i would say go for the buy if you just wanna♥♥♥♥♥♥around with Persians and Ogres, but for the people who want something strategic then i would steer clear for the time being. This game was obviosly made for fun and not seroius battle strategy."

I got some weird graphic bugs like white fields just popping up for 1/2 of a second and stuff like that.But it´s fine for now cause of beta version 0,1.

I haven't played even an hour, and the bugs/ problems are crawling out of the wood work.

When I tried setting overall quality to ""potato,"" it resets itself to ""high."" This can explain the lack of fps, but i'm unable to change to anything besides ""high.""2: I've descovered the ""nuke"" ability, and boy is it fun! The only problem i've faced was lighting freezes. The orange, meltdown lighting from the blast tends to stick to the scene until I restart the battle.3: Units with range ability tend to shoot in the direction the enemy is coming from even if there are obstructions. Example: U.S. military vs. zombies in the castle. The military shoot at the walls, and not the zombies that are in view. I assume this is because of proximity programming, but i'm no developer.4: The client freezes, or ""bogs down"" when weather is applied.

The AI needs more tactical/independent thinking instead of just charging forward (sometimes even off a cliff to their own death) and hitting whatever moves until they either die or win. Maybe the Romans can form their iconic formations before the battle by means of more sophisticated player command options. Or archers can line up on the castle walls/building rooftops and fire down upon the enemy in the case of being under siege.Some of the historical inaccuracies on namely the Spartans (they wore armor} bothered me as well.Other than these complaints I quite enjoy the game and I appreciate the time and effort that went into it.

I hope they add more maps, more heros, more everything its quite entertaining and i cant wait to see what else they add to it.  It fun for what it is, i don't know if they can make the graphics better, i have a sli setup and am unsure if it using both my cards but this does bring my 980s to the ground.

But I thought this game deserves mine.I'll start off by saying you will be hooked on this game for a good solid couple hours, I bought this game at 9pm the other night and I looked at the clock after a couple rounds and it was 2am.The amount of fun I had playing this, there was no stress, no annoying online people, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths where you killed them first but you still died, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Just the army you made to fight the other army and that is it.There are a few bugs here and there like AI detecting the enemys from far away through a building, so instead of walking around the building, they walk into it and get stuck. And not being able to change the formation of your army once in the game, only one battalion at a time, but even still they don't hold a proper formation. Which can be annoying because sometimes if you want a lot of soldiers in a little corridor near a mountain, it won't be able to fit them unless you are willing to get some soldiers stuck on top of the hill and the only way down is to fall to death.They do need to start making an update once a week only to include new characters to pick from as once you have played it for a while, they get repetitive.So this game is definitely worth the money if you're looking for a game to kill time or to muck around and just kick back with.

I think 5-7$ would be more appropriate at the moment. Still, if this game reaches its full potential, 15$ will be a steal.That said, there are a few things that are needed in order to really make the game reach its fullest potential:1) Campaign mode. (Along the lines of Totally Accurate Battle Simulator where there is a set of enemy units to go up against and limited resources to use for your placements.)2) A LOT more units with variations of attacks and abilities. Ex: Wizards that use magic. Super powered units. grenades. Dragons. Etc.3) A LOT more maps. The ones there are good, but limited. It would also be nice to have a wide open grassy plain type map other than the ""test"" map.4) Steam Workshop support. Not entirely necessary, but would certainly allow the game to rise to much greater heights.5) Slightly more in depth controls for third person ""possesion"" of units. Ex: With the heavy knight, be able to slash and block or slash and stab. Basically, add a secondary action of some kind.6) A few more options for unit behaviours aside from ""attack"" or ""just stand there while youor friend gets the crap beat out of him"". Like ""patrol"", or ""defend/guard"" (will attack and chase all within a certain range then return once all enemies are out of range or dead).7) Cinimatic mode/pressing ""C"" is cool, but sometimes seems to focus on totally random things, like one unit half way across the map no where near a battle that is already dead. So maybe fine tune that a bit.8) Allow for more teams. If I want to put up an army of ten different units and then the same on the other side, then I should be able to.9) Some kind of multiplayer or coop would be cool. Though again not necessary.10) Some more options for customization. Especially asthetic options. I want my heavy knight of ultimate badassery to look different from his run of the mill counterparts.All that said, those are things to consider for the future. What the game currently has is great and is done well: inventive, good looking, fun, breathtaking (those 10000 V 10000 (and up) battles? Awesome.), and quite well optimized. I will be spending a lot of time on this game in the future and I look forward to seeing the game develop into what I know will be an excellent one-of-a-kind game given the correct care.Score:Now: 7.5-8/10 (7/10 if low content takento consideration.Full potential: 10/10 no doubt."

Make your rifle squad to deal more damage/run faster etc.Non standard units, like tables and turtles. I hope this is greatly expanded upon in future updates.~Cons/where I'd like to see improvements.The UI needs work. The drop down boxes do not show enough options and you have to use a scrollbar to navigate them, which takes up a lot of time.Only allows seven different groups of people on the map at any given time. I would like to see the option of unlimited groups of characters.When placed on the map, only Attack and Hold position are available. More things like Patrol, or Skirmish etc, would be nice.More unit variation would be a plus. I'm positive there will be more, but as released, you could run through all of them pretty quick.Camera speed on the map feels a bit slow.I'd like to see morale implemented. If a unit looses too many people it can route. That could even be a God power.Scalable unit size. I want a super huge turtle."

But as far as I can tell, the only things added are new units, new maps, and more unit customization.More than 8 armies at a time would be nice. Any overhaul to allow me to set up more interesting battles with varied tactics would be awesome. As is, the game has a certain charm but it's worth no more than maybe $5 and that's only if the premise of a sandbox intrigues you.""Thus far, I've had a good bit of fun. Unfortunately on my low end laptop the best I seem to do framerate wise (with some 100 units on the map) is around 14-18 with constant fluctuation. But I feel like the lack of framerate isn't a big deal as it still feels decent to watch.I think allowing Steam Workshop in the future may be the difference between whether this game is ""meh"" or ""pretty fun"" for hours.Also it's somewhat worrying that I can only have 8 seperate units on the map. Obviously these can be huge in manpower, but if I want to set up a complicated seige (which I do) then having more than 8 seperate units would be nice. I hope though that either i'm missing something or that this will be imroved soon."""

I set  300 spartans to hold position and made the enemy team like 15,000 penguins or something, at the end the wall of penguin corpses surrounding them was maybe 15 feet high. If you've ever played one of the Total War games, and liked to do the skirmish vs comps more than play the actual story (when I play TW i set my team as the muskets and set the computers to indians, just to see them get mowed down), you'll probably like it, since its early access and new units will be added. This game will make you bust out laughing when a horde of thousands of kangaroos overwhelms a squad of thompson equipped WW2 soldiers. The game runs well, too, even with the huge amounts of units on screen, I'm able to run fraps and still have a pretty good non-choppy framerate. Dont expect a game though, I would suggest watching youtube videos of gameplay, the people always have a fun time."

,Recommended,616560,31473699,Posted: 30 April,all,[RoA]The Batman,"I highly recommend this game. It is really fun. Although in future versions, eventually the final product, more factions need to be added. For example, Ancient Egyptians, more heroes/factions both historic & fantasy wise such as Leonidas of Sparta, Julius Caesar, Realm of Chaos units in evil category, Karl Franz from Warhammer, Sigmar Empire in fantasy, King Henry V in heroes etc etc etc. The amount of heroes can be balanced. For example, you can have at least 2 lotr heroes, 2 warhammer heroes & 2 historical heroes.Different variety of elves need to be added too such as high elves, wood elves & dark elves. Of course, we need to see the elves not mixed together like the Romans & Footmen that have different colors of coat of arms & shields. If its possible for flyable and rideable dragons, griffins, centaurs, that would be cool. Also if centaurs themselves can be added as warriors like from Narnia, that would be amazing. Minotaurs too! Lastly, more maps need to be added too. Maybe if possible custom made maps but I aint sure. Although more siege/flat maps would be good for different types of battles. Maybe even naval battles can be added soon where you can choose an all water map and you battle which ever enemy fleet you choose to fight. For example, you can replay the Battle after Thermopalye where Themisticles is outnumbered against the Persian fleet. Than more villain like bosses that we can fight such as Sauron, a random zombie boss, a chaos lord etc.This game has great potential! I love it so far! Keep up the good work! Very impressive job for a one man dev to be working on this! Well done!"

,Recommended,616560,31200326,Posted: 17 April,all,Feels,"Not too much of a strategy game, just a fun sandbox battle simulatorI like this game. It has a lot of problems though.It's a sandbox battle simulator. There's no goals or objectives. You set up units and watch them fight it out. You can have insanely big battles if your PC can handle it. You can control a unit yourself but playing as a unit is really clunky. Once you die you can choose another guy who's still alive to take control of. You can edit units to create a customized version and name them whatever you want. You can't change their cosmetics though, just stats. There's a good variety of different types of units in the game from orcs to penguins. There's funny units like furniture and chickens too. There's not that many maps but the ones that are there are quite big. Overall I enjoy this game and creating my own scenarios. If you're looking at this thinking it's like Total War, it's not at all and don't get it if that's what you're expecting.I suggest making up your own scenarios to make the game more fun. I like to make a character and give them really low stats. Then I set up other units to protect that character. I call it VIP. It's pretty fun.List of some stuff I dislike:Placing units on the map screen while setting up the game usually leads to placements innacurate to what you wanted. If you place to closely to rocks your units can straight up just dissapear. If you place too closely to the map's borders they'll dissapear.Sometimes when I customize a unit they'll be permanently unable to attack. This only started happening since the latest update.Playing as units is very clunky and ranged units are extremely boring to play as since there's no manual aiming and you just highlight enemies with your crosshair.There's no in-game restart battle button so if you mess something up you must return to the menu then restart the battle.Some units are unbalanced like the well armed footman being less powerful than an unarmed zombie.When the Spartan hits an enemy, it'll knock them back. This makes them way to strong and really annoying to fight against. I don't know if you can even disable it. I can't find an option to so you probably can't."

It was just simpler to remain apart, as we'd move again and I'd lose the friends I made. I was very much an introvert. I spent countless hours having crazy battles with my armymen, tanks, howitzers everything. This game takes me back to that. It's buggy as hell, but what software isn't. To me, this is just a great game! With the addition of the mods, the game has gotten even better. It is seriously graphics intensive, so if you've got a less then decent video card on your system, be prepared to change the video settings. You'll have to. All in all, I am loving this game. I paid 12 bucks for it. Money well spent."

,Recommended,616560,34642449,Posted: 31 August,all,Kvothe,brilliant game it runs really well and allows for a tonne of troops without dropping too many frames i have a 1060 and an i5 6700 and i can fit 20000 troos on the screen with 20-30 fps. would recomend adding more selection tabs because now there is only 8 and it can be a bit limiting.

With that being said, a big thanks to the dev. for all his hard work, and even his acknowledgement on my own mod :)"
