,Recommended,616720,33220922,Posted: 4 July,all,Fenrir,"Before I start off this review, I wanna give people an idea what this program is. Live2D Wallpaper is a program that allows you to apply live wallpapers to your desktop, very similar to Wallpaper Engine. The main difference with this program is that you have the ability to personalize the wallpaper by adding Live 2D Mascots (identical to the facerig models) that react to your mouse, a background picture/video, effects, filters, widgets, music, etc. You can essentially customize to your heart's content.As a person that's been using Wallpaper Engine for quite some time, I was quite pleasantly surprised with this program and I've found myself playing around with the program, trying out a variety of combinations. While I don't see this replacing Wallpaper Engine any time soon, I do see it as a great alternative.One thing to keep in mind is that this program is in its early access stage, so you can expect the program to be a bit barebones. At the moment, there aren't many widgets/filters/effects to mess around with, and the workshop is currently full of anime girl models (this may be a downside for some, or a selling point for others).As far as cons go, my only real complaint is that Live2D Wallpaper requires steam to be open in order to run, and it can take quite a bit. I'm hoping this can maybe be changed in the near future, but it's not a deal breaker for me.For $3.99, you can't go wrong with Live2D wallpaper. I look forward to seeing this program expand and include a variety of new features down the road.Edit: 08/18/2017It appears that this program is certainly making progress. The workshop is still lacking variety, but now we have the option to use 360 videos for backgrounds, which is quite nice. While this hasn't caused any performance issues on my end, I do worry about lower end PCs.While I'm at it, I feel I should address some of the noteworthy changes that have been made. This program has gone through a few name changes, with the new current name being Live2DViewerEX (quite the mouthful), and its base price has increased to $4.99. I'm still unsure as to why these two changes happened, but these changes are too minuscule to affect my review. The program is still reasonably affordable, and it has only gotten better with the recent updates."

,Recommended,616720,34345424,Posted: 19 August,all,SirTyrent,"Amazing software that, if combined with other software can become extremely powerfull.Personall I use this in co-operations with Stardock's Fences which can also be purchased on steam.Now. This has a lot of similar capabilites as Wallpaper engine. I don't think either is a recplacement for the other.Both do something the other don't and offer huge possibility's.Both of the developers for this and WE are extremely nice and open for suggestion.If you can't decide which to buy then I highly reccomend buying both. Neither will disapoint."

76561198045635377,Not Recommended,616720,34439915,Posted: 23 August,all,Lanti,"Before I go much into detail, I just wanna say this:Live2DViewer is still a pretty nice tool and very easy to handle for those who simply want a cute animated second screen or something like that, still while I was testing it, I stumbled over a lot of things that I didn't particularly like.Pro:- Very responsive UIIt's clean and easy to find and adjust things, this is actually very well done.- Many different customization optionsPictures, Videos, Filters, Effects, Widgets, there's plenty to pick from.Con:- The Engine.On my search for the actual model files, I discovered that this tool is actually using Unity Engine. Now I'm not trying to ""hate"" on it because it's using Unity. It's just that the usage of a full blown Game Engine for something as simple as a desktop tool that, in some or even most cases will constantly be running in the background is absolutely overkill and unneccessary. Which also brings me to my next con.- Memory UsageI had it running on one screen in FullHD, displaying a video with 60FPS and had the model it comes with pretty small somewhere in the corner. It used a whopping 300MB of RAM for just that.As a comparion: Wallpaper Engine, running 3 different videos (all 1920x1080@60) on 2 fullHD displays and one 2k display didn't even use 70MB of my memory.I know in our day and age with people having 16GB of Ram by default it doesn't look much, but it's just unneccessary waste of space.And it's pretty much what you get for using a fully blown game engine - that was not build to modify your desktop - instead of natively written code for this specific purpose.- Editor not includedAs I read the description I stumbled over this little bit ""[...] and lpk files(a format from Live2DViewerEX)"", so I though, hey, it's this programs file format, so surely there should be a way to create them, right? Eh... nope, turns out another program is needed for that. Either clarify this or add the Editor, please.- Little variety in content in the WorkshopThere's the mainstream anime characters, a couple videos to test out things and that's pretty much it. I get that the tool is in early access, but I figure if it would be made more clear how to actually create content for it or include the editor in the actual program, there would be more people trying their hands on it.Conclusion:While being very simple to use, it's still far inferior to what I see as the main competitor (namely wallpaper engine), both in performance and in content. For a tool that will be running in the background of whatever you're doing on PC, be it just browsing or playing games it is absolutely crucial to be very adaptable in it's usage of system resources and so far I could not observe this with this tool.This is the main reason why I'm currently not recommending to get Live2DViewer in it's current state."
