The biggest thing for me is the developers with the game.  I’m sure you read the negative reviews just like I always do and some of it is true.  There are a lot of things that need work but you can look at the discussions on how they respond.  I have got a response every time I have had an issue.  These Devs are committed to make this game awesome.  That alone would make me support them.  The content gets better every day.  In less than a month this game has transformed into a great playable game with very few show stopping bugs at this point.  If you don’t know if you want to buy then look at the discussions and see how committed the developers are."

And to be honest, following experiences in Stranded Deep, it feels great to not just punch sharks, but to shoot them, string them up, chop them up for their meat and grease, and run your engine on their corpse-juices.  The crafting system is also interesting.That said, maybe it's just me, but something about the economy in this game seems broken.  So many times, it seems like you play this game and it is killing time until you run out of fuel.  Farming pirates, sure.  Taking down platforms, ok.  Building up your own base, nice feature, but since you live off your boat, and can't craft on/don't get perceivable bonuses from having a home other than the boat, I don't really see the point.  It's a good price for a not-so-great experience.  And perhaps it was my copy, but that running of the engines on the refined blood of sharks, I actually couldn't do.  I could make the fish diesel, but it wouldn't work in my engine.  All this combined with an inefficient boat, a simplistic economic system of shops charging twice the value of any good, all shops having the same prices, and ultimately, the value at sale of manufactured products being not much more than the value of the goods and whale oil going in plus a little extra (but only sometimes) means lots of running around trying to make ends meet until eventually, you are in a boat out of gas.I really feel like giving a more negative review, but let me ennumerate exactly...Pros-shooting sharks is awesome-interesting setting and environment-unique and intriguing research system-pirates make for good enemies on occasionCons-pretty much just the economyTo be honest, if the economy was fixed, I would whole-heartedly recommend the game.  The only reason I can think for leaving the economy as it is is that the creators want to show how even in an apocalyptic future, business owners will keep oppres----♥♥♥♥♥♥  Ecotech detected my hack!

It's very very good. I can see it taking over my life for a while lol.It's Waterworld: The Videogame. I actually can remember thinking about 4 or 5 years ago, 'why doesn't someone make a waterworld style game where I can scavenge, kill and build in a giant waterworld. And alas it's like these dudes heard my thoughts!In early access atm. But having a look through the updates. These guys are tearing their way through this game like no other. I watched a vid of it from May. Which as of this review is just 2 months ago. And it was a completely different game nearly. They have added so much to the game and are continuing. I like that they respond well in the discussions. And are putting in tonnes of things the fans want in the game. There are your typical bugs here and there. And the textures could get a little better on some models in the world. But nothing major that can't be sorted out.You start off with your own little boat. And it is really awesome. It reminds me so much of the jaws boat lol. You can fish. Hunt. Have firefights with pesky raiders. Trade with weird medieval-looking folk lol. Scavenge for scrap, loot, boxes and barrels with items in them in the ocean. Recently-added deep sea diving in a awesome big daddy style armoured suit. And then on top of that, the best part is crafting.Crafting allows all the things you are used to seeing in survival games. Weapons, tools, items & best of all base building!!Sure you have seen it all before. But there is honestly nothing quite like building a home in the ocean where you can store all your valuables and whatnot. I played my first session for 5 hours. Couldn't tear myself away from it. :PWant to put 50 bullets into a shark and then stick it on the crane and chop it up? Go for it!There's a tonne of great fun to be had in the game right now. And it can (and has over the past couple of months) only get better from here. I'd rate this as my number 1 early access game to keep an eye on."

So buy it to aid the Developers!((NEW EDIT as of May 21 2017))   This game came out on May 10th, I bought it May 11th. Today is the 21'st and already i've seen 3 patches i believe. AMAZING!  So far a lot of things have improved and changed big time! The Devs deserve credit for constant bug fixes and patches so fast.When i first got the game, all the mechanics were hard to figure out. Now there's a tutorial and game hints that made this game 100% easier to navigate.  There is now ways to collect water, how to fish! Fishing is a pain at first, but over time you get used to it. But let's be real, fishing should not be super easy in any survival. So with this now you have a way to get water and food.The tips show you how to dive, although several times diving freaked me out lol.  I was worried of something scary eating me so i swam back up.  Loot is now so much better. There's loot boxes randomly in the water, loot boxes in the Raft Houses, and those pesky raiders on rafts now drop loot! YEAH!   There are birds in the sky you can kill for food now, there's also a change to the music in the game! Which adds a lot!  I've seen about 25 bugs fixed already in just less than 2 weeks and around 15 issues i had with the mechanics and how things were done, revamped or changed and tutorials and hints added!  So the fact the Devs are working this hard deserves credit!   BELOW IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW!   .... :D This game is worth it guys and gals!Todays journey.5pm.   Old man contacted me to tell me apparently about the story of me escaping from some pirates.15 minutes later I learned I am a female, and I got to see the pirate who is after my beautiful body! OH NO!5:30 Learned how to fish, look at water, press K.  It's not easy fishing but i did manage to catch 8 in 5 mins after a lot of practice.5:45 pm Learned to cook said fish, yeah me!5:55 I noticed something strange, the water began to roll high and heavy.  Then BOOM the sound of thunder!6pm   I climb a top of my boat screaming ""You call this a storm!""   Probably shouldn't have tempted the Big Guy in the Sky!6:05 OH S H I T the boat is rocking too much back n forth! Waves are tossing and turning the boat. I'm not sure if the boat can capsize but this is scary!6:07 I found a small raft house ill go inside and seek safety!6:08 Wave crashes into boat at the side and flips the boat as i Approach the raft house. Boat sinks, I die.LOL I would scream into the storm all over again!((This game is heavily patched by Devs since i bought it I have seen patches nonstop. It's still super early and it probably needs a few more patches for stable good play. But it's enjoyable.  Buy it to support the developers.))"

76561198304046780,Recommended,617030,33000883,Posted: 29 June,all,Bringthabass,"This is game is awesome. Granted, I can't wait for some of the kinks to get worked out and and maybe a little bit of a direction change but overall definately worth the money and support. The controls are a little loss and you do seem to move awkardly fast in the water, kinda like gliding. That should be fixed. The crafting is really in depth and although there is a tutuorial it doesn't begin to really help you with the crafting and building. After the tutorial you are kind of just thrown into the world. The graphics are right about where they need to be for a game like this. The pirates come up on these little boats and are easy enough to kill but their aim is ridiculously good. Although shooting back is fairly quick and precise. You should be able to loot their boats as well not just have them drop a box of loot. The boxes of loot thing in general is a little old school and lazy for a game like this actually. Also the view. I have not yet found a way to scroll thru views if you are able. But the view from the boat driving at either wheel is not great at all. Also the music is awful. I would rather hear the ocean and birds and a more realistic sounding boat engine lol. I havent began to get into all of the aspects of the game and will comment as I do. But so far I think this is a great project, and I only hope that the developers don't tank it."
,Recommended,617030,32261518,Posted: 7 June,all,jaunraeq,"Excellent start for an early release.  The game is decently fleshed out and is very playable.  It's a nice concept and not too difficult to pick up.  I've played for about 8 hours now just tinkering around with some of the mechanics and crafting and so far have only encountered 1 ""game breaking"" bug.  I have encountered multiple other bugs but nothing that has deterred my enjoyment or ability to play.  The dev's seem very responsive and appear to take action or explain every bug report/suggestion listed in the discussion area and they are pusing out relatively quick patches/versions.  It is still pre-release/mid-alpha stage though, so if you are looking for a completely polished experience I would tag to follow and wait a while.  If you don't mind a few hiccups while still getting to enjoy the game you should invest and support the dev team so they can make it better.Pros:* fairly detailed crafting system to include having sub-components to make larger items* You don't know every crafting recipe right off the bat; but have to learn them as you go -- you get to pick what you want to learn and then hack a network to gain the blueprints to learn it* very smooth gameplay (it uses Unity)* decent story line to get you started* the game is mission based, but it's also free flowing so you can do them at your leisure or just ignore them and free play* procedurally generated map and encountersCons:* Crafting is a bit cumbersome and can take some time to build things -  very slow to craft just a few items, but the time decreases for each additional item. If you are making say 100 metal brackets  it will take a bit to make the first 5 or so, but the remaining 95 will happen in less time that it took for the initial ones.* NPCs are pretty weak at this point in the game - basically give you a short dialog text but no real interaction ** exception are mission related NPCs* Building system is a bit weak - it's difficult to find the sweet spot to your plaform to add a wall or add in stairs with the rolling of the ocean even in calm waters.* alpha bugs :)"

There are silly things like when the sea is choppy, you can't use the the crafting menu because it keeps disappearing as the boat goes up and down, almost as if you have just walked away from the menu thus it despawns, and so you have to wait quite some time until the sea calms down. Fuel cans for the boat only add 10 and therefore do not last long at all, buying more fuel cost a fortune, 65 waal for 5-10 secs of fuel. As I said above, great potential but really just not there yet."

To sum up for those who like to get to the point: I wouldn't say this game is great but it isn't bad. For me, though, it has a special appeal that I think other people might be able to see as well.I've had real experience on personally owned boats and being out on the water and this is one reason I was drawn to the similar game of Subnautica. But Landless is vastly more succesful in capturing the feeling of those days I had with its atmosphere.Behind all its bugs and glitches one would expect from an alpha the sound and the atmosphere of the game manages to pull me back to those days, make me feel again what it was like to walk on those docks and hear the water splashing against the wood that shifted beneath my feet. So in a sense I have a weakness to the kind of thing but I think that it can capture such so well this early on is something to priase. I hope the atmosphere of this game doesn't change through the development process it'll be going through."

By that I mean more than your totally devoid of rhyme or reason early in release. On starting your actually met with a feasible backstory, a reason for this and that, and a goal.  Then along the way you have options to do extra quest, read ala' contracts, or not.The crafting is pretty straight forward, tho it did take a minute to get used to the layout.  There is quite a bit for building, and more shows promise for delivery. In the time I watched this title before actually buying I ve seen some big changes.A MAJOR plus, the devs are active. Most are in early EA yes, but these guys did  a rare seen thing that caught my notice. They admited to a mistake.  GASP IKR?  It involved completely dorking the crafting system for purchasers between this last update and the one prior. Ooops. But admission of error, and a QUICK release of new update ( not patch.. UPDATE ) had my attention.So I could not hold out any longer, had to get and try.I like.Graphics are good, but not beautiful in a few areas, however that is noted as improvements coming.Runs smooth.Combat is interesting, and varies as you progress.A tech tree that you can advance and unlock.Hunger, Thirst, Sleep and Weather factor in.Actually, only one thing annoys me...The generic greeting of all NPC's at the moment.  Ugh. It wore out 4 in. :pA fun play, a little more intense than SD in the survival world. But not Long Dark level.Oh.. NO ZOMBIES!!!  or cannibals, or aliens...Enjoy!"

If you see something thats buggy/glitched and point it out to them their on top of it which is really a rarity with early access titles.The game has changed quite a bit from first release to now which shows their really committed to improving/expanding the game. I'm enjoying just riding around killing sharks and hunting down npc's, theirs also missions to stay busy with. Theirs also weather changes when rain/storms come the water gets rough causing the boat to rock like crazy. Survival is not super hard just have to keep an eye on your stats which are easily managable.Graphic wise it could use some improving mainly the npc's look too old school graphics wise but they serve their purpose.

The tutorial and a few tips along the way help get you started.The objective of the game is to survive long enough to find a special group that has a lot of technology.Right now there are NPCs, though not very advanced right now. I suspect they'll get much better. The attackers - pirates and what not - are very simple and basic as well. Again, I think the devs will build this up a bit.Some hopes:1. Sailboats. I've always wanted my own sailboat and in a world where fuel is scarce, the wind would win.2. I can't seem to find enough fuel and I go through it very quickly. Whales should have whale oil and that shouldn't be difficult to turn into fuel. Also, fuel shouldn't consume 10 of my bottles making it. I get it if you want the recipe to consume water, but don't have it also lose my bottles! I need those.3. Map: I can't use that map to find anything. I'd love a world map overview or some sort of navigational chart so I can mark waypoints or other places.I assume future plans include some scuba gear, use of the diving bell that's in the town, more boat types, and possibly some flying vehicles. Also, please get us some good binoculars! Maybe some big ships?Really, the sky's the limit in this game. And there's crazy potential for some epic sea battles.

They pump out updates for new content and fixes for old and new content extremely regularly.

I like to fight AI and I like to explore so this game is really my type of game. Unity have made the long dark they have made a really good job whit that game and I like the picture there are building for landless. This game have a really big potentiel. Under and below the sea. I have good hope for the developpement of that game. If you wonna wait to buy it it's fine but you will miss all the work the DEV gonna put and the betterness this game will come from update to update so give it a try and Haaaaaarrrrr Haaaaaaarrrrr skipper :)

And before everyone screams ""but it's an Early Access Game"" I own, and have played, the following EAG's from their early days:Stranded DeepThe Long DarkAnimallicaARK: Survival Evolved7 Days to DieDie YoungSpace EngineersSubnauticaEmpyrion - Galactic SurvivalSo I am no stranger to EA survial games and I have never requested a refund, untill now. In it's present form i find the game confused, and unplayable, and i take no enjoyment from it. May be i will be back in 6months or a year. but for now Landless is not for me.To all of you out there reading this and thinking of buying the game, i suggest you take a look at Youtube, and judge for yourselves."

Landless has a great tutorial to help new players get started. Content for the game has been steadily improved since release.The developers have amazing plans for Landless and I personally can't wait to see what changes come out in the next update. If you are into playing early access games and enjoy playing the game as new content comes out. Landless is worth the cost. I whole heartedly give the Landless a thumb up.If you want to see the first 30 minutes of gameplay, look at my first look at Landless.https://youtu.be/MCkj270eGlsI have also started a Let's Play Series that I will regularly post new gameplay of Landless as the game develops and updated content is added.

,Not Recommended,617030,35255891,Posted: 27 September,all,Danger Dangle,"Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥.. this game is rough. The good reviews, well edited trailers, and neat concept fooled me. It might be a good game, but at this point it's pretty far off.AI is hilariousy bad. Graphics are worse. The under water area on the game is indescribebly barren and the trailers make it seem MUCH more than it is. There's obviously bugs... as with any Alpha game, but there are several that made me question just why they thought this build, or any previous build was even close to a release. The ""fight off"" pirates part is a hilarious misrepresentation of what combat is all about.Combat is as follows: Upbeat string music begins playing, you look around and spot a dingy with a driver and a man firing at you. The boat pulls up to within about 15-20 feet of you (every time) from whatever intial angle of attack they first came in on, with no variation, maneuvering, or semblence of any real AI. They cant shoot through the cabin of the boat, so you just time the shots and peak between firing, because otherwise the gunner WILL hit you as they have laser accuracy at whatever distance they can engage. Both driver and gunner take 3 shots each, if the gunner is killed first the boat immediately does a u-turn and tries to flee,  if you kill the driver the boat sinks, you get some loot. And then another one comes... And another. And another. Annnnd another. Until you destroy a beacon with 50 shots or about 300 swings of an axe. Enemies on platforms stand entirely still, no seeking cover, no running from shots, and no rection to being shot. As stated turrets and pirates can engage from a long distance and will hit you EVERY SINGLE TIME. So in the case of attacking a pirate fort... there's probably 15 people and 5 or so turrets firing at once, making it impossible to even leave your cabin.I'm sure if the dev is worth his salt and continues to work on it, it could be a pretty cool game. But at the moment it's far too rough. $15 is even too much at this point."
,Recommended,617030,34673988,Posted: 1 September,all,Omg_ImSoNoob,So I have played this game for nearly 2 hours. All I can say is this game needs co-op its simply amazing the concept and gameplay are fantastic I can see myself spending hours in this game simply playing with my boat with a house on the end. but for me to spend real time and focus on this game alone I need friends to play with I can only play by myself in the lonely ocean for so long. ps. False advertising found a small ISLAND

,Not Recommended,617030,33390461,Posted: 8 July,all,[S.C.] Worsin,"I like the idea of this game but wow is it under developed.  I understand that this is EA access game but this one in particular is REALLY alpha.1. The UI is probably the worst ive seen in years. Not kidding here.2. The mouse control of the character is wobbly and just bad.  Even for a game developed on Unity which has never been a good engine imo the controls are horrible.3. The graphics are almost all untextured at this point it would seem because they are not good at all.4. The characters and animations are worse than minecraft for the most part lolCompared to other EA survival games like ARK, 7D2D, Subnautica and a few others this game is not even close to their quality, not even in the same ballpark.Now that being said, all of these things can be addressed before its released.  I would just recommend not buying this game until it is WAY WAY WAY further along in development.  Unless you enjoy helping debug and game and if thats the case there is A LOT to debug here ;)"

,Not Recommended,617030,31896215,Posted: 21 May,all,FG-James,ATM this game is really buggy i tried to enjoy it but after crashing 4 times due to jumping in and out of the water at the first town(no i wasnt doing i ton purpose) it started to freeze when i got in the water and eventually the game would just stop responding and secondly i reallllllly dislike the crafting system they realllllly need to simplify it its soooo hard to craft anything i literally had to look up what i needed and pick up only metal and electronics too actually be able to build something or just not have enough space in my inventory to build all the materials needed for anything(like a battery which is also a crafting material needed for anything useful) and honestly idk if u could even build the basic stuff without selling or using all of ur metal or electronics(if i could ever get that far without crashing and having to restart). I'm gonna wait to refund it as they do patch it frequently but right now its more frustrating then fun.
,Not Recommended,617030,35058315,Posted: 18 September,all,Silent,"Glad I got a refund. The game is barely worth 5 USD at the most. Difficult to use GUI, barren menus, and a rather lacking tutorial for crafting. The game just seems lacking in some ways."

,Not Recommended,617030,32910547,Posted: 27 June,all,TheDaringCaptain,"A quirky game with a lot of potential, but unfortunately there is a distinct lack of polish and content to set it apart from the rest of the pack. Grammar errors, shoddy character models, and humor that seems almost unintentional detract from a potentially compelling setting. Fun to play for an  hour or two, before you realize that building platforms can be done in many other games that are already complete, or have more unique features. There is little point to building a secondary base since your boat is perfectly serviceable; Subnautica forces you to build bases to increase your tech level, for instance. Right now there's a lot of open space with nothing to do in it but attack random animals and fight pirates with awful AI. The UI is clunky and not comfortable to look at, and is slightly buggy. I was never sure if I was crafting or driving my boat. There needs to be more feedback on what exactly your character is doing. Also, why do your arms only show up when you're holding a gun?I would wait until much later, as I have high hopes for the game, but right now it just isn't cutting it. It looks ugly where it shouldn't (the abyssal worms are particularly odd even though shooting smaller worms is hilarious), and only mildly interesting where it should look amazing."

Potential is there but this has a LONG LONG way to go

From the very beginnning the game bombards you with information and expect you to remember it. Then a few minutes later when you're set loose, you have no idea what to do. The very base mechanic of the game, Driving the boat, they got wrong. Dear developers, a boat is not a car, It doesnt have immediate feedback and it does not have BRAKES. Even the jumping sound is laughable, it sounds like an anime girl moaning.This game is cool (I guess) Just very poorly executed, with alot of immersion breaking."
