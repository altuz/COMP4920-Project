,Not Recommended,617700,30890022,Posted: 1 April,all,Aqe,"At first let me say that I never wrote a review before and please excuse my english.I have to say that I like the idea behind that game and that was primarily the reason for me to buy this game.I should have watched some videos about it before buying it too early but here I am.Now I want to tell you why I dont recommend that game to the present developing progress.So there are mainly two things that are possible after about 2 hours of playing - the first one is growing your plants which is not very interesting (even for a simulation ; but thats just my opinion). You literally just click to give them some water and after a few minutes of waiting you can harvest them (I feel like every 3/4. plant is infected and as a ""low levler"" you cant cure them). While waiting for your plants to grow you stand in your shop despirately waiting for customers to come in. You sell them the weed with two clicks - no real individuality given except the people who try to steal your weed but thats not that often and doesnt seem ""realistic"" either. I could go on with this little problems for hours but the main problem is the game progress. The money you earn isn´t enough for you to improve your shop or your equipment in general (Of course you can say thats the realistic part but who wants to wait about 10 real hours to have enough cash/money to buy a lamp or some indoor things that aren´t really expanding your experiences with the game?).I wont say that everybody has to see it like this but I just want to show you what I experienced.Moreover by now I can say that the game isn´t good in it´s present developing progress, because even for a simulation you have too less opportunities to do stuff.If this game (I dont know how abitious the programmers are) gets a few updates balancing the ingame progress it would be a good start. As an act of ""boringness"" and the fact that im pretty early writing this review I´ll now list some ideas that could make the game better in my opinion:- graphics improvement- more complex act of growing- differences between customers claims- differences between the price/quality/.../popularity of the weed- (Maybe some skills/talents you can level up or that improve by time/work; for example the quality of the weed depends     on your skills as a grower)- more customization- you are a person in this world and not a flying camera :D- you can design your joints (some sort of personalization) so they get kind of a beauty-value and being more valuable when you sell them.- selling different types of weed for the individual need of the customer - weed tea - prerolled joints - ""just"" weed - weedcakes...- technology --> you can create new sorts of weed and name them- the overall thc <-> cbd ratio or the general quality depends on your mastering of growing--> maybe you need lamps for better lighting of the weed or other water that has some sort of nutrients for better growth...To conclude I can say that I do not recommend the game at it´s current state but im looking hopeful into the future and for major updates.Thanks to everybody that has read the whole review, I hope i didnt write too much senseless stuff :D"
,Not Recommended,617700,30870664,Posted: 1 April,all,mattupchuck,"Far too buggy - keeps crashing, menus fail to appear, characters wonder out of the world where you cannot reach them...It could be a good game but right now I am cheesed off that I have spent the best part of £5 for a game that simply does not work after 4 attempts and less than an hour's gameplay.Until such a time as this game is tidied up, fixed and adequetly tested I would not suggest any parts with any money for it.Beyond that I cannot properly review it as I cannot properly play it."
,Not Recommended,617700,31176951,Posted: 16 April,all,hC Ibrahim,"Ok straight to the point, this game feels like an demo of some early access game. Not much to do, major bugs. Far away from ""simulation"" it's just one of those clicker-games. Click Click Click...0/5 for game that costs 10€."
,Not Recommended,617700,30860197,Posted: 31 March,all,TeeBee,"It's pretty buggy, for example, people would noclip through me, when you level up the customer timer carries on ticking down, everytime I grew plants the 0:00 above the plant didn't go away when harvested.Starts off really slow, not sure if it gets any better but there's sometimes 5 minutes of not being able to do anything.Tutorial is frustating, walking feels weird.Would I buy it for £5 know what I know now? Probably not because progress is so slow."

,Recommended,617700,32042358,Posted: 29 May,all,SykoFerret,"Although I was disappointed to find the game was no longer available on the Play Store, I found an APK ;)Now for Weed Shop 2: Basically the same as the previous generation, PC tuned graphics still aren't mindblowing, but they're decent enough and bearable. Updates are still rolling out; I have to say I'm quite impressed by the presentation of such a good game from a solo developer! Keep up the great work kid! Procedurally grown weed is fun to watch; knock out burglars, and vandals, and spice vendors harassing your customers, roll and smoke joints, blunts, bongs. Mingle with people on the beach by walking outside the shop! You can even adopt a cat*!Simply put, a great weed game, unless your dry, in which case, it's like a mad teaser!* Much like a Ferret is a cat snake ;)I can't wait to see where the developer takes this on PC, as there was so much to do in the android version!Legit, Loving the frequent updates! A few tips, from a player with a few hours.- Safe Robbers (Mobsters): Hit your bong (I'll often leave it loaded and ready to hit), or smoke some really good joints/blunts to get really high before you try and knock those guys out. I usually run up and smack them, then run away, smoke a few joints, over 120 seconds, then swing away! you'll knock the big guys out!- ABH (ALWAYS BE HIGH): You'll get double XP for EVERYTHING while your st1d. (and the post processing effects are fun, as well as the missions!)- Find the cat** keep him high, by getting your staff high (He gets a copy of every joint you give them!) Usually he will attack and alert to any possible threats, often getting himself knocked out by the thugs, simply give your clerk a cross joint and he will be right back loving you when he wakes :) **He no longer works for me, nor do security guards, since I accidentally knocked him out through a thug once... or twice; he has hated me since. Yes, watch your swings, they can go through your target and hit anyone standing behind them, or next to them, really in the vicinity of your target, since it swings like a bat. lol- If your employees stop doing their jobs, walk into them to move them and they will reset, or smoke a joint with them sometimes helps resolve this. You can also push customers through your doors, and they will buy something!- I'll update this for awhile, and then forget about it;)- Ye's Bodyguard is a con, don't buy him! He looks like a bad@$$ werewolf in disguise, but he doesn't do anything to protect your store (or disregard this as it may be due to me knocking out the cat. Not sure on this one.)"
,Recommended,617700,32702960,Posted: 23 June,all,Superdank,"Well, I know my profile suggests I absolutly adore weed.... Its not wrong, I do, But thats not the point.This game is in its early stages of becoming something very special. Not knocking how it is right now as its brilliant but i think a few more tweeks are needed.1.The sale of merchandise should be restockable by sales assistants.2.A.I mobility, They can get stuck quite easily but this has been adjusted I believe ? as the recent update seems to be running alot better and Im not getting anyone stuck in the shop anymore!3.Quest placement, I think some of the quests are quite hard at a lower level and don't reward you well enough it feels like the reward may be set to random!But although ive mentioned those, Id rate this game incredibly highly as it has a certain feeling to it that draws you back to it, its set up so you can start save go off do something else (work or play another game if your a lucky f*** and have time ;P). There is a constant feeling of progress which is what I look for in a game and also theres a factor of feeling like your alwasy close to unlocking something great if that makes sence ? almost like you dont have to play for hours to unlock something worth while.The interaction and simplicity of game play is ideal to pick up and play with ease, A nice and brieg tutorial to get you on your feet and the game starts nice and slow so you have plenty of time to learn how to get along with growing, Selling, Decorating, Beating up Theives and most importantly getting your own smoke on.Overall it is well and truly worth the small amount its for sale for and it is incredibly fun.Massive respect to the creators of the game as too be truthfull it shows that a small amount of money was spent creating this game but the overall result totally blows that factor out the water and for me its currently one of my go to games to play and has a high chance to become one of my all time favourites as a simulation game."

,Recommended,617700,32712734,Posted: 23 June,all,Hot Soup,Hands down the best dank game you can find. It was certainly worth the buy. The developers are incredibly responsive to the community and deliver. Very nice! =D
76561198091991512,Recommended,617700,35248480,Posted: 27 September,all,DethBiSnuSnu,"I gave a blunt to a possum who was digging through the trash. He smoked it then meowed at me. Now we are bros, he follows me everywhere. I can't get in my grow room because there is a stoner possum in my way. Considering giving him less weed and maybe he'll leave me alone.Super shady dude keeps creeping up on my shop to steal my herbs. I can see him slowly sneaking from a block away in broad daylight. I roll my eyes and light a blunt to smoke while I smack him with a broken broomstick. Next time he manages to get in my shop while I'm gardening and steal my weed in front of 6 customers. I give him the stick he's so used to and end up hitting one of my best customers. He gets free premium blunts when he comes in now. The bud burglar is still at large.I've had a lot of fun with this game for the 10 dollars I paid for it. I love the idea of first-person management games and shop sims. The only other one I had hope for was Shoppe Keep and it was basically abandoned.Things I love about this game:-Watching people slowly get more addicted to your product. My first ever customer bought $45 worth, now he's in twice a day dropping $400 each time. I treat him like gold.-Getting almost anyone high at anytime. you can hand out weed like candy to customers, employees, and possums. It would be cool if you could give weed to criminals to chill them out and befriend them.-The map is small but the graphics are nicer than you'd expect. The water looks good, the trees move in the wind, there is a day and night cycle and there are a good amount of model designs for characters, many new ones come as you level up. Some are ugly and some are nice looking but so are real people.-Free placement of furniture and art, no grids limiting your style.-Employees are expensive but they do their jobs quite well and even need to get high every once in a while.-You can teleport to your grow room or sales desk quickly with a button-The Interface isn't perfect but its simpler than I expected. Clicking actions will open the relevant inventory and if you don't have what you need you can quickly click the shop button and it will take you to that type of item in the store.-Later you get to sell merch too, such as bongs. They are easy to restock and you will make about 20% profit on them if the customer likes you.-Completing a transaction is fast and easy like it should be. I'm glad I don't have to play a mini-game with the cash register every sale.-You can get stoned yourself, and varying levels of stoned. From colorful buzz to hunting for clam shells to attacking poo with butterfly wings.-Customer AI is smart enough to rarely get totally stuck, and in that event, a gentle push usually solves it.Some things that bug me about this game:-Seeds and pots get unrealistically expensive, I'm currently spending $470 per seed plus $250 for a pump and pesticide to get 100g of weed. Every 5 grows I need a new $900 pot because it breaks.-All weed is the same once harvested, just the yeild changes. Would be nice if you could display different strains in different containers and if the customer got the one they requested they would be happier.-The thugs who come to see if you have extra money that you can't fit in your safe seem to be sexually attracted to walls.-Growing 28 plants at a time hurts my wrist.-Feels a bit like a grind when upgrades such as a simple poster will set you back $5,000. Wallpaper in my shop costed me $15,000. And it gets much worse. I'm only level 30.-There is no pause button and I have to pee. Saving then quitting the game works but all the water dissapears from my plants when I reload. Kind of wierd pausing was left out in a game for people who probably need a few smoke breaks.All the games about growing and selling weed that I have played in the past were embarrassingly simple and bugged so this game by far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it, especially if you like first-person management. A genre that is sorely under-rated."

Grow weed, sell to your customers, grow your business from a small hole in the wall to a mega store.  Fight off thugs and punish thieves who try to steal your precious flowers.  Or if you choose, just light up a fat blunt and go out onto the beach for some fun.  All in all a great game, still got many hours to play and many more missions to complete.  Fully recommend buying this game, even at full price you wont regret it."

76561198150996060,Recommended,617700,33825154,Posted: 26 July,all,Sly,"Weed Shop 2 is good. That is it. It is good. Not great, not bad, it's good... Why though? Well for a few weeks I've been thinking why it is so good, and I think I know why. But before I do that, let me go through the game. In Weed Shop 2 you are some person who opens up a weed shop, and grows his own weed. This is already amazing to be completely honest. You can sell tons of weed to people, give out free samples, (you want to do this to give your shop reputation) smoke weed yourself, I mean it's just awesome. You can make a cross joint, smoke out of bongs, and get super high. This review was a bit hard to make because it's kind of a game just about doing like 3 things, make weed, sell weed, fend off burglars from your store, it's good, but it isn't game of the year worthy. Now for things I don't like. Sometime's the game is a bit unfair when it comes to waiting on your weed, like the amount of time is annoying. Also the graphics aren't amazing, but I do understand this isn't some AAA title, and also it's an indie game so I won't hate on that. It becomes repetitive, a lot of the same stuff. And finally, the fact that the map is reall small, and you can't leave the block you are on, ever. But I get it, the map doesn't have to be massive, but I feel trapped all the time. Now, the reason I think it is so good is because it is addictive and has stupidly fun aspects, and that's why it's fun for about 10 hours or so, then I don't know. I would give this game an: (Up)- *processing closer analysis* -Finished- Rating: 7/10. -Concluding Thoughts- Fun game with chuckle inducing dialogue, but map is very small, weed farming is tedious, and can get repetitive. Is it worth to buy for $9.99? Weed is involved, of course it is."

I dont know any smoker who could comfortable listen to the same reggae loop for hours and hours without being stoned. In a lot of ways its like a stoner movie, amazing under the right ""conditions"". I will say for the non smokers, if you've ever looked on steam for a shop owner game, or something like that tavern management game, theres nothing ive played that gives you the sense of owning and managing a shop like this. you really do feel like you build some sort of strange relationship with the akwardly animated customers. you start to get annoyed by the criminals in the area and all in all, its an immersive shop owning game. just happens to be all about weed. personally, i love that. but could someone who doesnt care about weed enjoy this, hmmm, not sure. but, considering nearly everyone smokes, weather they tell people or not, it should be fine.to wrap up this game has kept me entertained for a long time, i used to put a podcast on and just play, then i bought the in game tv and watched my podcasts in game. nothing beats that. the only con i could possibly think off is that there needs to be more. just more, of everything. the games great."
