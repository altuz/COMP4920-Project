,Recommended,617830,32305524,Posted: 9 June,all,byteframe,"Yeah, it's pretty super, and fairly hot. 90% of the exaggerated enthusiasm supplied by the Oculess plebs (when it was only available to them) was more or less well founded. This is one of those titles, like Space Pirate Trainer, or Pavlov that you will always keep installed because even a 5 minute play session works as a VR warmup and will be fun. After a long enough play session (just did 20 minutes) my whole perception of time is slightly warped (as though I'm still playing the game), and -- even as I'm typing this, I stop... and, then... resume typing.... like I was, playing.... the... game.It's essentially a 'that scene from the Matrix with the slow-motion bullets' simulator. You proceed from scene to scene murdering these poor red men made out of glass. If you die, you resume to the start of the set of scenes.It seemed a touch more aliased than it should have been, and super-sampling can only help you so much, because of the constant red+blank on white color contrast, but of course it runs well. Ilovedthe intermission scenes in the little apartment, with all that computer crap everywhere. The 'campaign' mode will probably be over before you know it, but there are plenty of other modes to enjoy in your subsequent sessions. Soon they will release an update with a better control scheme and other improvements, and Idohope they add a few more levels/scenes.Red man hangs dong for a split second at the end of the latest video for the aforementioned update, check Yootube.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=943437003"

After 3 hours of playing my legs hurt from all of the ducking and dodging, my arms hurt from all of the slicing and throwing things, my heart rate is up, and I'm sweating.Clever, very clever SUPERHOT team."

If the price lowers to like $10, I'll recomend it. Until then I cannot.Quick edit: I re-bought the game for $15 through the bundle. I'm gonna keep it because I want my friends to be able to play it.

Not terrible, but frustrating at times.- Throwing never felt great to me. I found it difficult to properly aim my throws.I beat it in about 90 minutes. I felt this was a good natural length for the game, but perhaps not great for the price (but certainly reasonable after the ""VR tax"").All in all, the pros far out weigh the cons, so GET IT AND GET READY FOR...SUPER.HOT."

It was intense, awesome, and even better in VR.I'm not even sure I would reccomend the non-VR version if you can buy this. The main appeal of it is ""you don't get tired as fast""You can move in slow motion, snatch guns out of hands, deflect bullets with ninja stars and throw cleavers at enemies. It's movement system through little gateways is beautiful and gives you time for a breather. Combat is diverse and you don't need 90 guns to make it fun. It can be challenging and feels rewarding when you overcome the campaign. I wish there was more campaign mode and screwed up story like in the PC version but it's still very fun.Would reccomend in a second to any vive owner and I'm glad it's no longer just an oculus exclusive. Dissapointed at first I had to buy the game again, but happy that it's this good! It's worth it for sure. (Also be warned, lots of punching, many punch)"

There's only 5 endless modes (compared to the near 16 in the original) and you can't walk around. You have to clear an area, then a pyramid will appear and you get to teleport to the next area. Overall, it breaks the emmersion and all of the enemies will be infront or on your sides. No backside. Which breaks the BA-ness from the original SUPERHOT as you avoid bullets from every direction. The levels feel polished, but they're the exact same rooms and areas from the original one, so you're not missing out on much. The only real difference is how they're played.Overall, if you have the original SUPERHOT, you will find this quite bad. If you haven't played SUPERHOT, then you won't dwell on how good the original was."

,Recommended,617830,33535193,Posted: 14 July,all,Artisti,"When things go your way, you'll feel like Rambo.I absolutely recommend Superhot VR for anyone with a VR system, it's one of the most engaging experiences I've tried so far. You use both hands to grab anything in your reach to shatter your red polygonal opponents into glassy pieces (nice way to tame the violence, by the way).You'll need to dodge and hide behind objects, but you don't need a very large play area, since all the moving you'll do will be in a very small radius. The game automatically advances you to the next point once you've finished your opponents in your current spot.My biggest grievance is that the game is saved only every 5-6 scenes, so if you screw up in the last one, you'll have to go through all the previous ones again, which can be frustrating. This frankly feels like a cheap way to prolong the game.Contentwise it has enough levels for an hour or few, depending on your skills. It does have an endless mode with 6 different levels, which increases longevity if you like that sort of thing, but I'd still prefer to purchase it from at least a -25% sale.Definitely worth experiencing in any case."

The mechanics are fun, but the game is lacking in sound, story, and basic functionality like correct gun angle. Feels like it was quickly ported from Oculus Touch to Vive controllers without testing. Please update these features and include some more content then I would highly recommend.Edit: Took me 90 min to get through the main game. If you put your own music on in the background this game makes you feel awesome. Would be nice if a soundtrack was included. Recent update says fixed gun angle but still seems off for the vive controllers. Global leaderboards would help with replayability."
,Recommended,617830,32120544,Posted: 1 June,all,Dr. Zeppelin,"This game was ♥♥♥♥ing made for VR. Compared to current VR games, this is pretty god damn good. Even audioshield doesn't feel this impressive. I'm sweating as if I just ran a mile, and I'm inside my house at 11:00pm. I keep seeing bullets fly into my face.Devs, the original was great, maybe a 7/10 (not too much to do, but it was awesome), but this one get's a 9/10. Nothing gets a perfect score, except KSP.New to VR? Get this game. Not new? Get this game. Are you unable to get VR hardware? Take out a loan, set up the hardware and GET THIS GAME.---For an actual critique, one could bring up the odd hitbox your character has. I understand the head and heads acting as a real object, but sometimes the torso seems to exist as well, as in I lose when it gets hit. I like the sound design, nothing bad about it. I wish the bullets distorted the air behind them when they travelled. The graphics are so basic, which means ANYONE that can even handle the Vive (or Rift) on its own can easily play this game.  Also some of the sticky notes in the main room could use some variety, I think a lot of them are just copy/pasted.I'm on the last level of the main story, and so far it's pretty great. I mean... I think I'm some guy in some simulated reality that is being put through some initiation for some group? It's quite bizarre to have a VR game in a VR game; nonetheless, I like it!"

,Recommended,617830,32972108,Posted: 28 June,all,Shadow Streak,"Potentially the best game you can play in VR at the moment. With a simple and easy to understand mechanic, it's worth purchasing and even showing off to individuals. Weaving and bobing through bullets feels incredible and desperately throwing your gun after you run out of ammo, only to have it just barely hit the enemy, causing them to fall backwards flinging their gun right into your hands. It feels so good at all times. Controls are not perfect but you can easily get over them in a few minutes."

,Recommended,617830,34134809,Posted: 9 August,all,Airborne,"Disclaimer: I got this game before the steam release on the Oculus Store and used ReVive to play it with my Vive, so the hours played here are way lower than the amount of time I actually played this.Hands down the single best VR game out there yet, apart from maybe Elite: Dangerous if you've got the setup.Like all VR games it's lacking in content, short (though very, VERY replayable, especially with endless and challenge modes), and graphically simple, but it uses everything Roomscale VR has to offer and it does so brilliantly. You don't need to flail around like an idiot so it won't get sweaty as quickly as something like GORN.The Concept and execution are both absolutely fantastic. It worked well in the 2D version, and translates even better into VR.This game as a whole just feels right. If I could pick only one game as proof that VR has something new and actually productive to offer to gaming, this game would be it.This is my one and only VR must buy, which is why I bought it twice.IMPORTANT: If you get it, make sure to go to right click the game in the left bar in your library and go into properties -> betas -> opt into original-vive-control-scheme. The default controls work okay but I think the original controls are far superior.You have to hold the grip buttons to hold onto a weapon, which would be annoying if you held a weapon for long, but that doesn't happen, you use a weapon and then toss it. It feels more immersive, more responsive, and makes throwing much easier."
,Recommended,617830,34154337,Posted: 10 August,all,Toofast,"A must have for vive and occulus touch users.  I remember when I saw the original non-vr version of the game my first thought was ""this would be sick in vr"".  Now that I've given it a try, I can definitely say that my excitement was not misplaced.The game isn't very long in vanilla story mode, but there are several other options to change up the game like time trials, no-death runs, a hardmode, headshot only mode, etc, and these greatly boost replayability I feel.This is a great game to show people who have never used vr as the contols are very intuitive and easy, just use the grip button to grab and the trigger to shoot.  And the gameplay *sigh* lawdy lawdy it's a good time.  For sure recommend."
,Not Recommended,617830,34468475,Posted: 24 August,all,ChunkyStyles,"The core gamplay is pretty good, but I cannot recommend this game.  Not for $25.The problems with this game:- It's super short.  Two people have completed the game on my account and one of them even played endless mode and headshots only mode for a while.  I have 3.2 hours played in game.  So that's roughly 1.5 hours to complete.- Crappy hitboxes.  For example, when shooting from a doorway, your bullets will he the door even when they're 1-2 inches away from it.- Lagginess when loading into a new area, which happens a lot.- You have to start over from the beginning of a level any time you die.  This means replaying many sections multiple times.  This wasn't a big issue until the very last level, where it just felt a little unfair.- General user-unfriendliness:- No menus.- No settings.- No way to even quit the game outside of closing it from Windows.- Can't even access the Steam VR menu to close it.- Can't reorient anything.  This means that if you can't reach something because some physical object in your room is in the way, you're completely out of luck.  If you don't have a big room setup, you may end up (like me) punching things with no way to fix it.I just don't understand how a game that's reviewed so positively can be so unpolished and short.I was the second person to play this game on my account and I couldn't find a way to reset the game.  So I googled it where I found where the save file was so I could delete it and start over.  After beating it myself, I found the disk to reset progress.  It shouldn't be this hard to use a game in this day and age.  Especially since this game has been out for so long.So, I don't see this game as being worth nearly $25.  Not with the lack of polish, general difficulty of using the game, and lack of content."

76561197993703914,Recommended,617830,31952839,Posted: 25 May,all,Primate,"This was a really enjoyable game, with great gameplay mechanics and controls that show the developers really thought about how they would integrate VR rather than just having a shallow implementation. The central mechanic, which involves the slowdown of time which only progresses when you move, makes for exciting gameplay. I think few games, not just in VR but games period elicit the feeling of being an incredible badass as much as this game. The game's also incredibly polished, with a stark minimalist aesthetic that is cohesive across all parts of the game, from the level and enemy design to the user interface.Besides the campaign, there are some other modes that are unlocked once you finish, such as an endless wave mode where you try to get as many kills as possible before you get overwhelmed, and a hardcore mode that limits the ammunition in guns you acquire.Unfortunately the game does have some minor flaws. It is incredibly short - my playtime for the campaign was just under an hour. Some might say that that playtime is perfect, that to be longer would drag out the game, but truthfully some of the game mechanics are never developed and much of that has to do with the game's length. For example, half way in the game you are introduced to a new power; however the number of times you have to use that power to progress is limited to the moment it is introduced.Sometimes you will need time to speed up whilst waiting for something, and there isn't really a way to do that other than to waggle your hand around. It feels a bit silly and a way to progress time other than flailing your hands around would be ideal.Lastly, and this should really be considered a bug, there is no such thing as object permanence in this game. Meaning, if you are not looking at an interactable object it doesn't exist. This results in a lot of frustration, as to catch or pick up an item it must be in your field of view.That said, overall the game is excellent also priced at a somewhat reasonable price, particularly when compared to other VR games, which tend to come at a premium."

,Recommended,617830,32059293,Posted: 30 May,all,LOLGuy213,"This game is AMAZING. But before I get into that, I need to address the same issue other users are having with the Vive:When you pick up weapons or items, you have to hold down the ""Grip"" buttons on the side of the controllers. This is also how you clench your fists for punching, etc. It is very prominent, however it gets quite annoying very quickly. Having to hold down these buttons on the controllers makes it a pain to pick stuff up and it gets to the point where it strains and hurts my fingers.However, if you look past this flaw (they may fix it or allow you to remap it at some point, hopefully) the game is amazing. It's short campaign allows for a lot of replayability with various modes available upon completion, the feeling of dodging bullets in VIRTUAL REALITY is the coolest thing ever, and every action you do feels like it has weight.Quite an amazing, immersive feat by the devs!

Also, I'm sick of the incredibly redundant and eternally-cliched bandwagon of first-person-shooters.  As a result, I shy'd away from getting Superhot initially.  And while it does center on the overly cliche'd ""bad people coming to get you"" motif that modern games that lack imagination have to rely upon, the game's other unique mechanics and graphic stylization make up for it.What appears to be a FPS is really a clever puzzle game using time as a mechanic.  The game's design and UI and control scheme is a work of art.  The people who put this thing together crafted some beautiful software.  My only annoyance is I can't figure out how to bring up a menu to exit.  Other than that, the game is elegant and interesting.  I imagine there will be lots of added content for this in the future."

It's kind of repetitive and a little boring.The art used is good and works well in VR it's just slow bullet mode which I am so over in games and jumping from scene to scene of gunplay etc just get's a little repetitive after a while and having to repeat from several scenes before if you ♥♥♥♥ one up gets old fast.But it's better than 70 percent of the games that are available for the Vive atm so it is still recommened it's just not for me.

The feeling that you get when you are surrounded by enemies and all that is in front of you is a single gun and a coffee mug is incredible. Moments like that, which are numerous, are a clear demonstration of the importance of VR for video games, as a medium. I have seen the Matrix many, many times, but only now have I truly been able to dodge and return bullets in a game.Also, if you've played the original SuperHot, SuperHoT VR is a new experience. Don't miss out if you have VR and have enjoyed the original game (which you better have).*Felt like I needed to mention the hand-cramp thing. I'm not quite sure what a lot of people are talking about. While my experience has been brief with SHVR, I have not even come close to feeling discomfort in my hands. I felt some tension in my abdomin after a quick dodge, but that was ""unique."" As a pro-tip, I press the touch-buttons with my middle-fingers. I suppose that, after a while, if you are squeezing your entire hand while holding something in-game, that may lead to some stress. Still, if you are on the fence about SHVR and the warning of hand-cramps are the only thing that are holding you back, give it a go. I don't think that it's worth passing this up."

It is really good in terms of pure gameplay and I recommend to anyone who has a VR headset with motion controllers. 10/10 would roll on the floor trying to hide from shotgun pellets again.I had an issue where objects grabbed would not remain in my hands and fall from them. Realized it was because the deadzone of grabbing an object is too small for the touch controllers and most of the time I couldn't use one of my hands. Mostly the left hand but some days it was the right one. Also had some issues with buggy menus and some other design decisions or stuff that didn't work properly. Still it is one of my favorite VR games and even if the main story is short, attempting to do challenges after beating the game and the achievements makes it longer and not less fun."

With a 2m x 3m play area, I must still be at the minimum space requirement because I often needed/wanted to punch enemies that were just slightly beyond the chaperone boundaries. I feel like the levels could've been tuned a little better in this regard, but it wasn't so bad that it made anything unplayable."

The story is short but the real fun starts after you beat it and get the other modes. The puzzle feel of the story is good but playing Endless mode is great. A lot of replay value and a great game to pass back and forth when a friedns over. A second option is needed for the grip because your hands do get tired but it doesn't ruin the game.

(Not including the challenges.) And part of the reason why it's even a hour long is because if you mess up one sequence it sometimes puts you back several sequences. So actually it's actually probably more like 30 min short, which makes the true name of the game SuperShortHot VR.Is it worth it? Well, that's more a personal question. Some people are perfectly happy to spend spend $20 for an hour's worth of fun, whereas some people won't be happy with that. If you're in the former group get this game right now!

You will find yourself ducking, side-stepping and blocking incoming bullets and using a variety of weapons, including pistols, submachine guns and shotguns. Melee weapons are also present and include your fists, knives, hammers, shurikens and household props. All items are throwable and this might be the hardest part about the game - it tends to be difficult to throw things accurately, at least on your first go around. After completing the game, a level select screen is available as well as challenge modes. This game does not require 360° tracking and worked well with a ""Moderate"" Guardian System setting and a standard 2-sensor front-facing setup."

I only wish it lasted longer.Pros- Slow time mechanics are fun to learn- Game is roomscale only which is nice for beginners- Levels are exciting- Multiple ways to approach each scene- Aesthetics are simple yet pleasing (Important things stand out)- Sound design is well done- The computer room in game is very meta and I loved it- Endless mode will give you something to do once you beat the game (As well as other challenges)Cons- Story is very short (I completed it in about 45 minutes)- Endless mode is another wave shooter for those who are tired of them in VR- Cost to gameplay ratio feels off if you use minutes as the metricTo explain the biggest con. I completed this game within an hour. I have 54 minutes playtime. I completed the story within about 45 minutes. I played endless mode for about 10 minutes. Depending on how good you are at reacting and working out the scenes, the story may be longer.Even with this I found the game exceptional. It just feels right. From the computer room (which I love) to the simple art style, it just meshes so well with VR. I would definitley recommend this to anyone at full price even with it being so short. This is especially true if you love showing off VR. A friend could easily come over and complete the story in a sitting, making for an awesome way to introduce VR. Highly recommended."

I considered Superhot VR at first glance but then ended up getting it after a friend recommended it. In my 1.1 hours of play I managed to hit two walls, smash my thumb on a subwoofer outside my play area because I thought I was bracing myself on a weapons crate, work muscles that haven't been worked in a while to the point of exhaustion and then pain. ""The game will test your limits. It will make you hurt.""  <--- this happened.It says the game is a standing play area and not room scale? Maybe I'm just overly dramatic, but I have a decent sized area and I was still hitting things in the real world. I'm glad I got silicon controller covers.That said, wow! My expectations were exceeded. The game is immenesely satisfying. The object is simple. Hit the bad guys while not getting hit. How you manage to do that depends on the tools at your disposal, your setting and your plan of attack. Some levels can be steamrolled with brute force and some need to be more calculated. I'm a big fan of the place where athleticism meets gaming and strategy. This game delivers on that."

I found the game a little frustrating since it only saves so often and you get stuck doing the same spot over and over again for one small mistake, but over all its blast to play. Think the only issue is with the grip buttons on the side of the controllers, really hurts my arthritis and I spend a lot of time having to hold down those buttons. Think it could use some improvement mainly a difficulty setting would be awesome for those of us that really want to play it but can’t move like we use to. I know that seems weird in a game that only reacts when you do but sometimes bending down isn’t as fluid and it ticks away too much in game time resulting in you getting killed and reset. Maybe just make it so it saves more often would be nice as a form of difficulty modifier.My overall opinion of the game is rather mixed because it is fun to play but I think it could use some polishing to make it easier for all players. If this doesn’t intimidate you I’d recommend you go ahead and get it.One more thing I noticed is the store page missleads you into thinking this game is standing only. I'd disagree that this is room scale and to play it properly you need the full 2.5 by 2.5 m space. also I punched the wall cause the boarder lines in vr are impossible to see by the default grid methiod so be warned."

My only real complaint is the fact that for some reason, using the Oculus Rift, my player was never placed in the right spot it seemed. I'd often be too far back to reach the weapons it put in front of me. I'd be able to pick them up, but often only if my arms left the play space, hitting into things sometimes. My forward-and-back play space is plenty big, so I'm not sure why this happened. I wish there was more content, too. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely worth it."

The actual game is wonderful, the shooting is satisfying and the levels are enjoyable. It's just that in the game, respawning can set you back a considerable amount, forcing you to replay the same levels over and over again. It isn't fun, at least not for me, it's frustrating.

The biggest for me is that when you start the game, the weapon you start with is beyond the boundry for you to pick up. I would have to hit my monitor to even pick up the gun. There are even issues with having an enemy starting in front of you and having to punch him would result me in punching my monitor. There are no menus and you can't access the steam overlay at all. I find this unacceptable from the devs and this would be my first game I have to refund. I also forgot to mention is that you can't even move in the game where as the regular version you can.

The real fun begins once you unlock the extras.

In a game where getting weapons as quick as possible and keeping hold of them until they're destroyed or exceeded their usefulness is imperative to the game, this is a major bug and has been ongoing for at least a month.I don't know how VIVE handles, though I can say for a fact that you shouldn't purchase this game if you're an Oculus player, until this issue is fixed.  When I hear of a fix, I'll update this since I'll likely have been able to play the game without dropping a pistol or calculator twenty times."

The graphics are simple and unimpressive. The game play is unique, but not really dynamic as each of the bots are pre-progammed for specific movements.Refunded after playing less than 10 minutes. Not worth the $25 price point. A good demo at best. Hardly an industry standard or reflective of VR games today.

At it's best you really do feel like you're in The Matrix, dodging bullets and killing ""people"" with bottles of wine. However, and this was a huge issue for me, the collision detection for melee is AWFUL. During my ~hour of playing, I must have waved my hand around inside a red dudes head at least a dozen times while he slowly punched my lights out. Perhaps there's something to the mechanics I'm missing, but that bug almost ruined the whole experience for me.

No other game can make you feel like you're Keanu Reeves in whatever movie hes in where he kills people. Dodging bullets coming at your head and feeling an actual slight sense of dread as one bears down on you is amazing. The Level design, atmosphere, achievements, everything is just perfectly mastered in VR. Zero issues with nausea, its one of the few games I've played quite a bit without stopping.BE WARNED: you will be throwing things in VR often and throwing punches, this equates to a lot of hand movements that in my playthroughs often broke the playing area.

I bought my Vive a few weeks before its release and with just enough time to get back on the hype train. Upon its release i was pretty satisfied.The game is very short and i can understand my fellow gamers frustration concidering the 24 dollar pricetag if you do not own the original game. I have faith that the devs will add more content as VR gains more traction.One of the enjoyable things about this game is that it is easy to get lost in it. The task is simple, kill all the red guys without getting hit, but the slowdown mechanic allows  the player to do cool flashy moves that keeps the gamer satisfied for hours. If you are like me and enjoy doing a simple task with the ability to add your own creative flare then you will more than likely enjoy the game. However, the game is easy to beat in little under an hour.If you owned and enjoyed the standard version and have 15 bucks to spare i definitely recommend picking it up for a great time. But if you are picking it up for 24 dollars, I would recommend waiting a week or two to see where the devs are planning to take the VR version.Overall if there was one pc game i could have had made to play in the vr it would definitely be SUPERHOT and im glad the Devs pushed their game to the VR front."

I hope they find a fix for that.Great game overall, I'd like to see updates in the future, player created levels or random generative levels, melee weapons, grenades/grenade launchers/explosives or assault rifles maybe ."
,Recommended,617830,32357812,Posted: 11 June,all,Geekatrocity,"To say I was excited to play this game in VR is an understatement; I almost purchased an Oculus headset and controllers just to get a chance to play this as soon as possible. Thankfully, Vive support was released and I was able to get a chance to play this without needed an equally expensive VR device that I would also not use as often as I would like.SUPERHOT VR is an experience that truly shines when you are in the ""flow"" of the moment. There is a small disconnect between distance and time flow, as there were several instances of me reaching for a melee weapon and swinging towards an opponent, only to whiff and die when I was just able to perform it flawlessly not a moment ago. Since movement varies each time you take a swing (due to exhaustion and other factors), I found myself unable to repeat a performance consistently.Shooting was also weird for me, since I felt that using the Vive controller, I had to tilt my hands forward at an uncomfortable angle in order to aim the barrel of the gun where I wanted to go. On the subject of shooting, for the majority of the game, I felt like I was unable to consistently line up a shot with where I wanted it to go. This may be because targeting reticles or laser sights have ruined me, but even when I took only one weapon and aligned it properly, I still struggled to land even a body shot.For a game that expects you to be action-movie levels of awesome, there were few crutches to rely on. But perhaps this is intentional, as the moments where I was able to perform all on my own felt all the sweeter.Perhaps the weirdest disconnect was needing to ""wind"" my arm to get the bullets to travel to me close enough to dodge. This is likely not an issue in the classic game because you can physically move forward. VR unfortunately tethers you to a small square where walking to far forward means you bump into a chair or tug the cables and snap your head back.All in all, if I had to boil this game down to a numeric value, it is a strong 8/10; while not perfect, definitely one of the more fun VR experiences."

There are plenty of games out there with more impressive visuals, but the visuals do work very well for this game due to the necessity of the high contrast of the enemies on the background. Knocking guns out of the enemies hands, snatching them out of the air, and laying a stream of bullets into the other enemies on screen never gets old. The whole ""they move only when you move"" thing sounds like a strange idea, but it is an absolutely incredible way to play. The Matrix comparisons in other reviews are very accurate. You really will feel like Neo dodging bullets, but you don't even have to be a Matrix fan to love the mechanics of this game and the satisfaction of hearing SUPER...HOT...SUPER...HOT after beating each set of levels.The biggest drawback of this game is how short the regular set of levels is. It takes less than 2 hours to get through them, and it leaves you seriously wanting for more. HOWEVER, they do have nice endless modes that were added to significantly increase replay value, but I would LOVE to see an update or DLC with additional levels.As it is, the experience this game provides is 100% worth the $25 cost of entry. I have had my VIVE since it launched, and have almost 300 VR titles in my collection, and SuperHot VR definitely ranks as one of the ""must have"" titles in my collection."

Buy this now.Games try so hard to make players feel powerful, but eventually it usually just ends up feeling like pressing another button. The control of time in Superhot makes you feel Godlike. At first, your instincts hurt you - when a shotgun goes off in your face, you want to run. But eventually you master your power and realize if you don't panic, you have all the time in the world to casually walk away from the incoming buckshot. And like any good God game, what usually kills you is your own hubris...I bit the dust most often while getting a little too cocky with my power and losing track of the single bullet that killed me. The concept of ""stop and think"" is literally a game mechanic, and it's amazing.If Quantam Break had employed this mechanic, that game would've been what it tried so hard to be. My only, only complaint with Superhot is that it's a short (but highly replayable) experience. And while I love the design and think it looks great (reminds me a lot of the Hitman Go mobile game in terms of minimalistic level layout), this mechanic in a fully developed game would be unstoppable."
,Recommended,617830,32045396,Posted: 29 May,all,4o7.dc | Gpig,"UPDATE: They released a patch fixing the problems below. Buy it. It's a great game.____Original Review:It's a bad port of a great game. The greatness outweighs the ♥♥♥♥♥iness of the port for me, but you might want to hold off until they fix it. I'll recommend the game once they fix the issues, it shouldn't take long for them to do it (although it's surprising they released it with the issues. I don't think they tested the game besides making sure it ran.)The game is also incredibly short. Steam says I have spent 60 minutes playing it, and I've already beaten it. The game is artificially lengthened by having you repeat earlier levels once you die, which is annoying because some of the earlier parts aren't as much fun to play for the 5th time when you really just need practice on the last level in the group. If you don't die this game could be beaten in 20-30 minutes on your first try, but you probably will die. However, it does unlock an unlimited waves mode which I heard is great so I'm not very upset with how short the campaign is.Problems with port:-Virtual Hands and weapons not lining up correctly with where your hands really are-Must continuously hold grip to hold items. This includes items that are meant to be thrown.-The two above leads to the biggest problem: It is impossible to throw weapons/objects accurately and so a lot of the set pieces are incredibly awkward, artificially difficult, and unsatisfying. Instead of feeling like a badass, you are lucky if you limply throw a pool ball or ninja star at someone's feet. With the hands/weapons not lining up it means if you throw at your natural point of release it will not go where you are expecting it to go. It is also incredibly difficult to release the grip of the controllers when throwing and so it's hard to time it correctly. They need to implement the ability to click the trackpack to release.-Difficult to grab weapons sometimes. I don't know if this is related to the hands not being in the right place or what. Instead of easily grabbing weapons on the floor or table without looking, I had to look at the item and move my hand until I saw the gun highlight, which was often nowhere near the gun. Whereas if I put my hand on the gun, I could not grab it."

I’d completed in about 1.5 hours, however the game modes you then unlock are better than the campaign.Read the full review athttp://nextgenclassic.com/2017/05/29/superhot-vr-review/"
,Recommended,617830,32073915,Posted: 30 May,all,Kuposaurus,"In a VR landscape that's disappointingly bare of worthwhile content, us early adopters will jump at just about any quality games we can find. I think the SUPERHOT team realizes this, which is why they're able to get away with delivering such a short, albeit incredibly sweet, experience for $25.SUPERHOT's length is the main issue that most people have with this game. It took me just under an hour to complete all of the levels, and it should be noted that there's an achievement for doing it in under 10 minutes, which gives you an idea of just how much content is in this game. Aside from the main ""story"", you have some bonus modes like time trials, hardcore mode (where guns have much less ammo, shatter on impact, and time moves at a much faster speed when you fire them), and an ""endless"" mode, where players survive for as long as they can in one of several stages. These modes give the game some much needed replay value, but the experience is still painfully short given the asking price. Whether or not this game is worth it to you depends on how much you're willing to spend for roughly an hour of original content.Yes, that hour of content was one of the most enjoyable VR experiences I've had to date, but it doesn't change the fact that it's over in a flash. SUPERHOT VR would be an easy recommendation at $10 or maybe $15, but for $25 ($20 on sale as of now) I think it's just a bit too steep to be worth everyone's money. I'm still going to recommend the game because it truly is a fantastic experience and VR owners are no strangers to paying the ""VR tax"" on games that should cost half of what they actually do. I do really hope, however, that the SUPERHOT team will continue to supply this game with free updates to make it more worth everyone's money."

But great for anyone that is not nit picking on VIVE's grip button and is willing to be challenged.The game is no Final Fantasy: it is technically ""short"" but it is very very dense.If you beat the ""story"" once and think it is over, you are missing the point. Although the levels are always the same, the player is not. You learn new movement and combos. And that is with your own body, not scripted combos. Mastered a path? Try dual wielding, try to chain reactions. Push yourself further and you'll improve your time.The game has in-game time and real time challenges level by level. I only miss a ""Full game run"" with built in clock.And it is great as ""casual or introductory speedrun"". Very fast re-start, short levels (20-30 seconds), easy to perfect. WR for the full game is about 10 minutes. Stamina is needed for that."

Keeping it for historical reasons.Game uses a hold-down-grip button to hold stuff, which is literally painful with the vive controllers. Also none of the hand or weapon models properly aligns with the vive controllers. Both are a result of a direct (and lazy) port from the Rift version.Sometimes this is understandable, but in this case the devs had 6 months and a huge load of cash to make this version. The fact that they didn't even bother testing it on a Vive, or fix these very easy to remedy problems, is mind boggling.Bottom line, this game literally hurts my hands to play. I'll wait a week to see if a patch is coming. If not, it's going to be my second-ever refund."

Only downside is lack of mobility. It is standing-vr only, so your space is limited, although that's not a major setback. What disappoints me is how there is no movement around the levels. You only teleport to the next location after enemies are cleared. What this does is reduces your options in combat, making it feel like there is only one way for you to complete each level. In the original game you would use your slo-mo time to weigh your options, while in vr you spend that time thinking of what the devs wanted you to do next.Nevertheless, this is still very fun and one of the most unique and satisfying shooters, especially when in vr."

From the artstyle to the incredible replayability of it to the excellent  core gameplay mechanic, Superhot VR is probably the most immersive game I have played yet. Everything about it is just so perfect, the main menu blends seamlessly with the story and gameplay and gets you prepared for the plethora of gamemodes ahead. Although the story is short, I doubt you'll be bored as this game has plenty of challenges and other gamemodes to try out. The simple art style makes the screen door effect essentially vanish and allows you to become fully immersed in the environment. The sound design, art design and core gameplay mechanis are one of a kind and truly make you feel like your inside the game. The only issue I have with this game is sometimes the gun will just drop out of my hand, not a big issue as I just pick it back up but a little immersion breaking nontheless. All in all, great game.

He played it start to finish without coming out of the basement.  That says something.He was yelling ""wicked"", ""cool"", and also saying ""super hot"" over and over.  I watched him get killed, and he doesnt exactly take things lightly.  The guy gets frustrated at times.  But this game, he wasnt frustrated he would die, and be retrying within seconds and each time he would learn something new that would help him get a little further.  Well built game for sure.Grabbing guns out of peoples hands and then blasting them in the nuts while they were like ""huh?"" was violent yet satisfying and somehow a great mix of slapstick and matrix.Then it was my turn.  I'll add to this review once I have some more time with it.  Obviously 1.4 hours from start to finish inst great but the price was right at around 22 dollars."

Coming in as a fan of the original Superhot, the only thing disapointing about this one is it's length. I completed it in about 3 hours, however you do unlock a number of modes that may keep you coming back now and then such as headshots only."

,Recommended,617830,32106572,Posted: 1 June,all,Iridium,"Remember back in the day when pearl-clutchers would whine that stuff like Doom 2 was a murder simulator?Well guess what? It's finally really here! This is the murder-simulator-est game I think I've seen. And immediately upon downloading it I strapped in my 10 year old daughter to make sure she learned how to murder correctly. She's doing well, aside from her tendency to try to add unnecessary flair to her murdering. Style counts, kiddo, but survival counts more. She does admittedly have an advantage in that she's quite a bit shorter than the game expects, so she's normally behind cover even when standing at full height.Still, her aim is improving, and she's appropriately vicious with it. She's got the killer instinct I've been instilling all her life. Every murder makes me a little prouder of her.So, A+++ would kill again. And as soon as I can pry her away I'll give it a shot myself. Looks fun."

I am using an Oculus Rift and touch controllers and the game works fantastically; The only issue I really have is that sometimes weapons or items will drop just outside my play area so I will have to wave my hands and wait for enemies to come to me, so I can punch them or steal their weapon to progress.If you are new to VR like I am then this game should be one of the first on your list for sure."

76561198125809811,Recommended,617830,34743197,Posted: 4 September,all,IdoshoGaming,"Great game overall:SuperHot VR is one of my favorite VR games to date; the game is very fast pace but at the same time it's not. This game is great both for hardcore players and players that want to take it slow. This is achieved by the games main mechanic, enemies around you only move if you move and they change their movement speed based on how fast you move yourself. The game is absolutely great; the only downside for me was that I finished the game in no more than 2 hours. The game isn't very repayable in my opinion even though you do get new modes at the end of the game to play in. If you are into VR you should definitely take this game into consideration, because it is one of the best VR games. I myself would wait for a sale before buying the game."

Having to do the exact same levels over and over and over again, because of one mistake, or error, is NOT fun. If you didn't have to re-play a room, unless you wanted to, that would be a lot better. Each room gets harder, as you would expect, but having to re-do several rooms just to get back to where you were is a grind."

It has easily lived up to and surpassed my expectations. It definitely plays a little differently, in that your movement is more restricted, but the new ways to play afforded by motion controls are awesome. Also, there's something amazing about actually fighting real life size enemies. Their size, relentlessness, and the fact that they have no faces is both terrifying and exhilarating. 10/10 made my wife cry in fright and stress.It will make you sore, and if you play the time trials (in real time) it will make you sweat, so be ready.Also, obligatory: Superhot is the most innovative shooter I've played in years!"
