76561198044229474,Recommended,618120,32001667,Posted: 27 May,all,"Oh look, JJ is here! (AFK)","A cute 2D mission-based shooter with inspiration to scroller shooters in sandbox enviroments. Fight off zombies and soldiers, collect upgrades to increase the rate of fire of your weapon and collect health containers if need be. 5 worlds to explore with defense style wave games, on rail shooter games and boss battles.Sporting 9 steam achievements and badge progression this game can fluff any account. Rather low pricetag with a quick single player story. Its worth a poke."
,Recommended,618120,31689160,Posted: 11 May,all,DreaMiSS <3,It is an infernal game with the infernal shooter in a leading role. Mercenaries and the zombie will resist to our hero. We have to help civilians to save the world and to find a vaccine.Excellent hardcore action. I think to fans of such genre it will be pleasant.
76561198284737282,Recommended,618120,31723868,Posted: 13 May,all,Medvez,"Simple graphics, but It looks quirky and fun, everything moves smoothly.The mission is merely a static map with enemies. All that is required is to shoot and kill. Collect boxes with the vaccine and destroy enemies on the map.The controls are equally simple to master.WSAD moves your soldier about, Left mouse clicking has them fire in the direction the cursor is pointing.A great way to pass the time. Fun little game.It’s quick, it’s intuitive but above all it’s just really bloody great fun."

76561198064097915,Not Recommended,618120,34740921,Posted: 4 September,all,krwawy,Visuals and music are good but I can't recommend this game because of some really bad design choices. Invisible white bullets on white snowy backgroud are just one of less annoying.
,Recommended,618120,34913119,Posted: 12 September,all,LTS,"I actually liked this game, but personally, this game, at least to me, is too simplistic and too short (1.1 hrs for 100% completion) and for that, I think this game is a little too expensive for what it is. You can go to any website with arcade games and play similar (sometimes even better) games for free. I would completly recommend this if you have a coupon, this is on sale, or if you don't care about spending only just a single dollar unlike I do, feel free to buy this game. It'll be a very short few hours, but they will be fun and entertaining.Pros:-Simple controls (anyone can play, and you can play on anything)-Great level layouts-Not to difficult-Easy to understand enemies and game mechanics-No bs/straight to the point (no boring or overly cliche storyboards or cutscenes, you go headfirst into action)-looks nice at least-tRAdiNg cARds-ez pz achievementsCons:-waaaay too short-bullets are invisible on top of snow-DAMN INVISIBLE WALLS-similar to most (free) 2d arcade games-no transitions or briefing-pause doesnt pause the game-generic final boss battletl;dr - good game, too short and simple, buy when cheap or if you dont care. [7/10]"

,Recommended,618120,35004122,Posted: 16 September,all,Tezlakipuka,"This game keeps up to its promises, the level design is really nice and offers a decent challenge, with the sight range being very limited. The boss fights are quite fun. The soundtrack is enjoyable, but the translation is mediocre at best.HellGunner is worth its current price."

76561198120651134,Recommended,618120,31703033,Posted: 12 May,all,偉大な敵,Fun aecady shooter. I recommend the developers to possibly include player skins and a new compass system.

,Recommended,618120,31690350,Posted: 11 May,all,neonsun2004,"HellGunner is a top-down shooter with pixel graphics and 8-bit style sound. We used to kill crowds of mercenaries and zombies to..... SAVE THE WORLD of cause).This game is good enough but i have a couple of negative remarks:1) Antivirus Avast Free 17.4.2294 detects nw.exe in win64 folder as a virus. Please fix it with Avast support2) My controls was set for touchscreen devices by default for some reason. I used to change control settings.As for the game in general I had a good experience with it. This shooter is cheap, has its own style and trading cards. Its enough for me to make a decision to by this game."

,Recommended,618120,31688612,Posted: 11 May,all,RETRIX,Hardcore pixel shooter in which you need to wet enemies and bosses. There are several difficulty modes.We have to pass the levels and perform various tasks. And the main mission in the game is to collect all the boxes with the vaccine.Graphics and control are pleasant.I liked the game.

,Recommended,618120,34022565,Posted: 4 August,all,Nicky #PrayForLasVegas,"It's hard to say if I recommend this or not.First of all:The game is somewhat difficult, once you learn the level it's easy.I really love 8-bit games and this is more of a thing to play while passing time.Second of all:People may give it a negative review and cry about some level being hard, the game being crap or mostly annoying.Seriously, screenshots for this game exist for a reason and there's even gameplay to show it off a bit.Last of all:Since this is a review, I should probably rate the game from my 0.2 hours of playing it.Gameplay Mechanics: 7.5/10 (Could be improved)Interfaces/Menu's: 8/10 (Like the main menu espically)Sound/Effects: 7/10 (Good ol' Retro-type music)Art-Style: 8.5/10 (Love it)Conclusion:Like yourself a good 8-bit styled game for a cheap price? Get this then.Looking to kill the time while waiting for something? Recommended."
