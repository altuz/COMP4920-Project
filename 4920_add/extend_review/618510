The piles of dropped enemies change the ground shape and can create walkable areas in some levels. If you liked the trailers or Zimbres comic style, check this one. There is also a ""car defense mode"" that adds some tower defense elements to the survival topdown vibe."

The amount of content and levolution that comes with this game is well worth the price. The programmers, designer and soundtrack developer should all be pretty proud. I'd rate this game an 8/10. Solid work and lotta fun!"

So I tried it out a bit while the cards dropped, and actually found myself liking the game.  Just a simple crazy zombie shooter, killing waves of zombies and pink elephants.  Yet it is quite well done and a bit addictive once you start it.  Nice little time waster.  Just wish there was some instruction and the ability to turnt the volume down."
,Recommended,618510,34896152,Posted: 11 September,all,Hank Hell,"Battle Bruise is an exceptionally good game for an exceptionally low price.  I got the game for 27 cents.  The game is very easy to pick up.  You have two choices when starting the game, campaign or car mode.  In campaign you have to fight off waves of enemies from all directions; 8 waves in total per stage.  After each wave you can buy different weapons and upgrade your current weapons.  I car defense mode, you have to protect a car from being destroyed.  In this mode you can also buy turrets to place on your car which makes it quite a bit easier.  I beat the game in about 4 hours over a few days.Bottome line: if you need a 4 hour time waster for a dollar and enjoy shooter games you will probably enjoy this game.Fun gameplay, extremely cheap and pretty decent music = 9/10."

76561198079581222,Recommended,618510,32226658,Posted: 6 June,all,ArcadianGhost,I'll admit I'm not one for shooters where your put in an arena and forced to shoot down a bunch of enemies. Not that its bad just that I feel they never have enough depth. But that is not the case here this game has plenty of depth yet is still easy enough to understand so you can just pick up and play. Granted there are a few technical glitches but it never distracts from the game and I love the aesthetic.

,Recommended,618510,32212100,Posted: 5 June,all,raf!,"Battle Bruise is a simple yet fun game. The visuals seem to be taken straight out of some downtown graphitti, and that's pretty cool - it fits with the awesome soundtrack very much! While I'm not that much into simple pick-up-and-play games, Battle Bruise gave me some good fun, skillfully dodging waves of undead enemies. Ah, and do expect some random difficulty spikes - mostly RNG things. This is the most fun you can get for a price tag like this!"
76561198007430407,Recommended,618510,32314358,Posted: 10 June,all,Yoko Taro >= GOD,"Good bargain for its price.It's traditional ""Alien shooter-like"" with interesting ""corpse pill-up"" mechanic.Basically when enemy got killed, they turn into ""floor"" and will pill up into hill when enough enemy is kill in that area and player can walk on the hill and feel like a badass.The interesting part is that some weapons can be 'blocked' by this 'hill' so player can't just stay still or they may not be able to shoot.Another one is that some weapons and enemy attack or pick up will destory these 'corpse hill' and floor too (the under-flood maybe water which slow you down or lava which deal damage to player, enemy can also submerge in them so player may not know what's under them and could got ambushed) . This add tactical decision on how to move around, what weapon to use (not just the most DPS since it may destroy terrain or blocked by hill), and where to kill the enemy. It makes the game feel much more 'fresh' and 'active' than other run-n-gun shooter.Overall, I recommend it."

No problem just drop a nuke on it, you`ll be fine and so will the car (It's probably a japanese model)!Never thought you could get so much fun out of sorounding yourself with shot piles of corpses!Great Indie gaming experience all around, so glad i stumbled upon this and for such a low price!Get this for some quick challenging fun!Don't be pretentious about the visual side of it on a 1€ indie game sheesh, just enjoy the carnage!"

Also sounds like the developer is going to be enhancing it a little more in the future, but as is it's an amazing game and totally worth the 50 cents or 99 cents asking price.   Lets see... 2.6 hours of play time so far, 49 cents.... carry the 7... divide a turnip... um... wait... I cannot maths, but this game is fun.Good job to the developer!  Also thank you for making this game.  Cheers!"

A huge thanks to the developers!"

,Recommended,618510,32984403,Posted: 29 June,all,[202nd NOVA] Doctor A. Nibenay,"In this game you take the role of a noble pink-haired Run-Gun cat heroine named Féline D'akka who tries to stop an invasion of Zombies.Okay, enough with the jokes, this is basically Z.O.R.M. (Zombie Storm) on LSD, DMT and 3 crates of Templar beer. (Pink elephants included) Lots of things to kill and their corspes are so permanent they even start rotting and pile up, soon enough you'll find yourself on a mount-everest of burnt Heretics, killed Mutants and purged Xenos.The main focus is crowd-control, wich is pretty well executed, altough in the Lava level a jump button would be appreciated if you just nuked the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the map, leaving lava pools everywhere.You can buy upgrades, one part of me wishes them to be permanent, the other likes the extra difficulty of repurchasing all  your weapons.The only downside is the shortage of weapons, wich is easily overloked, more guns aren't a must, but I'd like some more. Like maybe a Plasma Cannon and a flamethrower.For what it is you can give it a solid 10/10 especially now on sale."

I like the astetic and playing it felt nice, though the gunsounds are, in my opinion, too weak for a game like this, the'y need to be super booooom, when they are more of a pewpewpew, if you understand this weird comarison :DI got bored of it quite quickly, but it is one Euro and for this price I think it's worth it, you'll be entertained for about an hour I'd say."
,Recommended,618510,33527919,Posted: 13 July,all,ProtonsZero,"This game makes me wish the review system had a ""neutral"" recommendation button. It is interesting graphic wise. It is decent fun for its size. The changing geography of the map is a super interesting mechanic... However... There's very few types of enemies, the balancing is attrocious, the game does nothing to explain anything, it is also very short.If it eventually has some overhauling patch that adds some permanent upgrades, more stages, balancing, etc, this game gets strongly recommended. For now, however, it is only worth it if it is not full price and you can at least make your money back with the cards and get some easy achievements."

,Recommended,618510,33463806,Posted: 11 July,all,Beefyrulz,"For $0.34 (Had a 66% off coupon) It's not a bad little arcade shooter. Even for $0.99 it's a pretty good deal. Unfortunately there's not really much to the game. There's like 6-7 different weapons (If you don't count Lvl.1-3 as different weapons) between two game-types (Campaign and Car Defense) A limited variety of enemies (Maybe like 4 total unless I'm forgetting one) And there's practically no 'options' Just Resolution and Fullscreen.All-in-all, it's not a bad deal for $0.99 and it's something you can launch and get into quickly and easily if you needed to kill like 5-10 minutes with some mindless action.That being said, with a little more work, this couldeasilybe a $4.99 game, but it is what it is.Oh yeah and for bonus points, the art is interesting and the music isn't half bad."

,Recommended,618510,33730534,Posted: 22 July,all,Luik,"• Inexpensive casual fun with pluses that will exceed your expectations.• Impressive sound work and soundtrack.• Liza, the pink-haired cat protagonist, is cool and adds a lot of character and uniqueness to this game amidst tons of games with generic protagonists.• The terrain mechanic is an interesting twist in the genre. Together with the enemy diversity, weapons and power-ups it adds depths of strategy and difficulty worth the praise.• Gotta love the craziness of the inclusion of mammals into an apocalyptic background and they aren't there just for laughs, they play a part interacting with the terrain.• Trading cards make it even more worthy!
