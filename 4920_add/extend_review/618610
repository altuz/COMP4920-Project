,Not Recommended,618610,32476524,Posted: 16 June,all,Kraken,"I don't believe this game went out of beta versionhere my points:-Most upgrades don't make much sense--Creatures bug running-Glitched attack animations-Defenders all attack at once breaking strategy possibilitiesExample: 5 shotgun vs 2 enemies,they all shoot the same target, the remaining target advances and kills defendershow can you work any strategy on this? when defenders have very little range, zombies charge when getting close and kill defenders in 2-3hits, so the defender units are always in one of the two states, 1 - enemy too far, can't hit anything or 2 - enemy too close, getting damaged already.-Only 1 map to play the game endlessly-Defenders units can't shoot bullets over tables, computers and boxes on the floor.-Scientists randomly spawn in the worst places possible, making it impossible to defend it past a few waves because of corners, obstacles blocking line of sight, enemy speed, units attack speed, and the fact that units can't attack one at a time or flag an enemy ""this one is dead"" don't shoot it anymore.the game itself has a nice tower defense idea and potencial, but without working on these issues it's not an enjoyable gaming experience."

Not sure what I was expecting, and the game does have a very beta feel about it.When you first start it's very confusing, and the leveling system isn't great I think. Also the 5 point explosive barrells are very very OP.Worth a try, and shows potential, needs balancing and small things addressing."

I didn't find most of the negative stuff mentioned in the negative reviews and judging from the posts at the community forums, they were probably patched via updates. Sure there is still way for improvements here and there but nothing game breaking. The developers seem to be very active and listen to the community regarding how to improve the game, in other words, this game can only get better.The only con I found was that there is still one map, but after checking the updates it seems several of them will be coming soon along with new game modes. Having said this, the game is pretty fun and very well worth its 2 dollars price and probably more with the upcoming content mentioned in the updates.So, yep, recommended. Most of the stuff you see at this price range is crap, but this is great."

Not that I play everyday but It is cool to see that the game is being constantly improved, I wish other games could have this kind of support. Can't wait until the new content comes out. Great devs.The game is fairly simple but entertaining. There are very few cons, but seeing that the game is being updated regularily, I don't have any issue.PROS-Tons of zombies on screen-Many upgrades/units will keep you entertained-Active developers that do listen to their players-Leaderboards may keep you grinding-Its 1.99, what more can you askCons-Needs more zombie types and mapsBut they will probably add them via updates later.I do recommend this game, its great fun for the price but it may not be for everyone. Get it if you like tower defense games and RTS but don't expect content on par with more expensive tower defenses(at least for now)."
,Recommended,618610,32166733,Posted: 3 June,all,drone110266,Cute tower defense style game. Gets pretty boring after awhile since it is really just the same thing over and over until you die. Fun for a short playthrough though. The price is right for what it offers. :)
,Recommended,618610,31331485,Posted: 23 April,all,GaTsU,"For 1.99 it is more than what I had expected and even more because the devs seem to be working on new content and fixing stuff according to the forums. In other words, it can only get better.Pros-Leaderboards-Active developersThe only con I found is that it might be a bit hard at start, but once you level up and get better guns it becomes easier. Personally, I didn't find annoying having to click on the supplies pickups, other games have done this before. I didn't see any game breaking bug. No comments on the gameplay since it is a tower defense, but it will keep you entertained for some time.Verdict. Worth Buying"
,Recommended,618610,31967615,Posted: 26 May,all,Muh macht die Kuh 👍,"Endless Horde.. a tower defense game with endless zombies, guns and scientists.You have to protect the scientists by any means from the zombies. The zombies will increase in numbers and strengh while you are limited with scientists (if they die they are death) and troops (you only have a limited space).Scientists will spawn randomly and you can unlock more troops and upgrades with money you will earn playing this game. At the moment there is only one map, but 4 more maps will come (you can see the in the map-selection-screen allready)..The game itself is pretty funny, while beeing able to play it on low budget computers or laptops, its pretty worth the 2€ i paid for."

Its a tower defense game, you know what to expect.Good stuff*Excellent value for a cheap price*Very polished(at least I didn't see any bug)*Devs add stuff based on the feedback of the players*Good tower defense gameplayBad Stuff*It may seem like it is lacking content, but for the price its understandable. However, there are placeholdersand other things that point out that new content is going to be added to the game, eventually.OverallA hidden gem between cheap games. This is a good game for the money. Right now it is a good purchase, but a definite must buy once all the remaining maps are in place."

They are only useful if the zombies come from the way they are facing when placed. Only glitch i have run into so far and its not enough to make me hate the game."
76561198399907221,Recommended,618610,32798192,Posted: 25 June,all,KQueen,"Good game for the price, I don't regret buying it.Its fun but don't forget to buy new units as soon as you unlock them, some of them like the shotgun guy make the game easier and more fun.You buy new units from the equipment menu, I read a misleading negative review where it says you require to grind 50 waves to unlocks stuff, this is not the case, I unlocked the shotgun and other stuff in my first playtime, about 15 waves. However it seems that you do need to play 50 waves to unlock new maps.But its oks since the units and other upgrades keep you entertained. Which leads me to one complainThe game is somewhat unbalanced, in my experience, everything unlocks too fast. But this also means you get the achievements fast, which is in a way, good.In my opnion, yes buy it. It is good for the price."
76561198398615975,Recommended,618610,32756315,Posted: 24 June,all,HamOfThor,"Spoiler: I thought this was going to be bad but it was actually quite good. With 40% off 1.99 lol during summer sale, this is one of those what are you waiting for"" buy it now games if you like defense games. Read about the reason below.After reading the forums, reviews(the negative ones) and playing it, I figured out this is one of those games that the devs keep adding content as time goes by. In other words some of the reviews don't really represent the current state of the game. For example some of them mention the lack of maps, saying that there is only one when I see 3 at the level select screen and another two locked as dlc. So brushing other reviews aside, in my experience(late June) here is what I thinkPros-It has tower defense gameplay, not that it is awesome but it is good enough. I mean, its a tower defense game.-Game gets new content every now and then-The game is very cheap, especially now with the summer sale discount.-It has leaderboards to keep you grinding for some time-You unlock many units as you progressCons-With many gameplay related updates, it seems that the gameplay has become somewhat too easy, unbalanced-I didn't happen to me, but apparently there is bug related to 4k monitors that has not been fixed by the programmers, but there is a quick fix at the forums.ConclusionThe game would be good enough for its price even at full price, as time goes by and more content is added, the value for the money will keep rising, so what a better time to buy it now that it has 40% discount."

,Not Recommended,618610,34517839,Posted: 26 August,all,praise the sun,the gameplay is dull. a poorly made tower defense game with bad graphics and little effort. i have only played 6 min because the game is bad and zombies have a lot of health too much health. i would not recommend this game too anyone.
,Not Recommended,618610,33533413,Posted: 14 July,all,KAMARAD,"It's a game I'd say rated ""meh"" ... Got to wave 60 on the 2nd game. Sadly it got boring because Zombies didnt have much to chalenge my units. I had the basic units (pistol and rifle) + shotgun. I stoped building units to suicide and it took 2 levels with speed buff to kill me."

,Not Recommended,618610,32775619,Posted: 25 June,all,Civilized Hitman,It's ridiculously grinding.The soldiers are too weak in the beginning. Gotta spend hours of repetitive playing to upgrade stuff.Unlockable content at wave 50?This is definitely not a game I enjoy.Can consider adding in more stuff like weapon drops to increase the power of the soldiers and make things more interesting.All in all a 4/10 rating for being too grinding to be enjoyable.

I have to click the mouse dozens of times before it recognizes that I input a command. I have a hard time starting a game because it won't take mouse commands right away. And then, when I do actually get into the game, it's a frustrating experience because the mouse won't work properly! I'm leaving this review up until the creator gets off his butt and fixes this problem. I noticed others were talking about this very same problem back in April. It is now the end of June."
