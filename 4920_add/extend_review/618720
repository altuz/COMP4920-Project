,Recommended,618720,34650235,Posted: 31 August,all,Vidservent,Cute and colorful as always like every other Miwashiba game. A side-scrolling game where you just walk around and talk to people as you uncover the main story's plot.The story mode plays like Ace Attorney Investigations where you collect info and then use it to rebuttle arguments and refute people.Free Time is used to make friends like in Danganronpa by giving people gifts till you trigger a character's event and eventually get a friend invite plus a thing to remember them by which is basically the main goal of the game that will decide what ending you get depending on how many friends you have collected :3I loved the art and soundtrack of the game and the main story had a twist that I was not expecting XDDefinitly recommend for people that like to just have fun and know more about random characters :D
,Recommended,618720,34555967,Posted: 28 August,all,Tsukkito,"I really enjoy playing this game. You walk around a town to get clues and you solve a different mystery each chapter that i believe leads to one big one. Its not too easy or too hard if you are following along with whats happening. The art is very pleasing to look at especially the character designs. The music is nice as well pretty catchy and soothing to listen to while playing.Currently i finished 2 chapters and enjoyed both of them. Overall its a fun game to kill time and if you like solving puzzles/mystery this game is great. You are getting good art, music, and a story for cheap"
,Recommended,618720,34764088,Posted: 5 September,all,Hansen,"Miwashiba is one of my favorite illustrators and game-makers thus far. She’s the type of person to develop better the more she works.  Miwashiba did a splendid job on this one. The art is simple -but simply beautiful; giving off her unique sense of cuteness. It's really colourfull, and nice! The hairstyles, and outfits are really intersting too! Not so mention the characters whos are really cool, and well done.The gameplay is simple, but working well: It's a 2D game, you go around talking to people and stuff. That’s the main gameplay element. It may seem boring, but the story prevents that from being too repetitive. Sometimes (at the important events) there are an action called ""Talking Time"", where you have to use your logic, and get the facts together. They are somewhat challenging, you need to pay attention. (if you enable tips, it will be easier, and i really recommend it, otherwise it can be frustrating.) The characters are unique, you wont get bored quickly, while trying to befriend them.The music is really cool, and wont get boring. The unique themes for every level, and for conservations really stands out.I played Miwasiba's previous games, and i do like them very much, but i have to claim this is her best game so far.Subjective Rate : 10/10I definitely recommend this gem!"

Endearing characters matched with a great light-hearted writing style, brilliant art direction and an eclectic soundtrack. Don't think any less of it because of the price point, this is a must buy if you like VNs or games such as Danganronpa, Persona and The World Ends With You."
,Recommended,618720,34584266,Posted: 29 August,all,NappyXIII,"I played this game just a couple months ago. Now that it's on steam, I purchased it immediately! Miwashiba makes a great game about making friends and adventure!If you like games where you get to meet an interesting cast of characters, listen to cute music from the web, and playing tetris for money, this is the game for you! Takes place in a cute futuristic set of towns, each with their own flavor and style.I think it's 5/5 and shouldn't take too much of your time (unless you spend a huge amount of time on the Tetris part haha). It's a straightforward and really cute game and well worth your time.Like I said, bought on steam to support the dev, so only 5 minutes played so I could review it, but this game took me about 22 hours. probably something like 15 hours of Tetris and 5 hours of the main story. There is a secret way to get free money in the game if you don't want to play Tetris though haha. Look it up."
,Recommended,618720,35040599,Posted: 18 September,all,Nanashi,"Very fun and colorful game that changed my life. It's definately up therein my top 10, maybe even #1 by pure merit of how it emotionally helped me in so many ways.This game is essentially danganronpa without death, with the funnyness of ace attourney, and style of TWEWY. The art in this is GORGEOUS. And the seiyuu's are pretty good. Most of the music is creative commons, but that ending theme original song is a bop. If you enjoy light feel good games with an interesting plot, futuristic game settings, RPGMaker-esque games, and any of the above mentioned games, then I'm sure you'll find something to enjoy in this game. Get your tissues ready for that ending, you'll be crying. Good tears.Oh you can also play doctor mario and tetris knockoffs if thats your jam.Pro's:+Emotional story about a boy opening up to others and coming to love himself+Fun colorful characters to get close to, all having events to get to know better+Catchy music and beautiful artwork+Multiple Endings connected to the amount of friends you have+Extra epilogue for more contentCons:-Most characters outside of the main group don't get much screentime or development-Friend events feel too fast and easy-grinding for bits without the cheat takes too long-Plot holes tied to big spoilers, mostly time junk"
,Recommended,618720,34554508,Posted: 28 August,all,malaisling,"An anime game where the characters have clothes on, WHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT?And a game that has a transgender character who is actually a character and not just a pawn for getting the game bonus points for inclusion.Also an RPG Maker game which isn't just the boring archaic RPG Maker engine with some custom assets added in.While the initial plot start off seems really unrealistic, once it's on its way it feels very natural and immersive. The dialogue is well written and interesting, the humor is smart and includes sexuality without being perverted or overbearing. The basic gameplay is simple and focuses on the story, however it is mildly innovative enough to make it still feel stimulating.Exactly what RPG Maker games should be, using the engine as a framework but still making a unique game out of it.Totally worth the price, great value for how much actual effort and quality is in this."

76561198351402170,Recommended,618720,34562393,Posted: 28 August,all,Lapisdragon,"I have only just started the game but im already in love! It follows the same beautiful style as LiEat and even has an animation to introduce it like an anime opening. The game functions and game play are almost like an ace attorney - point and click advenutre-esk, the concept is also brilliant as well. Would recommend!!"
,Recommended,618720,34591786,Posted: 29 August,all,12p Ronald,"It feels like a Persona game without the Personas, so the focus is on comfy, mystery and SOCIAL LINKSAnd instead of womanizer Narukami we get a professional creep who can literally read minds because he is good at math"
76561198370109488,Recommended,618720,34572723,Posted: 29 August,all,littlesilvermaiden,"Interesting and unique. A little juvenile and simplistic in the dialogue, but it could be good for the younger generation. As for the description of this game... The ""angoraphobia"" is non existant. The main character is not afraid to go outside, he just doesn't bother because he cares too much about making other's happy and has low self esteem. He is a shut-in at the beginning, so I suppose it's a natural mistake."
,Recommended,618720,34687819,Posted: 2 September,all,ᄿIKAᄽ☀,this game very fun to play and challenging. I really enjoy playing this game. i hope you guys can improve more better in the next game
,Recommended,618720,34682059,Posted: 2 September,all,无情 | 57nG,"1bitHeartis a rather, unique 2D side-scrolling game.Improved graphics with adorable characters.Their designs are really inspirational, just as expected from△○□× (Miwashiba).Excellent written story, while the amount of friends created determines the ending.Background music are surprisingly magnificent.Lookin' foward to the sequel release in future."
,Recommended,618720,34883470,Posted: 11 September,all,histora,"A story based game with beautiful character art. Its gameplay consists of absorbing information and deducing from them.The investigation time (Talking Time) is not too difficult as there is no time limit and the amount of lives given for incorrect answers are massive.Overall it is heavily depandent on its side character developments as there are over 30 of them which amounts to 10+ hours  of gameplay. Fret not as the side stories are not needed to complete the game but feels good to read if played anyways.In my Opinion, i have really enjoyed this game and will reccomend it to people who wants to experience a short story and a few puzzles."
,Recommended,618720,34922853,Posted: 13 September,all,SpookTek,"Held off on writing a short review for this until the sound issue was fixed, which I'm glad they did. I'll do another playthrough sometime soon.This game is very well-written. Main story aside, you can get the most out of this game by befriending all the available characters, which the game recommends you do. The art in this game is simply beautiful, with well-drawn characters and backgrounds. The actual game isn't too difficult as you can enable hints, plus you can take your time to go through the dialogue over and over in talking time if you want to. The mini-games you can play in free time are just there if you already used the cheat to max your bits, so it's mostly an optional thing unless you don't mind playing the hell out of Tetris or Puyo Puyo to grind bits for gifts.Overall, I highly recommend this game if you like a good story and a well-written cast of characters, not to mention amazing artwork. You might be aware that this game was originally free, but if you played it before I suggest buying it to support Miwashiba if you enjoyed the game."
,Recommended,618720,34942069,Posted: 13 September,all,Mergs,"1bitHeart is personally one of my favourite games. The music spans various genres but are generally upbeat or laidback; some of my favourite tracks are Sweet Beach and Bus Stop. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed playing 1bitHeart. It was nice seeing how Nanashi’s growth throughout the game and the story going more in-depth with every chapter. Another thing that stood out for me was the art style as seen in the various backgrounds through different areas in the town, and the unique character designs."
,Recommended,618720,34666506,Posted: 1 September,all,I blew it,"As always, an amazing game by Miwashiba. The art is soooo good, unique, and colourful, each character has an amazing design and literally nobody looks boring. The music is really great aswell. I love the atmosphere Miwashiba captures in every game, it's all so fitting and it all looks nice and feels right. I haven't played too much of this game yet but I am definitely going to, the gameplay so far is unique and fun. No complaints. 10/10 my favourite Miwashiba game so far.. all of them are good though. <3"

,Recommended,618720,35320919,Posted: 29 September,all,Nayuta,"If you like the ""lets be friends"" mechanic of Danganronpa or Persona, you'll probably like this game.Moreover it is a game that involves investigation and argumentation, and it's quite fun.Cons: so many waifus that u can't date."
,Recommended,618720,34739909,Posted: 4 September,all,Gawainn of Painn,Good soundtracks and great storylines. This is a game worthy of your 2.99USD and I would dare to say that the experience is worth much more than the price.

,Recommended,618720,34590539,Posted: 29 August,all,Chompy,"Interesting premise and characters, and has great art. Your HP seems set a little too high though..."
,Recommended,618720,34755157,Posted: 5 September,all,UndyingRevenant,"It may not be fully voiced, but by jove am I happy that they kept the original voice acting instead of getting god awful last minute work done, or having it removed entirely. So happy in fact, that with such a low price point, voices that don't ruin emotional impact by sounding more poorly emoted than Microsoft Sam and a unique art style that doesn't look like a monkey who just learned sign language was forced to finish it under contract, I'm locked into giving it my seal of approval. Because lord knows if a game isn't about a stock asset racing down a stock asset to land in a stock asset, with trading cards that pay for the game itselfTM, it literally becomes better than over a quarter of the gold mine saturated in algae and mold that is Steam."

Never played the free version but so far I really like the gameplay. You found a girl in your bed who doesn't have any memories. After talking for a while to figure out what's going on, you find our your main character is a stay-in because he was bullied a lot? He seems fine with it?! The girl is not very happy about it and suggests he go find some friends. All within first 20 min of gameplay.Still playing! Not stopping anytime soon. And would recommend this game!https://youtu.be/wDawzPACcKQ"

,Recommended,618720,34703097,Posted: 2 September,all,Aeif,"Review from playing Chapter 1.With music that draws straight from the Persona games, and a conversation/interrogation system heavily inspired by Danganronpa, 1bitHeart is an aesthetically pleasing science-fiction RPG that has heart and charm. However, so far the game seems to be extremely linear. I don't doubt that the budget of the game makes it so that there is little to do other than follow the plot.But for what I've paid, I've gotten a lot out of it. My interest is hooked. Excited to continue playing the game.Would definitely recommend trying this game. Don't be discouraged by the slow start."

The gameplay is pretty relaxed, as you merely socialize with the characters, trying to make friends with them, and solve mysteries on the way.As expected of Miwashiba, another unique and beautiful game~"

,Recommended,618720,34950171,Posted: 14 September,all,Dane Nicholajsen,"Ok, so i have saw all the ending of this game. I've been thinking about my previous review (thumbs down) might be a little too harsh. So, i update it a little bit, and give it a thumbs up.If you like playing VN, there's high chance you will like this game. But, if you new to this medium probably you'll end up hating it.Pros :- Tons of lovable character with marvelous design- Great and cozy music- The music is really good, really-really good (except the song after good end).- Its so damn good that i need to write it again.- It's free (you can buy it here if you want to support the maker)Cons :- Some of the villain is poorly written- The DLC (soundtrack) is mp3 format 128 kbps, nani the fukk?- Some of the VA is kinda meh, but its understandable since they are newbie/hobbyistI will look forward too the next and last(?) game from miwashiba, 1Beat♥. You better localized it to steam! And if you can please make the soundtrack dlc at least mp3 320kbps, and probably digital artbook??"
