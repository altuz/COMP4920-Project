I only played 30 minutes for now, so of course I don't have any 4D intuition yet... but it's promising. Man seeing a hypersphere roll away from you into the 4th dimension is weird! It's that's all you want, it's worth the price: get it! But don't expect anything more. There's no gameplay to speak of (as correctly advertised).It's very well executed overall and enjoyable. There's a couple minor issues, but nothing out of the ordinary for experienced Vive users:- Weird launching behavior from the steam overlay (had to retry a couple times before I got it to work... the popup window before launch is useless IMO, given you can change that setting in-game).- Serious lag in large play areas (10 hypersphere could be renamed vomit simulator)- The game doesn't show up in my VR library, only in the regular game list. Probably just an issue with tags."

Just like a baby learns about 3D objects by playing with blocks, you can learn about 4D objects doing the same thing.  Quite extrodiary, I wonder what would happen if you gave this to a small child to play with."

I was seriously laughing like a kid again as I smashed 4th dimensional objects against each other and began to get an understanding for what I was seeing happen in front of my eyes.I'm not a physical theorist, or even a mathmatician, but I'm still all kinds of blown away by this thing. I'm going to be showing this to a *lot* of people.I played with this experience in VR using a Vive. *Highly* recommended!"

76561197982889146,Recommended,619210,33883751,Posted: 29 July,all,Landsknecht sem knecht,"Well, this ""toybox"" is amazing. Though I'm not an educator, I'd say it is a revolutionary approach to teaching (children and adults alike) such a... poorly understood concept as extra dimensions.From the artwotk present both at the opening of the game as well as in the author's website, I'd guess his involvement with this subject traces far back in time, and comes with a hint of passion for it. It also shows in the carefully designed introductory level, where the player is first encouraged to interact with the misterious 4th dimension.For that alone, I feel this game is totally worth the price I paid. From the patch log, with extra content being added, I guess this project is on the right path!"

It does a good job on trying explaining how the 4th dimension works by giving a tutorial and letting you play around with 4 dimensional objects."
,Recommended,619210,32582523,Posted: 19 June,all,Harodz,Well made demo for 4th dimension and Miegakure! Too bad I can only have a 4D object rendered in 3D and projected on a 2D screen though.

At first, I felt lost and pretty confused, but accompanied by the comments/help bubbles on every mini-game feature, I started to gain some knowledge on what I was looking at! Even with just a mouse, it has been incredible, I can't possibly imagine how great this would be in VR, though! I would recommend this to any of my friends who like geometry-type things. Try it out yourself!"

,Recommended,619210,32642338,Posted: 22 June,all,Thompson Baliot,"This is awesome. I really like it. I feel like i have a better understanding of higher dimensions.I have no idea if this is inherently difficult, but i imagine that vector math work similarly. Can you add the option to see the projection of a 4D object onto my current 3D space? I think that would be useful for understanding how an object js oriented in 4D.Also agin this might be limited by the engine, can you add the ability to hold on object at one point in 4D and drag another along the 4Th D with my other hand? I was fooling around with hitting things together and was difficult to ""throw"" and object in he 4th D and at the same time i needed to move myself to a 3D space where i could see them collide.TL;DR:Awesome game, really interesting and fun.Feature request: Projection or (shadow) or some 4D objects on 3D spacesFeature request: the ability to scroll an object to a different spot in 4D without changing my position in 4D"
,Recommended,619210,32224543,Posted: 6 June,all,isha Q,"As someone who has spent a lot of time trying to visualize interactions in four dimensions, this sandbox was a mind blowing ride. There were several points while playing with this that I just had to sit back and gape at the realization of what was going on. At one point, a 3D torus fell over, and it took me five minutes to figure out that it had fallen over because it was ""flat"" along the W-axis. Really great app.Not too sure about the price though. I bought it immediately because this is right up my alley, but there's really not as much there as I would like. If a feature was added to allow users to create their own toys, it'd feel much more feature-complete.But again, it's a realy impressive engine, and even though I would prefer a sandbox, I really appreciate the toybox."
,Not Recommended,619210,33352531,Posted: 7 July,all,KRPkiller,"Look this game isn't bad, not even close, the problem witht this game is that i played it for maybe 30 minutes before wanting a refund. This game is creative, unique, and puzzling but for me (a person who loves philosophy and extra-dimensional physics) it felt just... alright. To summarize if you have never seen 4D objects you can get the same experience by googling a  4D tesseract turning, overall 5/10 would not reccomend, but if you are intrigued pick the game up and see if you get bored or not."
,Recommended,619210,32784468,Posted: 25 June,all,yarvis,Very nice tool to understand the 4th and dimensions in general. Controls could be more intuitive.
76561198397205515,Recommended,619210,32511854,Posted: 17 June,all,kellner2610,"Well as expected I was not disappointed, the experience is nothing but amazing, the game gives a whole new perspective to the concept of four dimensions and I very recommend it.4D toys showed me just how excited I am about the upcoming arrival of miegakure, It will be awsome!Footnotes:1. I did stumble upon a bug, on the abacus levels the spheres seem to intersect other spheres if I drag them while they touch the other spheres which are on a seperate track/line/path.2. One cool thing that would get the concept of combining shapes with lower dimensions to make 4D shapes (cubinder, spherinder, duocylinder) is to make an interactive shape maker which will take as input a set of lower dimensional shapes and make 4D shapes out of them.3. And as a software developer I would love it if you make the 4D engine open source so we could too use this extraordinary tool you worked on."

It costs way too much for a game that's newly in development, experimental and lacks a lot of content to keep users playing for more than an hour.It's neat to try and make something that only had basic simulators online into a fully interactive game, however, for something that's merely new and not proven 100% accurate through math, even in the real world,, in terms of 4d physics, the price should be lower than $15.00. If I were the devs I'd make the price $5.00Also, the game needs a lot more content than it does right now for users to keep playing.To fix the problem above, I'd suggest adding configurations and properties to both the 4d objects and space/physics. Maybe make it a Geometry Sandbox, and 4d is only an option you can toggle."

Dropping an object then letting it bounce into the fourth dimension is not doing it for me as a learning tool. Am I missing something? If so, the tutorial needs more work.I is a product I would like to see succeed though."
76561198163668546,Recommended,619210,32212640,Posted: 5 June,all,winsribbons2,this is a game that ive been looking for for a long time the funny thing is im very good at interpreting 4d space. my brain is quite strong. keep up the good work. im expecting big things from you like 4d rooms and buildings (ofcorse on small scale)with like markers in side an example would be a lamp or a painting. but if feel im a head of you. one thing i recomand is making it so you can rotate the objects in 4d.

The feature that I love the best is the Dice rolling with Hypercubes (D8) all the way to 600 cells (D600)If I had one critique it would be this: The ""advanced controls"" aren't exactly advanced, but really enrich the experience of playing in the 4th dimension and so the tutorial should come sooner in the menu."
,Recommended,619210,32280808,Posted: 8 June,all,Erhannis,"Niiice.  Very neat.  Suggestion: it'd be nice if there were a way to rotate your view with respect to the 4th dimension, and not just move through it.  Second suggestion: it'd be nice if you could rotate objects through the 4th dimension while holding them - perhaps with your other hand?  I think that'd be just enough degrees of freedom.  It's a little hard to play with the objects properly while being unable to rotate them in 3 of the 6 planes.  Third suggestion: it'd be nice to have a sandbox mode, where you could drag in new objects from a list (or even import your own vertex lists?)."

The controls were challenging to figure out with the Touch controllers, and felt very unresponsive. Could be due to frames dropping. Everytime I wanted to do anything, it felt like I had to do the same gesture multiple times, before anything happened. No hand implementation at all, just Vive wands.I refunded this."

A game with many 4D objects, and I can play with them!I personally recommand this if you're interested on 4D shapes, and tired with watching youtube videos and math documentaries.- Lots of 4D objects, from simple to complex.- You're free to play with them, instead watching boring videos or seeing non-sense images.HOWEVER, I can't recommand this game to 'everyone', since there're clear cons:- High price. I understand this game uses 4D calculation engine that developed from scratch, but it's still high.- It's not a 'game', but an experimental simulation software. If you're not interested, not fun at all.- All you can do, is play with 4D objects. That's it."
,Recommended,619210,34975625,Posted: 15 September,all,Eversome,"It's alright. I think there are a few areas it could be improved, though.For the mouse version, it'd be nice to be able to look around in the 3D space. At the moment, the camera is fixed rotationally.Also, having different rendering modes would be great. For example, a rendering mode that renders 4D depth to a certain extent. Perhaps the deeper in 4D it is the more transparent it's rendered, for example. I love the concept and would love to see an interesting game made with it."
