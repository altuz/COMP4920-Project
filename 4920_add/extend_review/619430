,Recommended,619430,35014670,Posted: 16 September,all,|96th|.Kgm.Winged Hussar,"World of Castles right now (as of 9/16/17)  is a early access  title that allows you  to create a castle to your  image. The  game being new has a very large amount of potential of being the next big medieval title. People say the game is bad but they most likely don't even have enough hours in the game to experience it. I spent the first 6.8 hours after the game came out just building a castle. I cannot deny that there is bugs and glitches, but your talking about a game made by a team of four on a lowish budget. The game can be quite confusing at first and even frustrating. As soon as you get the hang of the game you too will most likely spend hours on this game working on the very best castle. The creators did a good job giving you freedom to build however you want. I talked with one of the creators and combat should hopefully be out by the end of 2017 (no promises.) The game can be laggy when having alot of grass or torches. If there was a tutorial I most likely would have been less frustrated at the game when trying to deal with the terrain. The one thing that will make you want to kill yourself in this game is dealing with the terrain for the first time. The creators have been working nonstop to bring you the best game they can in the limited amount of time they have. They work late at night just so you, the player, can enjoy yourself in their game. Most people see the potential in this game and want it to be the best. Calling the game♥♥♥♥♥♥when you have played less than two hours doesn't help anyone and it makes this beautiful game look terrible because you couldn't play it for one more hour.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GraphicsThe graphics of the game, I have to admit, pretty bad. I don't blame them for this since once again, only four people are working on it. I thought they were good for their development team. The creaters of this wonderful game plan to improve the lag caused by torches and grass.EDIT: I have a a decent graphics card and I can run the game with a huge castle at high graphics at about 20 fps. Bad but still good enough for early access------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NPCsThe NPCs as of (9/16/17) cannot move around or else they will die. All the NPCs can do is just stand there and look pretty. This NPC glitch should be fixed soon but is probs not a top priority. As long as I can have what they said we could do which is sieging with NPCs then I am happy.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BuildingThe building in the game is very confusing at first and it is the only thing in the game currently so I will go over it. Pressing tab brings up a menu of blocks, walls, decorations, etc that you can use in the game. 10 of the circles will have a number under it. The numbers are the buttons you press to access that category of building when you leave tab. When in tab you can change which category of building goes to which number. Once you have your hotkeys set up you can leave the tab menu and start building. E and Q change the item on the very bottem of the scroll wheel at the bottem of the screen. You can select what item you want with E and Q to place. To see what you have selected look at the bottem of the screen. The selected item will have two lines on the side of the item. I do not want to go over terraforming since it will make me want to kms again. Left click places the object and right click breaks the object. You can place NPCs the exact same way. You can assign them to patrols (dont until the glitch is fixed) by selecting the marching soldier with E or Q then left clicking the soldier. Once you have done this right click the spot you want him to go. Holding Shift allows you to make a pathway.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Singeplayer:Not out yet but from what I have heard it sounds very good.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Multiplayer:Same as singleplayer.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CombatNot out yet but will be soon.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you for reading my review, I hope I didn't miss anything important to discuss about. If you really want my rating of the game so far here it is:8/10Why 8/10? Because the building is well done and I will not rate the entire game untill everything comes out. Besides, building is about the only thing in the game right now."

Can't wait for more content and the ""siege"" part of the game.Only issue I really noticed is that terrain sometime ""swallows"" blocks and makes it really hard to delete them or ""fills up"" closed off rooms if you build something near the house."
76561198048422024,Recommended,619430,35010431,Posted: 16 September,all,Fuzinator,"As stated this game is in early access and as such, do not buy expecting to hop right in and fight a battle.  I have explored for about 1.5 hours now moving about the countryside and practicing with the build features.  So far, the most concerning point I have is the camera controls are difficult, and not friendly in their current iteration.  Terraforming can be frustrating, but that can be worked out later.   The graphics seem nice, and the game looks like it has good potential.  If you have been waiting for a good castle game, this may be the next one.  At this point, I am ok with the $24-dollar investment, and wish the developers speedy and successful coding."

Very little of the video is actually in the game today but that doesn't mean it might not be. The idea is positive and I purchased and support the idea but there is a lot of development work that still needs to happen.The mouse movement is not fluidThe movement mechanics needs further workI could keep going but I don't want you to take this as a negative review rather that my opinion is the game requires a lot more work in order for it to be playable. Once the game is at that state, I will probably spend several hours playing and enjoying it. I hope people continue to support the idea and that it comes to fruitionOriginaly I added you cannot remove trees and the resolution needed work. in reality it works but you need to press TAB to get full features and when you are in game you need to change the resolution."

Do not expect fighting, a story, PVP/PVE.  This current state is a castle sandbox game."

,Recommended,619430,35023194,Posted: 17 September,all,Brando[SSR|MG],"GREAT EARLY ACCESS CASTLE BUILDER; NO COMBAT YETThe game in its current state is simply a castle builder, but it is satisfying in that respect which is what makes me recommend the game rather than give it a negative review.  BUYER BEWARE, however, because it is not feature complete and does not include any form of combat in its current state.Understand what you're getting in this Early Access form of the game.  If you enjoy castle building, it is a wonderful game already for that aspect.  If you were expecting combat, you may want to hold off a bit until those features are in place.  Know what you're getting yourself into when you purchase the game and you'll be pleasantly surprised.Developers are very driven to work with the community as well, so that is a huge plus.  Bottom line, if you enjoy the Early Access process, then this is a good buy.  If you don't and you just want a complete game, then give it a bit of time and make sure you at least put it on your Watch List."

I was waiting for this game to release since a dev vid I happened upon awhile back. World of Castles has way crisp graphical details and awesome on-point physics. Its worth it to pick up and try if you like the period in history or if you just like bulding/construction and destruction :) Ive only so far built on my castle and look forward to everyhting else. Keep-up the possitive progress 'team at Hammergames' and may the happy players like me continue to be added to the fold."

Not even the sandbox tool is fun because the game runs at 10 fps. I would recommend waiting a few months until the combat system has been implemented."
76561198305910425,Not Recommended,619430,35084875,Posted: 20 September,all,AirBoRnE,great game great building system nice graphics BUT the trailer doesn't look so promising we haven't seen sword fight and the movment of the player 2- the voices not good at all in the trailer THAT'S GOOGLE translate voice not in the game i think the game will take like 1 or 2 months to get this done like 3 YEARS BUILDING A CASTLE ?? AND the map is only 1km or less I SAY DON'T BUY IT NOW wait for more updates.
,Not Recommended,619430,35032127,Posted: 17 September,all,Jáklöe Goldmann,"At release unplayable. Wait!I thought it looks very promising, still no judge, it just came out.But @15FPS, it hurts playing it. Too bad, I'll have to wait until I can find out, if the game behind the lag is any good.My Pc ain't no beast but it can handle all new 3A games at above 30FPS, so I think there is a lot of optimization to be done.If you want to support the development of the game and you can spare the money. Go ahead and buy it!But if you're looking for something to play right now, I would recomend buying Medival Engeneers (It's the same content but had more time to grow)"

,Not Recommended,619430,35033214,Posted: 17 September,all,squanto,its not worth 20 $ for a poorly optimized game and a building simulater
,Not Recommended,619430,35008618,Posted: 16 September,all,Ethom,"I just bought the game, and after finding out how to place walls and furniture, everytime I tried to place a NPC soldier it just crashes and everything ends there. I feel really sorry because I´m huge fan of medieval games and this one looks promising, but right now is unplayable.Asking for refund."

It is EARLY ACCESS and damn, this game has potential! Already a robust building system and cant even think of how fun it will be to actually fight a siege!Did I mention this game has TONS OF POTENTIAL?Well, it does.If you dont have the patience to support a game under development, dont buy yet. And if you do, dont be a whiny little b*****."

76561198128487865,Recommended,619430,35372357,Posted: 1 October,all,65thFLB_Rct_Corruptor,"Played it for one hour so far, the game got a lot of potential. I currently lag a bit, but it might as well be my laptop's fault. The devs said they'll add more content soon, that's ok with me, after all they said what will and will not be in the game on EA release, nobody can complain that they did not now.If they fix the lag problem (or add an option to get lower graphics for us lagtop users :-d) the game will become even better."
