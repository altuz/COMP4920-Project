,Not Recommended,619490,31506489,Posted: 2 May,all,SB,boring and horribly made...- graphics are horrible- extremely limited controls- lighting/shading is messed up- extremely limited sound and audio- gameplay is not only limited but non-existance
,Not Recommended,619490,31619083,Posted: 7 May,all,El Gato,"i had no expectations other than having actual gameplay.  needless to say, this ia great example of inept design.  dark hallways, scattered sounds here and there, drones in the soundtrack to feign horror, and then worst of all, it is way too dark.   the horrible dark picture of this blunder of a game even makes the level after the opening frustrating setpiece completely unplayable.    drones, dark hallways, bad gamma, and burning out the player with total frustration to get through a level is not horror, nor a game, but a visit to a physician for a thorough prostate examination.got a refund.>^..^<"

I dreaded every movement for fear of what consequence it might bring. The atmosphere was intense and I was truely scared of the threats that loomed before me....And then the game became an instant disappointment when the core gameplay began. It turns out the section I was so enthralled with was nothing more than a prologue which was leading to a horrible disappointment. The actual gameplay turned out to be nothing more than a simple game of keep away with a ""monster"" that was comically non-threatening and who, when he caught you, proceeded to do nothing more than repeatedly stab at you in a poorly animated motion that slowly ticked down the players health bar.The breaking of the mood in this game and the poor gameplay that ensued was a massive dissapointment since the introduction was so effective at putting me on edge.A solid premise but horrendous execution."

,Recommended,619490,31990264,Posted: 27 May,all,Cthulhu Redux,This is a neat little indie horror title that includes a little bit of stealth and a couple of other interesting little ideas. Also Clowns.See for yourself:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb6I9E1BrNg
76561198083907346,Not Recommended,619490,31455680,Posted: 29 April,all,Jawdoc,"Well done for an Indie project.  Eerie, if not particularly horrifying.  Certainly worth $2.  Now in the level after the padded room.  Obviously now in the psychiatric hospital which was aluded to in the notes found on previous level. Problem I am having is the same as alot of other people.  Game crashes/hangs if you saved the game at the padded room level and then try to resume the game from that saved point.  Otherwise a fun little game with that one fatal ""hiccup"" that renders it useless from that point unless you want to start over at the beginning again......"

I'm not used to horror games anymore, so this was a treat to be messed with. I like how dark the atmosphere is, and the clowns aren't scary anymore once you get a good look! I've gotten jumpscared multiple times playing this game. One, not knowing where the clowns are, two progressing in the game and being spooked by a clown on the other side of a wall, not know he's there. One of the things I'm confused about, is that I picked up a wrench, but it's not in my hand? I had a knife, but I lost that due to a clown wanting to stab me! I think my game glitched, idk, but still a good game."
,Recommended,619490,31450332,Posted: 29 April,all,KyleKidd,"First Impression Gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo-qGt6inUk&feature=youtu.beWhile not perfect, ""Fear of Clowns"" performs a fairly decent job of delivering a tense atmosphere and feeling of suspense.  Coulrophobes be warned, if you can't take the impending threat of evil clowns, perhaps stay away.  As far a gameplay is concerned, you start out being startled from sleep in the middle of the night to the sound of your doorbell.  As you leave your appartment (within a large apartment complex), things quickly go sour.Graphics are not the best, but are decent enough to not ruin the game.  Audio is quite good, with sound effects really adding to the suspense and tense atmoshpere.  Hearing the distant squeek of a clown nose quickly becomes very unsettling.  The horror aspect is done tastefully (so far as I've seen), without the overuse of jump scares.  Less can be more in games of this nature, and I think they found a good balance.  I did suffer from a crash shortly after the padded room.  It may have been caused by my recording software and screen capture.  For ~$2, I think this one is worth it.PROS-Great use of sound effects/audio-Effectivly creates a tense and suspenseful atmosphere-Doesnt rely too heavily on jump sace (though you will find them)-Plays effectivly on a fear of clowns (Coulrophobia)-Graphics are average, not much to say other then not horrible.-Price is on pointCONS-Would have been nice to see more detail put into the world (but for ~$2, maybe thats asking for a lot)-Did not see an option to adjust volume levels-Game crashed shortly after padded room.  (admittedly, it may have been caused from my recording software)"

76561198138035940,Recommended,619490,31633986,Posted: 8 May,all,Narrative,"For a $2.99 horror indie, its good. It was entertaining and suspenseful, especially if you play it with your friends watching and with the lights off. It does crash when you die but it takes a few seconds to boot back up.For an indie horror, I give it a 7.5/10 and I recommend buying.For my gameplay and commentary, click the link below :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMsZ-O7xnPE&t=584s"

,Recommended,619490,31468136,Posted: 30 April,all,TipsyNerd,"I was SO looking forward to playing this game!The short amount of time I've been able to play the game has done a very good job at keeping me on edge.I can't knock this by giving it a thumbsdown but my game works perfecftly fine UNTIL I get in the elevator, after it tries to load after getting off the elevator the game crashes. I know that this is not a problem with the game, as I've seen walkthrough's where it loads properly. If anyone can message me and tell me what a possible fix for this might be I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!"

,Recommended,619490,31455134,Posted: 29 April,all,FamousScrub,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVKbHlY5SNkLet us first address the question that is on most peoples' minds. Is Fear of Clowns scary? If you have a case of Coulrophobia, (which to me is a weird way of describing a fear of clowns) then yes, this game will freak you the heck out. Everyone else though? I can't guarantee it will bring the heavy fear factor, but you will get startled by a few jump scares, that's for sure.Personally I found Fear of Clowns more funny than scarry, which may seem like a bad thing, but it totally isn't. I really did have a blast playing the game. The game starts kind of slow, as it works on building a palpable tension and atmosphere. When you finally do run into Bobo (my personal name for him) the clown, then the fun really starts! Bobo can be a little slow to react, but when he does, watch out!! Michael Myers himself would be impressed with how well Bobo wields his butcher knife!The game does have a few issues. It will crash during the load screen occasionally. Yes, there is a load screen. It doesn't take a super long time (like The Inevitability's if you played or watched that), but it is presesnt which can be annoying. Bobo's AI can get a little wonky at times, but it's more hilarious than anything else.For $2 and fiddy cents I came into this game with zero expectations, and came away really surprised with what I've seen so far. I can't promise it will deliver majorily on the fear scale, but I've had a blast playing. I included a gameplay video at the top you can check out if you're curious as to how the game looks/functions."

,Recommended,619490,31487653,Posted: 1 May,all,GregGore,"So far so good (only about 10 minutes in) - so far the only negative is that it can crash if you die, best bet is to restart the game.  Half decent graphics, I like most of the sound effects (though when I get discovered and stabbed the sound is a bit underwhelming - I expected something far more dramatic) and the controls are smooth, though sometimes it's a little tricky to pick something up quickly, but that is minor.  I will say that the clowns so far aren't too scary but definitely creepy!  Actually the scariest thing for me was a painting that changed when you looked away and back at it - sometimes it's the simple things that get me.I made a video of the first part of the game here:https://youtu.be/UBGUslS2mZE"

They have a made a really scary environment and with the amazing sound effects it just creeps you the hell out!+ Scary Environment+ Sound effects+ Jumpscares+ Objects that freaks you out- Game Mechanics- Experienced a crashThe controls/game mechanics could be better and i experienced a crash, but compared to the price you cant really complain.I will definitely recommend any horror-game fan to try out this game."
