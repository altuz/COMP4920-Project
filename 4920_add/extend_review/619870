,Recommended,619870,33562938,Posted: 15 July,all,Frank,"This is a great example of the ""Don't judge a game by its cover"". The ridiculously low price and the not so appealing pixelart made me think that this was a quick ""pay the bills""  project but since it was made by Jonas Kyratzes i picked it up anyways and boy i was wrong.The game starts as your typical mario clone platformer, it requires almost zero skills in the beginning, its very relaxing and has an enjoyable storyline with some unexpected surpises. The variety of the monsters, the level design and the dialogues differentiate this game from your typical platformer you can expect to find on steam. The world is full of hidden secrets that award you with extra achievements and for the most part you can play any level you want in the order you want. This will be my only negative point, you might find some of the end levels ""unbalanced"" but they are not, you have to play a different level istead and revisit those later.I don't write reviews regularly but here i had to because it's definetly one of the best games i played recently, i couldn't enjoy my 3$ more and i will definetly recommend this if you will spend 4-6 hours to 100% it."

Double-retro!Omegaland is easy to play, and so its rough edges become charming eccentricities. The world map lets you explore in the direction of your choice, so it's quite possible to reach at least two of the ""boss"" levels before any of the shops that sell powerups - but then it's possible todefeatthe bosses with minimal upgrades. The difficulty curve can be a little schizophrenic, depending on what order you play things in, but if you're struggling with one level then backtracking and trying a different one will usually work.It's cheap and simple and manages to evoke a huge world in spite of that. One gets the impression that this is the game where Jonas Kyratzes got to do all the things that he wouldn't be allowed to do in a big-budget AAA game. Some levels don't lead anywhere or seem to serve any purpose. Others seem to exist solely to show off some gimmick or joke - like Tiny Hill, a level with no enemies that takes two seconds to finish. Sometimes new game mechanics show up without any introduction. And yet it all works.In most other games these would be mistakes. Omegaland teaches you to expect them. Omegaland will not hold your hand, will not guide you to the ""correct"" path, will let you make mistakes and then laugh at you... but you have plenty of hit points and dying only sets you back two minutes, so you're laughing along with it. It is easy and fun and gives you much more leeway than most other games, and then it uses this leeway to indulge in off-the-wall design decisions straight out of a thousand teenagers' first Flash games.Buy it if you're nostalgic for Flash games ten years ago!Also buy it if you just like easy and quirky platform games!"
,Recommended,619870,33485521,Posted: 12 July,all,luthier1729,"Pretty fun little platformer, with a world full of colorful characters and secrets to discover.It starts out pretty relaxed, with no time limit for the levels and a lot of collectibles and treasures to find. You can use the coins you get to purchase a few upgrades for your character, which will definitely come handy as the ending starts to draw near.And then, well, as the game description says, let's just say that there might be a few surprises along the way indeed.Definitely worth its asking price (and more, certainly)."
76561197999647773,Recommended,619870,33513198,Posted: 13 July,all,ErsatzDragon,Well worth it for fans of Mr. Kyratzes (much) earlier works.

,Recommended,619870,33733352,Posted: 22 July,all,Puzzlem00n,"Before the ""few surprises,"" I liked this game a lot. It took a while to get used to the physics, but the art was cute, the collectibles and other jokes were funny, and figuring out the layouts of the castles was a fun challenge.After the ""few surprises,"" I loved this game. The music and sprawling levels create a real sense of awe, the sparse dialogue gives me just enough to care about the characters, and the Omegaflow mechanic is a brilliant metaphor for the capricious world Jonas experiences (e.g. cat emergencies). There are also great callbacks to previous games in the Kyratzesverse (a term I coin precisely because Jonas will hate it). Try it out!"
,Recommended,619870,33861690,Posted: 28 July,all,Stokes,"Omegaland is a coin-collecting platformer reminicent of early 90's cd-rom games. The story is standard save the princess fare with a nice twist mid-way through the game.  Level design is a mixed bag, ranging from downright awful to ingenius.  Some require specific character upgrades to complete, while some are quite trivial. Overall, I had a fun time with it.+ Story twist is neat and rather well done.+ There are multiple ways through multiple levels.+ Does not take itself too seriously.+ Music and sound design is great.- No controller support. Keyboard control scheme that is absolutely brutal for left handers. I had to use my right hand for WASD and crossed my left hand over my right to hit ENTER for jump.- Some levels require specific upgrades to beat, which for story reasons you might not even know is available to you.- Considering how powerful you are by endgame, the final level is a bit underwhelming."
,Recommended,619870,33702205,Posted: 21 July,all,synthanatos,"If you're thinking about getting this game because it's made by Jonas Kyratzes, and you (rightly) loved his work on Talos Principle and The Sea Will Claim Everything, but you're worried that this game looks really boring/dumb/simplistic and aren't sure if it's worth getting purely based on the developer...Get this game. It's much more clever than it looks. And no, I'm not just talking about the fact that there *is* a twist, but that it's actually *done* really, really well. This isn't going to reach you as deeply as TTP or TSWCE, but it's unmistakably a product of the same mind. Unquestionably worth $3."
,Recommended,619870,33700415,Posted: 21 July,all,saitcheson,Much more to this than initially meets the eye. A solid little platformer with some startling twists and turns. An absolute bargain!

,Recommended,619870,33545303,Posted: 14 July,all,Enuo,A delightful platformer that gains in depth at about a third of the way in. Definitely worth a shot.

It's alot of fun and quite alot of content and upgrades, aswell as a good number of achievements which are a challenge to complete but not too hard to get them all. I loved it, and I hope others will give it a try aswell!"

There is a bit of a challenge, but nothing that you cannot overcome by trying one more time.  Be sure to get any upgrades you need prior to turning in all of the keys.....and that's as close to a spoiler as I will get ;-)"

,Recommended,619870,33778304,Posted: 24 July,all,Cap'n Crazy,For $3 this is a steal. A neat (if a bit on the easy side) little adventure from the guy who wrote TSWCE and The Talos Principle with some fun twists along the way. Bring the kids!**Don't actually bring the kids. Trust me on this one.

,Recommended,619870,33616995,Posted: 17 July,all,A Pocketful of Stars,"+ Usually more than one path through a level, which makes them more fun to return to+ Full upgrade system is quite fun+ Cute world that starts to feel a bit like home- Platforming controls are a little clunky- No gamepad support yet- Grinding is optional, but you'll need to do at least a bit of it if you want all those upgrades* I wouldn't personally call this casual. There's a difficulty spike about a third of the way through. It's never challenging per se, but it's enough that you won't be able to cruise through without some thought.Similar to the old pixel Mario games, except Omegaland is filled with silly humour and characters in each level who chat with you. It's a charming game that prods you not to take things too seriously; you're even reassured that you're not killing the monsters you stomp on, just throwing them out of the area.You can revisit every level you play through, which means you're never short on coins (which you use to buy health and other upgrades), and you don't have to stress out if you miss something. It's a nice touch, plus it makes the map feel more like a world you're exploring rather than a series of gameplay objectives.Not joking, MAJOR SPOILER FOR THE FINAL SCENE: Personally, I didn't like that I was forced to kill the villain. It spoiled the utopic vibes to see a bunch of characters I liked cheering for murder. I would prefer to at least have the option of imprisoning them instead.TL;DR: Fun world to explore, sweet and silly sense of humour, and quite a lot of gameplay for something less than $4. If you tend to avoid stories that appear too twee, this might not be a good fit for you, but if you're in the right mood for it you should find something to love here."

,Not Recommended,619870,33529166,Posted: 13 July,all,darien,"A simplistic platformer with stiff controls, dodgy hit detection, questionable level design, and no gamepad support. At least Kyratzes found time to include lots of bone-brained communist propaganda!"

,Recommended,619870,34417209,Posted: 22 August,all,Sean Han Tani,"Nice, simple platformer with gradual difficulty curve that can be alleviated by occasionally finding or buying health upgrades. Also the general tone of the game is consistent. If you're interested in making a platformer as well this is a good game to study."

76561198126592129,Recommended,619870,35474808,Posted: 4 October,all,StereoCat,Really fun little platformer. It's the kind of game that is bigger and more difficult than it seems at first. The story is pretty original and the gameplay is really good. For the price you really can't go wrong (it could even be higher and I would still recommend it).
76561198075435104,Recommended,619870,35510274,Posted: 5 October,all,finesseb,"I love love love this game. It starts out as a peaceful and enjoyable platformer but increases in difficulty to what I find to be sufficiently challenging. Hard but not insane. It's also an incredibly unique and interesting game with a lot of really cool features. I loved everything this game had to give me and found it to be a lot of fun to play. It's especially worth it for the price. There's a lot of hours of content in this game, it's genuinely very fun, and it's also a unique experience.I've been a fan of this game designer for over 5 years and I've never been disappointed by any of his work and I've gone out of my way to play as much as I can. I'd recommend checking out his website if you like the game."
