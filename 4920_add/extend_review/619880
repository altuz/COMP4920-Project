,Recommended,619880,35118027,Posted: 21 September,all,Name Brand Hipster™,"Ok yes? BUT! A big butt here. This is the one time I wish a game *was* in beta. Because, while the game is great, I feel it's not finished yet. Like. Why aren't there multiple maps? The match making is kind of meh. It's not horrible, but it could be allot faster.The gameplay is hands down fun as hek.  It doesn't matter if your getting wrecked, or if you're a raptor or an Omega, each stage is fun to play and it has great replay ability. Also the sounds and visuals are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ically awesome.HOWEVER! I can totally see this game dying on the vine within the first two months, and being forgotten like our disappointing friend No Mans Sky over there. Mainly because there's ONLY ONE MAP!Why they thought this was a smart move, I don't know, but it's going to hurt the game. We needgame-modes, we needmaps, we need to be able to choosecommunity servers.I mean, come on. This game really feels half baked in this area.Great game. My only beef is that there isn't enough of it. So, consider that a compliment? But also like, c'mon Ubisoft. Stop holding out on us. We love your game... love us back. ;)"

Same game mode 8-man free for all, on the same map over and over and over....and that's it.  It seems super cool, looks nice and plays super smooth...there's just nothing there.  Maybe if they add more later I'll pick it back up but for now I'm getting that refund."
76561198125743694,Recommended,619880,35066844,Posted: 19 September,all,NekoApocalypse,"Fun and innovative gameplay, but still needs some polish.I just played this game for a few matches, so I will share my impressions so far:In this game you start as the humble Atom, and as you collect mass from the map and fallen enemies you evolve into larger, more powerful, yet slower forms, and ultimately, the Omega. The most powerful Omega form only lasts for a short time so you have to make the most out of it. After the Omega timer ends you are revert back to the Atom.Every form feels a little bit different to control and they are all pretty fun. The game itself emphasis on evading larger life-forms and predating lessor ones, while securing your territory to collect all the mass. You can win a fight against a larger enemy, but that's extremely hard, so you have to play by the rules: collect, pray and hide.The best part of this game is that it offers a brand new experience: it's like a jungle simulator where you are both the predator and the pary, fighting your way to become the apex predator and get to the top of the leaderboard.Still the game feels a little bare-bone. You have no way to customize the abilities of your life-form other than the random pick up from the map, and (as far as I know) there is only one game mode and a single map. And you cannot team up with your friends (you can invite them into a game, but cannot play as a team). The game has so much potential, I really hope they will add more features in the future.Still, the game is lots of fun and totally worth the price."
,Recommended,619880,35066437,Posted: 19 September,all,blaa,"After 50 minutes my first impression. I´ll give it a thumbs up, but it might be a ""neutral"" at this point(if it were available)- certainly not negative, though.Good:- Smooth gameplay, game flows very well- Clear visuals, good sound- A nice conceptBad:- Transition between stages of being pretty fast, imo the small, fast stages are way more fun(when you can zip around the arena with high speed), but you spend way more time as a large, chunky, slow being- Damage + health gaps from lower to higher stages too big, I was shooting a 5th or 6th as a 3rd or 4th and I barely made a dent in his health with lots of hits while one of his hits took 90% of my health. It should never be pointless to shoot at someone.- Not enough content. There really is only one arena/map(correct me if I am wrong)?!Bugs:- Larger beings clipping partly through walls"
76561198057797146,Recommended,619880,35078868,Posted: 19 September,all,Prism,"ATOMEGA is a game where the main objective is to collect cubes in order to become a stronger form while attempting to defeat your oponents in the brink of an arena that is drifting ever closer to absolute destruction.I really enjoy the game for its simplicity. No long tutorial, no convoluted controls. Just a nice, solid, fast-paced game. And while I do believe that there could be many things to add to the game, such as a few more different arenas, some game modes, a versus A.I., and maybe even different exoforms (perhaps different variants), the price is very fair for this game.There's just one thing I'm worried about, though.The playerbase is very low, and the game could very well end up dead on arrival. This would be especially bad if no bot mode were implemented where, at the very least, you could skirmish by yourself with A.I. controlled enemies. I will do my best to promote this game and spread the word. I am just hoping that the rest of the community will do so as well.Thanks for such a nice and simple game, Reflections. Your game, Grow Home, was really good, too."

While you will do less than 10% of damage. Its not possible to dodge since you throw lasers.It seems this game is about who can gather cube faster but not really anything else...There are good ideas but not my taste."

,Recommended,619880,35071598,Posted: 19 September,all,TheSkullKid,ATOMEGA is a good game. However it seriously needs to be promoted more by ubisoft and get some more content like maps and customisation. The gameplay is fun although slow due to the lack of players and the networking needs some work as I have died many times behind corners. Overall I would reccomend it due to it's relatively low price and serious need for more players.

Gain mass over the stage to grow bigger, bigger forms, the stronger you are, there is a max form that you shred everything and are really tall. Then you go back to the first growth stage and work your way back up. I cannot stress how much fun this game is. Only requires 4 players to start a match, can usually get a match pretty easily. It has sometimes wheree it will be hard to find a game but it is not often and the game only came out yesterday. I cant wait until the community grows on this game and to see where the devs take us. When this game starts to roll out updates, it will only make it so much better. MUST GET ONLY $10!!"

76561198218463491,Recommended,619880,35076205,Posted: 19 September,all,BryanLeng223,"The imagination in this game is absolutely stunning.By combining FPS with the concept of survival for the fittest and decent graphic, this game is absolutely a breakthrough in the video game industry, though it is not the first of its kind.I especially enjoyed how the final stage of transformation resembles EVA 01. The final stage requires a consistent supply of energy so the player has to keep collecting (sucking) blocks to maintain its ""god"" form.I had really high expectations for this game and so far it hasn't let me down yet. However, I think Ubisoft should add more modes into ATOMEGA because there's only PVP mode now, and that might make players feel bored soon. Team matches/PVE would most likely work well in this game. Imagine if Ubisoft adds a single player mode or co-op mode where players have to face a gigantic monster together.All in all, I am impressed and contented for now. Ubisoft can make this game even better by adding new modes and new transformation types. I would suggest anyone who likes FPS/Agario to try it out."

76561198140959873,Recommended,619880,35134348,Posted: 22 September,all,cork25,"wow... this game though! so in the game you start off small and insignificant but as you aquire mass you grow into bigger and stronger exoforms. now as is there is only one arena as im sure you know if you have looked into this game at all. but that one arena is very well made. good size with many secret passage ways for the wee ones to slip into and hide in. the gameplay is very smooth with great sounds and animations. some people have said the the balance between the small and large exoforms is not very good, but i would disagree. even when in a small form you can take out players of higher level than you with the use of items, said secret passgage ways and a little know how. when you reach the top teir you will feel unbeatable but that is not so. at the top teir you have a marker placed on you which means all players know exactly where you are. and shooting the Omega (top teir) gives you mass at a very fast rate so the little guys can just pick at his ankles to get bigger. but the Omega is not defensless oh no no. all things considered this game is a gem and with a little patience i hope it will grow to be a game with multiple omegas where a player can choose what path of exoforms they want to evolve through. that is my hope for this game but as for now its good enough for me!"

A couple new maps would be nice, as you get pretty used to the current one quite quick.The learning curve isn't too hard, same with controls, I actually expected it to be a bit harder to control. I would prefer it to be a bit faster pace, similar to Quake (but that may be due to me playing a bunch of Quake champions lately).For $13 it is quite worth it though."

I quickly outgrew my oponent and dominated from there on. I reached the final state (in which you are quite strong but also quickly die and start again with zero mass). Since the map is huge when there are only two players I managed to gain enough mass to dominate again...  It wasn't that exciting but I could imagine that it would be better with a populated game.Second game:This time there were four others with whom I had to compete for dominance. It was WAY more exciting. I ""struggled"" a little bit to set myself apart but once I eliminated my biggest contender it was just enjoyable enough for me not quitting.

I love the idea, i love the gameplay, i love the art style, what i don't love is how there is only one map. this is a huge detriment to the game, and while the map is well made, it does not fully compensate for the lack of more. despite this i feel the price tag issnt unreasonable and I look forward to how Ubisoft will respond to the communitiy's requests."

,Recommended,619880,35164746,Posted: 23 September,all,blazinblevins,Had a blast playing this game. Only two concerns were the single multiplayer map and the matchmaking. Overall the game is still worth the buy.

The idea is very similar to agar.io, except it's a bit more strategic and overall more fun with 3D FFA shooter-style gameplay as well as excellent map design.If you like games like agar.io, you'll love this. Definitely worth the price in my opinion!"

Think being inside a computer simulation, a la the Tron Films.The game is played in rounds, or matches.  There is no single player campaign or any real deep storyline to sink your teeth into.  But does Rocket league?  No.  Some games don't need a huge story to be fun.The game is currently only deathmatch style.  No team games, unless you decide to informally team up against someone.  Honestly, this won't happen:  there can be only one!You search the map (time is ticking down) as a single celled 'exoform' and collect cubes to grow to the next stage of growth.  There are six stages.  With it comes the ability to defend yourself as well as use 'hacks' to move faster, collect faster, teleport across the map, shield up, and more.Everytime you get larger, you move slower.  However, your weapon is more powerful and you get more points.The goal is to be the one with the most points at the end of the game.  The best way to get there (and the most fun) is to grow to the final, largest Exoform, the 'Omega'.  You are at your most powerful at this form and your ability to gather points is above and beyond all other exoforms.  But when everyone else takes a shot at you, you lose 'cubes' to them helping them grow.  You also lose points on a meter.  To extend your time as an Omega?  You must 'deform' your enemies and suck up cubes!  When the meter is shot, you become a single celled dude again.You can become the Omega multiple times in a game.  Outside the game you can 'level up' to change your color and texture in future rounds.  This doesn't affect how well you play, it only allows you to customize the way you look.The devs have been actively listening to gamers, have already fixed a few issues in a patch and have written a short outline for the future.People are concerned that the developers are not going to add content, as it currently only has one large map.No worries, the devs have already responded that more content is in the works!Try the game out, you can't lose for only $10!"
,Recommended,619880,35177012,Posted: 24 September,all,Mr. Dunkaccino,"This is a really fun game with a nice look, but the devs should add more content as soon as possible to give it a better start. As good as I enjoy this game, I fear of it falling into the gutter because of lack of content"
76561198278796997,Recommended,619880,35196326,Posted: 24 September,all,EternalFlame,"ATOMEGA is a very unquie game that stars alot of differnt aspects from different poupler games. It has great graphics for a $10 game and even better gameplay that is very smooth. I would recommend this game if you like games that are still fighting but still youy have to take your time to build up your power. Some downs are that maybe the dev team should make the time for each match longer becuase for some people it might not give them enough time to actaully exprience the game in its full potential. Another down is that (i dont know if it is just me) the game crashes alot. But the game is still a worthy game to play with it's outstanding controls and graphics, and excellent gameplay.-EternalFlame"

The Devs are active and to say how new the game is, it's really polished!If you want a casual game with a ton of replayability then this is one you should check out for sure.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM5WSm5Ay4k"
