,Recommended,620240,33587418,Posted: 16 July,all,Kevkong aka sQk :-*,"+ great soundtrack+ moderate difficulty (it is not too easy, you will not clear all levels on the first try, but definitly will after some tries)+ controls are fine, playing with a XBOX One Controller (care: junp, pause and reroll achievement won't unlock with controller)+ some levels are designed pretty well- little playtime, hard mode would be cool- some levels are designed pretty bad"

Surprisingly enough, the soundtrack is enjoyable, though. It's basically enough to entertain a kindergartener.Not much else to say here. I'll allow myself to say it belongs to what people call ""garbageware"", since the devs probably didn't mean it to be any more than that. Otherwise, there wouldn't be trading cards, 90% coupons and tons of achievements.Not judging, nobody's forced to play this anyway."

,Recommended,620240,34009733,Posted: 3 August,all,Real,"It's like Super Meat Boy meets the Atari 2600. Controls are a bit sluggish, but it offers a good challenge all along the 36 levels. Very pleasant electro / alternative music tracks. Achievements, trading cards, cheap, what more should we ask? 5 thumbs up."

You need timing, concentration and a little bit of luck eventually to get through.Positive:+ Challenging, yet not impossible+ Great Soundtrack+ Different good ideas for the levels+ Never gets boring and keeps you playingNegative:- Rather short (more neutral, than bad)- Difficulty of the levels is random- Controls are VERY sensitive- Senseless achievement spamm- Bugged achievements (you will need a keyboard to get them all)"

,Not Recommended,620240,33993603,Posted: 3 August,all,ExNought,"Its a nice little platformer, really, but I only pressed through it to get all the achivements, they are mostly well earned :)The dev did push out an update some days ago that added a couple achivements. For clicking on a flag and a heart in the credits! That is not really achiving anything other than many people outraging because they lost a 100%-game for valid NO reason. Me personally? I don't like it, but pushed through them with a macro saving me of 40+ clicks ... yes...But because of that I give this a thumb down, as this is not nice, its that simple!"
,Recommended,620240,33763666,Posted: 24 July,all,Wormatsu,"For a game that I got for 10 cents after getting a badge crafting coupon and going ""eh, why not"", it was a nifty little timewaster. It's a very basic platformer with all the default platformer tropes. Avoid enemies and spikes, watch out for platforms that disappear from under your feet, make some very tight jumps on very small platforms and just run run run. The order of the levels doesn't really have any rhyme or reason, you might have a very simple ""jump on a few platforms"" level right after a god damn long maze littered with spikes and enemies, and the game engine is very simple, slowing down drastically on the few levels where there's a bit more objects on the screen.Who do I recommend this game for? Achievement hunters. It took me 0.4 hours to finish the game and all the achievements came quite automatically. And those who, like me, got a coupon for this and happen to have the 10 cents just waiting on their Steam Wallets. After idling for the rest of the cards and selling them, the total price of the game will round out to about 5 cents. Not all that much for a nifty quick little platformer, though if you're not interested in achievements or trading cards, you'll probably find better ones for free on Flash game websites..."

76561198145174355,Recommended,620240,33819251,Posted: 26 July,all,Красное дерево,"Unique & entertaining platformer, in the vein of Super Meat Boy & Pinkman.First thing - it reminds me games, like ""Pinkman"" or Messhofs ""The Puinshment"" just from his minimalistic looks.It plays very similar to the both much much harder Pinkman or Team Meat's Super Meat Boy. The idea and mechanics are just the same. I think SMB has the only difference the run button - to both others.I thought, its a very hard platformer, because of those other games mentioned earlier. but, surprisingly this one is by far the easiest of all. I was surprised, how easy it was - so its an easy 100% game.Mechanics works well, and also the music fits the game just well. There arent that much levels especially compared to games-  like SMB or Pinkman, plus with its very easy difficult level, you wont spend that much time on this - as the others.While, you play in both other games for countless of hours - due to their difficulty, this one doesnt even take an hour for an average platform gamer. This is like a walk in the park.The controls just work fine - although, i only played it with the (xbox 360) controller. One thing, about the achievements:I was very SURPRISED, that i did not unlock any auto chievos - like ""First jump"" or Press R button"" - this bug is, when you play with a controller, they arent recognized, by your joypad inputs - so, in the end, i had to use keyboard, to unlock them. (i did in fact not press R on the keyboard, until the end of game). When you just use joypad, it just wont work.So those would be my only 2 complaints about this game:-joypad bug for auto achievements, like ""pause the game"" or""make your first jump""  - for a hunter a bit annoying.-very short and maybe a bit too easy.All in all, for its price and for its craftmanship (its a very solid platformer with very superb controls)i would recommend this tiny gem to any fan of the genre. It the other games are too hard for you (like for me), then you will be surprised with this. Give it a try."
,Recommended,620240,34998530,Posted: 16 September,all,𝐋𝐨𝐬𝐨,"Game of the year. I recommend playing this game on the keyboard than on the steering wheel. Sensitivity of moving is also really high, it can be indeed hard to play under the influence of alcohol. There is a bunch of levels, which are gradually becoming harder - stupider also. Authors of this game have forgotten to write precise warning, that your table or any computer device AREN'T safe anymore, so it is good when you have to beat a meat. Super meat boy's little brother. Graphics are also lit, but only if you are on drugs. Achievements are truly good hidden, to get them you have to click everywhere. Solid game."

,Recommended,620240,34559843,Posted: 28 August,all,Expired Waffle,"This is one of the times that I would love a ""Mixed Review"" button. There are a few reasons to recommend it, such as the cheap price (I had a 90% off coupon), a nice challange, and the pleasing art style.Yet, the flaws are abundent. The difficulty varies wildly, such as being able to die dozens of times on an early level, then going on to run through the next 3 without so much as a sniffle. Preformance is another problem. Framerate is locked at 30 frames, but on some levels it can drop all the way to 20 on my 1050ti.  My biggest complaint are the controles. They feel very floaty, with the jump button being late from time to time.All in all, it's a short(beat it in 35 min), very average platformer for someone with a few cents to spend."

,Recommended,620240,35475422,Posted: 4 October,all,Zynischer Narzisst,"Outrunner is a simple and funny jump n' run.In each level you just have to grab the coin, which is sometimes pretty difficult because of the several obstacles.The graphic is minimalistic but still very nice and the soundtrack is awesome (but not very much different songs)!Also you get a lot of achievements. I played 35 min. now and got 37 achievements!The controls are really difficult in the first few minutes, but after a while, when you understand how the character jumps its quite ok. Just sometimes the player won't jump.Only negative point is the fact that you have seen every obstacle after the first few levels. There don't come new one, its just getting harder.Conclusion:Graphic: 7/10Sound: 7/10Controls: 7/10Fun: 8/10For the price of just 0,99€ (or even better in sale) its a must have!"

Volume settings and key bindings would make this game so much more enjoyable."
