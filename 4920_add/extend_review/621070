,Recommended,621070,33868936,Posted: 28 July,all,Agent 56289,"This game has the ground work for an amazing game. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of bug right now (7-28-2017) but it just into EA. I would really like the controls to be improved as there seems to be a lag in movement. There also seems to be a bit of memory management issues. However, the game offers a combination I have never seen before in a game. A mix of RTS combat, city building, and third person adventuring. I can’t wait for the future of this game."
76561198006921706,Recommended,621070,34814103,Posted: 8 September,all,Owzo81,"Right, first things first, as mentioned in other reviews, this is EA. Anyone who has played an EA will know what that means. However, this is actually in a lot better place than a lot of other EA titles I have played. There are still bugs but i have found nothing game breaking yet. Mostly, just things are not yet implemented. Don't get me wrong there are bugs and it is obvious it is EA but the team is very transparent and eagerly want to hear your opinions and I even posted a suggestion and got a pretty prompt response saying my suggestion is already in the pipeline. That screams decent dev team to me.Anyway, to the game features. Quite a lot is already implemented but there is still a lot to come. And the things that are in the game already need a lot of polish and to be built upon. Graphics range from very good to things like terrain that does need a bit of work. Guessing these things are to come. Combat is a little clunky and appears to have bit of lag between click and action (would be amazing if they did some kind of mount and blade inspired combat) but anyway you get the idea.In conclusion as i am rambling a bit, this game holds a lot of promise. I have been looking for this type of game since northern shadow died and i bought the game and giving this a decent review due to the concept and the fact the dev team seems to deliver regular updates and are transparent. If this is something that speaks to you then get on board and help to make this game even better."

There are good and bad things to consider while deciding if this is a game you want to buy.The Cons:It's early access and like all early access there's no gaurantee it will ever leave early access.It's an early build so there are plenty of bugs for you to discover.Not all features have been implemented yet.Optimisation is poor especially for older machines, low frame rate is a given.The ProsThe game is pretty stable and rarely crashes.There is a lot of content in the game.The game is fun to play in it's current state.The developer is very responsive to queries.They're working hard to fix bugs and to add new features to the game.The futureStuff like the world map is apparently coming in the near future.The more interesting stuff like RPG leveling, character customisation, seige eqiupment, kingdom management etc. are in the medium to long term future.There's no gaurantee that any future planned content will make it into the game.Taking all this into account I think that Legends of Ellaria is worth the price at present as you'll get plenty of playtime for your money and have fun to boot. The future stuff is a gamble so if you're buying it because of what's promised I'd be careful. But if the game appeals to you in it's current state then I'd say go for it."

I just thought I would see a world map at the least. I`m getting and seeing things like a wierd shadow effect around the ground and in the sky. No foot step sounds or body movement sounds like jumping. its going to progress I know this, but this game needs a MAP and SOUND, please devs. Seems to be a fog over the entire scene as well, idk if its just me or what. ive tried low to max settings. Buy it and enjoy its progress."

76561197980911757,Not Recommended,621070,33883886,Posted: 29 July,all,Masked,"PROS:The main strength of this game, in its current state, is the atmosphere. Each location is distinctive, detailed and entertaining. It makes you want to explore and, from what I could tell, the world is large.- Visuals: textures, models and dungeons look really good and the spells look amazing!- Writing: the quests, after 2.5 hrs of playing, were still interesting and unique.- Building: I only played long enough to create a single house, but placing it and then watching it get built was nice. You're also able to go inside of every building.- Audio: I liked the background music and sound effects.- Humor: Sometimes, a dying enemy screams, ""no, my treasure!"", which I think is quite funny.MID:- No map: I honestly liked exploring the large caves without a map. You feel like you could actually get lost in there, but I can see how some people might not like that.- Day/night cycle: this seems like a useless feature atm. It might be cool for some quests, but there should be some way to sleep or light your way so that you don't have to explore in the darkness.- Items/resources: you're able to find, pick up and carry different things. It's in a good state for an alpha. I couldn't figure out what I could do with the extra weapons that I found.- Physics: there are some noticeable physics. For example, your fireball falls down over time.CONS:The main weakness of this game is the complete lack of immersion and fluidity. Even if you ignore all the (many) bugs, this game is still an example of choosing quantity over quality and form over function.- Combat mechanics: if the devs remove ALL enemies and temporarily make this an exploration/building game, while they completely change these mechanics, then I would probably recommend the game. That's how BAD it is... Your bow is useless, the sword is great for swinging, but not for fighting or blocking. The fire spell aim is off. The only way to stay alive is to outrun your enemies (horrible AI), to wait for them to get stuck (horrible path finding), or to kill them from a distance with your fire spell. Oh and you can't loot them.- Fluidity: Do you like constant loading screens and choppiness? Well, play this game because that's how you get both. The movement is choppy, the music stops and starts randomly and the FPS seems to take a dip as soon as you need to defend yourself. I can understand a loading screen when I enter/exit a cave, but not when entering every tiny building or when opening the options menu. Really, can someone explain why the options menu takes a day to show up?There are a lot of bugs in this game and normally I would say that they're very reasonable for early access, but this thing has been in development for FOUR YEARS. It feels like the devs just move forward with new content and never come back to make any of it functional or fun. That's why I don't recommend it."

Does it need improvement? well yes, of course, it's a hugely ambitious project. At present it's still playable, unlike at launch but what is crucial to games like this is continued support otherwise it will be abandoned"
76561198410800597,Recommended,621070,33957672,Posted: 1 August,all,12looli,"Hi guys! Just bought and played this game for the first time! the first thing engaged my eyes was the overwhelming landscapes of this game~ I looked around other games in the early access wondering which one to buy, and this one catched me the most. The king is nice, it's nice that he can be followed by soliders... the quests are cool and fighting is everywhere... I loved that in the beginning the king moved to the new world through the patrol. I like the idea that i'm part of the dev of this game becoz there are bugs here and there, and that now i put an amount that soon enough will cost probably much more. Cheers and looking forward to new developments :)"
76561197988745431,Recommended,621070,34155419,Posted: 10 August,all,Augustus,"Excellent game concept, unlike any other RPG I have played.  Dont be swayed by the negative reviews for this game, it is after all a EA title, which has just been released.  So far the DEVs have been very quick in responding to in game bugs, player suggestions on game improvement, and other matters pertaining to this game.  If the DEVs can keep up their pace on updates, I believe this will be an excellent addition to any RPG fan who also likes the aspect of a strategic sandbox game.In closing, if you are good with EA games, which means less polished, and full of bugs, then grap this title and add your positive imput towards the developement of this game."

I constructed a house and went into a cave. When I came back the house was built. That's a really cool feature. Hope there will be territory wars"

76561198007561034,Recommended,621070,33984158,Posted: 2 August,all,Reaper776,"This game is in early access so keep that in mind when looking at negative reviews and also after buying it. The game has a lot of potential if people stay patient and give feedback on bugs as they play. All in all I would recommend buying this game, but whether you do that now or once it is out of early access is up to you of course."
,Recommended,621070,34921978,Posted: 13 September,all,Farhnir,"Good concept, if development makes constant progress we may see a good sandbox game. Graphic is not the best but hey, games are not all about graphics and physics. I definitely recommend the game in the future and if you want , support developers. It may give them more resources and advance the development ."
76561198168797818,Recommended,621070,33954313,Posted: 1 August,all,oliverolover10,Game has potential although it does have some bugs here and there but once fixed It could be a very good rpg

,Recommended,621070,34684188,Posted: 2 September,all,jm4music,"I have been following this game for a while and I challenge people to try and find a game in development that matches the scope and feel that this game is aiming to make.  What games out there allow you to build a kingdom top down one second, then dive into a cave and fight bandits and undead the next and then order your militia around the next.  The game has some bugs, spelling errors and performance issues, hence the early access tag above.  But just take a look at the news log and you will see the devs are not just being open about the development process but they are delivering what they are promising - a rare trait these days, especially for early access.Some of you might be disuaded by the reviews but please keep in mind that steam only counts steam purchasers towards the review count.  There are now (as of right this) 42 positive review of 55, which puts it at nearly 80%!  For an early access title that is far higher than most.Some things to keep in mind:-Combat is a but buggy - not that it is game breaking but it is hardly skyrim or the witcher.  Needs some tweaking to allow for a smoother feel.-Textures could use a bit of work to add more depth to them but there are still some pretty nice scenes in the game.-It is early access, if you want a finished game you should not buy this - if you want to support a dev that is actually following the spirit of early access then you know which button to press."

76561198168764957,Recommended,621070,35458291,Posted: 3 October,all,British Curmudgeon,"I was undecided about buying this game, but now it's on sale, I thought I'd try it out.This being early access, you've got to understand there are issues with the game, which is to be expected. Only through feedback to the Devs can they iron out various bugs. I played about an hour or so and found as with all unity based games when you stop using the ""W"" key, the character still walks a few steps??? That apart the game is enjoyable. Looks like you've got to build a town, employ people to fight for you and slaughter everything in sight! Sounds good to me.I'm looking forward to see how this game developes over time but for now it's very playable (can't stress that enough as so many early access games are awful)I would recommend you buying this game even with it's current rough edges and low fps on ultra settings.No Commentary Video  :https://youtu.be/Lk-tGj5SqwM"
