76561197970966562,Recommended,621810,32721587,Posted: 24 June,all,Bushid0g*,"Edit 2: Devs actually implemented fixes to the problems described below in a WEEK.I have no words.You should give them money, they deserve it.Leaving the rest of my review here for history's sake.Edit:Dev answers with humility and concern to all the points mentioned. That's how you change a review from negative to positive.Recommend to fans of the genre who wish to look over some flaws.This is a gem in the making, rough for now, but loads of fun to be had, partly shared with deeply frustrating moments.Part of the time spent playing Strain was really fun, and part was really frustrating. Half of my 6 hours play time (as of writing) has been spent restarting missions that went bad for reasons of gamedesign/controls.I want to like this game and i'm going to keep playing it a bit. A lot of things are really interesting if you like these kind of games.I write this review because experience told me sometimes dev read them, and there aren't too many yet. I'll be happy to change this to a positive one or remove it if the devs take care of several glaring, huge, user experience problems (appart from generic improvements that could be made to the UI/Controls):- Remove Escape as a shortcut ""exit to main menu"", put that ""exit to main menu"" somewhere else, and make the Escape key close the windows in game for christ sake..- Allow the player to skip the intro sequence. Everyone is going to fail in the first couple missions and will restart. Tutorial is long enough already and the first feeling will be of frustration.- Either prevent the Helicopter's Going Back to Base button to be pressed while the Heli is Docked, or ask for confirmation to leave when there are Soldiers on the ground. I just lost 3 soldiers on my most advanced game  because of a missclick - didn't realize I was still docked and repositionned my guys too close to an exit port. Didn't look close, sent heli to base, game saved just after the 3 guys got down and heli got out at the same moment. And that was a mission I had to restart 5 times. I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this feels really bad design. You shouldn't be able to abandon soldiers by accident. Ever.- Improve the Keyboard/Mouse controls or the game is going to burn forever in steam's abandonware hell. Most importantly, find a way to make a soldier rotate on himself without moving, please (appart from forcing fire in the direction you want him to turn towards... )I have faith."

,Recommended,621810,31588459,Posted: 6 May,all,Ant Person,"Strain Tactics is RTS strategy, set in a post-apocalyptic world where bodybags are pokeballs and human trafficking is an acceptable business practice.I've played a bit and will probably play some more. I recommend this to anyone who likes squad based strategy games. Included below are a bunch of pros and cons that I've come up with in about two hours of play. The game is fun, but is held back by UI problems (which makes it seem like it was for a touch screen primarily). The only time I found the UI actually intuitive was the Heli weapon fire screen, where the UI and big buttons were actually not that bad.Pros----------------+Each of the usable characters are pretty unique, and have different quirks depending on their class. Each of them can  be equipped with any type of weapon as long as they have eqipment slots big enough to hold them.+The equipment system is pretty good, each item has different weight and size (S to XL) which determines what slots they can fit in on characters, and how big of a movement penalty they incur. There's a big variety of equipment fromdifferent types of weapons (rifles, PDWs, explosive sniper rifles, grenades, etc.), consumables, armor, and other things.+Morale breaks are part of each of the characters, and add some more flavor to combat when their morale gets low from getting rekt. For example, some characters have the Panic break, which makes them shoot randomly.+In contrast to moral breaks, characters also have positive active traits like Encourage, which causes the character to increase the moral of other squadmates they're near.+From what I've played so far, characters don't die permanently. When they do kick the bucket, you can package up their dead body and revive them. Alternatively, you can sell their body for that sweet cash to buy more guns (or cigarettes).+The drag to move and character selection is kind of clunky but fairly useful. Positioning is really important in certain areas, because friendly fire is a thing.+The game is based around running missions and visiting your base (or other friendly hubs) for equipment. Travel is done through the Heli Transport, which can be landed in a mission to move troops. You can also use its weapons (note, do not use missles to solve a hostage situation), which include missles, machine guns, and explosive rounds.+Each of the missions are reasonably challenging and have a good bit of variety (escort, save hostage, retireve data, etc.). They can be revisited also. Best part is that most objectives are optional to the single main objective, which is kill hostiles. You can also leave a mission anytime you want.+After my last mission, I realized you could let friendlies (not from your squad) get killed, then take their equipment. It's all about saving the monies and getting that sweet, sweet anti-monster rifle, boys. You can also not do that, and save friendlies instead, but where's the fun in that?+Despite being top down, the game has really good art. Especially great is that the tone of the missions is supported by the art. Nothing like running your squad down a street filled with the carnage of the post-apolcalyptic world.+You can control squaddies even inside the Heli. There's also a decontamination shower to wash of that Strain gunk and the blood of your enemies.Cons-----------------The UI is definitely made for a touch screen. The buttons are too big or clutter the screen, and the controls are probably easier with a touch screen. This is pretty much the only thing holding it back, and could probably be fixed with a UI scale option.-I noticed that smoke effects from fires still are active when your team is in a building (and the fire is outside). Even if the building has no doors or windows to let the smoke in. If smoke effects from outside a building your in could be turned off or toned down, that could fix the problem pretty easily.-Lots of micromanaging equipment. Because the equipment system has so much stuff, it becomes a serious pain when you find an awesome gun as a drop but can't pick it up without calling down your transport, going to your locker, then deploying again to pick it up if you don't have space.-You need to press an icon to display item info, which is weird and clunky. Mousing over an item should include the info (actually, mousing over most things should include info, it would fix a lot of the clunkiness).-The game needs an easily accessible character/monster encyclopedia or database in-game. There are some times in missions where I meet something I've never seen before and want to learn about it before it explodes in my face and tries to eat my squad. Other times, I forget what a certain enemy can do, and it gets annoying to try to memorize these traits since there is such a variety of baddies.-Some impassible obstacles are not immedietely obvious. I've sometimes pulled my squadmates back only to have them get stuck on a piece of terrain that I thought they could walk over. If the line representing characters movement could be highlighted red to indicate impassible terrain, that could help with this."

This completely flew under the radar for me and it would have been a horrible shame if it did.It's a very very well thought out tactical strategy shooter, but is extremely noteworthy for the following points:- Game supports full touchscreen. This (like probably many of you) would instantly ring alarm bells like ""MOBILE PORT"" but this is absolutely not the case. It's a brilliant little crossover between both and handles fluidly once you get used to the (initially) strange controls. Trust me on this, you'll get used to it and for all the good it will do you, it does it flawlessly.- It's a biopunk themed game. We cannot possibly have enough of these. i mean srsly.- Everything feels organic and not overly simplistic. There's so many detailed ways to describe what i mean here but overall it's a very well flowing game, that has serious ambition in how maps are set up, how detailed they are, storyline flow, overall progression, and so on.- Death is not the end ! It's a rather ""timid"" concept but overall your dudes will die, horribly and a lot, but there's a system with story in place that removes the otherwise roguelike feel from this. I could argue that this isn't good or bad but in this scenario and given how often you're likely to get shredded within seconds from landing, it's by no means a bad thing.- Actual ""panic"" system that is so well thought out, i'd spoil it just talking about it. No really.Obviously this game has a few flaws as well, but nowhere near enough to warrant holding off playing thisA few worth mentioning:- Some of the overall game progression elements (ie: finding new stuff, new classes, etc) isn't very fluid. You basically have a static instance of a map (including the main base) that essentially resets upon each visit. This means you can destroy an entire city and nothing will change once you replay the mission. The only thing that varies each times are minute details like pickups, spawn locations and otherwise have no impact on replaying the map.- Somewhat vague about certain things like what certain items do, what certain classes require, but nothing too over the top.- A sort of unhinged feeling when it comes to story and interaction. You're given exactly 1 main goal and there's very little to no deviation from it. Individual mission briefings are extremely brief and the few times i did get interactions from other characters, it was not as much as i'd hoped :PAnd of course there's also great things !- Gameplay. The gameplay takes at least some getting used to, but it's so well performing that it's almost magical.- Musical score is limited but not boringly so. Same for the voice effects. The real kick are the visuals. There's a lot of detail on each map, slight variations on roofs, collapses, etc. Overall it felt great and wasn't horrible to look at after a while. I was hoping for a few night maps or somewhat more ambient designed ones, but the ones that are there are greatly done- Enemy design. My god i cannot praise this enough. Games like prototype did this and it's very much in line with that. Borrows heavily from J.Carpenter's ""the Thing"" in terms of design and overall feel, and is henceforth probably weighing the heaviest in giving this nothing short of a stellar review.So is this for you ? If you're very much into tactical strategy games, squad management, critical ""on your feet"" thinking and other such elements, then absolutely yes. That said, even if you're not hardcore into tight strategy then you'd still be able to get a lot of good times out of all of this :)Game isn't horribly long, but that depends on how well you're doing in games like this i guess. I clocked about 10h for the entire campaign, and for the price it's currently at, that's well enough in terms of ""good times for money"".Overall this is one of the few games that i'd like to see more of. Not just the strategy ideology but overall feel and theme. There's literally not enough games like this out there, and luckily the developer has made plans for a followup game :)"

When you finally managed to get your squad through some no-win situation it feels incredibly rewarding. If you do try it, give yourself a bit of time to get used to the controls."
,Recommended,621810,31617695,Posted: 7 May,all,Corrosion,"Pro:A nice art style combined with some advanced gameplay features that make the game stand out and unique. Sounds are decent, character art is good, runs smooth, and is pretty fun. It's tactical and decent.Neutral:I don't know if it's worth the $15 price tag... Maybe 10.Con:Incredibly frustrating with many bugs and little user friendliness. It would take too long to describe the painful things I've experienced in this game already with only an hour and a half in. Yes, it's fun, but oh my, don't be fooled. It isn't polished at all. Rough around the edges... Very rough."
76561198014566797,Recommended,621810,34511394,Posted: 26 August,all,SpecOps,"Strain Tactics is a true gem of Indie and Strategy genres! At first, i thought that the game is a bit overpriced, but amount of content and its quality(animations, music and sound effects are my personal favorites), proved me wrong! The game itself is a strategy(has a tactical pause!) with a heavy emphasis on squad and inventory management, and ability to support your ground troops from an armed to the teeth tactical helicopter. I`ll try to make this review short, again because of the amount of content(soldiers, morale mechanics, weapons and items, etc.) it has, or its gonna be a LOONG review that you feel tired to read :) Just try it yourself and you won`t regret it a bit! Also, developers are very responsive, and keep improving the game and mechanics. A little salt in honey jar(in my personal opinion) : touch screen/tablet controls(feels clunky at first, but after a couple of hours i found myself very accustomed to hotkeys), minor bugs here and there(but with developers like this, i guess that is a matter of time). To sum it up, Strain Tactics is a mix of things that we loved in XCOM and Red Solstice. Thanks for your attention and have a good day!"

76561198054234149,Recommended,621810,31563703,Posted: 5 May,all,Froofy,"So i've had the pleasure of playing this game back when it was still in its beta stages. The controls were so hard to manage at first omg, although, im no rts player. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate how slow it can get when you wana pick up things in the heat of battle and stuff. But man those parts are the most exhilarating of all. But like if you take the time to learn the controls its very intuitive with its share of slower aspects for noobs. Once you get past the controls the game seemed easier? I learn never to charge ahead with a full squad at the start, you'll just find it harder to manual control them one by one and end up dying. This game is very punishable its quite brutal.Tips,go in alone at the start to scout around, bring a faster character with you. Then when u feel confident nothings there to screw you over, string some lackeys behind but never a full squad (unless you know what you are doing)Try Sear, the guy you get for free at the start, dont give him weapons cos hes stupid and just drop it lol. But his ability is damn powerful, u can clear out a bunch of kill quests with just him and 2 other guys (preferably a faster turn speed one like jackal).Try to make your own rag tag team with stupid skills and see them try to fight things out, trust me its fun playing god >=)Most of all, the controls are very intricate and you need standard few hours to get it right, but the first few missions are so easy, try to at least learn how to use the diamonding system, makes life way easier.And don't be afraid to let your troops die. you can always get more lol ;)"
,Recommended,621810,33004053,Posted: 29 June,all,Percopius,"This is a really good tactics game. It works well with mouse and keyboard, or touch, or touch and keyboard. Dont't let that put you off, that it can be played on a tablet, they continue to patch the game and it is very deep. I have it on my laptop with a touch screen and it's works really well with my left hand on the keyboard, but I have mainly played it on my desktop with mouse and keyboard, and I think it actually works better with mouse for me (and I can read the screen easier, there are quite a few UI elements to monitor. The map has many locations that can be unlocked and replayed, and the 'agents' you will find in cryopods in unlocked areas give you the ability to craft the team you want (you can store any unit in a cyrovault, and as long as you grab the body, you can revive any team member if there is a cryopod on the map) There as 80 characters you can choose from, some with very useful special behaviors, and there is a ton of unique and common gear to outfit. I have not played very long into the game, as I put in short spurts and have other things to do, but I can see playing this for a while. Honestly, the missions can be pretty painc inducing, even with tactical paue and helicopter weapons, and when everything goes to hell it's quite something to watch. Hint, just go to main menu from a complete disaster and the mission won't save, but do try to revive team members, they actually get a perk in stats from being revived if I am not mistaken. Anyway, the devs care about them game and patches have been coming pretty regular, and they are reponsive on the forum, so give it a try if you like realtime pausable squad based tactical combat with a deep moral / personality system and helicopter support against an infectious 'Strain' enemy."
76561198050238053,Recommended,621810,34085942,Posted: 7 August,all,WH1T3F4N6,"For a non-RTS fan and an FPS fanatic, I find Strain Tactics a very fun and thrilling game.I enjoyed commandeering the units, they each have their own unique styles which resemble their gameplay and functions, and with the fact they can swap and drop their equipment which makes them feel like individual controlled players like those of a top-down shooter. And when units are in trouble, the docking dropship is able to fire their weapons upon heavy enemy strain which provides more for the autonomy of playing the game.The high-tech weaponry, state-of-art security and references to hazmat, biohazard and labatory ashtetics make Strain Tactics' Cyberpunk Post-Apocalyptic art style feel like at home - having units wearing all types of head and boy armor while covering themselves with gas masks and hazmat suits.Negatives, however were the morale system that was added to the game, it's slightly frustrating to see your units cower and run away in fear, panic, etc. Kinda' makes you feel embarassed or sad for them in some way.For an inde game, I give this game an 8.0/10."
,Recommended,621810,34909950,Posted: 12 September,all,TastyMints,"For a little indie game Strain makes big waves. The premise is something like PROTOTYPE's Blacklight virus rolled into a dystopian semi-cyberpunk setting, with you playing the part of the humans desperately trying to keep the biohazard Strain from consuming the region. If you fail you get nuked, along with everything and everyone else in the general area. UN2 takes containment very seriously, as should you.In order to complete your task you're given control of a small dual rotor helicopter equipped with various weapons you can use while above the area (limited by enclosed spaces and jammers) to support your small team of brave and quite suicidal panicky psychopaths in their mission to save themselves and the world. While I'm not too far in the game yet, the character types have ranged from scared scientists, who probably shouldn't be given a gun because they'll shoot their squadmates in the back, to combat androids and full on Night City Cyberpsycho SWAT types. Each has their own panic mechanism, like the aforementioned Combat Androids will terminate all infected individuals with extreme prejudice and Cyberpsychos have a tendency to go Rogue and start actively hunting down and exterminating everything they can find.As side notes, the music is quite good as well. Infection is a serious problem and you have to be very careful in how you deal with it. While the game does allow you to revive units that have been killed, they will be permanently lost if severely infected and allowed to die from that infection. This will then spawn more Strain creatures, which can lead to a cascade of morale failures and a total breakdown of squad cohesion. Overall, amazing game for its price. Don't pass it up."
,Recommended,621810,32263737,Posted: 8 June,all,KarateKite,"Exquisite top-down strategy. My favourite part of Strain Tactics is the late game, when you've got two squaddies hammering distant enemy hives with 20 mm wall-piercing rifles, two squaddies spraying the ground in front of them with SMGs to keep the enemies away, and a fifth squaddie with a flechette-loaded shotgun to pick off the ones that get too close. And they're doing that while they're edging forward in formation. And while they move forward, you're burning the ground behind them with HE shells from your flying gunship/command centre."

(Having to draw a circle around groups of chars to select them rather than just quickly drag a box, having to click side buttons to move inventory rather than just drag and drop, etc.)I spent more time fighting with the controls than I did having fun, so refunded after giving it a good hour of play.Should the controls ever get an overhaul to make them more kb + mouse friendly I'll gladly give it another go, but for now my vote is a regretful thumbs down."
,Recommended,621810,31605878,Posted: 7 May,all,Merv,"TO BE UPDATED - v.01TLDR - Strain Tactics is a diamond in the rough. Give it time, fool around in the game learn the ropes and it will slowly open the doors for fun, and sometimes outright silly situations.============Full review============Clunky UI is the biggest issue of this game.Initially, you will find yourself fighting the UI more than the enemy, but once you get used to it it does the job, albeit with a lot more micromanaging and menu diving.Initial impressions of this game was a top down tactical shooter, but upon exploring the game, it turned out to have a sandbox-ish approach to missions. Sure you can just arm everyone to the teeth and go in guns blazing, but with a bit of creative thinking and explosives, you can pull off some very silly wins.*hint* There's always more than one way to solve the hostage mission, and profit from it.Also, do try a full team of dudes with the xenophobic trait and equip them with shotguns. Just make sure no one gets infected. =)"

Calling in my gunship / base to evac my troops to regroup and then return to the task at hand is often harrowing, and im getting a handle of the mechanics enough now to focus on my next goal - finding the right types of soldiers for my squad.Current Pros:- Love the tongue in cheek mix of serious style and humor- Great visual style- Controls really well on mouse and keyboard- Great depth of gameplay and fun 'collection' mechanicCurrent Cons:- The first 10 minutes is pretty tutorial heavy, followed by little hand holding.

While the controls for this game are somewhat more optimized for the mobile version of the game, I do not feel as though this affects things too badly in the gameplay.If I had one complaint, it is that if a character has a full inventory, trying to move anywhere near an item on the ground becomes almost impossible, as the game wants your character to pick up the item, rather than just moving to that one spot.Next, is more just a personal preference: there should be more store type locations that offer a wider variety of weapons. Maybe even some more characters to add to your squad.And yes, I will be one of those people who would wish for the ability to customize the character's names. I believe the Devs have stated they do not want players to get confused and forget characters skillsets or whatever, but I feel as though that is more an excuse than anything. After all, I have a pretty good idea as to which character I assign to each of the five slots, myself, and I do not have to wonder about it at all. Then again, maybe that's just me."

And let's face it who doesn't love the end of the world infection scenario"

The original is below.I changed it because there is a setting to switch from the pen tool to an expandable box, there's a fix coming soon for the indirect fire, and the dev comes off as someone who is responsive and knows what he is doing.This isn't early access, but the dev is still improving the game regardless.*****************************************************************************************************Original review:This game is a lot like Doorkickers. At first I loved it.Then, when its controls started annoying the hell out of me, I was like, ""Why I am I playing this instead of the real Doorkickers?"". So now I'm back into Doorkickers, and here writing a negative review on Strain Tactics.The controls are really weird. I have to assume this is a half-♥♥♥♥♥ port of an iPad game. For example, you want to select several troops that are close to each other. Instead of just dragging and selecting a box, like every other game, you manually draw a circle with a pen tool around the soldiers.The worst offense is that it is easy to accidently set indirect fire when trying to move.Here's what makes that last thing really annoying:  When you land at your base and are just doing administrative stuff, there isn't a different 'base' screen. You have to land your helicopter and move your soldiers to different points to get things done. Your soldiers move around your own base in the same manner that they move around a combat zone. The controls are the same. So it's easy to mess up and have them start randomly blasting away with indirect fire instead of walking around.In 4 hours of play I've lost 2 soldiers to accidental discharges on the base, whereas I've only lost 1 in combat to the actual enemy.If they fix the controls I'll change the review. It's pretty good outside of that."

Strain tactics is for you.If you don't like reading every little text box before picking a mission you will fail alot and lose your good units."

I can't be bothered to properly format this review :)The tutorial is a bit lacking, and the question bot never has the answer you're looking for.I think some kind of tech tree feature would be nice as opposed to the current system of finding gear unlocks randomly.I don't know why you can't use pills and things on characters other than the one carrying them.You've already got a base that gets attacked if you don't kill enough during the mission, it would have been nice to have a tertiary base building and/or defense aspect added to that. Although, not everything needs to be xcom, the focus of this game is more on the tactical battles.I do like the control scheme and the stress mechanicsThe clone system works really well, the only thing i hate about it is that you have to remember where units that you want to buy are after you build up the RP. I feel like they should update the cryovat at the main base when you discover them.The music conveys the exact right mood, although it is just a bit repetative.The CAS helicopter is super fun and the ammo is expensive to keep you from nuking the site from orbit. it's the only way to be sure.Some other features could have been put in to make it perfect and worth more, but it does what it sets out to do efficiently. Below is my pipe dream list of features.randomized missions on larger maps to keep things more organic with a scripted missions to keep things from being bland.being able to put points into your clones skills upon level up instead of the passive skill gain system or being able to spend points to upgrade and modify clone genetics + unlockable/upgradeable stress and happy abilities as opposed to the static abilities that come with the clone.A bit of base building and research. upgrade your clone vat to unlock new clones and/or abilities. build base defenses and station troops to fend off strain attacks, research facilties to unlock new gear instead of searching the other hubs for stuff. upgradeable helibase, nuff said.As i said, my suggestions are just a bunch of stuff pulled out of my♥♥♥♥♥♥in my fantasy of the perfect vidyagame. Considering that this is primarily a mobile title none of these are feasible. As a mobile title it has everything it really needs (except for microtransactions lol.)Also, the sequel is almost certainly going to be a prequel on the spacehulk. I'm calling it now :D"

There is an incredible amount of detail and world-building crammed into the game, along with an unhealthy obsession for cans of tuna.The sandbox style of play and the frivolousness of your team allows for endless experimentation with builds and weapons. Dont forget to execute or arrange an 'accident' for your friendlies to free up a new character slot!10/10 would bodybag again."

Music on first selected mission was annoying after about 30 seconds of looping. Couldn't get into the game itelf because of frastrating controls. Just not fun to play, at least on a PC with a mouse."
,Recommended,621810,31543514,Posted: 4 May,all,This Cat Tho,"After a couple of months I decided to return to Strain Tactics to see how it has been improved. Controls, concerning Mouse + Keyboard, are vastly improved since release. The UI also is much better although it could use some improvements. For example it would be helpful for info to be displayed after hovering over a trait or item for a second or so instead of having to navigate to another section.Gameplay wise, it is fun on a tactical standpoint. Missions are selected and are repeatable. The issue here is some specific units are only purchaseable during a specific mission. So say you want a cyborg soldier. You have to revisit the mission but luckily it seems you won't be penalized for simply entering and leaving. However, this does hamper any sense of progression. That rogue cyborg you took down? If you reenter the mission, he's right back up. Not that the ability to replay missions is bad. It's just odd to have to return to a specific mission to buy a specific unit. It would be alot better to ""unlock"" the unit at the main base to be purchaseable.Speaking of bases, it seems that completing a mission doesn't stop a base invasion, rather it limits the amount of strain that attack. These base invasions are cool but can get annoying very quickly as no matter how you do on a mission, they will attack. It would go a long way if you could customize or at the very least arrange the defense of the base. Like being able to set persistant guard posts, turrets, etc.TLDR; Controls and UI are improved vastly for Keyboard and Mouse. However gameplay could use improvements concerning progression and base. It is playable but has questionable design choices. I reccommend only if you can look pass the above.***PREVIOUS REVIEW***Strain Tactics, on first impression, has alot of potential. It is immersive as far as those first few minutes are. However I decided I can not continue with it because of a fundamental issue of the controls. It seems it was designed for touch devices (aka Iphones and Ipads). It felt far too awkward to use a keyboard and mouse. You drag your soldiers to their positions and draw loops to select multiple soldiers (This is okay, same as Door Kickers). Items are automatically picked up where your mouse drags them to, making it VERY fiddly to pick up specific items. Also, there are a lot of buttons that take up a big portion of the screen at times as if it was meant to be easy for fingers to press. If they can change the controls to be more intuitive to keyboard and mouse, It might be something worth digging into. Until then I can not reccommend it.TLDR; Controls and feels like a ported over app game. Can not recommend until controls are better suited for mouse and keyboard.* Further Thought(s)- Settings are non exsistent except for Sounds, resolution, windowed mode, and unsurprisingly a touch screen mode.***PREVIOUS REVIEW***"
