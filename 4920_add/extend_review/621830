76561198278429557,Recommended,621830,34987376,Posted: 15 September,all,HyperionFIN,"Sim racer here.. love sims like AC, rF2, RaceRoom, Richard Burns Rally, Automobilista. Went into this game VERY skeptical, but end up positively surprised.WRC 7 is surprisingly sim-like, WAY more a simulation than any past WRC titles. Actually I rate this game higher as a SIMULATION than the disappointing Dirt 4. (Well, Dirt 4 Rallycross was okay, but their ""physics upgrades"" effectively sucked the fun out of rallying)This is close to Dirt Rally good.PROSSTAGESBest stages in any Rally game, period. Detailed, narrow, full of danger and surprises. Puts Dirt 4 to shame. Think these actually surpass even Dirt RallyPHYSICSActually, they are fairly realistic! More convincing than Dirt 4, who would have thought.Definitely more sim side of things, than past WRC games. Pleasantly surprised. Only thing bothering me is the braking, the cars just stop a bit too easily. If you lock up, in real car you would get into more trouble than here. However, tyre wear is simulated and if you abuse the tyres (two compounds selectable, Soft and Hard) early on, you'll regret later.People saying there isn't weight transfer are clueless.. There definitely is weight transfer, and you can use brakes to load the front and rotate car around corners. Sliding feels very natural, controlling drifts feels spot on. Steering with throttle is very much possible, unlike the terrible understeery mechanics of Dirt 4. Different surfaces truly affect the car, even overheating tyres will work like you'd assume. Tarmac, snow, wet, gravel, all feel differentCONTENT52 stages in 13 countries that all really look and feel different. Longest one is 23 km.Cars are the 2016 and 2017 WRC, WRC2 and WRC Junior cars. So no historic stuff, but to be expected. Career, Custom Championships and Online challenges should offer plenty to do.NEUTRALFORCE FEEDBACKNote that Physics and FFB are a separate thing. Physics in this game are good, car moves and behaves very much like real cars. You can see that from the visual feedback. Game can have great physics, and poor FFB. While they are connected they aren't the same thing. Good FFB doesn't exist without good physics, while good physics can very much exist without good FFB.FFB in WRC 7 is serviceable, while not mind blowing. Make sure you have Spring effects in your profiler at 100%, otherwise FFB will be dead. Damper I prefer at 0%.I'm assuming many people complaining about the FFB had their driver settings wrong, this game ABSOLUTELY needs Spring to feel right. Many sim racers have disabled or lowered it from their driver, which will feel horrible in WRC 7. It's programmed effect here (not constant Spring), and forms the core of the FFB.Also suggest turning the ""FFB Vibration"" effect down, I didn't like this effect at all. It vibrates on engine revs, but you won't feel this through steering column in a real car. Sadly they bundled also some minor road detail into this same slider. But most of road feel remains, even if you turn this to 0%.Don't expect Assetto Corsa or rFactor 2 here. FFB communicates what the car is doing, but not not much more than that.  Feels very similar to Dirt 4. But the better physics make it feel actually better than Dirt 4.My FFB settings:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1136158620SOUNDNo music to speak of. Cars sound okay, while not as good and detailed as Dirt Rally. Basic engine noises and backfires are fine, transmission whine, chassis flex and such things aren't there though. Sound is okay.DAMAGE MODELActually, it's pretty detailed. However, same as Dirt Rally, the cars are a bit too tough. You can keep going, when IRL you would be on a tow. Wish in ""Simulation"" difficulty, the cars would get totaled easier. You can do it, just takes a bit too much effort.CO-DRIVERA bit wooden, but gives 99% right calls. Also supports multiple languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese and Japanese).I didn't have a problem about it, while it's not great. Does it's job. You can set the calls later/earlier and adjust the detail level of them. I wish it didn't tell me to ""BRAKE!"" though because it tells me that, even if I've just messed up and barely moving.Edit: Actually you can delete the braking callouts, game works and they won't be played:C:/Program Files(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/WRC7/WIN32/Sounds/Voice/EN/PACENOTESMOTION & SIMVIBE SUPPORT?The game seems to have native D-Box support. There is D-Box .exe in the install folder, which has loads of settings. So it clearly outputs required telemetry.But at the moment SimVibe is not supported, if it ever will be is a mystery. For me SimVibe is pretty important for immersion. Hopefully they can add support, but don't think past WRC games have one.CONSNO TRUE TRIPLE SCREEN SUPPORT & NO VRTriples image is stretched, while otherwise works fine. So, just like in Dirt games. There is also weird zoom-in effect, based on speed. It's not as terrible as might sound because it's quite subtle. Just something I'd like to disable.Motion blur (not a fan) seems to be forced on at first. But actually, you can disable it by disabling Vignetting. Makes sense? No, but works.WRC 6 had experimental VR support they showed in conventions and such. Didn't make it to full release. And this one still doesn't have VR, sadly. A developer said on Steam forums, they don't have plans for adding it.LIMITED FOV / SEAT POSITION SETTINGSYou can't adjust the seat height. Which is too high for Triple Screen users. Also getting the camera close enough isn't possible either, even with ""Very close"" dashcam setting. I ended up using the bonnet cam. Which I wouldn't normally do, just works better here. Hope they could patch this issue.PERIPHERALS ISSUESGame's understanding of multiple input devices is bit of a mess.There is a function called ""Axis detection"" which is supposed to recognize unsupported & multiple peripherals. But currently it's not working. However, you can get separate pedals working by assigning them as buttons. For some weird reason, they will still work as Axis in the game. This is very confusing, and needs patching ASAP.Was able to get TH8A working as a handbrake by this method. Seen also footage of people driving with high end pedals and wheels, with separate USB connectors. However, I've heard some having trouble getting a G29 to work in the game. T500RS worked out of the box.Suggest testing with your peripherals. Steam refund works flawlessly, used it many times.USES DENUVOSo, there's that.The performance is fairly okay though. Able to run triple screens 60 fps with 980ti, by dropping from Very High to High and dropping Post Processing SSAO to medium.STUTTERING ISSUE FIXRun as Windowed, then press Alt+Enter to go into fullscreen. I do this once per play session, zero stutters. But if I don't yeah.. there is stutters. Obviously needs an official fix ASAP.Also, use in-game V-Sync. Yes V-Sync is not ideal as it creates some input lag, but it's only way to get smooth experience at the moment, at least for me. I use ""V-Sync (A mode)"".SUMMARYPleasant surprise, went in with zero expectations, finger already on the refund button. But what do you know, best rally game of 2017. If you enjoyed Dirt Rally, you might like this.Don't expect it have the best FFB in the world, but if you're thinking this is another arcade crap WRC release, you're seriously mistaken.Also, judging by WRC 6 update history, obvious issues will be patched:http://store.steampowered.com/news/?appids=4587708/10, recommended."
76561198178095631,Recommended,621830,35119211,Posted: 21 September,all,boggie1,"Like many other simracing fans I'm surprised at the mixed reviews.  This game is a huge step ahead of its predecessors.  Physics are intuitive, stages are absolutely amazing, and after some tweaking of the wheel I found it more immersive than any other rally game out there.  This truly wonderful game deserves VR and an analog hand break.  If we got these two things I wouldn't be able to stop playing.In terms of specific car physics, I can only compare it to the real life.  If you have only driven the Fiesta in this game as the Junior WRC entry, then you might be sceptical as to how you can trash it around so hard while the car maintains so much grip and feels sort of like a rear wheel drive car.  I own the same gen Fiesta, and with summer tires, rear sway bar, and front and rear strut bars, my car feels exactly like that.  And I can't imagine the upgrades the rally car goes through to make it what it is.  I also own a heavily modded WRX track car, and I have to say that the nimbleness and accuracy of my Fiesta with limited mods over my WRX with fully upgraded suspension and far better and wider tires still boggles my mind.I own a fanatac v2 wheel and my graphics card is a 1080, and with everything maxed out I had no issues that people are speaking of.  The stages truly are a work of art! Not only how they look, but even how many surfaces change over a stage, and for example, how a patch of ice can feel different from one area to the next.  I also love the attention to small details like tracking of each tire on the gravel and snow surfaces, how twigs break and shatter after you have hit them, the sparks from hitting a guardrail, and how the interaction with each of these objects effects the car in a way that I would expect it to in real life.  It's too bad the replays right now can't show off these amazing stages in the right way.Even still, I believe this is the best rally game out there today.  I say game, because it's not quite a simulation, but pretty darn close to it.  It crushes Dirt 4 in every aspect except graphics clarity, which can be a bit of a turnoff, I have to admit.  That motion blur really has to go you guys!  I can't stress enough how important it is for the graphics to be crystal clear in a driving game.  The game has plenty of sense of speed, and does not need anything to enhance it.  It's better than Dirt Rally for sure, unless you play with the RFPE mod.  RBR is only better in terms of the damage and setup.  The physics in RBR are really not relevant anymore, no matter what people say, and I do still love the game.  Assetto is still king in terms of physics for tarmac rallies (especially if you have a motion rig), and stage mods by Simtraxx and others are amazing!  This reminds me, Sim Commander software absolutely needs to support this latest WRC title now.WRC 7 really captures the essence of current rallying, which the developer did a masterful job of.  The speed of the cars also feels right.  The time and control it takes to execute a hairpin feel perfect to me, but you have to really get the game and wheel settings right.  With that in mind, it's not about how fast you are going through a stage, but just the enjoyment of driving and getting the technique right, which naturally results in fast stage times anyways.Keep in mind, my review is solely based on playing the game in simulation mode.  So, for those casual arcade racers, sorry you had to waste 30 seconds of your life readying above writing.  I have no idea if you would like this game.And lastly, although I fully understand the financial reasons of creating the game that reaches a broad audience, it's too bad this can't be an out and out simulation game, because it's clear that the team really has the talent and the ability to make that happen. I was really disappointed in the last WRC title, but now I'm back being a fan again in a big way.  Keep up the good work, and please don't forget about us drivers out there ;)"
,Recommended,621830,35338159,Posted: 30 September,all,Murderface,"TL;DR - A ""should probably buy"" for DiRT Rally fans disappointed by DiRT 4.The question ""Is WRC 7 more realistic than DiRT Rally?"" does not have a simple yes-or-no answer.The question ""Is WRC 7 a better game than DiRT 4?"" does. The answer is yes.It's brilliant. It is not, however, Richard Burns Rally 2, nor is it DiRT Rally 2. If you're looking for a ""more realistic"" experience after putting 1,000 or so hours into DiRT Rally, this might not be the solution. The realism or believability of the handling varies from surface to surface.In Rally d'Italia Sardegna, it feels almost like you're playing RBR. The car is ludicrously skatey and floaty, but in a fun, satisfying way that is easily controlled using your throttle and brake. Moments like this are where the game really shines, handling-wise. It's responsive and lively like DiRT Rally, but slippy and elegant like RBR.In Rally Finland, the car feels like the tires were manufactured by Gorilla Glue. I don't just mean that you have a lot of grip (you do). I mean the cars tires, through my G27, literally felt sticky. It's a strange and not-so-true-to-life experience. Sometimes you'll find yourself going flat-out around bends that would have killed you in DiRT Rally or RBR (or real life), planted firmly to the ground without a bit of lateral motion. Other times, you'll suddenly frisbee off the side of the stage and cut down more trees than the Finnish Forestry Commission. It can be inconsistent.Besides the variable handling in terms of expected grip, as a player, the handling was almost immediately intuitive and comfortable after bingeing on DiRT Rally while the game downloaded. DiRT 4 felt confusing and alien - it took me several hours to even gain the ability to hold a line or a drift angle, and even then never for long, or to my satisfaction. The cars in D4 practically begged to understeer into an outside spin at some times, and refused to move the rear out a single degree at others. In WRC 7, the cars love kicking their tails out. All it takes is a solid flick (or tap of the handbrake) and a feathering of the throttle, and the cars take an angle and - more importantly - HOLD that angle so long as you keep it steady. They'll turn in or out at your behest, or hold fast and drift like crazy if you tell them to.That's the main thing for me. Even if the game is - on average - less realistic than DR, which was never an incredibly realistic game to begin with, the cars are intuitive and they behave. The rear does what you want, and you rarely feel confused or frustrated by the car making its own decisions in terms of angle or balance.PROS:+Stage design/stages from actual WRC events+Career mode+Sometimes handling+Multi-surface stages+Fun and intuitive, to contrast with D4's incomprehensible feelMEHS:~Performance~Lack of FOV options~Wheel compatibility issues (my G27 worked fine but there are tons of reports of issues here)~Sometimes handling~Graphics (vary from solid to ridiculously dated on a moment-to-moment basis)CONS:-Overall, less ""realistic"" than RBR or DiRT Rally in most handling cases-Co-driver is robotic and kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥ but I didn't mind so much in terms of playability-Sometimes handling-Lack of car variety-Controls are wonky without tweaking, no clutch(?) and handbrake does unexpected things to the car"
,Not Recommended,621830,34973175,Posted: 15 September,all,Aurora,The tracks are fantasic. They're narrow - They're unpredicable. Exactly what rally games need.Unfortunately the handling is rather lacking. The cars feel heavy (good) but without the feeling of any weight transfer it's a waste of time. It also seems to lack any inertia. The suspensions feel welded solid. Jumps feel like something beyond gravity is artificially yanking you back to the ground as soon as possible.I went into this really excited and wanting to like it - I can put the poor sound and graphics aside for a good game but this really disappointed.
76561197989826349,Recommended,621830,35047824,Posted: 18 September,all,TriS,"First of all, this is a very good game and should be considered for trying by every rally fan, especially those who like Dirt Rally and RBR.Pros- Stages. As for 2017 these are easily the best rally stages compared to any rally game of any time. They're both beautiful and challenging, short and long (including so called epic stages that are 15-23 km long), what else could you dream about?- Physics. Driving cars in this game is pure fun. If I'm to compare WRC 7 to Dirt Rally and RBR, I'd say that handling in WRC 7 is closer to RBR's which is personally to me is a good thing.- Graphics. Not the most beautiful racing game out there, but it gets the job done.- Modern WRC cars (obviously).Cons- Co-driver sounds unnatural, robotic and annoying. Many improvements can be done in this department.- UI in this game looks like something from games of early 2000's.- Lack of overall polishing and lack of minor quality of life features like UDP output, saving/loading tuning presets and adjusting FOV."

,Recommended,621830,35058472,Posted: 18 September,all,jhiggins822,"At first, I was susceptible at even considering getting this game. After not so good WRC 4, 5 and 6 still not hitting a high note in the era of Rally PC/Console gaming. Plus I thought, I already have 'Dirt Rally', Dirt 2 (my all-time-favorite), Dirt 3 and my recent semi-disappointing 'Dirt 4' purchase. Why in God’s green earth would I need another Rally game? I pondered for a few days and looked at some YouTube videos test driving and giving the pros and cons of the new release WRC 7. The clarity of play and the real-feel of the car riding on various tracks. I talked myself into giving WRC 7 a try. I'd bought most of the earlier versions why not give the newest game a chance. All I must say is WOW! The best WRC FIA Rally game ever released. I'm really impressed with the clear graphics (Car and Road), you can feel the road underneath your tires, every rut, gravel, wet, Icey/snowy road. Really nice custom races you can set up in 'Solo' or 'Quick Game' mode. Great 3-D menu system. I haven't played more than 3 hours or so and can't wait to start career mode. It reminded me of Colin McCray Rally games of old. Drop anything you're doing and buy this game pronto. I believe that you'll be surprised! We have a winner here! Happy racing!  JohnnyPcgamer."

The Sountrack and Sound is not so good but on the Gampeplay side its better. The Physics may be a little bit weakter, but HEY it makes fun! Thats more what Dirt 4 got. The Cars are easier to control than Dirt Rally but the Track is really really hard. The Game has for me only one downside....Which Project Manager Allowed the game to release in this Performance disaster!? I Drove some tracks without stutter and its great. (Tweaked in the Amd Driver). But in the next Stages the Stutter started again. Are you Serius? You could overpass Dirt 4 easily but insteat the game was Released not polished. I dont understand this."

Honestly it's so good if codemasters plugged the same tracks into dirt 4's car physics engine that would have made d4 a great title.If they can it would be nice to see some patches and updates that address as many issues people list here but overall this is a huge leap for rally fans

Co-driver could be less robotic. And the engine is sometimes hard to hear over all the musquitos buzzing around in your helmet.- The drive though,.....

76561198014649631,Recommended,621830,35305993,Posted: 29 September,all,vangomaextreme,"Giving a big thumbs up on this one. Only in my JWRC career so far but what an improvement over the previous two releases by this developer. Their first attempt WRC 5 was truly godawful, the second WRC 6 was a dramatic improvement but still lots of gamebreaking moments like driving at night and in bad weather the graphics didn't stand up. I am delighted to say that third time is the charm. There are still minor flaws but this is a GREAT game at a GREAT price. Having said that is it Dirt Rally no, and it doesn't try to be. However, what it is is a very rewarding romp through the WRC calendar and season. If that is what you are looking for then do not hesitate to buy it. If you want a sim experience that will test your wheels and all the gadgetry you have for this sort of game then yes you will probably be disappointed. However, if like me and I am sure many others, who often only have 30 mins in between work and family to just pick up a controller and go, then this is SERIOUS bang for your buck. It even plays smooth as butter on my laptop with a GTX 960m, even though I know some higher end rigs had stuttering issues, but I had none and it does seem the developers are working hard to iron out the very few bugs that are there. Give them credit, they are a small studio trying hard and doing a remarkably good job. If WRC 7 is this good I can only imagine what WRC 8 will be like. 10/10 and a MUST buy for any casual rally gaming fan!!!"

,Recommended,621830,35101711,Posted: 21 September,all,solstice,After putting just under 10 hours at this point I have to say I am very impressed although it is no Richards burns rally it has good physics I don't know why people are saying they are amazing I just don't see that to much grip in my opinion but the thing that makes this game so fun and addictive is the stages. The stages blow me away although they aren't acute to real life the are amazing the flow of them is great darting between each corner it is very satisfying. The current game needs a bit of work with the wheel setup but I found no problem with setting up my T500 RS it just worked for me maybe I was lucky in construction it is a great rally game with good physics and great stages I would recommend to any fan of rally but it still doesn't come close to Richards burns rally

,Recommended,621830,35249097,Posted: 27 September,all,Arete,"WRC 7 makes good on the promises of WRC 6. I bought WRC 6 thinking it might be a nice game to play around with when not playing Dirt Rally. But the handling was too erratic (albeit with promise), the stages were wide and too arcadey, and the FFB was really bad.Happy to say that WRC 7 improves on WRC 6 in every regard.Car handling is up there on par with Dirt Rally. The feeling of the tyres digging into the gravel is not quite up to DRs levels, but the distinct grip level changes between different gravel types is real nice. Tarmac handling feels quite nice and believable. The cars feel like they have mass, and weight transfer is modeled nicely. Overall the handling has been a big surprise, and overall I find it more believable than DRs.The stages are quite nice overall, much tighter and more technical than WRC 6. There aren't a lot of stages for each location, so I suspect they'll be feeling stale after a while (like in DR), but they're varied and distinct and many of them are absolutely fantastic. While I personally give DR a slight edge with their real to life stages, there are some stages in WRC 7 that I feel are better than DRs. And the epic stages are awesome, so much fun to finally drive long stages.FFB is much better than WRC 6, but still nothing to write home about. I'd call it adequate on my T300RS. Not much to adjust, and it feels a bit like canned effects. Still, when you get the levels right (I found about 50% strength felt right) it works quite OK and communicates what the car does in a decent way. So fully functional, but can get better.Codriver calls are overall OK. I find that I can trust them overall, and I seldom get caught out on bad notes. There are times when the note pace gets a bit off, but generally OK. Codriver voice is a bit sterile and machine-like, hopefully something they can improve for the next game.Graphics are OK, neither good nor bad. Car models and stages look OK in general but ""wow"" moments are rare (there are some, like Mexico).Sounds are OK. Gravel kickup and tyre squeals are good, as are brake sounds. Engine sounds range from slightly bad too OK. Some sounds feel quite off, like the loud bang when the suspension punches through that just sounds completely wrong. Crash sounds are also very muted and undramatic.Stability wise I had some troubles for the first week, where I was one of many that got the heavy stutters even though I have real good hardware. Big Ben handled the problem well though, got a thread up about the problem and got some testers fast. New patch came out which fixed the problems for the vast majority and it seems to be trouble free now.Overall I'd highly recommend this title for any rally fan. Surprise hit game of the year so far for me."

Being disappointed with the boring tracks of Dirt 4, I decided to give WRC 7 a try. And to my surprise it's actually a great game! There's enough to complain about, like the poor pace notes, the mediocre engine sounds, no classic cars and the framerate drops that occure at certain stages. But the track design is top notch and so much fun (and challenging) to drive! With the WRC license all 13 rallies are represented, some tracks even beating those of Dirt Rally: Germany includes the famous vineyards and Sweden is the high speed rally it really is. And I can finally drive my personal favorite, Argentina. Don't expect the same car handling as in Dirt Rally, nor the same ammount of detail. But overall I recommend this game to any rally fan.

After dirt rally it was difficult to find a good rally game, especially Sebastien Loeb Rally was dissapointing, but WRC 7 i a great game.People often moan about sound - apart from co-driver (a bit dull and robotic) all other sounds are great! Especially i love the noise when you cut the corner - dirt spray on underbody and loud bang from suspension - who tried to cut corners in real life will know it is super real!  Also you can hear brake discs and antilag (very characteristic especially on Fiesta R5). Physics of the suspension is also great - any venture too deep of the main road will result in loud bang and harsh bounce... like in real life - now - people who like to beat the ""world record"" and drive through corners on a stright line (plenty of thic crap on YT) won't be happy, as they will bounce around, but people who are after realistic car behaviour will love it!Being able to turn wipers and lights during the stage is also great! Tyre wear is brilliant.Only two things i would like improved:1. Co-driver - i want someone like Nicky Grist, or that Woman co-driver from Dirt4 with sexy american accent :-)2. handbrake - too sensitive."
76561197999932221,Not Recommended,621830,35134953,Posted: 22 September,all,Acorn King,"In a word, disappointing.After reading many reviews beforehand, the game seemed to have very mixed responses. The reason I decided to try the game anyway was because many of the complaints centered around things like no support for VR, triple screens, and multiple USB devices. None of those applied to me, so I didn't care.Upon starting the game for the first time, I was immediately thrust into a 'test drive' without being given even a second to set up the game, my wheel, or any other settings. A bit of a jarring introduction I must say.However, there I hit my first obstacle. I could get the game to recognise my wheel (G29) and set up all the axis and buttons just fine. But the vibration control felt like it was trying to shake my wheel to pieces. Even turning that down to zero, my wheel was still making a lot of noise. It reminded me of the bug that happened in DiRT Rally when doing RX where any feedback to the wheel made it go crazy. I tried turning down the basic FFB control, which helped eliminate the excessive vibrations, but then I lost any real feeling for what the car was doing.Second obstacle was setting up the steering. The only control for that was 'Steering Sensitivity'. By default I think it was on 50, which meant I barely had to breathe on my wheel and the car would go full lock. Turning it down to 10 made it feel like I had about 10' of turning ability. Settling on 35 felt okay, but that's as good as it got. But that wasn't the end of that problem. On dirt/gravel the steering felt fine. Responded the way I liked it. But soon as I hit tarmac, it felt like I was back to sensitivity of 10 again. Suddenly no steering response at all.For a game on the PC, or even just a driving game in this modern day, I would expect having an exceptional control system in place would be of absolute importance. Not so in this game I'm afraid. It may feel better on a pad, but I'm not interested in that.My only other major complaint is the co-driver. In DiRT Rally it felt like all the callsigns for each stage were recorded for that stage specifically. It made everything feel much more fluid and natural. In DiRT 4 they opted for the more robotic co-driver due to the fact the stages in that game are random gen. In this game, they're using fixed stages. Real stages. Yet they opted for the robot co-driver. It's off-putting for me and gives a very unnatural feel to the game. Plus the constant yelling of ""BRAKE!!"" is totally unncessary. Many details seem to have been omitted from the co-drivers vocabulary as well. No warnings about ditches or hazards on inside or outside of corners, just another scream of ""DANGER!!"" with no more detail. Corner numbers feel off as well. If you've played DiRT Rally, an 'acute left/right' in that game is a 'left/right 1' in this game. It all seems a bit off.All in all it feels like a game that needed another few months in beta, and a LOT more care and attention paid to the finer points."

I knew it would be a good looking game. Well better than it has been anyway. The physics are just wonky. At low speeds you will slide right through your corner but going to too fast into a corner will only put you the same distance off. The handbrake is way OP. Even when you set it all the way down , it still locks you up with the slightest touch. The game doesn't reward good driving, only flatout, bounce off the rocks and trees driving. It's really just an arcade game and not a simulation like I was hoping for. If you enjoy the physics off the Dirt series then you will not enjoy this game."

If the game had propper FFB settings, I'm imagining it would feel like magic.Content wise...its the FIA World Rally Championship. Locations, cars, drivers, everything is here. Nothing special, but nothing negative about it either.Graphics are last gen, and that can't be argued. So what makes this a negative even more is that there are glaring performance issues from dropped framerates, stuttering, and INSANE amounts of screen tear (My rig sports a 7700k and a GTX 1070, so having said issues on this hardware is a HUGE problem). If these issues didn't exist, then one could look past the lack luster graphics, but this is more of an issue because of the performance.Audio? Meh. The co-driver seems to be asleep at times (even when setting him to call corners and hazards to the ""far ahead"" option). Cars somewhat sound muted, but the outer environment sounds nice.At best, this game is meh to boarderline unplayable. If performance and control issues are resolved in future patches, then this game should definetly be in any sim racer's library. Beyond that? Skip it until then."

I'm getting a refund just for that because it's unplayable for me.There's no excuse really, I can run Assetto Corsa and Project Cars at moderately high settings with at least 60fps. Can't even get WRC 7 to run smoothly at the lowest settings. There's always going to be stuttering. Should probably mention that the FFB and Graphical settings aren#t great either!For some reason you can't put the FFB force no lowr than 50%, when generally I run lower than that. Also, there's a serious lack of settings to adjust, just dead zone and sensitivity.Thirdly, the FFB itself isn't very good anyway, it's very vague in places and the stuttering doesn't help that either.Don't buy this in it's current state, it's crap. This could have the potential to be a very good game, but whoever thought the optimisation was passable needs sacking."

The rim is not listed on the supported device list, but the Porsche rim is. Is this the problem?

I mean, I can make my fightstick think it's a keyboard with a free program, yet a racing title cannot handle assigning an axis to an analogue device without a degree in engineering from the user? Many users point out the fact that hardware that didn't even exist in the heyday of RBR works, out of the box, flawlessly. Hell, Simvibe and my motion platform work as well. Not as refined as current sims, but at least I don't have to tear down my setup to try and access my wheel for fear of having a forgottten USB plug connected somewhere.

,Recommended,621830,35116331,Posted: 21 September,all,twisted,"---First impressions---I had no expectations firing up this game and I must admit I was very skeptical first and not sure buying it after reading all the mixed reviews but what a ride! Seriously, I'm happy I did these devs a chance! This game came out of nowhere and it look amazing and plays very well.The reason why I thought it would be a nice idea to put this review together is to try to describe how exactly the handling feels as I've scrolled the whole steam page reviews without knowing exactly what I was buying and wanted to help others like me. Also, if it can be of any help, I really hated WRC 5 and 6 handling and I'm more a fan of sims like Richard Burns and DiRT Rally.---Handling model---The physics of this game to me feels close to Sebastian Loeb Rally Evo. The best I could describe it is a kind of blend between WRC 3 and SLRE physic-wise, but with better axle pivots and a more dynamic suspension geometry modelling. Don't get me wrong, WRC 7 is still a simcade game.It's very fun to drift around corners (much better than DiRT4) and seeing your suspension working over bumps is a real joy to experience. Inside the cockpit, models are a bit rough around the edges... you see just a bit of the steering wheel, you can't adjust seat and FOV and I must say with a pad, the handling doesn't feel as dynamic as the exterior view or bumper cam. But with a wheel, it feels much better, I would not say as great as DiRT Rally, but it's actually surprising.I plugged my T300RS + T3PA Pro pedal set and the game instantly recognized them with the buttons mapped accordingly. The FFB effect is not very good and the slider in option menu is odd as it doesn't let you select each angle... I wanted to put it to 540 degree but it just let me choose between 508 and 560 although you can go straight up to 1080 degrees?!? Also, the virtual steering wheel look out of sync and I do get some minor input lag.The handbrake could make you slide more as right now it make you stop to a dead end. The cars behavior doesn't feel as predictable  as DiRT Rally, the cars feels more floaty and less responsive making them harder to drive than DR but they're intuitive and you will experience countersteer, oversteer and lost of control without ABS. The only negatives worth mentioning here I think is the landings after a jump and interaction of your car with the roadsides... it feels a bit clunky at times and you have that weird looking cloud of particles effect going in the air.--- Graphics and stages ---About the graphics and stages, the shaders to me looks better than DiRT4 (specially lens flare and reflections), the vegetation is luxurian and very dense but above all, the road are a real blast to drive... they're narrow, bumpy, packed with elevation and camber changes. I'm happy to finally be able to drive between vineyards on these narrow Germany roads, something DiRT Rally is lacking. You can feel the immersion as you're going deeper in these wonderful forests. The stages have been crafted to perfection and are amongst the best I've seen, if not the best ever in any rally games. You can go from a mountain top to a valley and back into forest, etc. the landscapes are so much different, we can easily see these guys were very inspired when they've designed them. The landscapes are never the same and the saturation of colors in Australia and Wales are top notch. The textures looks very natural and realistics, and each country look different and are packed with lot of trackside objects. So far, having always been impressed by the DiRT serie stages, I think these guys could show some tricks to help Codemasters refine the variety of their environments but one point goes to DiRT Rally for having more detailed road surfaces. Speaking about the graphics,I think the car models could benefit from more polish (especially rims) and the watersplashes effect could be reworked. This game is one of the few featuring the great Kopecky's Skoda Fabia R5.---Performance---Lot of reviewers complain they have microstutters, and some of them have killer rigs. It's not the case for me. For reference, I have a first generation i7 920 with a GTX 1060 6GB and 12 GB DDR3 and the game run perfectly fine at a constant 60 fps locked, even using local splitscreen which is a nice addition btw. Hopefully a patch will come soon to fix these microstutters but on my setup, game runs like a charm.---Conclusion---As it is currently, it's still too early to talk about the career mode as I just finished the first country, but so far, I've been very impressed. I recommend this game to any rally enthusiast out there looking for a different racing experience."

I dont know about other control devices.There are some problems with frame rates Though. I wouldnt have much confidence running this game on a lower end machine.Im using a G-force 1080i card with a top end 7th generation processor and even with that hardware frame rates do drop.but having said that it seems to be more at the start of the rally stages for a second or two and just as your coming to the end again for a second or two where the frame rates suffer the most.And In comparison with WRC6 i have noticed that the frame rates are better on the whole.which makes the game extreamly playable.the game feels a little less like an arcade racer than WRC6.But less of a simulation than dirt 4 !my conclution is that if you have a fast computer and you enjoy the thrill of shooting at high speed down country lanes with brilliant scenery and a good impression of speed then this game is definately worth buying.but if you are a simulator person and want very very realistic car handeling, with no frame rate problems dirt 4 still comes out tops."

Fafe deki jump, Ouninpojiha'daki sıralı jumplar dirt rally nin jump larına göre bence daha iyi.Tarmac fizikleri de Dirt Rally e göre daha iyi gibi, ancak Fiesta R2 de el freninin, zaman zaman ayak freninden daha durdurucu bir etkisi olabiliyor.Etap gerçekçiliğine örnek açısında özellikle Polonya SS sürerken, aynı etabı daha önce videoolarını izlediğim anlarda ""bu ne ya"" dedirten traktörlerin durduğu yerler gözümün önüne geldi.https://images.cdn.circlesix.co/image/2/1200/700/5/uploads/posts/2016/08/95c6ffb65a8b67a3ce25f2314f60a767.jpgBereket oyunda aynı yerde saman balyaları vardı :)Benim sistem biraz eski oluğu için grafikler full oynayamıyorum, ancak internette mevcut pek çok videoda grafik kalitesi oldukça iyi görünüyor.Düşük sistemler için performans optimizasyonu konusunda birşeyler yapılmalı.Postprocessing kapalı olmasına rağmen sürekli bir frame atlama hissi oluyor.Bu tür oyunların hele de sim olmak istiyorsa, olmazsa olmazı FFB şu an için büyük sıkıntı (DR, D4 daha iyi).Umarım bir an önce update ile düzeltirler.FFB leri kapatıp oynayınca daha iyi bile oluyor :) denebilir.Dolayısı ile controller severler için biçilmiş kaftan bir oyun olabilir.Update gelirse yine paylaşırım ama şu an için hissiyatım, eski serilere göre oldukça gelişmiş görünüyor olmasına rağmen, gerçek bir sim (hatta simcade) olmak için çok yolu olduğu ve career moddan sonra kenarda tozlanacak gibi göründüğü yönünde.:/"

The stages are really epic and the handeling feels just right for me (simulation setting). I can use multiple USB devices (G27 wheel with Fanatec SQ Shifter). Very sattisfied so far and I think its much better than Dirt 4.

I'm having a great time with this game. That being said, I do have some criticisms:1: Performance is really inconsistent. the game looks amazing but certain stages in Germany, Spain and Italy (I think) really hit the framerate on anything above medium settings, while other areas such as Poland are completely fine with everything maxed out.2: There are enough stages overall, but the individual rallies feel a bit short. An option to run every stage reversed or even mirrored would greatly enhance the feeling of doing a full rally, rather than simply a few events. These are some of the best stages ever in a rally game and I would love to enjoy them as much as possible.3: Replays are a huge issue. Firstly, the quality of the replays is poor, with bad camera angles except for the helicopter one and not enough roadside pans. Also, it resets your in game viewpoint for the next stage if you watch a replay which is really annoying.4: GIVE US AN OPTION TO REMOVE/REDUCE HEAD/COCKPIT SHAKE! It is really annoying and kinda makes me feel sick.In all however, Kylotonn has done an amazing job of WRC 7 and this has turned out to be the most surprising gamen of the year for me. The old days of having New Zealand stages in a WRC game are long gone, but now I can race Hayden Paddon's Hyundai through amazing stages in a licenced rally game that is actually good!"

The graphics are very good and the other effects are suburb. I was unsure what to expect as I last tried WRC 5 (demo) and hated it,  because of that skipped WRC 6 as well. I play Dirt Rally, Dirt 4 and Sebastian Loeb Rally and this is so far one of my favorites (right behind DR). The tracks on this game are the best of the bunch, they are a ton of fun (Overall I am liking the tracks on WRC 7 more than any of the others from the other 3 games.)This game is not perfect, I do notice some tracks are more demanding on the GPU so here and there I can see slight frame rate drops but nothing making me not want to play. I am also running an entry level GPU (Nvidia 1050ti) so not expecting the best results but compared to the other games I can't say its much worse than them. The sounds in the game are not close to the level of DR but they not the worst I have heard, they ok overall. Once your get sucked into the game, you don't notice the lack of sound that you hear in DR.If I had to complain, the only thing I feel needs work is the steering input. The steering itself is great for me, I have no issues controlling my car and I rate this as good as DR but I have almost no feeling of what the car is doing in terms of grip which is my only complaint.Overall I think this is a very nice game and I am not disappointed in my purchase. It may not be every ones cup of tea but if you play games for fun, this is fun."

,Recommended,621830,34982420,Posted: 15 September,all,BLUE-COLLAR (HEBBI),"Review after 1.5 hours. I was looking for a rally game. After comparing the different games in the genre I decided on this one. The graphics are pretty good and it runs well on my 970. I think I noticed some tiny stutter 2-3 times that could be fixed by a patch or some tweaks. The gameplay feels good and it's really simple to get into. The racing is hard but I could feel my self getting more and more confident after a couple of races.I'm sure simracers will hate the game for being to fun or something. But as someone who likes racing games, I think this is pretty fun."

I use the wheel and pedals to define sensitivity by myself!I don't want to play with numbers, I want to set the rotation angle and forget about it.So the steering / brakign feels very weird and hard to get used to.What's worse than steering is the handbrake (mine is DIY made of USB keyboard) - when you hit it, visually it looks like the hardest braking ever as you touch the windscreen with your nose :D absurd..... Physically - as if you lock all your four wheels - you just slide forward... In corners, if you keep it activated for long enough, after a second you will finally get some effect.... that's nonsense.I'm not talking about graphics issues - it's all over the board...Refund requested."

,Not Recommended,621830,35064010,Posted: 19 September,all,ganzosrevenge,"I bought this game with the day-one DLC and from the get-go it was an absolute nightmare.  My specs for my computer are:Intel Core i7-7700HQ/ 32GB DDR4-2667 RAM / GTX 1060 / OLED Screen (Yes, it's an Alienware)That should be plenty to drive this game considering that its ""recommended"" setup is only a GTX 780 with a skylake CPU.  BOY was I wrong.  First, the game was slow.  This was attributed to the fact that the nVidia drivers did not recognize that WRC 7 is in fact, a GAME, and not something like an office document or YouTube video that can work with integrated graphics.  Second, it started up every time in non-fullscreen AND windowed modes.  I had to go into settings multiple times to change this before the settings finally stuck.  Lastly, the input lag was monumental.  I get that there will always be some lag because of latency from input controller to machine, but when some inputs lag upwards of half a second before the input is seen by the user, it's not a ""game ready for release""; it's a game that was released because WRC's design studio realized that Dirt 4 came out.  Put simply, this game was caught sleeping.Moreover, stuttering was terrible.  Not ""this is too slow to run this game"" stuttering (which I would accept if I had an ultrabook with only Intel UHD or HD graphics), but rather ""this game's programming code was not tested thoroughly.  What the game has in difficulty, it lacks in fps consistency and it lacks in smoothness.  Cockpits look generic, with no real attention paid to things such as how the speedo / tach / other dials look, and while I like the copilot's dry readout of directions (adds to accuracy), I do wish that there was sarcasm when the player messes up (ie: I never knew a right 6 was a right 9... you sure you finished grammar school?).The idea is there, but sadly much like WRC 6, DiRT is far superior, even though DiRT gives up realism and actual tracks in favor of a far more polished experience.  Wound up getting a refund."

The game currently has a frame stuttering issue but they are currently working on a fix. The physics are close to DiRT Rally, perhaps even better depending on your style of racing, and it's all of the real WRC cars, teams, and stages. It's incredibly accurate, and if you're a true fan of rally, you'll want WRC 7. It is NOTHING like WRC 6, this is a massive improvement! I'm a hardcore sim racer, and DiRT 4 is nothing compared to WRC 7, DiRT Rally is still pretty good but doesn't have as much content as WRC 7, which is why I think this game beats em all. Force feedback is a little lacking but with some wheel adjustments you're able to make it worth your while. Cheers, and thank you for the amazing physics. I will not be returning this game, I was going to, but luckily didn't have to. This is my first WRC game since WRC 4 and this is by far the best WRC game of the series, WRC 6 was a joke and you can just tell by the online videos. THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT! Cheers!Update: The new patch works beautifully, no more frame rate issues, runs incredibly smooth. No performance issues, all fixed. Thanks again!"
