,Recommended,622040,33057841,Posted: 30 June,all,Tyclone,I recommend this game with a few stipulations. If you want this game for some good humor than it is perfect for that! The game is very funny to say the least but thats all the good I can really say for it. The gameplay is wonky and hard to play most of the time and maybe this will change but for me i had to hang around and wait for a decent chunk of time before i had any other players to get a session going. That being said im not gonna go to hard on this game becuase it did give me some good laughs! Final opinion is Buy for humor = Good. Buy for gameplay = Bad.Check out my video to see some gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkK-HZWmLLQ

,Recommended,622040,33703363,Posted: 21 July,all,DjDoggo,"This game can be really good, at this stage it needs tweaking though. (Obviously)One thing i would like for the devs to change is how as an animal, if you die you can just play as one of the other animals, i dont like this because you cant play alone with a friend. If the animal dies, he/she can just switch to another animal, and it'll be game over for the human. 1v1's is not possible in this, basically humans have to be atleast 3 people until its fair.One thing i would not want for this game is for it to be like Who's Your Daddy, and by that i mean where they ''overupdate'' it to where its impossible for the dad to win, because you have a pet running around pooping, and a pool outside, and batteries in a shelf, and soap in a bathroom etc... Because it would be a shame if they ruined the game like that, it has alot of potential.But from what it seems like, i think they may just stop updating it and just leave it. If this you're reading this a month or more after this review and there hasnt been an update, dont buy the game, its probably left to rotten.If it has been updated though then buy it for sure.Though i would recommend buying another copy or a friend or making him buy the game himself, as it is more fun with friends.Pro's- Every animal has a unique ability, which makes it very fun- Theres lots of fun items to use as the human- The Kangaroo has an amazing sound effect.- The ragdoll physics are very nice, though there are many glitches at its current state of developmentCon's- Ragdoll physics as i said, are fun but glitchy.- The game doesnt explain much, or at least i didnt really understand anything at first. Like how to open the gate with the key, i know theres a button that needs the key, but i dont know how to use the key on it, which it doesnt explain either.- If an animal dies, and there are animals which have not been picked by other players, the animal which died can take over that animal and live on, which is the worst thing about the game in my opinion.- The bald eagle, is very OP at its current state.(Sorry for bad grammar throughout the whole review.)Anyways, there isnt much more to be said, its overall a good game, but if you're planning on getting it, make a friend get it too."

76561198019276961,Recommended,622040,33600194,Posted: 16 July,all,DaRkFURY_Reaper,"Hilarious game, most definitely more than worth the $5 it costs. It's early access so there is not much to it as of yet, but if you have a few friends that all get it together it turns into a amazingly amusing time. Goofy controls and physics do nothing but make the game funnier and more enjoyable to play. I hope to see more content in the way of animals and levels come out soon."

76561198210765383,Recommended,622040,33245959,Posted: 4 July,all,Jt audio@Youtube.com,"Great game a couple of suggestions though, you should make the player models less glitchy making the game more stable and more playable. Secondly you should make items easier to pickup or create a type of inventory system or atleast a hotkey system. Thirdly possibly make a all out war gamemode for humans or make less animals in the current map its a bit one sided. Finally good luck with your game have a nice day!"

,Not Recommended,622040,33108736,Posted: 1 July,all,Benweed Griffin,This game is absolutely terrible. I Dislike this game because payed 5 dollars just to glitch out and just die within 10 seconds of the round when i am a human. The humans in this game are way to easy to kill and the animals in this game are just way to glitchy. Please fix this game and i will then consider recommending it to others.

I played at least 15 and it just didn't show that for some reason.Okay, so in this game you play as a bunch of underpowered zookeepers, or some really glitchy and overpowered animals.Okay, so heres what a normal match is like for the humans.You go looking for a weapon. Before you can find anything, AN EAGLE GOING THE SPEED OF FREAKIN' LIGHT dive-bombs you, cutting off all your limbs near instantly, making it so all you can do is hop around trying not to be killed. It dosen't work. And heres a match for the animals. you either manage to click the overpowered eagle (not likely) or you are stuck with one of the other animals. Then a zookeeper with a rocket launcher shoots you, killing you in one hit. It's a no win situation. NO WIN.Edit: Oh, or a zookeeper stuffs themselves into a wall, making themselves invincible. That actually happened to me once. And then another zookeeper murdured me in the next round. (I'm guessing because they thought I was the person who stuffed themselves into the wall?)"

,Recommended,622040,33395446,Posted: 8 July,all,💀 GodzillaFightn 💀,"From the limited footage and play i have had with this game so far (i watched a video, played it for a while), it is pretty good!The wacky physics engine it has really works well with the simplistic design, making it feel much more ""natural"" to the physics.I honestly cant wait for the rest of the animals! I wonder what they will be!Could just be my computer, but the chat got glitched and i couldnt communicate.It could of also been the long time the match went on for, having no timelimit and a very glitchy ostrich.Anyways, i would usally say ""Let's wait for the full release."" but this seems to have alot of promise!Right now as of June 9th, 2017, i will give it a solid 8/10!The creators of this could do alot with this, honestly. Can't wait to see what the future holds for this, and i hope it doesn't end up like Hybrid Creatures or whatever it was called..."
