,Recommended,622650,31510365,Posted: 2 May,all,BigDaddyHaler,"BATIM is one of those different types of horror games which is good for the size of the game so far. I'll try to mention as many things as possible:The reason why I recommend it, is because you don't constantly expect jumpscares *cough*all those other hardcore horror games*cough*, which makes the jumpscares a bit scarier. The scares aren't constant and they aren't overdone - which, in my opinion, has MORE of an effect on the player. I find hardcore horror games to be extremely boring, because I constantly expect the scares, and yeah yeah, we've seen it all already - the blood and gore, k k moving along. This game is different, thus, good. You don't know when something is about to pop up, and when it does, you certainly didn't expect it.The art style is great and you don't need a $1000 computer to play the game smoothly. The style and colour-use of the game adds to the atmosphere, and it's not a COLD atmosphere like in most horror games. Instead, the warm atmosphere makes things a bit weirder. I also love the limited use of colour and lighting. It's not a super light game, but it's also not super dark - you can actually SEE where you're going, praise the lawd.The SFX and music choices are great and really add to the 1900's animation studio theme (does that make sense?). The voice actors spoke clearly and you can HEAR what they're saying, accent and all, without needing subtitles. That being said, the voice acting is really good and it also adds to the time-frame of the game - the accents, pitch, emotion, everything is just really well done, ok. Props to the voice actors, ya'll are gods, pun intended.Interaction with objects is easy and interesting, and the effects it can have to interact with certain objects are a bit different, such as the cutouts and instruments (organ specifically). Listen, I spent like 2 minutes making music for Sammy on the balcony or whatever you call it, and I enjoyed it a lot, thanks.The controls are easy to get used to, although, I feel like the swinging of the axe could maybe use a tiiiiiiiiiny bit of work. If not, that's fine too - still easy to get used to. THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING A MOUSE SENSITIVITY ADJUST OPTION ♥Characters vary, even though there aren't many. You don't see many of the characters, but you can differentiate them simply from the way they talk - the humans, I mean. The character designs are also interesting. Most people mention the Disney-like style for the cartoons, but to me, it almost feels like a completely different style on it's own. There are certain Disney-like elements, but egh, it's not completely Disney. As for the monster designs - I don't know when they changed, but they terrified me, good work with the re-model.The game seems so simple, yet it hides so many secrets, and testing the game's limits regarding what can and can't be done is a lot of fun. Just doing a playthrough without exploring a little is what makes the game short - but taking some time to look into some things, pay attention to details, can go quite a long way. This adds to the story as well. Only 2 chapters in and the story is already interesting. You want to know what happened, why it happened and who was responsible, etc, which makes you want to look at some extra details and figure things out if you can.Really cool feature: The game will be different for everyone (or like, a lot of people at least), with the different placements regarding certain objects and order of doing things - Really cool feature. It adds a bit of variety to the game, so you can watch multiple people play it, and play it yourself and still not see all the features and secrets.FANART AND FAN-MADE STUFF ARE INCLUDED! This is great, because it makes the community a part of the game. The creators interact with fans every day (such as Twitter) and naturally, they also look at player feedback (which should be something every game developer does tbh).TL;DR: IT'S A GOOD GAME PLAY ITCONS:Note: Patch 0.2 has been released, so the stuff mentioned below are basically not cons anymore.When you die, you have to restart the entire chapter. FIXED!The axe thing mentioned above. FIXED!People mention that $6 for the 2nd chapter was too much, although I really feel it wasn't. 4 chapters for $6 each = $24 for the whole game (because chapter 1 is free). That's really not a bad price, because the game keeps getting updated and newer chapters might be longer. It's only at the 2nd chapter, so I can't really say whether it's too expensive or not, but in my opinion, it's not.That's all I can think of for now. Will add more with time, or write a completely new review once the game is complete."

Although this can be turned off in the settings, it feels like that effect (when working properly) is a strong part of the game's atmosphereThis following section is more in hopes the developers may see this and take 'em into considerationMinor consSome animations are lacking or slightly buggy (namely: in the scene whereSammy rambles at you, he repeats a single idle animation [includes enough movement to fit, but isn't moving quite as animatedly as he should be] while his left arm and leg often twitch back and forth)Bendy's chase theme doesn't loop smoothlyPieces of destroyed wood/cardboard don't collide with eachother, creating a glitchy-looking area where they overlapSammy's model needs improvement, namely his lack of mouth despite the mouth-hole in his mask and his overall straps not resting on his shouldersThe floor is composed of a repeating wood texture with a single plank lying across it, which beaks immersion slightly once noticed"

,Recommended,622650,31638476,Posted: 8 May,all,Doctor Fudge,"It's fine. It's not the best thing ever, but it's ultimately inoffensive.The art direction is absolutely the only thing worth truly recommending so far. Everything else is competent but forgettable. It uses one color in various shades to emulate the style of the early days of animation in 3D. It mostly accomplishes this, although I'd appreciate it if they could make a different floor texture than the ceiling. It kind of got on my nerves. 3D character models aren't nice. Entry level at best. Their animations are worse.Please make the jump ability relevant, by the way. Don't give it to me if it accomplishes literally nothing. You lied to me, game. I thought I would need to jump, but I never did. Ya jerk.Sound design could use some work. The musical stings were irritating to me. Why not try something using the actual instrumentation you'd hear in the theaters these old cartoons would play at? Not strings. More piano please.Anyway, 7/10. It's alright, play it if you want. It won't make you want to die."

,Not Recommended,622650,35501164,Posted: 5 October,all,Thefatfellow,Before you buy this game you must know that even though the graphics look easy to run they are very much the opposite. I have a very decent gaming computer and this game cannot have a fps above 20 on lowest settings. The game may be good but you need very good specs to run it.
76561198041046172,Not Recommended,622650,32243538,Posted: 7 June,all,Emrys,"While I enjoyed the concept this game provides -the idea of old animations coming to life is intriguing to me- the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The art style here is brilliant, and the atmosphere is tense, something a horror game should do, but the gameplay... well, there is none, really. Ninty percent of the game is simply walking around looking for items or buttons, and the other ten percent is waiting for blobs of ink to attack you so you can chop them down. The puzzles are not very complicated, and this honestly feels like a game meant for children.I think I will simply be watching other people play chapters 3-5, as there is no benefit to playing them myself, and I would urge others to do the same, this is not a game worth six dollars."
,Recommended,622650,31531907,Posted: 3 May,all,skpacman,"The free Chapter 1 gives you a good, quick sense of how the rest of the game will play. Get some story, solve some puzzles, get creeped out, hash some theories, find some secrets, then move on. Chapter 2 greatly expounds on the experience with new characters, voices, mechanics, models, and even MORE SECRETS!Trying to be as fair as I possibly can, yes this game is not without flaws but is still one of the best indie games I've played in a very long time. TheMeatly and Mike Mood really pulled together to make the best experience in Bendy's world they possibly could, and it WORKS.Finding secrets is incredibly satisfying, even if Mike or TheMeatly refuse to give us more descriptive hints lol. Gameplay is short and to the point. The scares are simple but effective. Spoopy Sammy walking past you in the distance or watching you from a balcony creeps me out. Very well done game.It's quickly becoming my favorite Indie game!Overall I'd have to give this a 9/10, only because of some of the design and gameplay bugs (which are small, but potentially game-breaking)"
,Not Recommended,622650,35292329,Posted: 29 September,all,Cheru,"World of Bendycraft (90 minutes of delivering items from A to B).I was one of the first ten or so channels to play Bendy when it made its appearance on Gamejolt all those months ago, and though I'm a big fan of both the first and second chapters, there is no way in the world that I can give this chapter a positive review, which I will explain why now.Bendy was never about the gameplay mechanics. You walk around, interact with objects, occasionally jump and swing around a weapon, and that was ok. We loved BATIM for the story and the mystery surrounding Henry and the inked demon himself, Bendy, and though the chapters were short, they were packed with excitement and most importantly, questions. More and more questions that needed to be answered. It was undoubtedly this collection of continually growing unanswered questions that generated the popularity that Bendy has enjoyed since its debut.With this standard set, it comes as no surprise that I went into chapter 3 expecting more of the same. I wanted mystery, I wanted story, I wanted questions. Did I get any of those things? Absolutely not. What I did get however, which I found to be extremely obnoxious was the blatantly obvious attempt that the developer had made to stretch out what otherwise would have been a 15 minute experience, to 90 minutes by adding the most boring and mundane fetch and retrieve tasks .. not once, but SIX times back to back. I literally had to find and deliver 4 of the same item a total of SIX times, after which the game was over with basically nothing having happened at all during the entire chapter.To me, this was a lazy and unimaginative attempt by the developer to push out another chapter priced at $6, which was actually a 10 to 15 minute experience, padded out to 90 minutes with completely inane and mind-numbingly boring fetch tasks that contributed nothing to the story whatsoever.I'm all about supporting small developers, but not like this. This was a very, very poor attempt."
,Not Recommended,622650,31961988,Posted: 25 May,all,The One whose Shape was snatched,This Game is pretty good. But the comparison between playtime and price (for further chapters) leads to the conclusion that it isn't worth it. If it's for sale give it a shot if you think it might interest you.

Worse it's a tedius point and click adventure with jump scares.  Oh, and it's short.The devs appear to be so enraptured with their graphics that they forgot to include many of the other things that make up a game.  The graphics are clever enough but graphics do not make a game.Stil it might be entertaing if there were an option remap the controls.  Particulary an option to  invert the Y-Axis.  But there is no such option and this offering becomes a frustration in ""always looking in the wrong direction.  There is a lengthy thread in the game discussion but the devs have not found fit to respond to it.  Apparently they are more intrested in creating Bendy toys than they are in presenting a playable game.I recommend against the game until the Devs demonstrate a responsibe attitude toward their customer base.>> Several thumbs down <<"

,Recommended,622650,31402932,Posted: 27 April,all,angelwolfchild,"Really craving bacon soup right now. Don't know if that's even a real thing but I want it.I originally saw Markiplier's playthrough of this game and it instantly caught my attention, so when I saw that it was getting a steam release I immediatley decided to pick it up. Totally worth every penny. Not only is the aesthetic absolutely beautiful (and match the old animation style Bendy emulates) but it contrasts the horror atmosphere, creating a very uncanny vibe. Add to that all the little details, like the regenerating Bendys and the multiplying Bendys and... basically anything the little demon does, and it creates a charming yet creepy ambiance that makes you want to explore. The story is interesting and well-paced, each chapter keeps feeding us more and more details about what hell has been unleashed on the studio but always raises more questions by the end. Gameplay is quite straight-forward, with basic first-person mechanics and a decent weapon that does the job without making you feel overpowered. The easter eggs also brought a huge smile to my face, you have no idea how much I squeed when I heard 'Build Our Machine' while playing.My only real issue is the lack of save option. I know the chapters so far are fairly short overall so it shouldn't take long to get back to where you were if you die, but due to how some things are randomised it can be easy to miss objects needed for progression which leaves you wandering around for ages. Either a manual save system or an autosave everytime you get a new objective would make things simpler, though it's not a dealbreaker if one is never implemented. And the randomised aspects aren't necessarily a bad thing as it gets you exploring and can make repeated playthroughs more unique; for example Sammy's favourite song is different each playthrough, that's so cool.Overall this is brilliant, I love Bendy and I look forward to seeing what trouble he causes in the future. Thanks for bringing this amazing game to steam The Meatly, I'm eagerly awaiting the next chapter.Also, any chance that Bendy plush will become real to purchase? Or is there a way to summon one?"

I love the direction the story is taking in the first two chapters, and the achievements are fun to collect. It's really great that there's even fan-contributions like Build Our Machine (which I consider the anthem of the fanbase at this point) and the amazing fanart.It's cool that Chapter 1 is free. It means that people who didn't know about the game before can play the first chapter like a demo, and not have to worry about losing money.If there's anything I have to complain about though, it's people asking for the other chapters to be free. Please, stop this. There has clearly been a lot of work put into this game so far, and the people working on it deserve to profit from their efforts. It may be inconvenient for players, but if we want more chapters of the same quality, if not higher, the developer and everyone involved need funds. It's really that simple."

I did experience a couple of glitches that happened more than once; the textures render as all pink or yellow sometimes. Combat also could use some work. Besides from that, outstanding. 9/10"

,Recommended,622650,32840542,Posted: 26 June,all,melissaduck,"As I write this, only two chapters have been released for this game. However, I'm already singing its praises. The art style is wonderful, the originality is spectacular, and the simple yet creepy character design for Bendy makes him an almost believable demonic expy of Mickey Mouse. I'm also impressed by the nods to actual Disney lore contained within this game's universe.My only real complaint is the axe mechanic, as it is rather iffy. There is seriously no telling how close you have to get up to an object or enemy to swing it at the right time. Other than that, I very much love Bendy and the Ink Machine, and anyone who loves horror, Disney, or animation in general, should give this game a try."

But I'm a sucker for a good story. This has a great mixture of the two of them together! You've got me hooked Meatly! And I can't wait to see more!"

,Recommended,622650,34684223,Posted: 2 September,all,ThatCrazyRedHead,This game is one of the best horror games. You never know when a scare will happen. It keeps you on edge of your seat. Chapter 2 had me shaking with fear on stream. The jump scares are not repetitive so you will never not be scared. I highly recommend this game! Excited to see what happens next! I can only imagine the new scares that are to come!

,Recommended,622650,34742531,Posted: 4 September,all,Indurok,"Video version of this review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk-NuHCmBnYThis is a horror game about an old-style animation company. You are asked by an old pal named Joey to come by because he needs to show you something.Right off the bat, the visuals are kinda weird, when I look at things from a distance, everything is clear, but when I look at anything close up, everything is blurry. I’ve looked at other videos, and I seem to be the only one with a messed up depth of field. I eventually found out that you can turn that stuff off. And lowering the graphics was also quite helpful, since it had a low frame rate.But anyway, all you basically have to do is walk around and find certain things, like these tape recorders on the walls and stuff. They can provide you with information about stuff you will need to do later, especially when it comes to the music room in chapter 2. You find the ink machine and wonder how you turn it on. Funny that since you used to work here, you wouldn’t know how to turn the machine on. But then again, you spent most of your time at a desk, so you were probably never in charge of the machine at all.In order to turn on the main power, you have to find a bunch of ""offerings"". The item I’ve always had the hardest time finding is the wrench, especially because of the depth of field screwup. Then you power up the ink machine and meet up with Bendy. I don’t know how the dude can even see me with that ink covering his eyes. But then again he’s kinda made of ink, so I guess that’s not really a problem for him.There are all these bottles of ink that I assume you drink when you pick up, but I have no idea what they do. I assumed at first it was for health, which is kind of ironic, since drinking that much ink would give you severe ink poisoning. So yeah, I have no idea what these are for.In the second chapter, there is actually combat. You have to ax some ink monster really hard in the face, which I could barely do because of the frame rate. But they seem to die after landing a successful hit on you anyway.So anyway, that’s all I really want to say about this game, I don’t want to spoil too much of it. But the game does have good scares and creepy moments, and I'd recommend 100%. It's a great game. The first chapter of the game is free, but the second chapter is a pretty good price for what it is, but what do I know about good prices?"
