I have got most everything int his game and i can tell you its amazing but has to many gamebreaking bugs. I honestly think they should do a wipe to do more testing but dont think they will for now. Some of these bugs include unlimited duriblity of weapons, stat problems, and level gains with unlimited duribility. BUT that is an easy fix and this game does deserve alot of attenion by other people. Right now i do say that things are kinda bland and there isnt much to really do after a few 40 hours or so. Yet they are making patches and updates every few days. Just hope they fix the big problems sooner then later that are in the game for those willing to put time into it."
,Recommended,623310,32281662,Posted: 8 June,all,Wuzzleteets,"A little bit more than barebones at this stage. I would say it is still worth the 20 dollar investment because if you like games that are similar to Classic Runescape then you'll be right at home here in Arcfall. After getting your bearings you can expect at least 40 hours worth of gameplay time minimum to get a taste of what the game has to offer. The game's main feature is skilling and can be a tad grindy at times, especially when your'e at the stage of trying to gather up enough coin for a plot of land, a house and a horse; but it's addictive.This game has nothing but potential. The dev (Neojac) is constantly active of the game's discord server and is always up for suggestions and community feedback.....The hours are slipping away and I'm getting withdrawls when I'm at work.Someone please help me"
,Recommended,623310,31875669,Posted: 20 May,all,SlyJesse,"Although the game is very basic right now it has brought back the fun feeling from playing MMORPG's that I have missed since I first started playing runescape back when it was only classic. There is a community that helps each other and chatter among the players inside the game. You have to deal with real people not just an auctioneer NPC. You need to go out and kill to find the better equipment, not just log in or do a quest.Would recommend at this stage to anyone."

PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT.""He did warn us...(Ask yourself, is it about the choice that a person makes and then replying to them from emotion, or the disregard for the warning that was provided? Furthermore Have you ever bought a game on the hopes that it may be progress further even when others say it's not going to?).My support on this game is from the Dev actively replying, and being involved in the community updating us on changes, if that changes and progess stops, I'll happily change my review."

This game has a very nice and rewarding/late game concept. ITs hardcore rpg so i would suggest learning a few things before you play(you litteraly get dropped into the world with no quest guide , map etc its truely yours to discover...lol) Anyways this game is  great for Early Access and i reccomend it for rpg lovers. IT does has a few FLAWS like server crashing and bad fps drops server wide. But these are things you expect when buying into an EA tittle. Other than that the game has alot to offer right know, and alot of potential in the future. FYI i played 4hrs straight and didnt get bored..sadly i was up allday. Great Game Definatly reccomending this one!!"

This game is developed with kind of ""family spirit"" and that's great because you can realy participate to is creation even if, like me, you have not take the founder pack !For the game itself, is full of potential. PERIOD.Yes is a Albion like on many things, and?Every Minecraft player rage on Minecraft like, WoW player on WoW like.... This game is still hapenning guys ;) deal with it and don't just spit on the work and passion of a team because things aren't going fast enough for you... Go play Albion and stop crying !This game is for farming/ crafting/ exploration/ community lovers. You found things/ideas/feeling like you may had playing Ryzom in the crafting, or wow Vanilla, with graphic like Torchlight ( first of the name) (and Dofus and Lantern Forge and others...). The housing, the craft, the exploration, the economy, the pve, the pvp....Beautifull things are incoming, so be patient mate. And the community could became very strong and friendly !! That's a big point !!So I think you get it : I love this game. And I wish the team will reveal all his potential to everyone.Love and Chocolate <3"
76561198155411247,Recommended,623310,31989546,Posted: 26 May,all,Melyssa,"A game with a LOT of potential!Since it's in Early Access it's understandable that issues like lag, bugs and missing content is possible, but NeoJack has been at the front of the battallion working hard to add new content and patch bugs. He's often present at the official Discord channel, checking the bug reports, reading our suggestions and answering questions about the current content and what's to come.For those asking ""Is this game similar to X?"", I'll say this game reminds me A LOT of the old school RuneScape. Several gathering, crafting and combat skills, decent graphics, housing system... I feel I'm 13 years old again, back in the old good RPG times.With less than a few weeks of launching the economy system is yet to be at its full potential. Right now everyone is crafting everything for themselves and most find it hard to part with their hard-earned cash when they really don't need to, but once the playerbase grows and cash becomes more abundant we'll see the player-driven economy advertised in the game description.Repeating my first statement, this game has A LOT of potential, and I'll love to be here to see it flourish."

,Recommended,623310,31919369,Posted: 23 May,all,jasconine,"An interesting and entertaining MMORPG that is in early access.While the game is still quite raw and is certainly unfinished, the current content and community make it worth the time to play. It is a seamless world (no zones or loading) with only 2 major towns (one is more like a large barebones city) with some settled farmlands, forests and plains in-between.The crafting system is easy to work with (but every crafted item requires a recipe and ingredients which surprises some players.) Gather, refine and craft is the basis of the current crafting system with a handful of recipes available at the moment to introduce players to try their hand at making everything they might need.The player-driven economy is still developing, so stuggling to buy a plot of land to own (or rent) has been a struggle for most, with some powerhouses claiming prime real estate.PVE combat is lackluster with only a few weapon options and imprecise actions versus enemies, but it has the makings of a reasonable system which should develop over the next wee while.A small number of quests exist in-game, with a set of tutorial quests that can help acclimitise new players into the basic flow of play as well as familiarising new players with key locations in the starting town.There is currently NO PVP, but it is expected as the game develops.The art style is stylised and could be considered cartoony by some, but I find it easy on the eyes.While it may be considered as a sandbox, it isn't what I would call a true sandbox (do whatever you want wherever you want whenever you want).Player housing is active in-game and works well enough, with the possibility of owning farmland for budding farmer-wannabes. Farming itself doesn't seem to be fully active though, so more exploration and research could be needed to understand how the system works.The skill system is learning-by-doing, so chopping trees increases a lumberjacking skill giving access to a few spell-like abilities to help you survive against the passive chicken threat that is just waiting to explode! Skills also increase some stats (STR, DEX, END and more which in turn affect other composite stats.) Skill gain is a little faster than expected, but a recent patch should have reduced skill gain to a slower but managable level. In-game actions, skills and stats are part of the RPG aspect of progression and customisation (as well as min-max for those so inclined.)There are no dungeons or dungeon-equivalents at the moment, but there are at least 2 planned with a possible 3rd under speculation. It has been said that some dungeons will be open world and others may be instanced, so we are waiting for more information in this regard.How can you get in on this action? You can purchase the game on Steam or through the officialneojac.comwebsite if you want founder packs (currently only available on their website and not on steam.) Just another reminder, the game is in EARLY ACCESS and is not production-ready for mass consumption. Support the devs and join us in-game!Will there be a wipe? Who knows, but there is fun to be had now!TL;DR: Still a lil buggy, not as stable as I would like but hours of engagement with a supportive community."

There is also a global FPS drop for everyone.

,Recommended,623310,31813966,Posted: 17 May,all,[AJSA] MiChAeL,"Although I refunded this game for now, I enjoyed the couple of hours that I did play. Basically the starting zone is the only place with some meat on the bones. It gives off a good vibe if you like the runescape-ish sort of freedom, as well as the MMO factor of seeing and communicating with other people. I'd recommend it if you have a few bucks laying around and want to support the DEV's and try out the game as it grows. I plan on picking this game back up at full price, instead of the discount they have now, after a few notable patches come in adding some more play value, and showing that they are serious about this game."

I can't permantly learn a recipe not even for basic tools??Limited storage/item slots - Your main inventory has about 10-15 item slots which fills up fast! especially if you can't learn the recipes and each recipe/item takes up a slot. This is aggrovating because it forces you to run back to the bank frequently (no recall or teleport feature) and guess what the bank itself has limited slots maybe 30 - woo. Who came up with this slot system?!(how about this - a recipe book so it doesn't consume your storage!)Player base - none.Introduction - There isn't much of a tutorial or help for new players,That's all I got at the moment just enough for me not to want to play - On a positive note, I hope this game thrives as we need more hardcore mmorpgs! no classes, full loot pvp, playerbase economy,etc.Good luck chaps - and I will revisit this game at a later time and hopefully see this on a steam sale soon!"
,Recommended,623310,34073892,Posted: 6 August,all,amartin7799,"I bought this game the other day, and as you can see I've already put 10 hours into it, which is more than I've put in to other games. I prefer this style of game because I just don't like twitchy games, and most mmos lately have gone that route. That being said, This game is in ALPHA. don't buy it unless you want to support development, and don't expect it to change over night. The main reason I bought it was to support development. I was digging for something to play and ran across this. The dev (I hope he's not the only one) appears to be keeping things updated, and this game has so much potential. I've already got my money's worth. I've bought triple A games that were shorter than ten hours. If they keep the ball rolling they will have a hit on their hands. The game is pretty bare bones at the moment, which is to be expected in a alpha (pre-alpha?) state. So far well worth the $20 I paid. Looking forward to seeing more from this. I'll keep this review updated as things move forward."

I mean, on 1 advert webpage that is popular among young man where competition is high she set her price low and didnt mention other, more expensive options where she would offer anal, bj and other cool things. You would have to actually find her own webpage to know about this extra offers.When you finally find that one girl you decide you will give her a try and visit herSpending 13 euro, not knowing there are also more exclusive pacages elsewhere you get surprised when she calls youTHE 13 EURO BOYthe moment you enter her apartment. First i didnt get the irony of that ""13 euro boy"" name.I took my shoes off, started taking my pants off and all of the sudden she asks me if i have brought the condoms with me. My answer was obvious: ""is this for real? you didnt mention i had to bring them when we were talking on the phone"". Than she rapidly answered ""Listen 13 euro boy, if you had paid me more, you wouldnt have to bring them with you"".Of course in my hometown you cant buy condoms without prescription. The solution here was simple. Escort Girl told me she could sell me the prescription for only 5$. Im like (i went all the way here,♥♥♥♥♥it i will give her this 5$). I put my shoes back on and i went to pharmacy. When i was on my way to pharmacy i noticed that the moment i left her apartment, one guys who paid her more (i can tell by the horse he was riding) decided not to wait in queue (until im done) and he entered her apartment. Of course he would♥♥♥♥♥her without condoms because he is her premium customer, neither am i.Just 1 thaught come to my mind ""she wont have enough time to wash herself before i come back"" and she will invite me being ""dirty"".Once again im like, ok Yolo Swagland, shes good looking, she must be worth it. Lets do this.I enter her apartment with condoms in my hands, she undress and say, before we move on to the main thing, you must give me the massage.Sure, i will give you the massage girl !! Lets just make this quick !!.....5 mins later.... still massagingMe - ""Bae !! Can we please move on ?""Girl - ""Shhh !! Keep massaging 13 Euro boy""....1h 45 mins later still massagingHere are my options:- if i reach 2h mark i would have to pay her full price and i wont even have 1/10 of fun that the rich guy had.- i could refund her and forget that this story ever happened to me !!What should i do ?!?!i am not stupid.

The system is not very complex. Character growth is closely related to daily nurturance.But at the moment I'm having some problems.MapThe map is not very large, but seamless convergence, the drawback is that the open area is not large enough, and the map thumbnail is too simple, I think it should be added to the large map interface compass and player custom tag. To make it easy to find resources in the Montreal map without getting lost.ResourcesThe distribution of resources in the map seems to lack of planning, the mountains and boulders near the rocks can not be found, the animals messy scattered in various places, towns and villages is a little small, some scattered resources and real estate. Herbal medicines have very low visibility and very few. But the trees are everywhere. Too little water is collected.Other systemsRiding and coming down seems too time-consuming, and the speed of horses is too little compared to the speed of people walking. Weight-bearing horses should carry 2 of parcels themselves, instead of sharing a package with the protagonists. NPC trafficking is also a lack of planning, many times in the new village needs drawings can only run very far to the main city to buy.EconomicI don't mind buying some gold coins after the game, but the price of primary resources is the same as that of advanced resources. It seems unreasonable to sell only a coppers for processed or finished products.The development of ORPGThis is a good direction, look forward to more underground city or field camp to provide more play, of course, with the depth of the game to join the new building and materials, do not forget to join more Monster Corps, let the sandbox and form, war and other forms of the Director.认真的写几点建议：首先，这个游戏很不错，结合了沙盒和ORPG游戏的特点。系统也不是很复杂。人物成长跟日常的养成联系很密切。但是目前我遇到了一些问题。地图地图不是很大，但是无缝衔接，缺憾是目前视乎开放的区域不够大，而且地图缩览图过于简单，我觉得应该在大地图界面加入罗盘和玩家自定义标记。以方便在满地图找资源的时候不至于迷路。资源地图中资源分布好像缺乏规划，山脉和巨石附近找不到矿石群，动物们凌乱的分散在各个地方，城镇和村庄有点小，而且地产资源有些分散。草药可见度很低，也很少。然而树木到处都是。水资源采集量太少。其他系统骑马和下来似乎太费时间，而且马匹的速度相对于人走的速度加成太少。负重的马应该自己携带2个包裹，而不是和主角共用一个包裹。NPC贩卖的东西也缺乏规划，很多时候在新手村需要的图纸只能跑很远去主城买。经济我并不介意买了游戏后再花点钱内购一些金币，但是初级资源卖出的价格和高级资源一样。而且幸苦做成的加工品或成品只能卖出一个铜币，这似乎太不合理。ORPG的拓展这是一个很好的方向，期待以后有更多的地下城或者野外营地提供更多的玩法，当然可以随着游戏的深入，加入新的建筑和材料的同时，别忘了加入更多的怪物军团，让沙盒和养成，战争等形式各施所长。"
