,Recommended,623880,34478001,Posted: 25 August,all,Pan Tutaj,"I'm writing this in English, so maybe more people will see this and like if I'm right.Game has a really big potential, graphics isn't bad, looks nice as a F2P game. I hope it will be free soon.The mechanic car tuning is really good, but we still have not so many settings. I wanna change ma angles, make my car lower, maybe give him bigger or lower pressure on tires.Lots of people are focusing on car look, visual tuning. Parts and bumpers are nice, maybe giving us some body-kits or wide fenders can be more interesting and will help making our cars more original.I'm still viting for vinyls customization. Possibility to get bigger rims can be good too.Making money and unlocking things in game is really nice, not too easy and not so hard.Cars damage is okay, looks nice and isn't too expensive to repair. Tht's nice it makes changes to car's properties.Now the worst thing of the whole game: physics, cars handling.Sesnsitivity on the lowest level is too hard. Cars are driving like gokarts with 1000BHP, sometimes like trains and sometimes like gokarts on the ice. We need to have more sim-arcade steering. I can't feel the car. I wanna turn without any drifting, sometimes I wanna drift but more realistic. I think the steering angle is too big maybe.Next thing is the moment, when you touch the other car. Now it works like a magnet. Other cars can go into your ride and change your direction. Lot's of people are winning, because they ram in any race. I would like to see completely rebuild any game physics. Focusing on something like GRID 2 seems to be nice. If I wanna drift I will, If I don't I will brake more, steer without handbrake. Going though 90* corner with 150 km/h isn't possible, but in game it's so funny to watch.Think about changing something and one day this can be a really good game."

I understand that it is in early access, but for a so cool game, to support just KEYBOARD is quaint...-How the f*ck, to turn with 150-160 km/h , angle ~70 degrees and all rest ok, no dirft, no crash, i had the feeling either run with 15km/h, either 150km/h, it was same...NOT REALISTIC AT ALL!!!I just dont understand developers. Why to do a so cool game(graphics, graphics details, cars, tracks), but to forget about those small things to MAKE THIS GAME REALLY SUCCESFULL. It was better if you could realise the game in some months then now and to get a ton on negative reviews...I will come in next months to see the progress, but for now i will refund the game."

But it isn't free.I love racing games, so I got the gold pack, especially for the Mustang.-Graphics are a few generations outdated.-There are very few cars, and they all handle the same.-There are only a handfull of tracks, and you don't get to choose where you race. You pick a class and the game decides what track you will race on.-Upgrading your car is expensive, and typical formy.comthere will be microtransactions to ""gear up"" faster.-Car behaviour is crazy.-expect to move sideways in corners, No I don't mean drifting, I mean literally floating/teleporting sideways. It's the base of a racegame and they can't manage to create that???-Calling the behaviour arcade would be an insult to arcade racers. maybe in a year or so because that's the least amount of time needed to get this game anywhere.-no content, no tracks, no cars, no fun. After 1h you have seen everything this game has to offer...The game has potential, but they are not even near that at this time. So my advice is to wait and deffinately do not spend money in it. At the way it is now, I don't even see how this game will ever become an alpha game.Guess we'll have to wait and see."

Some of the modes are annoying, but the driving is solid.There isn't a whole lot to this game, but what is there is moderately entertaining.

,Not Recommended,623880,34443097,Posted: 23 August,all,Ryu Makkuro,"After playing it for almost 18 hours, there's one thing I can say for sure... the amount of ramming Russians is TOO DAMN HIGH.Honestly, every race is either you against AI, you against AI with a russian or two or you against a lobby full of russians. Naturally every single one of them will ram you. Every. Single. One. They may not do it immediately, but they surely will. That's along the other usual tricks, like using you as a brake, wall etc.Problem is... if this was the only bad thing, you could deal with it. But this ain't even the tip of the iceberg. So let me start with the only positive thing about the game: progression system.By racing you earn cash, exp and class points. Class points are dependent on the car you use, therefore to gain class points for a given car class, you need to use a car from such a class. You get a free single unlock of a random car in the class upon leveling up (that's how you gain access to other classes). After that you can race and spend the class points on unlocking upgrades for the car or to unlock another car from the class... random again. If you're unlucky, you'll spend a long while driving something you don't like but it's still down to time rather you throwing money.Now, the bad stuff. This is gonna take a while:- aformentioned Russians. Ban them all. If cancer would had to take a human form, it would take a form of a Russian. That's how bad the races are because of them.- server sided physics. This means that even if you don't want to ram... you will still ram, because when you get close to another car, the physics go kaput and you have no control over what's happening. Best thing to do is to stay away from other players... which is difficult due to the issue above. In practice mode (client sided physics) though the physics are pretty much what you'd expect from an arcade racer.- premium cars. Yes, you have to throw money at the game to get those cars AND they come with perks... so if you want to farm efficiently... you need to have those cars. Not cool.- GUI is... rather bad. The colours make me want to puke after a while. Not that good.- did I mentioned Russians?- Nitrous spam is unreal. You don't spam it at the start, you have no hope of winning. Ever.- Pretty much every RWD car is drift for the win. Given how crappy the physics in MP are... rivers of cancer. Literally.- Drifting is awful, no sense of what the car is doing, whether you'll make the corner or not... and... come on... enough with drift for win everywhere. Sick and tired of it. Especially on tracks that aren't optimised for such driving style.- DLCs at the launch of Early access and... at a price higher than the game itself... or many other games out there.- I am yet to see an actual response from a developer on the steam forums which is the only way of contacting them provided... not a great start there as well.There's a few more minor things, like upgrades being exactly the same for every car, not being able to queue with friends or specifically with AI only etc. A lot of things are supposed to be adressed so I'll give it some time. If it changes, this will change to a positive review. There's potential for this game, it all comes down whether devs are making a jump on the money or want this game to actually be something good. Hopefully it's the latter although I am expecting the first deep down inside. Time will tell."

I've been playing video games since the Commodore days and I don't think I've ever played one with such awful handling!   Seriously, what is up with the steering?  You barely touch it left or right and it makes a 90 degree turn!  Maybe I need more experience with the game.  I have the Intel i7 7700 Koby chip, 4.2Ghz processor, Nvidia 1070 Video card, 32Gig DDR4 memory and over 20 TB drive space and running this game at full Ultra is just a mess!  My computer should be able to run this game at the Ultra settings.  Had to reduce the settings just to get it to run smoothly.  Waste of money!"

,Recommended,623880,34548537,Posted: 28 August,all,Nurini,"So, after all those years, it has finally come, although under another dev's wings.TL;DR: physics is a combination of the ol' NFS World and Drift City, car balance needs a lot of work, but the races online seem to be straight out of Initial D, which is great if you got some Eurobeat blasting. Overall I've really enjoyed the game, win or lose.The matchmaker waits for a bout 2 minutes before filling up the rest with bots. There also are bets and well, they're bets, dont take a bet you cant win, dummy, but it's hard to progress without winning bets, but if there are a few bots in the game the medium bet should be pretty easy to complete. If you got 8 players on the other hand...ohboy. If you got 5+ bots? try to complete the hard bet, which still can be tough but very rewarding.The physics: No, this is NOT a simulator, nor a simcade, this is proper arcade. With FWD cars you cant properly drift though, but with the RWD cars you actually lose a bit less speed on corners than with grip driving, but always drifting isnt viable on technical bits as drifting needs ""settling time"": No grip-no grip-grip-GRIP-GRIP. Dirt actually slows you down, a lot, so thats good.The customization: there's like 3 choices each for every bit of the car, the game is lacking some rims, but those could very well come in the nearby future, and liveries are ""coming soon"". Overall I'm pleased.The cars: 3+ choices every class, but some are most definitely better than others, as the car specs are realistic, and the 0-200 time matters the most on the tracks you'll drive as a beginner.The tracks: you get about 3 tracks as a rookie, but as you progress into faster cars you'll also get more technical tracks, like the Nordschleife, road California, other sections of existing areas... The races are short, about 2-3 minutes, so this game doesn't suffer from Dota2-itis where you have to cancel all arrangements just to play a single game.WARNING: from class B to D the GT86/BRZ is by far the best car at the moment, purchase wisely. Although you may have to spend some diamonds to unlock the right car for the next class, which is a huge annoyance. Either that or youll have to grind a bit with a car you dont really want."

76561197996551596,Recommended,623880,34447689,Posted: 23 August,all,Hekteur,"(TL;DR will follow)I'm writting a positive review because I believe many have been unfair to the game. First thing first: this is an Early Access (Early Access started on the 22nd of august) and it should be treated as such. The game is, obviously, at a barebone stage. DON'T BUY RIGHT NOW if you expect a full game or anything somewhat close to even a public beta; in such a case, wait a while until the game is updated with more content, or maybe wait until it releases and go free. You should buy it right now if you want to support the developper and/or you want to give feedback/send bug reports. After reading many negative reviews, it's totally obvious that 90% of those are from people who were oblivious to the fact that an Early Access is NOT a finished game and mostly nowhere close to it.Pros:- Great graphic for an MMO.- Some tracks are unusually long compared to the usual racing game (that one could be a con to some, but definitely a pro IMO).- Early Access will mostly last a long while so if you want to have much impact on the game's development, it's definitely the right time to jump in!.- Early Access doesn't forces people into an NDA.- pros will be upodated as development progress.Cons:- Some tracks may feel long to some people (also wrote it in pros, so just put it where you want whether you like long lasting race or not)- The game is still very far from looking like a complete finish product (this isn't a con to me since I also made a similar pro, but obviously, many are angry that the game is still under serious development).-  cons will be updated as development progress."

But nevertheless in this game there are all elements of a quality multiplayer racing simulator (arcade game of course). This is a large garage consisting of famous supercarriers and not super. And good multiplayer component and of course it`s flavored with good graphics and soundtrack. As for me this game is an excellent alternative to its more expensive competitors, and the price / quality ratio makes you think seriously about its purchase.As a bonus for the purchase, we get 2 weeks of premium account and in-game currency, which is important for multiplayer games.

Once that's taken care of, you're treated to a racing simulator that has some arcade feeling. There's a good selection of tracks, cars and performance tuning.During the races, i just sticked to the car sounds.The game is not hard, sometimes even on easy, but it depends on the settings and your racing experience. There's also some bonus objectives, although they're always the same. The XP system is almost pointless, because you progress very quickly in it. The racing mechanics are good after tweaking, but collisions with other cars is a mess. I also didn't enjoyed drifting too much. But overall, i had a good experience with this game, even if i didn't touch the online features. Plus, it's cheap on sale."

Азарт от соперничества с живыми противниками, рев двигателей, визг резины, гулкие удары столкновений и все это под драйвовую музыку. Это та планка к которой надо стремиться. Так как игра в раннем доступе хочется высказать несколько пожеланий:1. Это система повреждений машины - сейчас она работает только визуально. А хочется чтобы она влияла на управляемость машины.2. Это сильная разница участвующих в гонке автомобилей - игрок с полность прокаченной машинной, пусть даже той же марки, что и у новичка имеет неоспоримое преимущество. В результате гонка завершается с заранее предопределённым результатом.3. Малый заработок - даже с учётом према гарантированный заработок за проведенную гонку весьма мал. А ведь ещё приходится платить за ремонт машины... Хотя вариант с системой ставок перед гонкой мне понравился это интересное нововведение.Графику и звук пока не оценивал. Эта та вещь которую можно вытянуть в любой момент. В качестве примера перенос одной игры с планшета на ПК, там разработчики за полгода довели графику техники от стадии ""квадрат"" до стадии ""почти hd""."

76561198031429364,Recommended,623880,34431790,Posted: 23 August,all,Auron Rayn,"So far, I must say that I have had an awesome experience. Yes, the game is in early access, and yes, it is pretty bare bones. However, the foundation for something great is there. It can be expanded upon to become something truly great if handled correctly.To be completely honest, I'm always a bit sceptical when it comes tomy.com'sname slapped onto a game, as I got my fingers pretty badly burned by Skyforge. So far though, the monetization here looks pretty fair.I have what I consider to be a potato computer by modern gaming standards (Intel Core i3, 8 GB RAM, GT740 and a 4MB Fibre Connection in South Africa) and the game runs flawlessly without any stutter or lag. I generally prefer keeping my settings at medium quality as I prefer performance above over-the-top graphics.I bought the Gold Cup package, and for now am not regretting it one bit. I remain warily optimistic, but if you have not (like myself and many others here) followed the game since it was announced (I still have an unused beta key on my account I did not get to utilise) and are looking for the next NFS World, I would suggest giving it a pass until some of the newer features and updates are rolled out. Do remember that the game never gave itself out as being open world. It has always been advertised as an arcade racer with customization and damage to cars, with the only ""open world"" section being the planned Airport Strip where you can show off your car to others.I urge you to do the following:1) Open your Web Browser. I prefer Google Chrome myself. You can even use Internet Explorer.2) If not yet set as the default search engine, type""www.google.com""in the address bar. Please: no one ever says ""Let's Yahoo it!"".3) Type in ""World of Speed"" in the search bar. Press Enter.4) You will be directed to the World of Speed website. Should be the first result, unless you have some messed up ads in there.5) Read and explore the info about the game.6) If you feel any hype, return here and re-read some of the reviews, then either wait or buy immediately!7) If no hype is felt, quietly click the red cross in the top right corner or press the Home button, and return to your regular life or regular scheduled browsing.To Saber Interactive: Thank you for bringing this game out after all these years. Please don't disappoint us with needless micro-transactions up the wazoo! The fans only expect what was promised on the original website. If you deliver on all those promises, you will have a successful game and a dedicated fanbase, willing to spend money on it if what you offer is reasonable.With that said, I bid you all good day and see you in game!Edit: Made a mistake. After carefully checking and following through, you cannot exchange dealer points for crystals. It costs crystals to exchange dealer points between classes."

,Recommended,623880,34741847,Posted: 4 September,all,Coasterfreak,"I've played a lot of racing games in my life, from Life for Speed to The Crew. I've mainly played Drift City for around 8 years, and Need for Speed World for some time as well, so I basically knew what to expect from a racing MMO game.World of Speed isn’t a sim racing game – far from it. If you’re looking for a sim racing game, don’t even bother reading this review and carry on.This is an arcade racing game. Basically a fusion of NFSW graphics with Drift City gameplay, together with no optimization at all, which results in a poorly run game. The physics are non-existent, you can finish a race without touching the brake pedal once, but it’s an arcade racing game so it shouldn’t surprise you. Hitting poles and trees don’t affect you at all.Upon starting the game for the first time, you’ll notice that you’ll have 500 “Diamonds” and 15 days of “Premium”. Diamonds are basically the real-money currency system in World of Speed, and you get 2.5 euro’s worth of diamonds, which can be used for various small stuff explained a bit further down. Premium is something like a membership which gives you 1.5x more credits, XP and dealer points. Dealer points are explained a bit further below if you don’t know what they are.Once you’re finally in game, there’s not a whole lot you can do. There’s a huge “PLAY” button at the top to join a racing lobby. This lobby will at most take 1:51 minutes of your life before it throws you into a lobby mainly filled with either bots or Russians. Bots are easily recognizable because of their names, which look like this: AmbertBarton, MattJordan, NancyTate and so on. If you’re not interested in joining a lobby, you can also practice on empty tracks.You’ll mostly race on 3 tracks, but occasionally you’ll play on the Nordschleife or some highway track in California, but it’s mainly some lap tracks in San Francisco and in Moscow, together with a sprint race near some coast.When racing, you can get so-called “Action points” by doing certain stuff, like:-	Reaching 5th gear, which givs you “Top speed” points-	Drifting, which give you “Drifting” points-	Slipstreaming, which give you “Sliptstreaming” points (No mistake, it’s really written like this in game.)-	Overtaking, which give you “Overtaking” points.These “Action points” are absolutely worthless, unless you’re taking a “bet” when starting the race.These bets are divided into 4 tiers:-	No bet, no rewards, no risk.-	Easy bet, end up in the top 6 and get 1 task which is related to one of the four before mentioned action points.-	Medium bet, end up in the top 5 and get 2 tasks which are related to one of the four before mentioned action points.-	Hard bet, end up in the top 3 and get 3 tasks which are related to one of the four before mentioned action points.These bets are literally the only source of good income of credits when playing the game, but they’re obviously a risk, so take a bet wisely. When playing against easily recognizable bots, it can be an easy source of income. When you’re playing against real players, it could be wiser to take easier bets to not lose that many credits when losing the bet.Your car has nitro, but it won’t recharge, so use the nitro wisely. Many people just punch it all away in the beginning, only to end up without nitro at the end, where it’s actually a lot more important than in the beginning. But many people fail to realize this and you can end up taking advantage of that.Upon finishing the race, you’ll get 3 rewards based on the place you gained in the race:-	Credits, this speaks for itself.-	XP, this also speaks for itself.-	Dealer points, what?Dealer points are required to unlock certain stuff related to vehicles. Dealer points can be used to unlock cars from the dealership, which is necessary before purchasing a car. Obtaining dealer points from a race is based on the car you’re using. If your car is a B grade car, you’ll get B grade dealer points. Upon trying to unlock a car from the dealership, you will get a random car from the tier you’re trying to unlock. I’ll repeat it again: the car you’ll unlock is random. If there are 5 cars in a tier, there’s a 20% chance of you getting the car you actually want.There are 9 different grades of cars currently in game, of which 1 is unavailable. These grades of cars can be bought after reaching the level needed to unlock these cars. The grades A till H are locked till you reach level 1 till 8 respectively. The former grades are slow cars whereas the latter grades are obviously faster cars. These cars become more expensive to purchase and upgrade, so they’re obviously not that easy to obtain unless you open up your wallet.Dealer points are used to unlock visual upgrades to your car. You want to unlock some sweet rims or some skirts? Unlock them first with dealer points. If that wasn’t enough already you need to pay some credits to actually get it as well. Basically requiring 2 payment methods to get the visual upgrades that you want.Dealer points can also be used to unlock upgrading parts from your car. There are 6 tuning kit stages available for any car, and each stage can be unlocked with dealer points. Upon unlocking the tuning kit stage, you can upgrade certain parts in your car for credits. In the first three tuning kit stages you can unlock three different tyres:-	Drift tyres, giving you more “drift” stat together with xx% more drift action points.-	Street tyres, giving you more “grip” stat together with xx% more slipstream action points.-	Track tyres, giving you more “brake” stat together with xx% more top speed action points.The higher the grade of your car is, the more expensive it becomes dealer points and credits wise.After finishing a race, your vehicle’s state decreases by 20%. This happens every race till it drops to 0%. When it drops to 0%, your car loses its stats, but they’re very little losses. Repairing your car back to 100% costs around 500 credits, but it’s effective not to repair your car when trying to save up some credits, because the benefits of repairing your car is small.So, what are these “Diamonds”?With diamonds, you can purchase credits. Really. You can skip the grind by literally opening up your wallet. 1 race gives around 330 credits upon finishing 1st, without any bets. You can exchange 1 diamond for 50 credits. For 9 euros you can buy 2000 diamonds, meaning 100,000 credits.If that wasn’t enough already, diamonds can also be used to transfer dealer points to another car grade. For example, you can transfer your A grade dealer points into B grade dealer points for a rate of 10 dealer points for 1 diamond. So if you want to turn 100 A grade dealer points into 10 B grade dealer points, it’ll cost you 10 diamonds.There’s also a thing called “premium cars”. These cars are exclusively bought with diamonds. At first glance that doesn’t sound that bad, but upon learning that “premium cars” bought with diamonds give 50% more rewards after finishing a race, it’s showing the real thoughts of these developers.Levelling is a pure pain in the♥♥♥♥♥– and I love to grind, so if you don’t like grinding, look at the following the way you want to look at it:Level 1: 1100 xp needed to reach the next level.Level 2: 2200 xp needed to reach the next level.Level 3: 4400 xp needed to reach the next level.You get the picture. Levelling is a giant grind in this game, giving no benefits after reaching level 8 – the “H” grade cars can be unlocked when reaching level 8, but after that there’s no point in levelling. The levels itself are meaningless as well, they’re only used to unlock car grades.Now that I’ve explained every single thing in this game, it’s up to you to see if this game is worth your time or not. For me, this arcade feeling tickles me in special places, which I like. But all this paying nonsense makes it look like a crappy mobile racing game published by EA, in a hopeless attempt to make bank on people."

I might pick it up again after some major changes or wait for the free to play release, it's sad that I had to do this because I want to support the game but I don't see myself playing this at all in it's current state.Let's start of with the good stuff it has plenty of options and I mean a lot so any computer could run this with some tweaks here and there, it also looks damn good for a free to play quality game. Even though the store page doesn't say it, it does have controller support while minimal it does work. The game also has a handful of cars and each one can be customized however you want from tunning the engine etc down to visual upgrades, it's basically old school Need for Speed or like most people are saying Need for Speed World. It also has plenty of maps in the current stage of release about 5-6 with 4-6 variations in each which is nice.Now the bad and I just wanna say first thing is the physics are awful and downright terrible, the cars have no weight it's like driving a feather, turning is like driving on ice and if your not driving on ice you will be twitching all over the place, drifting is just powersliding with no sense of feel, crashing into someone is like attracting a magnet, I think the only thing the game does right is having a sense of speed. The game crashes almost flawlessly after every race and when you are in a race everyone is lagging about 50% of the time. The audio apart from the car sound and main menu song are bad, things like changing gears, drifting, crashing etc. Speaking of gears the game has no manual transmission which is odd for a racing game in this day and age. The online is dead as far as I can tell, I mean playing against AI is fun and all but the main point is playing against real people but I know this is something the developers can't fix and that might just change when it goes free to play.Honestly I had fun with the game but with the amount of problems the game has, I just can't recommend it. It has potential and it could be the best free to play racing game we have had in years but not until some major updates happen."

And I am stuck to it for a few seconds and can not pull away at which time I am so far behind I do not even try. (I have tried but never got out of 8th.)Before I completed up grades I was winning races and winning bets. Now I have no chance. I did not notice sticking to the walls or guard rails before. Sometimes A head on collision with wall I would have to back out.

I'll admit it feels fairly barebones in its current state but the foundation is there and I can only hope that it continues to blossom as time moves forward.In its current state I'll admit it feels a bit lacking. While I'm a bit bummed that there is no option for manual transmission I feel the big elephant in the room is the physics. It doesn't really feel quite right and a bit too arcadey for what the game feels like its supposed to represent. The game plays like Drift City or Asphalt, in short really drift happy which is fine but I was expecting something a bit more realistic. If you can get past these hurdles then I think you will fine a very enjoyable time with this game."

,Recommended,623880,34580906,Posted: 29 August,all,DeevFactor,"After a few years of development limbo hell, we finally get to see World of Speed on paid Early Access. While it'll still be several months before full release into free-to-play, there is a lot of potential for a great free online racing game that many are eager to see. For the moment, it's only quick online races and a practice mode with more features to come, especially looking forward to seeing how team racing will be like once it happens.While there is a small active online player base (AI cars with random real names fill empty grid spots), it is fairly understandable because of the current pay to access model and a lack of in-game community features (only text chat in pre and post race). It can also feel rather grindy after a while, achieving the hard bet objectives being the best way to earn credits (even then can be risky unless you have high confidence and some aggressive driving). Also keep in mind the rather funky online driving physics that can mess with your race, particularly when trying to achieve the bet objectives. That might be a deal-breaker for some, but the quirks don't really bother me that much. Your experience would vary by control type as well.At the moment, there's a fairly decent car and track selection, with more cars and tracks being planned in later updates, Customization is somewhat limited and there's no tuning aside from tires and upgrades. A few cars are locked behind the premium currency wall, which could be a bother if you like a particular car that is behind that paywall. Will have to see how things go when it comes to that.So far, I've been personally enjoying the game. I'm just happy that World of Speed is available in a playable state, having dropped nearly $40 for the Gold Cup Bundle for the exclusive cars and extra currency (also to support developers on top of that). If you don't mind the paid Early Access state, go ahead on and make your purchase. It's also worth waiting if you rather play it for free once it hits full release."

There are a few things I'd like to see in the game though:1) Since most of the tracks on the game are based on roads, I can see this game working well as an online open world game and something that could be done with maps that either represent parts or all of America or maybe even Europe.2) The game could do with more cars, although there are a good amount of cars considering its in early access and has only just come out.3) I also noticed something strange yesterday, although its only happened once. When I went over a jump, can't remember what map, it threw my car in my air and made it do a cartwheel, not sure if its a bug or just a one time thing.But as I have said the game is a great basis especially considering the amount of time its been out for, just needs to be worked on. Just one other thing, would be nice if we had the option of selecting between MPH and KPH."

What you should know though is that you shouldnt expect this game to be balanced in terms of everyone has the same chance of winning and it all comes down to skill. Since there is a progression and upgrade system there will always be people with better equipped cars, until you max out your own car. I cant tell how big the difference is between a default car and a fully upgraded one but its something to keep in mind. There are also no p2w elements that ive seen so far so technically i guess that means if everyone has a fully upgraded (or default) car it really could come down to skill.Anyway, you should get this game if youre looking for an arcady racing game with a progression system similar to the tank/airplane/ship mmo's out there."

,Recommended,623880,34497042,Posted: 25 August,all,GALAXY,"I have been waiting for this game to come out ever since NFS World servers were shut down because everyone said that this was its replacement and I am disappointed to say that it's NOT. Not even close. That said, I'm not saying that it's a bad thing, because this game is more of a replacement to Auto Club Revolution (ACR) by Eutechnyx than to NFS World, or at least right now, the bare bones of it.The PROS:- Graphics in this game look really nice. Everything to the sky, the surrounding buildings (if you are on a street circuit), the trees look stunning.- Queue times for multiplayer races last up to a maximum of around two minutes. If the timer comes close to two minutes and has yet to find anyone, the game will just drop you in a ""singleplayer"" race against seven AI, which will pretty much give you an easy win if you don't mess it up or the AI are less aggressive (see CONS for details about the AI)The CONS:- Track list thus far is very underwhelming. There are only five locations to race at (Côte d'Azure, California Highway, Nürburgring Nordschleife, Moscow and San Francisco) along with their sectors being individual sprint races (Moscow and San Francisco have modifications to them because they are street circuits). I would have expected more, like Spa, Silverstone, Hockenheimring, etc.- AIs in this game are both too easy, and very aggressive (and/or dumb, I can't tell). If you manage to get a lobby by yourself with seven other AIs, get to first place immediately and leave them to there own activities because they will ram you into a wall.- No ghosting option (as of yet), meaning there will be a lot of collisions.- No manual transmission as of yet.- Visual and miscellaneous bugs/glitchesThe IN-BETWEEN:- There is customization in this game, albeit not NFS 2015 level customization, but customization is there nonetheless.- Car list is decent, but is very outdated and not very large.- The physics are mostly based around PROJECT CARS, with a small hint of NFS into it in drifting because it's not too difficult to master it. You will have to manage the car's steering and throttle while drifting, but it's mostly tap the handbrake and control it.- Premium Cars are cars that are maxxed out and have free custom parts already unlocked that increase XP, Credits and Dealer Points by 50% after races. They can be bought using Diamonds, a secondary currency that uses real money to get more of. These cars are optional if you don't want to spend countless hours grinding at the game.If you want(ed) a replacement to NFS World, this is not the game. The Crew (both the first one and the upcoming second one) and Forza Horizon (1, 2 or 3) are better options for that because they're both open world and you can do whatever you want with whatever car you choose. However, if you want(ed) a replacement to ACR, then this is it, or at least the start of it. Not perfect, but it's something."
