Especially for the current discount price.It can be complicated to redeem and here are the steps.1: Make sure the ingame steam overaly is enabled. You can check to see if it is by pressing shift + tab.2: Click Esc ingame and near the bottom right there is a redeem button.3: The steam ingame overlay should popup with 3 redeemable packages. (Red Buttons)4: Redeem and choose your items.5: Check your ingame mail. Should now have the items delivered.6: In each mail message, click the recieve button to recieve your items.7: In your inventory there should be a Pearl Menu where you can now use your items!"

Until this issue is fixed, DO NOT BUY IT._______________________________________________________________________EDIT: FOUND FIX!! You must go into Steam's Settings (click Steam in top left of Steam Client Window) (Steam > Settings > In-Game: Enable Steam Overlay In-Game) After that, you will be able to hit the Redeem button in Black Desert and Claim your items through the Steam Overlay browser."

76561197994172224,Recommended,624371,32044774,Posted: 29 May,all,Simpson2k6,"You have to redeem the explorer's pack contents in game via a box found when you press the ESC button in-game. It isn't explained very well at all, once redeemed you then have to check your mail which is accessed through another box after pressing ESC.Took me a while to figure out but I feel it's worth the price on sale @ £22."

It gives you all the stuff you need to get a healthy start to the game.Update:  After a few weeks, I have a level 52 and four other level 20-somethings. I have a horse, two pets, and some decent gear. I have not paid a dime more than what I did for this pack and am still having a good time.  While my status doesn't seem to update on here, I'm at  112 hours."
,Recommended,624371,31989303,Posted: 26 May,all,squirrel with a nut,not a bad pack the pets are pretty useful since they Auto loot for you and the inventory expansion slots are really helpful toofor those who don't know how to redeem press escape go to redeem and all your redeemables are there
,Recommended,624371,31963544,Posted: 25 May,all,LukeDIP,"VALUE PACK ISSUE CORRECTED IN MINUTES AFTER EMAIL.This is an amazing game that I think all hardcore MMORPG fans should play, it takes it to the next level in some aspects and the endgame is hardly a wait comepare to most MMOs.  The different classes they have in the game are each amazing in its own way. The openness of the world combines with the amount of possibilites you can make your character into it really is beautiful. The way you can change your characters appearance makes you feel more attached to your role play. It has beautiful and unbelieveable combat for being an MMORPG. The game is cheap but it will cost money if you want to go above and beyond but thats prefectly fine. I would suggest getting the deal because it will allow you to get a very good mount and allows you a pet of choice with many other things included. The Value Pack mentioned above was an old negative review that we can ignore now because it was fixed very fast, thank you BDO for your support. Get this pack while you can and I hope you enjoy the game.Pleasure has been mine,Luke the Duke"
,Recommended,624371,31986250,Posted: 26 May,all,ArigatoX,I would recommend getting this if you are lazy to grind for horse and money this can give you a boost and you can also focus on leveling your character also get many benefits such as pets and items worth alot of pearls. Get this if this is on sale you save alot of money.

76561198121217668,Recommended,624371,32012998,Posted: 27 May,all,Frank648,The game is good out of a few MMORPGs I've played this is the only one I've really gotten into. This package is worth it just for the horse flute. Maybe not but the extra inventor and other things also really helps. Though if you are going to get the pack try to catch it while its on sale as you would with most things.
,Recommended,624371,33055459,Posted: 30 June,all,Warden Flamewater,"I won't really write a long review for this, but by buying this package, you know you'll get a reason to play more Black Desert Online. If you've read my main game review, you can see the points for what I've written for it.The pack bonuses seem very valuable for new players. Just be aware - $30 for a $50 package may sound costly, but if you are a true supporter of BDO, buy it today."
,Recommended,624371,32920360,Posted: 28 June,all,๖ۣCaptain ๖ۣJohnWick,The price for this during a sale is 30 bucks US. That's well worth what you get in this pack if you plan on playing!
