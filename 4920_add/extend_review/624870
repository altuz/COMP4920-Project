A quick rundown of my purchase experience. I played my $30 and launched the game. The beginning mission is fine and makes you want to play more, however after directly leaving the tutorial mission your put in the main town. There is only one merchant in the town and he is the microtrons store guy. I was like great, I’ll get my $90 worth of in game items/pets/costumes and look all cool. But the $90 worth of in game items that you’re promised turns out to just be in-game currency/gold. The pets that are promised are not permanent, and you are buy companion tickets for temporary pets. There are armor costumes in the game, however all 6 of them look very similar and not worth buying. To top it all off, the game is completely unplayable without spending additional money. What I mean by this is your revives and heatlth potions are all bought with real money. You can’t heal or revive without spending money which is the biggest let down. If they remove all of these pay to play scenarios, or make the game F2P, then maybe I’ll try it again, but right now the game is just a money sink. I’m requesting a refund from Steam now."

Very grindy as well and this is coming from someone that has played and enjoyed the grindfest of korean games.On the plus side the graphics are good and it s a good  concept.Developers - Have f2p with in game store OR 30 - 50 for the game not both. Thats just greedy."

Hover above character as you engage bad guys in combat or roam area.... then get first person perspetive when you interact with NPC's. Although.. it says it works with the vive controllers, I'm having trouble knowing what buttons correspond to  abxy, etx.  Optimized for gamepad - which I'm about to use now.******CASH SHOP******yyyyeah.. they need to get rid of this cash shop crap. I just encountered that when getting my early access perks.  After paying $30+ for a game, the last thing I want to do is find out I am expected to continue spending money to enjoy all the game has to offer. EFF THAT!  I'm not trying to pay you and be your cash cow...    I'm changing my review to thumbs down because of that. It's not right."
,Not Recommended,624870,33391130,Posted: 8 July,all,SteveThurston,"I'v done my share of gaming, but I still class myself as a novice.This is only a few of my opinions on the game.The Graphics (VR) and game play is pretty dam cool.BUT, it takes more than that to be a good and popular game ppl will play for an extended time, and not just demo it and toss it.I think this game has potential (After a lot of fixes - which the devs appear to be doing)VERY overpriced atm.Includes free $90 worth of stuff??If thats $90 worth, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ if your going to play this game, make sure you have a 2nd job or have a gamedaddy with an open credit card...ATM I do not recommend this game, there are grinding games and there are GRINDING games, this is a GGRRIINNDDIINNGG game, without a lot of areas to choose from to grind.Without co-op/group it gets boring quickly.Some of the mats are set to hard to get.eg: Complete areas in a certain time to get a certain mat, with co-op (which I dont think is working atm) I guess is ok, but solo runs a big nope.There are a lot of basic things that need changing.like just refreshing mats (show different mats) cost gold, then you still have to buy them?? WTFLeveling is too slow, definately needs speeding up.IMO it looks like they are setting this game up so you have to spend money to get anywhere.If a game is setup to buy ingame items witth real money that you HAVE to have to get anywhere, the game should be free to play - so atm this game goes in my RIPOFF list.If I had under 2 hours on this game I would be getting a refund.I'll probably update this in the future once the devs have sorted a few things."
,Not Recommended,624870,33996364,Posted: 3 August,all,AkaliA,"If you don't own VR even though they claims VR is totally optional, don't bother as you'll be stuck with worst camera control possible. This game came out as isometric mobile game way back (it looked better than this I think) and it didn't do well so now it's here. I refunded right away after playing for not too long because of that reason. I do not think that this game really needs VR unless they make it first person or some sort. Don't let my 0 hours fool you. I did play this game when it launched and did not like it very much."
76561198240617852,Recommended,624870,33626549,Posted: 18 July,all,B.O.R.G.2,"So after reading lots and lots of reviews in the forums and watching videos I decided to purchase Preta and give it a shot for myself. The reviews to date have been more positive than negative but mixed none the less.Lots of people are comparing Preta to Diablo 3 and then throwing their toys out the pram when it turns out to be lower in comparison. Sure it takes a while to go through the tutorial and sure the crafting is very lengthy and at times can be frustrating due to the need to redo missions and not have random drops etc. However let me say that this game is fantastic!!!! and here is why.The amount of VR games from indie developers that are basic in quality and game play longevity is massive, however VR gamers lap it up in order to ""support"" the VR community all good and happy to see that. However the developers of this game have taken a very indepth gaming concept such as Diablo 3 and tried to make a VR/non VR game that appeals to the masses. Personally I think they have done a really good job.A VR game that has great graphics, really smooth gameplay, hardly any bugs at first early release launch, clear readable text on screen, focused skills progression, character progression and story line, multiple attacks. Due to the mining for materials the game play is extended as you have to repeat levels but it feels good doing it. This is by far one of the more indepth, exciting games to play.IS IT DIABLO 3 - NO and if you want that go and play it and be happy.IS IT WORTH BUYING - hell yes and you wont be disappointed if you buy it for something revolutionary and different that has the ability of shaping VR games to come.For all those people that say WHAT MAKES IT A VR GAME. Not every VR game has to be first person view. the level of immersion you get having the level all around you  with the sound etc is by for more immersive than playing diablo 3 on my 4k flat monitorIt makes me laugh that so many people will rush to go and buy Fallout 4 VR and Doom VR later in the year when they are simply VR demos of the larger game. Hell Doom VR is not even going to be the campaign of the original. Or people rush to buy Serious SAM and through money at them when they release a new game every week/month but then heavily shoot down developers such as these guys when they create Preta which in my mind can stand up against the best of them and I personally am looking forward to the updates and future releases.Thank you"

As I'm mixed between an awesome upcoming game and a grind fest you have to pay to reduce such.The overall game elements are great and I can't wait  see what more the devs add. it's still early and they have good potential ahead.I'm really hoping they change the direction of the IAP route. I want to see this game succeed but I can guarantee you if they go down the route it's on now they will fail hard. The community is just too small for this in general, you will be eaten alive.I think the base game is worth the 30 bucks and I overall enjoy the game. For this I give a thumbs up. If the direction of the IAP does not change to make it less of a grind fest to proceed. I'll have to change my review. Here us hoping in a month or less it still stays blue."
,Recommended,624870,33551952,Posted: 14 July,all,Youthfullion,"This is a fantastic start to a vr game. You have to like grinding though to like this game. It is still in the very early stages and the devs are fairly responsive in the discussion boards. A lot of other reviews are commenting on the cash shop pay to progress features. These features are being reworked July 20th, so that many of the items will be bought with in game currency instead of cash. There are currently 3 chapters with what looks like 6-7 planned, as well as the raids. This is by no means a short game. With the grinding and 3 classes your looking at well over 100 hours to do it all with what's in the game today. The combat is also enjoyable with an emphasis on kiting and dodge rolls. There is good enemy variation and although the environments are limited the devs find ways to keep you on your toes with enemy formations and group synergy. Based on the changes that are being made with respect to the cash shop and the price of other short vr ""experiences"" this is a good value. But again expect to do a lot of mission repeats and grinding. The end game content currently consists of difficult group raids, and armor set collecting. I'm excited to see where this game goes."

I've played a lot of VR games and would say it's a very safe bet to purchase this game.  The early access title may worry some people since games on Steam don't always get finished but for this price... It's worth it even as is.In the future - I do hope the development team will come up with a unique idea to keep the game from story mode, and perhaps even add dungeons / mazes and outdoor adventures.   A lot of the quests I have seen are around a 10 minute timer or less for completion, so it's gives you a break here and there to rest your eyes.   It would be nice to see additional random maps but once again this is a fairly new release.If I had to say anything bad about this game - for me it would be that it is story driven.   I like open world games where you can do what you want,  without having to follow anything particular.   That's me though...and a lot of people are driven by a story.  The level system also seems to be driven by the latest story mode quests also.If this turns into more of a diablo style game,  with it's own unique twist -  in VR it will Rock for ages, with a lot of replay'ability!!!I had a couple issues and they were resolved very fast by the development team.   There is nothing worse than playing a game that has no support.   From what I seen so far this is not the case here,  this team seems to be on top of things.Don't delay - grab your copy today!!!"
76561197970495283,Recommended,624870,33307096,Posted: 6 July,all,Knyght,"UPDATE: I'm over 26 hours of game time with this now and still enjoying it. I just unlocked Chapter 2. It took me that long to finish 15 missions from chapter 1, but there was a bit of grinding by replaying the old levels to gear up my weapons and armor. There are currently 3 chapters in the game with a total of 10 chapters once it's out of Early Access. I would have to say this is easily worth the $30 asking price considering the amount of game time it offers. Don't be put off by the cash shop. It's only there for people with deep pockets that want to level up faster or want to buy cosmetic items. You absolutely do not need to buy anything to complete the game.I have played this for a couple of hours and here are my early impressions.Positives:+ For an indie game the graphics are really good. It holds up well with other high profile games. It is pretty much how I imagine   and want an ARPG to look like in VR.+ Addicting gameplay. The RPG elements gives you a reason to keep playing longer to level up your hero and to upgrade your weapons and armor.+ I like the Cool finisher when an enemy is almost dead. that's similar to the God of War games on the Playstation 4.+ There are Treasure goblins that you can kill for loot like in Diablo 3.Negatives:- Movement running is too slow when in town. I wish there was a way to dash or run faster as everything is a bit spread out.- I Hate the insults from the NPCs (so many indie developers do this, and it makes the game feel like it's made for children). It's a cheap way to provoke emotions like excessive jump scares in horror movies and games. It breaks the story telling immersion in every game because I always roll my eyes thinking about how amateur these devs are.- You are asked to confirm every time you want to close the menu or back out of a shop/quest menu. It's very annoying and unnecessary.- The voice acting is not that great. It didn't seem so bad in the trailer but ingame there's just a lot of over acting.- This game is better played with a traditional controller. You can use the Vive and Touch controllers but it doesn't feel comfortable holding 2 controllers when you don't have virtual hands in a ARPG VR game.- I don't mind micro-transactions in games if they are for cosmetic items, but I hate when games are made purposely for you to grind so that you are encourage to buy items to progress faster.Overall I am enjoying this and would recommend playing it in VR because it feels so immersive. But as a 2D flat-screen game I would pass. As for the item shop I do not plan on paying for anything with real money, grinding be damned."
76561198289877342,Recommended,624870,34967929,Posted: 15 September,all,Knytron OMEGA,First and foremost it's a good game if you can bear with it the more you play it the better it gets. And as everyone else said it's definitely definitely grind heavy. With that being said at $10 you will get your money's-worth 5 x fold. If you in the mood for conventional gaming that vR enhances definitely get this game.

,Recommended,624870,33361149,Posted: 7 July,all,CallMeBeard,Alright so ive put in over 5 hours on this game and i do have to say i like it not bad kinda grindie but what isnt now a days. i do not play in VR as i do not own one and i do not see any reason why you would have to play this in vr other then the VR experience. the one thing i do wish they would change is the camera it doesnt flow around it jumps and that bugs probly better in vr but im getting used to it. all in all good game kinda pricey but i feel like this game can go placesso now im about 20 hours in and every1 says u have to pay to win no its just grindie like i said be4. yes i do agree that since the game is $30 there shouldnt be as much pay for things so hopefully they see that people really want to play this game and tone back on the pay for stuff.

I havent written many reviews yet but I wanted to let people know since i took a chance and bought it right when it came out. I cant speak for how long the game is, but it was really fun so far. was fighting some creatures, cool slow mo finishing moves then i turned into somekind of demon and kicked butt.cant wait to play more laterside note, wasnt sure if the motion was going to bother me i get motion sick reeeeallly easy. but so far it didnt get to me, they did a nice snap click on the camera rotation which helps a lotlooks like there are iap, i got a bunch of coins for buying the early access version"

A bit buggy at the moment but this may pass and hopefully it will become a masterpiece of its own. I'm used to the grind and expect a decent reward because of it. I don't expect to pay to win. Cosmetics yes; exclusive playable content..NO. The concept is solid and I hope to see more updates and enhancements in the future. Good job devs, keep it up!

I was initially going to try it out and most probably refund but I'm going to keep it.Felt like Diablo 3 VR!There is something really special about having a little action figure run around in atmospheric environments.So far I'm pleasantly suprised with how much I like this game!
76561197968804528,Recommended,624870,33335793,Posted: 7 July,all,Thoemse,"I bought this yesterday and played it for a about an hour. I did the first three combat quests before I had to hit the sack.One hour is no enough for a review but it is enough to know that this is a keeper!I plan to update this along the way.About the game:It is basically a diablo like hack and slash for VR. One would think VR is tacked on and there is no need for it. In reality this works very well though. It is very immersive and I like it a lot.I did not bother checking what engine they use but one thing is extremely positive: With super sampling at 1.6 (it's my goto setting I hardly ever change) the image is very crisp. There are not many VR games with so readable and clear fonts. You can see that they had VR in mind when making this.Not once did I think about the resolution being too low.I play it with an xbox controller wich seems to be the right device for this type of game.If you look for a hack and slash in VR this game is for you. It's not roomscale nor would it make sense to be. It is however good fun. I am not sure how much content there is considering it is early access. The starting content seems to be of good quality though.About combat: A button is the ""mash button"". You have however three more attacks that have to recharge (abilities). There is a berzerk mode that charges up over time too and you can dodge and block. Definatly no simple button masher. If you don't dodge you will die."

One thing I would change would be in the start getting through your inventory and such a bit quicker but game feels solid and very excited to try it with a friend. Add me or viewtwitch.tv/j3hanmaybe we can play!*Edit* A few people are talking about the cash shop, but there isn't anything pay to win its mostly costumes and companions. Sure you can buy a few things to help you get farther a bit quicker but thats over priced anyways as well as being able to cut your crafting cost so you don't have to farm and grind as much. This is finally a *long game* for the VR which we have not really had to many choices, not one of this kind anyways. Most peeps complaining probably havn't even made it out of the first act. Money wise its a bit steep but if the game is your style then you will get your moneys worth anyways."

I stopped playing games like this after Diablo 3 cause I got a vive and thought I would never want to sit down and use an Xbox controller again because I love seeing a gun in my hands and running around in fpv so much. I tried a few games in vr that used Xbox controller but  got bored quickly. I almost didn't try this game but gave it a shot and was amazed how good it looked in vr. I didn't think looking cool would even change my mind about not being in fpv but I was wrong. You feel more like your really in this world so you soon forget that you are in the third person view. Then when you get used to the controls and start kicking butt and feeling like a bad♥♥♥♥♥you just can't stop playing and wanting to advance your character and see more and more levels and enemies. Co op will be amazing I'm sure. As far as the in game purchases go,,,,, yes I'm not very happy about that.😟 if I have to put endless hours into it to avoid buying anything then that's what I will do but I refuse to shell out anymore money than the original purchase price.

,Recommended,624870,33354147,Posted: 7 July,all,Spoiler Alert,"Anymore, I've become EXTREMELY cautious when buying ANY new VR title from independent developers that go over $20. Many of them are not worth that price model and too many VR users are now giving thumbs up with bad reviews just to encourage support for the uptick of independent devs.I am glad I decided to try this one out, because it is a very nice game. Smooth graphics, decent gameplay, and it feels a lot like Diablo in many ways. Very cool. Character progression seems nice and the boss battles are fun. Assuming this game is going to get better as more support it, I am excited to see how it improves (minus a few glitches, it is very good now).Preta in its day one state, unlike MANY other VR titles, was ready for early access. I encourage you to try it. This developer ACTUALLY deserves the support... and I rarely say that.Thanks guys, good game.

I have contacted the developer several times and there has been no resolution to what has happened. I think if you are gonna sell a product to a consumer then stand behind your product.
