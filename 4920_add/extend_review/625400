,Not Recommended,625400,34461479,Posted: 24 August,all,Faudraline,"Here comes my first game from bch waves studio - infamous for simply ""selling"" steam achievements in placeholder ""games""... Gosh, and I thought that I've seen everything. Ehm... well, there is not much to say aboutSisters in hotelrather than it is an achievement spam program with incest undertone of a ""visual novel"". Notice that I'm putting the term VN here with sarcasm intended, 'cause there is no story here which could even remotely be referred as a visual novel.Apparently, our character was away for sometime for his studies and recently came back together with his family, family being five sisters. First thing that I thought was ""poor mother"". Forgive me, I know that's a first timer for me but I do not remember any of the names o' characters involved, even though I've just finished the game. Apparently, their parents passed away sometime ago, and since then being the eldest and the only male, our character was trying to provide for his sisters. They sold the family home and girls have been staying at a hotel indefinitely. We arrive at the hotel and pass 4 days with our sisters, 4 days full of suggestive encounters in which our chosen sisters will try to sexually harass us and we somehow manage to decline while having fantasies of our own. It all is a cheap pretext for p0rn if you ask me, and not the good kind either. This whole smut comes to an end with an unnecessarily dramatic display. We flee away, got beaten by unknown strangers and decide that family is important. What? How even... oh, whatever. You know what? This doesn't worth even thinking about it this long.Look, when it comes to evaluating games and arranging proper reviews, stating and comparing the pros and cons etc. I'm usually more creative and eloquent, but I have no idea what to say about this crapstorm. Either the original writing is really bad, or someone couldn't translate for their lives. The topic and the sexual innuendo concerning sisters are disgusting by themselves. CGs and sprites do not match at all. Background art may be declared decent, and that's about it. Oh, I was forgetting about the main purpose here: achievements. The game contains 7000 or so achievements that will pop up in a timely manner, without any actual ""achievement"" for which you'll be paying 2 dollars. It would be the complete waste of 2 proper dollars if you ask me though.Now... are we done? It seems so. That's about it. Enjoy or whatever... The completionist within me tries to idle for this ♥♥♥♥♥torm currently, and discussion forums tell that it would take 5 hours for all of them to pop... Somebody kill me please already...Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

I did not even find a way to put the game in windowed mode.Pros7k+ achievements unlocked slowly but automaticallyOkay music and background artConsWorst visual novel engine ever madeNo way to speed up or skip the textTerrible writing that has either been written or translated by someone who barely speaks EnglishRegular hang-upsOverused fade-to-black effects that last way too longInconsistent character artDistasteful setup (to say the least)VerdictThe only reason to buy this game, even at its bargain price, is if you care about your ranking on TrueSteamAchievements or a similar website that tracks how many achievements you won.Its only redeeming quality is that you do not actually have to suffer through the game to hunt the achievements: just bear with this sorry excuse for a visual novel long enough to see some achievements unlock and then leave the self-proclaimed game alone for a few hours."
,Not Recommended,625400,33044523,Posted: 30 June,all,𝕋ch.,"Avoid like the plague.Seriously this game is terrible- the story (if you can call it that) is one massive cringe fest and sometimes the poorly translated english turns into another language (or just jibberish, I can't decide) for a couple of clicks. The sprites don't match the CGs and it gets stuck every so often and you can't proceed any further with the 'story'.The achievements pop up every second until you hit around the 2420 mark and then they stop for half an hour-ish before continuing on- I've read it takes about 5 hours to get all achievements, tbh I'm not even sure this game is worth idling for 100% especially as you have to have the game window active in order for the achievements to ping. Maybe just chuck it on and go out for a bit?Do yourself a favour and spend the £0.47 on anything else but this!"

And stupid me was like: ""Holy Molly, I want that!"". I clicked the gamename and was taken to the store page. ""Oh man, gotta love steam sales, just 50 cents. Well I guess I can get that."" Without even looking at the reviews I went ahead and bought it. I didn't even imagine what I was in for.Well, after like 3 minutes in I noticed what a terrible mistake I have done. THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING TRASH. I started reading though the 'story' (if you can can it that) and notice that it was a pure cringefest. This game is bugged and really, REALLY poorly writen.Let's start with the bugs. Whenever you have to make a choice in this game there should pop up a window with the possible options. Well, 50% of the time it just doesn't. This forces the player to restart the game and lose progression. I also noticed how sometimes the text just changes to some kind of unreadable jiberish. There was also some kind of glitch where the characters stayed on the screen when they shouldn't. There were way more but this review would be WAY to long.Also, the person who wrote this was prob. using google translator to write this♥♥♥♥♥♥ The grammar was so ♥♥♥♥ing tragic that you have to focus really hard to figure out what was said a half of the time.In conclusion:The only thing this game is good for are the achievements, this may be the only logical reasoning why this game costs money. Otherwise I would expect that the devs would pay us money for playing this game.Short story time:My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. Don't buy this game, otherwise you might get cancer aswell."

Even if those are your own sisters, man. But the choices doesn't make much differences. In each of the 3 paths the naked sister pictures look almost the same.Ah, I forget to mention there are 7k achievements also in this game. Here it gets tricky:- achievements only popup every 2 sec on a click (mostly selection screen)- the achievement supplyment line always breaks many times for no reason- on 2.420 there is an in-game achievement idling wall with 0.5 hours of cooldown- achievements don't popup in background anyways (you are forced to play this game to get them all)So if you are interested in 5 hours of lame gameplay this shallow story over and over again just to wait that every achievement popup in the end this game is yours"

The only good features are the somewhat cute cards (that are also cheap) and lots of achievements.What features you can expect from this wonderful game..- The English is broken beyond belief and that makes this a jarring read. You understand the point that is being conveyed.. but that's not the point.- The transitional screens between dialogue can literally last seconds. It's just a black screen. You'll get a bit of text and then have to wait through black screens. I legitimately thought that perhaps the game was frozen because absolutely nothing was happening. I'm not sure if this is due to poor programming or because the game can't keep up with all the achievements it is giving simultaneously. I even tried to click on the black screen, thinking I had to click to continue... but nope. You just have to wait. It sucks.- They don't even bother with punctuation. Sometimes words are not capitlized, or there's no period at the end of a sentance. There are major spelling errors. The font is default Windows font. There's no color coating to tell each character apart. The lazy grammar in this game will drive you CRAZY.- This guy is a little TOO close with his sisters.. if you catch my drift. The theme of this VN is largely incest between a brother and his 5 younger sisters. This is not a case of bad translations coming off as incest... this is straight up intentinal incest. Everything from having a bath with your sisters, staring at them like a creep in their bathing suits at the pool, sleeping in bed with them (mostly naked) and having sex at a LoveHotel. Im sure there's more if I bothered to go through and make all the possible choices, but NOPE. That's just not going to happen. It's HILARIOUS to me at the end that they tried to convey ""family"" and that he has to ""protect and provide for them."" I just... what? The plus side is that this tripe is only about 30 minutes long... so you only have to subject yourself to this for a short period of time, IF you want to try and read it.- No gallery, no save feature, no options whatsoever (sound, etc), no skip or fast forward option. The characters feel very ""stock anime girl"". The backgrounds and other artwork are blurry and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking.

Yet, the name seemed very fitting when the game crashed the first time I tried to run it and that was the only text on screen.At no point, from what I'm guessing are stolen ""art"" assets, to a complete lack of understandng of the English langauge, to the meaningless choices, to the fact that the achievements aren't named properly and are earned by simply having the game open, to the fact that at the end of the story the game doesn't end; it just hangs on a black screen and achievements continue to be unlocked, was ANY effort put into making this product.And I loved every second.I haven't laughed so much in a while.I went into this expecting cheap hentai, what I got was a journey of discovery into just how weird and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a game can be.Just watching those achievements tick over, knowing that all my friends can check my account and see the over 900 achievements I suddenly earned in one hour, was such a joy. Just watching as achievement after achievement was earn in an endless drip feed was funny for a solid 5 minutes. The broken english and the hope of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s (which are absent) made me finish this piece of crap game.My one complaint is there no nudity. You kiss your sister at one point and there is a wardrobe malfuction in a pool, both of which are described rather then properly shown, but no sex. I'm not sure if the inclusion of really cheap nudity would make the game better or worse, but I feel like otherwise the Steam page is false advertising.11/10 IGN - Would have a bath with my low res Google Image sisters again."

This is very poorly written with many errors and one or two screens that aren't even in English. It feels as though the text was thrown into Google Translate, then put into the game without being checked. The anime is also a disappointment, as while the images are well drawn, when you are able to choose two sisters, two different sisters are shown from the ones you have chosen.The main selling point for this game seems to be the outrageous number of achievements on offer just for having the game running. The whole game can be played through in 10 or 15 minutes, so there's a lot of idle time needed to get the achievements. For me, that's just not enough incentive to recommend buying it."

No I'm not mad for giving it a thumbs up, have a read...So, like many people, I brought this game solely for the achievements and to see how bad this ""visual novel"" reeeeeally was. I must say, it holds up to the criticism almost 100%.- If not for the writing itself seeming like a 13yr old trying to write a fictional recount of a holiday they once had in their dreams with himself and his many sisters (whom I should add it seems he has an underlying desire for).- Or the constant change in character art from scene to scene as CGI and in game models differ vastly. I think being able to admit I am a ""lolicon"" is one thing, but when selecting options involving Nishi, the youngest of the 5 sisters, I was thoroughly surprised to see that the character who appeared anywhere from 9-11yrs old previously, was now bearing the body of an 18yr old female, clearly undergoing a massive breast enlargement in the time it took for the protagonist to stop undressing the girls in his mind and enter the bathroom. Not only this, but when making a second selection for Nishi whilst at the pools, one can only assume she wasn't a fan of the enlargement, sought out a reduction and lost 10yrs as once again, I am staring at a more anatomically correct and if I may say, more visually pleasing representation of the character and all her loli goodness... wait, where was I?- It's easy to bash on the story, what there is of it, with a relative run through time of less than 30 minutes, and a short 5 day time cycle, seldom containing filling or lasting content, it's easy to see the errors and flaws. The creator often going overly into detail for minute points or lesser important things. I thank you for describing the room, but I can clearly see what it looks like, I want to know more about the girls, please and thank you, your valued reader.So, end verdict?I highly recommend this game to anyone who is: bored, loves achievement hunting, is a lolicon and wants the one good screenshot of a loli, enjoys a good cringe (or 20...ish), or someone who just simply enjoys a visual novel.Having happily left my computer all night to farm achievements, all 7143 to be precise, I have never felt more pride staring at my profile achievement tracker and seeing just how stupidly high that number is now, and hey, while you're at it...
