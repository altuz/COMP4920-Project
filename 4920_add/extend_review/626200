To help us with such a big launch we’ve teamed up with the amazing crew at Maximum Games, who have come on board as publisher and will be helping us roll out the new and improved full version of the game. We’ll make a big announcement in the next couple of months, but until then expect things to remain pretty quiet around here.Anyone who purchased the game for PC on Early Access will receive a key for the full retail version of the game, as well as some extra in-game perks exclusive to our Early Access backers. Until that point, we have closed sales of Moving Hazard and will not be making any further updates to this version of the game.Launching as an Early Access title was always about including you into our process, getting your feedback, and making the absolute best game we could for a community we love. We want everyone who played Moving Hazard and interacted with the team to know that we are incredibly grateful for all of your help in developing this game. We can’t wait to show you the final game, which has a ton of huge updates, improvements, new content, and even a new name. Stay tuned for more!There is less 1 gb of new content (just one map), nor did the players that bought the orignal game did not get the full game as promised nor did they get specail perks or skins, and after 1 and half years of extra devlopment time all they have is a map to show for it and that map is mainly created out of assets of another map and on top of it most of the bugs from moving hazard still exist on the shiitty rebrand dead allaince. Their is also a staggeringly less amount of zombies on the map then its early access game moving hazard and you only loose xp in private matches. THIS IS A SHAMELESS REBRAND, THEIR TRYING TO FOUL YOU INTO BUYING A UNFINISHED PRODUCT!9/9/2017 finally received the free dlc"

Illfonic learnt the artof the kickstarter scam. They used their new found skill in con-artistry to set-up the Friday the 13th Ponzi scheme.After hoodwinking their loyal backers (suckers) they released a half finished buggy glitch filled beta. Then soon after they started siphoning away the money and resources to  make this generic zombie shooter instead of finishing Friday the 13th.This ""game"" is another unfinished beta. It crashes constantly, the graphics are bad even by PS2 standards, No variety in weapons or maps and the hit detection is absolutely awful.The Zombies get in the way more than anything else. And you never get more than ten glitchy zombies on-screen at any one time.This beta is essentially a cheap imitation of call of duty zombies grief mode. (A mode everyone hated)Avoid this asset flip at all costs....EDIT:Illfonic are also the ""devs"" behind the dumpster fire that was Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric.One of the most hated games in history."

,Not Recommended,626200,34600314,Posted: 30 August,all,[DHG] Messorem,"I bought moving hazard last year and I thought it was a pretty cool concept, now they changed the name of the game and added a single player mode for which you need to pay 19.99 on top of the 24.99 for the base game unless you get the 39.99 bundle. The game is fun but not worth the price definitely not if they make you pay extra for the single player mode. I would suggest getting it on a sale. The graphics are pretty good, the controls feel a little clunky at times, and the zombies tend to glitch into things like buses or they start rubber banding and don't get anywhere. The game needs more work I don't understand why they released it the way it is or why they decided to give this game the price tag they gave it. I won't recommend this game the way it is but if we get lucky and they fix it (which I doubt will happen considering the way they abandonned it when it was called moving hazard) then I might change my mind."

,Not Recommended,626200,34655297,Posted: 1 September,all,Flippy,"Not only does it keep crashing, but the look of this game is honestly so bad.Buggy animations for both the zombies and the weapons, it's not even worth it. Clearly just a quick cash in on the Zombie VS player VS player title range.Disappointing."

At least DigitalHomicicde took pride in their work (for some unknown reason)Could you say the same thing about the stumblebums over at Illfonic?And the Romine brothers had a serious work ethic. Those guys relesead 13 gamesin 2016! That is an impressive feat. Meanwhile the Tomato cans over at Illfonicwait months and months and months and months just to release a patch that fixesmajor game breaking bugs. That's if they even bother to fix it at all.Dead Alliance is for all intents and purposes a high budget version ofThe Slaughtering Grounds.This is Illfonics first game lolhttps://youtu.be/cJD1eTam7RAIllfonic then went on to ""work on"" Star Marine as part of Star Citizen.These geniuses built the assets to the wrong scale and in the wrong engine!!LOLThis offcourse got them fired in humiliating fashion by Cloud Imperium Games.LOL AGAINIllfonic then ""borrowed"" the Star Citizen Business model (A ponzi scheme)And used the ""loot"" to make Friday the 13th which is a terribly broken game.They have released a couple of patches for this game, which have only madethe game MORE broken.TRIPLE LOLhttps://youtu.be/d3-8_RdNLQwThen they abandoned Friday the 13th to release Dead Alliance....I think this video below accurately describes illfonics attitude towards making""games""https://youtu.be/xhaPvmqqIS0"

,Not Recommended,626200,34928321,Posted: 13 September,all,Puppy,"My ThoughtsWhat is this game? I mean this was shipped out for 40 bucks? This game plays and feels like a crappy bootleg Call Of Duty clone, it's gunplay feels like just another shooter nothing special about it, than you have the crappy animations and the terrible balancing system! It's terrible, I mean they had to remarket the damn thing and it's just the same thing but with a single-player mode!GameplayThe gameplay feels not natural and it doesn't help that the hit detection is garbage -/-The only big difference and potential this game has is the zombies and how the become weaponized +/+There is not a whole lot of content in the game you have multiplayer, single player horde mode and bots, not worth the retail price -/-+ 15 PointsGraphics, Audio, and PortGame looks like a glorious mess, in a good way, the graphics are surprisingly well textured and clean, good job +/+The optimization is not where it should be and it doesn't help that the gameplay is in bad condition, I get 44 FPS on high with a GTX 970 and AMD FX-8350, this is not good. -/-The game has alright audio, it at least sounds decent +/-+ 15 PointsMarketing and PricesGame at least gives you the option to experience less♥♥♥♥♥♥with a reduced price between Multiplayer and the Full Game Upgrade (Adds single player ops, horde) +/-At Least had the niceness in there hearts to give the full game to the people who buyed Moving Hazard, Thanks I guess +/+The retail price is a joke, maybe just maybe buy on a sale with some of the new updates maybe it will be worth more than what it is right now. -/-+ 15 pointsThe game earned 45 points it's a little below above average. Maybe I am giving the game a little too much credit (I am) the game at least has some potential to be an original shooter with the zombie mechanic, but it's not there yet. Not by a long shot."

These are all valid issues and fair enough, but to the people saying, enraged zombies are overpowered, stop. The zombies need to be powerful or you might as well just go play cod. To the people saying you cant sprint and strafe at the same time, of course you cant, that would be op and is in no good games. To people saying you cant run fast, I see plenty of people in light classes bomb past me so fast I cant even ADS on them. Please moan about valid issues, there are plenty to choose from including spawns to name but one, but please stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing about stupid stuff because you are bad at the game."
