Choices come few and far between, and almost exclusively affect only ""who will I end up with"" and, later, ""will I continue on the path to end up with them."" To add insult to injury, there are times when an important choice feels imminent, but the player character just does their own thing... and to add an extra insult, ""their own thing"" often seemed completely illogical. For a price notably higher than many other visual novels, the depth and frequency of choices is severely lacking."

76561198027817952,Recommended,627820,31629382,Posted: 8 May,all,pysali,"So I'm going to be upfront about this. I really like the developer Hanako Games and have been buying their stuff pretty much day one for years. This isn't actually a 'proper' hanako game it's part of the sub brand so the set up, characters and personalities aren't what I'd normally expect because they weren't developed by Hanako's devs. All that written though I have a natural bias towards enjoying the developers style and writing so I'm sure I took some plot twists and character developments with a more mellow acceptance then if it wasn't one of my favorite game authors.Don't look at this review that way, no one can possibly tell me they don't have favorite devs that actually get them to in real life demand they take their money right then and there as soon as they hear about a new project. We all have it, we all do it and it's okay. I just want to be upfront that yes, I am a fan, ergo I fan it up sometimes.Anyway...So I expected it to be a mixed bag and it was. Not in a bad way, but the characters were definitely running along a broad spectrum of personalities from so mind numbingly sweet I thought I was going to lose a tooth to so...awful, completely awful human beings that it was actually an interesting experience. I'm a total achievement chaser too so I'll freely admit to pushing my way through the two truly crap peoples routes and they were still mostly satisfying, but absolutely in a rubber necking a car accident as a bystander kind of way and not in a romantic way.As a quick aside here for fellow achievement hunters the two hardest to get are wrapped up in the two absolutely worst ♥♥♥♥wits you can 'romance' in the game. I tried to spoiler tag rant, failed at it and removed that part. Edited for editing fails.Otherwise honestly all other routes are really up to personal preference. No one is just any one stereotype, even if they're all larger than life. I was lucky and got my three favorite characters in a row by simply making gut choices with the PC of the run through, then one of the awful ones, then two I didn't personally care for, then I pushed my way through the other awful one and now I'm on the final routes (some romantic choices are shared between the male and female player characters where as most are exclusive to one or the other) which are looking to evenly split between faves and mehs so I can drown out the bad taste with adorableness again.If you have other games from the dev and you like their work, I recommend it. It might not be a 'proper' Hanako game by being developed from the ground up by them, but you can get their style throughout the scenarios. If you have other games by the dev, but aren't too sure about the sub studio brand, but can get a good deal on the full catalog discount then I definitely recommend it. If you don't mind it when there isn't always a happy ending (this is the Long Live the Queen dev here) and you enjoy visual novels that are more about reading with some interactive choices I think you'll enjoy it. Otherwise if you want a more pleasant or... okay look some of the characters are jerks. If you don't want to read about jerks being jerks, but you like the dev/art/style/set up or whatever maybe wait for a bigger discount?Overall I give it a positive recommendation. I didn't like everyone, but anything that gets me that angry at fictional characters or wanting to just stop and reread all my favorite parts of my favorites because they're made of that much adorable gets a thumbs up from me."

The game lacks any meaningful choices beyond ""Yes, let's hook up"" and ""Nah, I'd rather not"". Given that the visual novel advertises itself as a romantic comedy, I can't fault them too badly for that, but the truly disappointing aspect of this game was the length. There were days, sometimes over a week, of in-game time simply being skipped without anything happening. Once the game finally decides that hey, maybe it should finally get back to the story, it drops you right into the middle of scenes without any context of what's happened over the skipped time or how we even got into the current situation. I ended up feeling more disoriented than satisfied. Pair that up with a lot of unanswered questions over the love interests (even the one you might be pursuing) and some unresolved plot points, and you're left with a feeling of disappointment and wondering if you might be able to get a refund.TL;DR: Fun for one playthrough (kinda), but super short. Not recommended."

But if you want to get all the achievements and don't want to sit through two abusive relationships (the rest are all fine!), then keep walking.While there were some lacking romanceable options, it wasn't because you could befriend them and then just hit a 'straight' wall. It was realistic in the sense that: they just didn't have enough time to hang out (for example: MMC and Angelo can't date because they only have one interaction, they're schedules don't line up), so we have no idea if that character was bi-curious in the least.PROS:Great characters. Everyone was a whole character with their own troubles and issues, interests, and distinct personalities (and some rather extreme reactions to getting into a relationship with you)Interesting relationships. You never get the full story on the thing syou eavesdrop between characters, and it helps build an interesting relationship between the other patrons of the hostel. It's more than just you and your love interest (or no interest)CONS:Not enough choices. In a lot of ways it felt like there wasn't a lot of gameplay and that was kind of lame; there were plenty of places where a choice would have been fantastic to have.Choice-only gameplay. Since there was school and a job I was sort of hoping that there would be more mechanics - study that day, exercise this day, etc. etc.Abusive Relationships. I'm actually torn on whether or not I liked the fact that they were in there. I personally didn't enjoy them, but I liked the fact that they were portrayed in an awful and unredeemable way. HOWEVER, since I was going for all the achievements I waded my way through them and just hated it.Jerks just to be jerks:  mean, yes some people are just rude and just use everyone around them. By the end of a few routes they get a little more tolerable but they're pretty obnoxious."
,Recommended,627820,31595069,Posted: 6 May,all,Loogs xoxo,"Decent but short VN, has some charming scenes but is a mixed bag overall. It's not always clear which choices lead to which events, I've never once been able to befriend my rival, and the protagonist's personality ranges from largely self-aware to really really really dense.Don't be expecting Steins;Gate levels of quality, but for what it is I had fun with it. I've cleared three routes at the time of writing (two as male MC, one as female) and out of those Danny's was the best written, though it got kinda questionable at times. Brendan's made me want to punch a wall. That guy is like a minefield."

76561198039084983,Recommended,627820,31608226,Posted: 7 May,all,cynfael,"This is actually a nice little gem.  Fun, surprisingly thoughtful at times, and sexy (more suggestive than explicit).Kudos for featuring a fairly broad cast in regards to personality, body types, and even neurodiversity.  The female characters are physically the most distinct from each other, while the men are all varying degrees of slim and fit, but there are still plenty of differences.As far as I can tell, the game seems to consider your character to be canonically bisexual; you get to choose whom to date, but your character's inner monologue will recognize the appeal of the other cast members (especially the women) regardless of their gender.  Personally I think this was a good design choice that helps avert jarring Suddenly Sexuality situations when you decide to pursue a same-sex romance, and I think it fits the protagonist well.I'm enjoying it, especially for the price.  Recommended if you enjoy this genre."

I liked the individual stories for Danny and Mark.Only complaints I have are I wish there were more CGs, and I wish there were more choices. Definitely did not feel like a game, was a visual novel (I know it IS a visual novel, but I would've liked it to be more of a game). Would have been nice to feel more like I had control over my character."

Her reaction was a classic and I felt so damn good teaching her a lesson. Just wish you had the chance to do this to Brendan as the female, I would have loved to teach that jerk a nice little lesson. Don't like how pathetic the girl gets when she is in denial about him not giving a damn about her after he got into her pants. Don't really blame him for been real jerky about it later when sleeping with the gold digger, the girl was being rather creepy. She should have just been whatever and gone for someone better, like really. Then she is all jaded bout relationshps once she gets home. It's really quite pathetic. My favourite relationship was definately Danny's route, male or female it didn't matter, he was a great character, really well put together, one of the best I've seen in visual novel games and I've played a lot of those. I replayed his route a few times, though I leant more towards the M/M relationships, just wish people would have more of those in games, rather then overkilling with F/F relationships. I loved how you had so many options, people to choose from, they were all pretty decent and unique characters, but Danny was still the best. c:"

I actually loved it alot, no strong qualms, which is weird because I'm super stupid picky about my otomes man.I think most people can agree that western otomes have almost always had quality writing, but have always looked ugly as hell compared to Japanese otomes. THIS GAME THOUGH! No long am I looking at strange proportioned men, but handsome boys like Mark who's hair I REALLY wish I had.If I could put some ok hand emojis here I would, but I don't know if steam allows that, and I'm too lazy to go, and copy paste any here. Point is, good game.It's definitely a little reptitive at times, i click the skip ahead button though, and I'm shooting through the game with ease which is VERY GOOD cause oh boy if I had to spend 10 minutes pressing skip ahead to get my romance on I'd be whining about that for an hour, and maybe saying its not worth it (but mark is so worth it, c'mon, if ur gonna play for anyone play for Mark.)An otome out rn that I think has some similarities to this game (meaning they'll prob attract near the same audience) would be Dream Daddy, except the main character in this game is more bubbly, and shy than the dream daddy mc. When the male characters cheeks rosey up everytime he smiles.... I think I've found peace"

I really disliked the male PC, especially in Aasi's route but just really overall. Female PC was definitely a sronger character. The way the main drama plays out at the end was frustrating - I know it's for the ease of storytelling, but I didn't like how quickly everything was forgiven and forgotten.Pros:* decent art* choice of male or female PC* diverse range of characters* sometimes things just don't work outCons:* very short and linear (I've gotten 13/16 achievements in 4 hours)* One CG per route, so artwork gets a bit repetitive"
76561198255565602,Not Recommended,627820,33422105,Posted: 9 July,all,sex_economics,"Yo, this game is straight up awful. The art is passable, the music is a really poor choice, and the writing is the worst. All the characters suffer from how awful, inconsistent, choppy, and heavily cliched the writing is. It seems like they tried to make characters with ""real life flaws"" like being horribly sexist!  But, even if this was something to be tackled in a dating sim, which i don't really think it is, they do it very poorly. Your character can speak out, but it's always weakly and it doesnt have any satisfying impact. Everyone is unlikeable save for maybe two people. They handle the romances very poorly.  Honestly i've only played one route but I don't feel like i need to see any more because unless they did a complete 180 on their writing quality in any of the others, its not worth it. The conflict they do introduce is handled incredibly poorly. There's barely any choice, none of it feels meaningful, the relationships don't feel organic at all, which is honestly one of the most important parts of a game based on relationships. It's bad. It's really really bad. It's frustratingly bad because I normally really enjoy Hanako games, but this one was such a drop in quality. There are free games with better writing than this. Honestly, don't spend a dime, it's not worth it. Not even on sale.also tbh, the only reason my playtime is so high is because it couldnt keep my interest and i kept my window open while i did other things. idiot move on my part because now i can't return it."

Could use more art but I wasn't dissapointed at the end. Glad not everything always works out perfectly and people with flaws don't magically change once they're in a happy relationship.Only problem is it tries to make a couple characters that are absolute garbage human beings sympathetic.Small complaint tho...and maybe some people actually will sympathize.

I was expecting more of a RPG element in the game, especially since when you're being introduced the character, ""Danny"" literally tells you that it's up to you whether you're going to go partying, study, work, etc. That turns out not to be the case, as you instead basically go through and decide who you want to ge together with in arbirtrary interactions throughout the entire semester. I lost interest fairly early, and have to say I'm disappointed."

Still, by what I have seen so far, England Exchange has not too much more than what you can expect from a vn in terms of plot: I mean, nothing more than routine happenings and choices that go toward one - not two or three - nonchooseable climax, and many distinct texts ending on the same background image. I believe that there could be a vn entirely out this format, but not sure though.Anyway, you can choose you protagonist gender and have same-sex romances (which seems to be quite rare in vns available from steam). Also, the art is professional, polished and clearly not amateur stuff. Last but not least, some characters start getting really adorable as they talk to you within the advance of story. For sure and for that reason some endings made me feel like they deserved a continuation. I'm waiting new contents or better, a part two ;)"

The story is boring, the content is lame, the dialogues are flat and uninspired, the characters are predictable stereotypes, the few (!) choices you actually have to influence the story are plain stupid, and the visual quality is worse than your averge Adobe Flash social game from the 90s.

Well, some ""storylines"" with certain people require a lot of tolerance on your part to still end up with that person in the end. Also, some characters are really stupidly written and do/say things that are way out of character at a certain point.Since I don't wanna spoil anything my advice, if I've made you curious now, is to either get the game (on sale) or watch a couple of playthroughs and you know what I mean.Point-by-point:+ nice grapics+ interesting backstories to most of the characters- can't modify your characters appearance- stupid (and so far unavoidable) plot twist during the last part- some characters react really stupid to certain things+ characters annoy you (plus, because its very much like real life)~ can't ""romance"" everyone (neither plus, nor minus, just an fyi)- not really many choices+ good skipping option when replaying (only skip already shown replies/text and automatically stop for new one)~ nudity patch (it's fun for a while, then it gets weird, so it's a good thing you can easily turn it on and off within the game)tldr:It's entertaining for a while, but don't expect to really get to choose that much. If you wanna try it, get it during a sale. 14.99€ is overpriced, ~10€ seems fair, when you compare other games here on steam at the same price point."
