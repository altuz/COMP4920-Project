,Not Recommended,628490,32585536,Posted: 20 June,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Well, here you have it folks; the achievement apocalypse, the end of the achievement world, the death of achievements and hunters alike. Although the developer says that Zen vs Zombie (Achievement Hunter) is a ""real game"" and meant for more than just mediocre, grotesque farming of meaningless internet points, it's obvious what the true intended purpose of this game is. It even boasts in the Steam store image, where the word ""achievment"" is misspelled by the way, ""10000 achievment"".You may be asking yourself, how do you unlock these achievements exactly? Simple! Just open the game and let it sit there. Nevermind playing the 5 subpar levels that look and function like a Newgrounds Flash-styled game that would be Blammed immediately, there's nothing related to doing that because that would make sense. Zen vs Zombie itself is a generic, run-of-the-mill 2D sidescrolling shooter where you have unlimited ammo and a useless health bar. Why is it useless? Well, because even if you run out of health, you just restart from a checkpoint or the beginning of the level and none of your progress is deleted. So you just run to the right, collect useless coins, shoot useless zombies with useless infinite ammo, while unlocking 10,361 useless achievements.If you're thinking about buying Zen vs Zombie (Achievement Hunter) to unlock achievements and then refund, think again. It's going to take well over 2 hours to unlock all of them, since roughly 3,000 unlock per hour. The game itself lasts about 10-15 minutes, depending on your luck with the last level. Did I mention it also doesn't have a rebind option for the controls? For some reason, the developer thought it was a good idea to have a combination of WSAD to move and R to shoot; given that you're mostly running to the right all the time, it makes as much sense as the Chewbacca defense.Rating:0.5/5.0- Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

,Not Recommended,628490,32946148,Posted: 28 June,all,The Daneyoable,"Achievment means you need to achieve it. All you do is sit in the title screen and wait for the achievments. I like a game where you have to put in work so you can achieve those achievments. If you actually like some type of challenge, don't get this game."
,Not Recommended,628490,33396331,Posted: 9 July,all,Dr. Goober 🥜,"To start off, just looking at the negative reviews with3+hours on themreally helps. Yeah, congrats to you guys receiving about more than 5000 achievements, AND THEN calling out the game for being bad.Really f*cking hypocritical in my opinion.I played this game just to see what this bullsh*t is suppose to be. As a result, I honestly feel very dirty about it. AS SOON as it launch, achievements are already spamming away. The game itself had potentials of being a neat platform shooting game. The art is cool and all, but just having a ton of odd looking achievements spam on the right side of your screen is terrible. This is ruins the actual meaning ofAchievement Hunting. I can't even look at my achievements again without knowing how much of a joke some of them are. (call me out all you want for complaining, but quit being f*cking lazy and play a legit game).Seriously folks, don't buy this sh*t JUST for achievements. Try to at least play some other cool games to earn them."

,Not Recommended,628490,32588208,Posted: 20 June,all,XJ9,"Unity. Dev doesn't even know how achievement spelled.1st of all I have to mention that you receive 10300 achievements for EVERY single second the game was opened SO, 171 minutes,  2.85 hours. You need to keep the game open for 3 hours, to obtain 10k achievements and that's it.By the way, there is another pооp from the same people, with 5000 achievements on board -http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/recommended/646450/What about achievements related to the actual game? Nah, there are only 6 (SIX! ) levels, 1 minute to 5 minutes long each, you can start from ANY level at any point of time.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=951049243http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=951056239-Horrible controls - 1st of all when you go into the game you try to figure how to shoot, the in-game menu says it's I or L or whatever, it doesn't work and mouse doesn't work as well. To shoot you actually have to press E, you can figure this if you go into the Unity settings, not in-game one, and you also see there 55 other buttons, like dash, booster pack etc. Some of those controls work at different levels (for example dash button works on the later levels.)-Rеtаrded gameplay - when you start shooting it's a nonstop beam and you can simply hold the button all the time. Zombie models are from cowboy zombies etc. Platforming part is super easy, but if you die you revived full HP right away.+Low price+CardsDo you want easy 10000 achievements? Buy it. Achievements hungry people are the one responsible for those abominations popping up on Steam left and right."
,Not Recommended,628490,33252210,Posted: 4 July,all,Blade,"Another extremely bad game by these developers. There's nothing of value in the game itself. Unlimited lives, character placement on screen while moving is terrible, and level design is pretty bad--though it seems some planning went into these 10 levels, unlike the other god-awful games in the bundle. I'm actually surprised they added a duck animation and the ability to jump, that's how bad these games are.The only draw here is the 10,000+ achievements. All you have to do is get on a box in the first level (they don't explain the controls, you have to look in the escape menu--that's an I and not a 1, by they way) and stand there. Stopped popping for me at 95xx, however.These people need to stop making games."
,Not Recommended,628490,32606653,Posted: 20 June,all,mio,"This game is a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ plain and simple. You shoot zombies that don't do anything but walk (a few of them do run. Exciting!) with your infinite ammo gun and platform around a few rockets and saws that just push you into spike pits, and then you respawn and do it again. The game has 10 levels and if you beat the last one you get stuck on a loading screen because the game has no actual end. That's it.But I'm gonna play devil's advocate here because if you're looking at this or have bought it you know exactly what you're getting, the devs know exactly what they're doing, and how this got onto steam is no surprise at all really. if you wanted achievements, you got them, and that's what you're paying for and care about and you likely won't even play the game because it gives them all to you automatically anyway. At best, it does a great job at highlighting how mundane the achievement counter is if you disregard how much effort someone actually puts into getting them. It's not really any different than all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games people buy and breeze through just to get that extra 100% (some people buy Nekopara just to hold shift and finish it in 5 mins, put it that way) but on a much bigger level. If you do this, you're getting exactly what you want, the only problem here is you're watering down that achievement number completely. It also must have taken the devs a good bit of time making all those cheevs (making 10,000 individual, slightly different icons is still quite a task) so uh they did something I guess.I'm still gonna give this a negative review because it completely deserves it as a game, but if you just want achievements and have no shame about how you get them, this is what the whole game is."
