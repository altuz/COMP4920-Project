,Recommended,628750,32224658,Posted: 6 June,all,BluePaw,"Now this was more of a challenge than aMaze 1. The mazes were very elaborated that it may hurt your eyes, or your eyes may play tricks on you. As the last game, just arrow keys to move however you would have to deal with angled paths than straight, which will be an annoyance itself. Took me close an hour to beat, and found myself lost and in deadends more times than aMaze 1.The music is a bit better that it somehow loops smoothly without even noticing.Is another one-off game, but challenging nonetheless.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish."

I bought this on impulse, cos I was reminded of that toy. aMaze 2 has more than one maze to solve, so that's an immediate plus right there, but don't have high expectations for a game that costs 1 euro. The menu and the look of the game is very modest and that's fine, but a single piano tune on repeat will make you turn off the sound in the menu. There are 20 puzzles per 3 different types of mazes and I enjoyed the circle mazes the most, but you'll plow through 60 puzzles in about 2 hours. The second to last maze was the only one that frustrated me, but it's a nice and short game if you like a distraction and achievements, most of which are pointless, but there you go. I noticed there's a 3D sequel as well, I might try that one as well."
,Not Recommended,628750,33628726,Posted: 18 July,all,Zetnus,"TLDR:I can only recommend this game to maze fanatics (like me); or to achievement farmers or trading card farmers.  For anyone else, it just handles too poorly to be enjoyable.Pros:+++Reasonably complex maze design.  You actually have to think to find the way through and the solutions are nice and varied.++Dirt cheap game+Relaxing music (but… --music is repetitive)+(Trading cards + easy achievements) – I suppose this is why most people buy it, but personally I think the game itself needs to be worth it, not the cardsCons:---Handles like crap.  What I mean is that as the maze gets larger and the ball gets smaller, it still moves the same distance with each key-press.  This makes it extremely frustrating to actually move where you want to go--Music is repetitive.  The track itself is nice, but it is far too short, so you find yourself hearing it again and again and again.  Needs a longer track or more tracks-The game is designed to produce trading cards so the developer can make money off people selling them on the community market.  In principle I'm not opposed to this, but the problem is that the developer has not put enough time into actually polishing up the game in such a way that makes it enjoyable to playVerdict:If you enjoy mazes, then the low price means that you can get 1-2 hours of enjoyment out of it.  Otherwise don't bother getting this game.If the game recieves an update that improves the controls, I would be willing to amend this review."

,Recommended,628750,34429944,Posted: 22 August,all,Ravenquick,This sequel steps things up.  Instead of sticking with square based puzzles they go with puzzles that are of different shapes and unlike the original game some of these puzzles do give you a run for the money.  The music is better but like the original game it's the same tune for each maze.  I prefer this over the original since it does improve upon the weaknesses in the orginal.  If you are new to maze puzzles I suggest starting with the original before getting this one.

I can't find anything bad to say about this game.The menu is simple, you can quit the game by just pressing ESC on the menu, it shuts down and starts up fast and the song playing on the background is okay.Bought it for 50 cents and it's surprisingly good for such a cheap game. It has 3 types of mazes which each have 20 levels (so that's 60 levels in total). The maze types are circle, delta and hexagon. Even though the game can be completed in under an hour including getting all the achievements. But for the price tag it has, the game is great!"
,Recommended,628750,33766930,Posted: 24 July,all,MÄKER,Pros : For less than dollar you get a decent maze game with decent soundtrack.Cons: Controlls are sligthly oversensitive but that's minor thing and won't spoil your enjoyment from this game.Recomended.

You have only 2 options - Mute and change keys. It's kinda compensated by the fact that game, by itself, doesn't require much of them.Lack of control over the ball. I guess it's not that hard to implement mouse control over the ball and would be really usefull.Once again, the ball, the most important aspect of the game lacks control, it's to fast, sometimes I waste time trying to aim the ball between the walls.I don't know if developer planed it to be like that or not, but the color scheme is ""toxic"", my eyes hurt looking at it.In general, you get what you pay, not bad if you're in mood to solve some mazes.5/10"
76561198263628036,Recommended,628750,31386264,Posted: 26 April,all,Boxed,"This was slightly better than the first one, I'd say this was ""above average"", since what matters most are the mazes and the feelings of ""I can't believe I went through the whole maze and missed it right there.""There are two types of mazes depending on the way to complete them: Straight and roundabout. Most of the mazes have you going in a roundabout way, but there are occasional ones where you can go straight towards the goal. And the differing maze formations and patterns adds a lot of variety that also tricks the eye. This is certainly better than the monotonous gameplay from the first game. This was enjoyable as you get lost and miss small paths that would lead to the goal if you didn't pay attention (unless you traced the path starting from the goal). This is the type of feeling that I was looking for, where I seriously followed a dead end that I thought was the right one for minutes and finally realize that the developer should burn in the deep fiery pits of Pastafarian hell drinking warm beer while getting serviced by that male Kim Kardashian wannabe. This game was a huge improvement game-wise from the last one though. +1Features:+Music - Has an approximately two-minute long track that is looped, but it has a soft tone and is much more bearable to listen to through the whole game. I used to play piano before, so I enjoyed this piece quite a bit.-Ball controls - It's really fast and more wild and paired with the music, makes you feel like yougotta go fast, and it's easy to move through the mazes. BUT, it's also easy to get caught in those little corners in the Delta and Hexagonal levels. Interesting layouts and it's also annoying to have to tippity-tap to get into a small crevice quite so often every single level.-Color changes between levels - Color changes are a bit better, but it can be even subtler so eyes don't have to adjust so much.-Lack of settings - Still no settings, customizables, unlockables, sensitivity changes, key shortcuts (except 'Esc'), etc. Only music can be turned off and on.-Bug - I was somehow able to skip past a level. Not a big one, but I'm a*tistic (artistic) on getting these easy achievements.-And I don't think I've given you enough♥♥♥♥♥♥yet—that studio logo looks choppy and old, period. Is that a lawn mower or blender?"

Fun time waster, but controls are real touchy and there is no timer (which I would like)Bought it for 49 cents, get about 12 cents of trading cards, so about 37 cents for the entire game.

,Recommended,628750,34215045,Posted: 13 August,all,MeLcator aka Thunder Wing,"Not too bad, a nice simple maze game.This game would be great...if it wasn't for movement issues.Movement with keyboard is very awkward to go around circles and on angles and that's what every move you will make will   be. This game would benefit greatly from controller support, as all of the movement issues would be fixed by using a joystick.All in all, I do recommend this game, just keep the movement issues in mind or else you may get frustrated."

I'll recommend it to other players who's looking for an easy peasy game!When it becomes more difficult and bigger, the controls work less. It's harder to control the ball then. Manageble but harder."

76561197971341065,Recommended,628750,31384195,Posted: 26 April,all,sfnhltb,"Another maze game in the same vein as it's predecessor it is much improved, much more challenging and fun, but also still frustrating and flawed at times as well. Playtime is probably about 1-2 hours, with little replayability.The much larger size of mazes allows them to actually be quite demanding to find the correct route, requiring you to trace through multiple branches quite deeply several times to find the right way, so that aspect of the game is hugely improved. We also don't suffer from any backgrounds quite as bad as the previous outing, while some aren't ideal to be looking at for so long, most are fine.However while the issue of the ball dragging along walls and slowing has gone, in its place we have a ball that travels way too fast for fine control - it is probably necessary given the larger size of mazes, but means you continually overrun the exit you want (unless there is a convenient wall in the way), and every key press moves you about three times the width of a path, making certain paths very hard to get into - some took me 8 or 9 attempts to get in the right one, particularly where you have three routes and you want the middle one. I tended to find the correct route entire in my head/using my finger, and only once done start moving the ball, to minimize the amount of moving about needed.Overall a pretty good set of mazes that were fun to find the solutions, and I would recommend it but with the caveat how much you like playing will depend heavily on your tolerance for the issues with movement."

76561198053422627,Not Recommended,628750,31342639,Posted: 24 April,all,Zaxtor99 ® YouTube,"If you enjoy mazes, then this game isn't bad for the price and some of the later mazes can be pretty tricky.  It took me just about two hours to beat all 60 mazes in the game.  However, be aware that this game is not without its faults.My entire play through of this game, defeating all 60 mazes in just over two hours, and even me writing this review is all in this livestream video on my youtube channel:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vybntqhTIaQMy main complaint is the controls, and having no ability to slow down your ball movement or change the controls from the arrow keys.  The ball moves too quickly especially in the more detailed mazes and getting the ball positioned correctly can be tricky and quite frustrating at times.Gripe #2 is that there is no timer on the screen 'nor is there even a indicator of what level you're on, and if you go back to the main menu to see what level you are on, sometimes the game will lose progress and you'll have to repeat several mazes you've just beat.  Argh!I feel like a simple timer, and a maze number indiactor on each maze screen would be a super simple addition that would help the game a lot.But my most frustrating gripe three days after the launch of this game is FALSE ADVERTISING BY THE DEVELOPER.  This game right now advertises TRADING CARDS, and after beating all 60 levels, I didn't get a single card.  I'm not a big trading card guy, but I know that a lot of Steam users buy these cheap games for one main reason, the trading card.  RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NONE, and the developer in a forum thread two days ago just says ""they are coming soon""... THAT IS FALSE ADVERTISING MR DEVELOPER!  Take the ""trading cards"" off the store page until you get them into the game!!!With the frustrating controls, the lack of simple and expected features like a level indicator and a timer, and mainly NO TRADING CARDS as advertised, this game is a NOT RECOMMENDED from me.My score...VALUE:  Plenty of content for the money. I played it two hours, but ZERO REPLAY value here as every maze is the same with no procedural generation which would be nice for a game like this.  There's not even a timer on each maze so there is ZERO reason to ever want to play again.  Still, a pretty decent value here for under a buck.. 30 out of 40.FUN:  The frustrating of maneuvering the ball through the mazes takes away most of the fun of trying to conquer the mazes.  I spent more time and focus trying to maneuver the ball through the maze than I did actually finding the correct path through each maze.  I give the fun a score of 5 out of 30.CONTROLS & BUGS: Too many bugs, controls are wayyyy too frustrating and with no customization available. my score here is a ZERO out of 20.GRAPHICS & SOUND, Ehhh as simple as it gets, the music is more annoying than it is pleasant to me in this game.  2 out of 10.---------------------------------------MY SCORE:  37%  -  Not recommended!  (and I love mazes and casual kinda games like this)NOTE: I should penalize the developer for his false advertising and stating there are ""steam cards"" in the game currently on the store page, and there being ZERO trading cards actually in the game.  It should be a ZERO by default for this false advertising, especially knowing how many people buy these cheap games only for those cards.. But I'll give the developer the benefit of the doubt and assume the cards will be added soon.  37% is my score and it will be interesting to see if the developer makes some simple changes to this game to make this game MUCH better...."
