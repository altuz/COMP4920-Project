This game has nice music, similar to legend of mana. The characters are all animated, and the game's nice to look at in general.Coming from playing the early Mystery Dungeon games, this game seems to have more complexity. I haven't seen any of the familiar hallways with boxes when it comes to the dungeon layouts. There's also actual character abilities rather than being completely item-based like MD 1&2.I'll continue to play this game and add more to the review once I've played for a few dozen hours and/or have beaten the game. It's early access, but after the short amount of time played, I can tell the developers seriously love this game.Good work!"

But its not just atmosphere that makes this game great: gameplay, graphics, style, all feel new and refreshing. The one thing that excites me more than the game itself, is where Tangledeep will be in a month, 5 months, a year. This game holds an infinite amount of possibility--I can't wait to see how the devs make something great, into something amazing! If you're on the fence about buying this game...take the leap!"
,Recommended,628770,34539215,Posted: 27 August,all,cowboyana,"i thought i was in for another by-the-numbers steam EA roguelike but this game is full of content and creativity and charm and just brilliant design! the classes are all unique and the job system is a ton of fun to play with. every mechanic is thoughtfully and refreshingly rethought from genre convention. easy 10/10, buy this game if you like roguelikes at all."
,Recommended,628770,33849853,Posted: 28 July,all,Klokinator,"I like ADOM. ADOM is a fun romp through a large world with dozens of classes, hundreds of items, and all sorts of other cool things.Tangledeep, however, is not ADOM. Obviously it's in Early Access, and I've only put an hour into it so far, so I can say that as of now it's a little less complex than ADOM... but it is also a MASSIVE step-up in UI and interface quality over all the other roguelike games I've played.There are 9 jobs you can pick at the start of the game. Each job has a whole bunch of abilities you can purchase permanently as you play through, and you will keep these abilities if you switch to another class. However, the classes also have passive abilities that are locked to only that class, and if you switch you lose them. This means you can play through and learn every active ability in the game, but you also have to make choices about how to build your character since you can't have everything all at once.Item variety is pretty good, but I imagine this will be expanded to the level of ADOM in the future.The art in this game is very nice, the colors pop, the catgirls look nice, etc. I think the only characters in this game are female, I didn't see a single male (Or I wasn't looking hard enough) so that means lots of spriting eye-candy.The UI is really phenomenal though, seriously. I've been bashing my head against rocks every time I play a roguelike and they put zero or minimal effort into user accessibility. Even in ADOM, just comparing two pieces of equipment to each other is a chore. Here, it's a cinch.Lots of game altering options to choose from too, etc.As of right now, it's a good 6/10 overall, and a 9/10 for presentation. You might think 6/10 is bad, but this is an above average Early Access game, since I'm using the Moist Meter system of rating, and not the IGN numerical system where anything below a 7 is terrible.This game is missing many things, due to being in Early Access, like 'advanced jobs' and other things that simply don't work and haven't been added yet, but the amount of polish already present in the game tells me the developer is taking the product seriously.I would say that buying it at full price is fine, and any form of a sale is definitely worth it."
,Recommended,628770,34068210,Posted: 6 August,all,Witness,"There is so much to say about this game. Aside from the obvious (gorgeous old school pixel art and music that sounds direclty out of any given 90's JRPG,) Tangledeep feels like a long lost game from my childhood.First and foremost, this is very much a real roguelike - but only if you want it to be. You can play it as a regular RPG if you desire, but it's clearly meant to appeal to roguelike fans. If you want meta-progression, it's there, but it's in no way necessary. If you don't want permadeath, you can play without it.The crux of the game is a standard tower ascension dungeon crawl. You pick a starting job (class), and you're on your merry way. There are quests to help you progress, and the flexible job system lets you design any kind of character you can think of within the span of skills available to you. You may switch jobs at any given point, provided you have the necessary gold (or a special item.) All the skills you spent JP (the resource you use to buy skills) on will be kept when you switch jobs. You could, if you really wanted, learn one skill per job and just keep switching. Highly inefficient, but still possible.The weapons classes in the game (i.e. sword, axe, bow, staff, etc...) all have a unique feature to them. For example, swords have an increased parry chance, and the ability to riposte upon parry, while axes hit all adjacent enemies. You can have four weapons equipped at once, which lends flexibility to each job. Some jobs clearly prefer certain weapon classes, of course; the Hunter works best with bows, while the Brigand works best with daggers, but these aren't hard rules (though some skills do require specific weapon types.)There is no hunger clock. You *can* grind - though the usefulness of grinding diminishes heavily very quickly. Of note, your ability to heal is finite. You carry a flask which heals based on a percentage of your max health, and has a limited number of charges. You can refill these at fountains scattered throughout the dungeon, but these fountains are also finite. You can also heal through food and an NPC in town, but you will eventually run short on food if you mess around too much, and the NPC in town charges higher and higher prices to heal with each subsequent heal. So if you grind too long, you will probably lose the war of attrition.The dev is amazing. This game is updated very frequently, each update bringing quality of life changes and bug fixes, and often times some content. I'm serious when I say it's updated *VERY* frequently. Like 4-5 times a week. The dev is friendly and communicative and fixes bugs pretty much right after they're caught. He is open to suggestions and seems to enjoy communicating with the players.I keep forgetting this game is Early Access. It has a TON of content already, and quite a bit more on the way. There are currently 9 jobs, but 3 more are slated to be released before 1.0. There are so many ways to approach a win here, and that number will only increase. This is well worth the $15.True modern roguelikes are uncommon, but this game fits the bill. Perhaps the most extreme purists won't see this as a true roguelike, but if you are playing on hardcore, I fail to see how it is anything but. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this game."

And the music is amazing as well.If you even remotely enjoy rogue-likes (especially the console ones like Shiren The Wanderer) don't even hesitate, just buy it. If you like the idea of rogue-likes but find them too confusing, frustrating or difficult, give this game a try."

76561198077518431,Recommended,628770,33797221,Posted: 25 July,all,Lars Umlaut,"Most importantly: yes, this is a proper roguelike!  Full keyboard control is available.I picked this up the day after release; this review is based on an alpha build.  And even though it's still in alpha I feel I've already gotten my money's worth.The UI is a little rough (those pop-up inventory windows, ugh), and if you're accustomed to traditional roguelikes the limited field of view will take a bit of getting used to.The cheery SNES-style graphics and music have really grown on me.There's a carryover system, but you can ignore it if you like.Thumbs up; roguelike fans will be pleased."

Had this one sitting in my wishlist, figured I'd wait until it was finished, but here I am.Bought it, 7 hours straight of playing.Amazing game, plays well with controller or Mouse keyboard.Could use a bit more refining, but it is early access.If you want a well paced RPG I highly recommend you pick this gem up."
76561197995238408,Recommended,628770,33665231,Posted: 19 July,all,My Little Pwny,"There is an incredible amount of potential for this game! Even with that said, it's still extremely fun in its early life. The classes are all quite varied and enjoyable (With plenty of room for more classes, obviously) and each can actually be approached from different ways; just because something seems like a melee fighter does not mean you have to pump strength to be effective.You can change classes (For a gold fee) and in doing so you keep all purchased skills, but can access new passive and active ones to help get the final character you want. However, spending enough on a single tree will give you a bonus, as long as you remain that class, so there IS a reason to stick to one.The attack animations are very beautiful, especially for the Blade Dancer and HuSyn (In my opinion) and the sprite work is gorgeous as well.Basically, if you enjoyed Dungeons of Dredmor or Tales of Maj'Eyal, plus any other turn-based roguelike, you'll enjoy this game as well. I foresee a very bright and long-lived future for this gem.Obviously, it is an EA title, but it's got enough stuff in it right now to easily be worth the $13.49 price tag. A very reasonable price."

,Recommended,628770,35353579,Posted: 30 September,all,Josh,I rarely write reviews for games but with that said my play time of 60+ hours should speak for itself and there are plenty of other reviews that go into more detail about the pros and cons so I will keep this review short.60 hours / $15 = $0.25 per hour played and I have enjoyed every bit of it and will continue to play this game after each major content patch is realeased.

They are highly active, responsive and very helpful and that alone is a significant merit especially in Early Access games."

It took me about 4 or 5 deaths to really work out whats what.Hint: Plant trees in town and craft food items, you will not survive with out crafting food regularly.  If you havent found any recipes, google em, as the recipes get added once you've crafted something as well.The graphics and music remind me of old school SNES games, and really takes me back.Did I say i love this game?"
,Recommended,628770,33704641,Posted: 21 July,all,AshaMarie,"Early Access Review:The devs are amazing and show care for their product.  The game is still in development and I still feel like I'm playing a high-quality product.  With that said, I am pleased to have picked up this game and experience it for myself as every cent was worth it.  After placing over 300 hours into the game, I feel it's time to make a quality review.You play as a female heroine of sorts who happens to be the only human in the game while all other friendly npcs are mostly animals.  I assume there's a reason behind this and that's probably a major part of the story that is in development.  While the story is incomplete since it's still in development, it gets you interested in why things are the way they are.The gameplay is fairly satisifying.  You are able to change jobs (classes) in the game and keep all of the learned skills much like Final Fantasy Tactics except the innate skills.  You can still use majority of the skills while using another job and you are limited to 4 passives for the skills that require a passive slot which is fine.  The combat is turn-based where the player acts first then everything on the map will make a move on same turn.  The exception is when your CT is at 100 which gives you a free turn.  You have food and flasks to heal with, while the food has a cooldown based on what you ate.  There are gear mods that can increase effectiveness of the food that heals and there are mods that lower the cooldown before you can eat again.  The flasks are refilled by magical fountains which are in limited supply in the main dungeon; however, you may find some in item dream worlds which is the place to go for upgrading gear later on.The difficulty is not too forgiving by any means.  The game expects you to learn from your mistakes and punishes you if you don't.  You can play on adventure mode to greatly lower the death penalty whereas playing on heroic or hardcore will treat you to the permadeath feature which deletes your character.  On hardcore, you lose all meta progress of your town and this includes the storage.  On heroic, you keep meta progress and storage at the least.The town is the player base where you can shop for supplies, store things to use for later, grow trees which will produce supplies, and couple other things.  Very soon inward, you are introduced to the corral system where you can capture monsters and have for pets.  This is not your standard pet system.  You can actually feed the monsters, wash them, groom them, and have them breed.  Breeding monsters is the reason to use the corral as the newborn baby may inherit skills and stats of its parents.  When you heal yourself, the corral pet will get 50% of that healing effect as well but it doesn't subtract from what you heal yourself with.  Overtime, your corral pets will sometimes find loot which is a nice touch and gives use to fill up the corral which should hold up to 12 monsters.Item dream worlds is consdiered the sub-dungeon of the game but quickly becomes a favorite of mine since the difficulty of this dungeon can be much harder than the main dungeon due to affinity on gears you are trying to upgrade.  Before you can upgrade gear, you must first progress the story a bit before you are given the option.  Once this happens, you must collect orbs which are used to upgrade gear.  Most gears can add up to 5 mods and have 3 base upgrades (weapons gain power, accessories gain max energy/stamina, etc).  After each upgrade, the next upgrade will require a slightly more difficult challenge or signficiantly more difficult challenge depending on the upgrade mod that was added in previous runs.The music and sound are just incredible.  The music is done by zircon, who is a master of music in his own way.  He is also the main coder of this game and is extremely active in discord and is a well-respected man who is fun to get along with.  He is partnered up with few other brilliant developers whom all pour their heart into making this game a fine product.  The music does not disappoint because of zircon and he plans to upgrade the soundtrack in the near future.  The sound effects quickly remind of you those 16-bit games you may have grew up with.  I feel bad for anyone who has not grew up with 8-bit or 16-bit gaming, but least now you can have a taste of the 16-bit while playing this game in terms of sound effects.There is not much to complain about with this game other than the bugs (devs are fast to deal with them and bugs are common and something to expect in early access), but one thing I can understand is that you might feel like there isn't too much progression.  Now this is a debate that can be talked upon for a while, but if we had some way to improve the town and such, it would be a wonderful feature.  Unfortunately, the devs have limited resources and the game is not having as many sales as it needs to have.Overall, this is a high-quality product that is still in developemnt that will not disappoint the average rogue-like fan who is in need of a game that isn't easy but not overwhelmingly challenging.  With new soundtracks on the way, new jobs in development, and story developement, I forsee great things for this game and would recommend this game to everyone.OVERALL SCORE:  9.5 /  10It will probably be a 10/10 on its final patch once everything is complete if it delivers."

Turn-based, permadeath (or not, depends on you), lots of items, and no classes - job system. You can learn spells as a wizard, then switch to another job and retain what you learned. You can also cook and in default mode plant trees, capture monsters and store items and gold for the next character after you die. Not as deep as some rogue-likes (can change during EA), but not casual either.+ nice graphics+ music+ job system+ cooking and trees (see above)+ updates ~3 times a week or almost daily (content, bug fixes, etc.)+ bugs fixed in few hours+ side quests- bugs (EA and usually fixed in few hours)Disclaimer: I bought the game on the day of EA release, having it wishlisted for a long time.

There are multiple jobs and you can use skills you have learned from others jobs in your current one. Which offers a lot of customization.The combat takes some getting used to, instead of having a dedicated key for melee attacking, you ""bump"" into the mob and that causes your character to attack, there are also ranged attacks and spells.There is the occasional bug here and there but this EA game is shaping up very nicely.Overall if you are a fan of loot hunting RPG's with customizable classes i would give this game a shot."

Please note that I only list this as a con as a warning for people unfamiliar with rogue-likes or those who don't enjoy the genre. However, you do have the option to play without perma-death.- Some skills can be a bit buggy - I'm speaking mostly of the Floramancer's vine-splosion skill. I've had multiple instances where it refused to work on her summoned vines. This should not be an indicator of the game's quality now or in the future though - it IS an early access and there will be bugs.That's pretty much it. If you love rogue-likes, if you enjoy games that look like SNES titles or if you just like good old fashioned dungeon crawling action, definitely consider giving this awesome game a shot.TL:DR - 8/10 maimed college students backpacking through Britain :)"

,Not Recommended,628770,33924191,Posted: 31 July,all,pango,"Hold off on this for the moment. It shows promise but there are problems with crashing, saving, loading. You could end up with too much invested in it and then hit a problem.Also the decision that has been made with graphics is a bit weird. There are nice, pixelart graphics with animation but all the player sprites are female with no plans to change that and changes in your weapon, armor etc. don't show on the character. Plans for more graphics include adding graphics and animations for facing up and down. This might look good on a trailer but I think effort would be better spent elsewhere. As for the gender of sprites, since there are 9 classes I would have made some of them male by default and others female by default if you don't have the time to make male and female for each class.Basically with the graphics I think they went too specific and removed connection with the player/immersion. Instead of being your character, male or female, a certain class, using certain armour and a certain weapon you are THE SWORDDANCER, a female sword dancer with a set outfit and weapon (which is a sword even if you're using a club).How would I solve this? I would axe specific sprites for classes and make all classes look the same but I would add in a modular system with the sprites so that armor and weapon can show on your character. If this means that there's no time to animation as it's done here then fine, I would do all animations for moving and attacking by rotating, scaling or transforming the sprite.Since i have received criticism for making this review negative and it has been implied that I should make allowances for things because it's Early Access let me also state that as a roguelike the game has too much roguelitey persistance for me. I also dislike the way hp is managed, the reliance on crafting and the fact that monsters respawn for ever and that you are supposed to avoid fights.I used to buy every single roguelike on steam because I am a huge roguelike fan but I am going to stop doing that. This game doesn't really offer anything new: it just tries to be a polished version of things that already exist. The job system is the only thing that stands out and I don't like how that has been implemented."

Until this is fixed the game cannot be considered a proper RPG as it forces you to be female and to wear female outfits (though the thought of Barry in a dress is a tad funny). RPGs are meant to promote choice and customisation.When I role play I tend to prefer doing so as the sex I was born. The game is updated a LOT, but this never seems to be added.I see malicious people commenting on the discussion boards that if you are a man and have to role play as a man, then YOU have 'issues.' Perhaps these people need to check what the definition of role play is. If men wanting to play men have 'issues', is it not then fair to say that men wanting to be women are equally, if not more troubled? People have their own preferences.I bought the game almost three months ago. I want to play it, but not as a woman. I'm a man who prefers to be a man. When I play RPGs its because I (me, the man) want to escape into a fantasy, not that I want to do so whilst 'role playing' as a female. I've had to request a refund, sorry. I make male characters on WoW, Dark Souls, Terraria, Project Zomboid, it's my preference when I play any game as an RPG experience. I pretty much only play RPGs and it's how I like to RP.Some people like dressing up as animals and having furry parties. Some guys pretend to be girl gamers or openly play female characters as male gamers. Me, I just want to escape into a fantasy world as myself, as my sex, representing my own personal exploration of the game world. Each to their own, as they say.If the game was tagged appropriately with 'female protagonist' then I wouldn't have bought it, at least not until male PCs were available. Sorry. I'd be happy to repurchase when this is fixed and would naturally remove this negative review (assuming of course I liked the game)."

Also Devs are working pretty hard on adding content. At the moment there isnt that many classes, as I would like, but I have faith more would be added. Story wise there is a lot to be desired, but again devs are working on adding features and squashing bugs.All in all whats there is a pretty solid experience. Also consider getting involved in the community, by joining the discord and forums. More feedback is always nice."

Lots of potential, constant updates, and fans who come back for more (even though it looks like i dont play it a lot).  A great game for 14.99 with constant updates is like a dream come true.  Buy this game and enjoy :D"

It looks really great visually and feels nice to play. Unfortunately despite all the nice parts of the game, it couldn't get through my problems that I have with these kinds of games. The game is good, but I just personally have a hard time getting into these games, so take my review for what it's worth."

,Recommended,628770,35358996,Posted: 30 September,all,Argiope,"pros:-great visuals & music-classes actually feel pretty varied in playstyle-charming flavour text-it's pretty upfront about what stats/items/skills etc actually do and very little feels obtuse-following on from that there's not really anything I've come across so far that can't be figured out with a little experimentation-resource management (no HP regen w/out items, etc) is well balanced to be difficult without feeling horribly unfair-frequent updates!! a lot's improved over a short time and it's almost certainly going to get even better.cons:-gamepad control sometimes feels a little janky, I'm not really sure how to explain what I mean (could be just me?)-ranged attacks are very annoying to do with a controller. I'm not even sure if you CAN or you're just meant to use the mouse?-I said few things are obtuse but cooking is definitely one of those things, even with the new recipe journal-the map only has two sizes and both are kinda.... the small one is really hard to read for me, and the large one is a bit big for something that's smack in the middle of the screen. I haven't checked the options menu in a while though so I might have missed something. I'd still have liked a ""medium"" size option but that's just me-as I've seen others say, terrain is currently really annoying - I'd expect that kind of effect maybe in a late-game area but having the root/stamina drain from the beginning is annoying without adding much in the way of challenge-I'm getting the impression that it's currently rather short, but this isn't much of an issue with how fast updates are; it's still something to keep in mind though if you think you'll be playing a lot at once.Overall I'd say it's definitely worth picking up and giving it a shot!"
76561197964102528,Recommended,628770,35348462,Posted: 30 September,all,Jazerus,"Tangledeep is a deep and rewarding roguelike, with visual and audio themes reminiscent of the Mana series of RPGs and a mix-and-match class/ability system similar to Final Fantasy 5 or Final Fantasy Tactics. Other systems, such as the ability to raise monsters or to power up items by going into them and completing extra dungeon levels, are also incorporated into the game.Essentially, it's a mixture of concepts from Legend of Mana, Final Fantasy, Disgaea, and Shiren the Wanderer (or Dungeons of Dredmor)!However, it never feels particularly derivative - instead, this mixture of features from many JRPG franchises comes off as a logical progression of the genre, a fusion of ideas that have worked well separately into a set of systems that work even better together.I couldn't recommend this game more, and it's only going to get better in the future - it feels more or less like a complete game now, but the developers have a lot more planned for inclusion."

,Recommended,628770,35350490,Posted: 30 September,all,kizyr,"Aw yeah, I love this roguelike -- everything about it is focused on making as fun of an experience as possible.It's turn-based combat, but plays really smooth and fluid. It has tons of options between job classes to customize and play with how your character works, but not so much to where it seems overcomplicated or too hard to figure out. There's a lot of replayability since there're different ways to play through the game (distance fighter? hand-to-hand? magic-heavy? summoner? master chef?) and more to discover (...it'll take me a bit to get the hang of the soul-catcher class).On top of that, the difficulty sits at just the right point to where it's challenging, but not frustrating. The gorgeous music and pleasing 16-bit graphics are just a fantastic bonus to it all.The developers also keep tweaking the game to streamline more things and fix balance issues, so each new update it's like the game is getting even better."
