,Recommended,628920,31714093,Posted: 12 May,all,Throwaway,"It's a short VN, no way around that.If anything I would compare it to going to go see a movie for the same price. It's length sometimes makes you wish there was more, having finished the game in 2 hours. I guess that's why there is 5 different endings, to try each one.The story progresses naturally unlike some VN that like to dart around and try to stick many stories into one which is a + for me. It has tension and actually makes you question characters motives. It kept me entertained and I enjoyed the humor and the good natured happiness that can happen while also the sadness that can happen as well.All the characters, including the MC are likable and help the story become more immersive than it already is. I'd say it's good if you have $10 lying around and want to be entertained for at least a few hours or want a introduction to Visual Novel genre. (I made the mistake of playing a 40 hour VN for my first)Don't do it for the nudity please, there are naked photos on the internet that are free. My first and final warning.Also Goddamn finally a game about Tomboys."

76561198111027222,Recommended,628920,31722827,Posted: 13 May,all,Finch,"TNLT is a romantic visual novel , you play as Kai (- a teenage boy) who is torn between pursuing his high-school crush Sophie ( a posh, pretty girl) but at the same time finds himself increasingly attracted to his best friend Chris ( aka Christine - a tomboy.)The outcome of the story depends upon your choices.GOOD:* It's a well written and enjoyable story - the dialogue is lively and amusing/emotional/intimate at times. The characters are likeable and interesting.* The artwork and music are good (but not quite amazing) however the overall presentation is very nice.* It has a branching story with meaningful choices and multiple endings ( but to be clear I have only completed the game once so far.)* There is an adult patch available (-  a direct link to it is on the main menu of the game -) plus you have the ability to toggle adult content on/off from the options menu after adding the patch.* It has all the usual features you'd expect from a VN ( text speed, skip, go back etc.)BAD:*My play time is from a single playthrough ( 1.2 hours) so it is a bit on the short side. The multiple endings add to the replayability - but it's still fairly short compared to some other VN's out there.Overall - 4/5I really enjoyed my time with TNLT and plan on replaying it.If you have a thing for tomboyish girls I'd recommend it."
,Not Recommended,628920,31915151,Posted: 23 May,all,Cross Breeze,"For its price, this game is way too short. You can achieve all 5 endings in less than 2 hours. There is also clearly only one good outcome. Kind of a giveaway in the title, but yeah.I've no complaints with the story, it's cute enough (even if all the women in the story are crazy down to get undressed at the slightest comment). I usually prefer to have to put more work into getting the girl personally, I don't feel like the payoff was built up adequately.Tl;dr: Enjoyable, but short, and very fast paced. Buy it on sale. I can't recommend it at its current price."
,Recommended,628920,31757038,Posted: 14 May,all,Nightwing,"As most of the reviews have stated, this visual novel is pretty short. You can actually finish this game in under 2 hours if you're a fast reader and do not take your time. If you're looking for a long visual novel with a lot background story and information, this is not the visual novel for you. However, if you're looking for a short and entertaining one, this one does not fall flat of expectations. I'll list the pros and cons from here on out so you can get an idea of what to expect when purchasing this game.PROS- Art design: The art and cgi in this game are absolutely stunning. Although there are reused backgrounds and a limited amount of it, the art is still appealing and stylish enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen. It's easy on the eyes and definitely makes the experience more enjoyable.- Characters: The strongest character in this game is of course Chris, she's the most interesting one and she should be the end goal here. Sophie is complex in her own way and I have to give the writer(s) props for making Sophie seem like a realistic character. Although in the end I ultimately chose Chris (probably the best ending), Sophie is such a complex character that I'm drawn to her in a different way from Chris and she does make me conflicted at times when I'm making decisions.-Story: Although this is a short game, the story itself is engaging enough to keep you hooked onto it. It's a little cliche but strong enough to be interesting on its own. Midway through the story, you're faced with conflicting decisions and it will determine the relationship you will have between Chris and Sophie. This game does make you think that scenarios like this also happen in reality and whatever you decide to do, affects those around you, which I greatly appreciate.- Price: I got this game for 9 dollars (on sale as of right now while I'm writing this review), it's a reasonable price for a game that can stretch to 2-3 hours if you try hard enough (not skipping through dialogue when playing the game again). The regular price is 10 dollars, which still isn't bad. If you have spare money and you're a fan of the visual novel genre, I recommend this for you.- Adult patch: There is a free 18+ patch if you decide to buy the game. Adding the patch to the game will enhance the playthrough a little bit more in my opinion, afterall it is a game dealing with mature themes. The art for the uncensored scenes are very well drawn and is worth the download.CONS- Length: Although I don't mind short visual novels, many other people will have different expectations. This game can be completed in under 2 hours if you read fast enough.- Music: I understand that this is a small budget indie game. I actually don't mind that there isn't much music in the game (I listen to my own music while playing visual novels half the time anyways), but other people may find it tiresome to listen to the same song on loop again and again. There are about 3 or 4 total tracks in this game, if I remembered correctly. I guess it could ruin the immersion if you keep listening to the same song over and over again.- Decisions: These interactions are important and I feel like there isn't much decision making in the game. Although the decisions you make are important (it puts you on a certain path to unlock certain achievements/endings), I feel like there isn't a variety of it in order to make the story branch into different scenarios and what not.Overall, the game itself is amazing. It is is made by an indie developer so I have to say that although I did list some cons here and there, I understand why they had to make it the way they did. It's an engaging and strong story itself and in the visual novel crowd, I think most people will appreciate this game for its characters and story. Besides, if you have a thing for tomboys, this game doesn't disappoint. Chris is a perfect tomboy and if she was my friend in real life, I definitely would try going for her. I recommend you pick it up if you want an entertaining visaul novel, it's at a reasonable price and there is an adult patch that is free that comes along with it! Will definitely be looking forward to more visual novels by Zetsubou."

That there's only one real option feels really obvious and one of your only two choices just comes off so unlikeable despite an initial attempt at fostering empathy for the character that despite there being two choices, there's really only one.  Had the devs done a better job at fleshing out the crush option in making her viable as somebody you might want to romance the game would have been miles better.The art is genuinely good and I don't think the writing is bad, just... too focused on who it feels like the developer wanted you to pick.  Make it  agenuine choice."

Christine (Chris) is a tomboyish girl who has feelings for her best friend Kai... who does not see her as a girl... yet. He's smitten with the class beauty Sophie, who has a few... secrets.There are five endings. Two would be termed bad, three varying levels of good (one of them has the possibility of something more, one is a redemption for one girl, and the last... is literally termed ""Happily Ever After"").The patch reveals a few more details, but even without it (it is free), the cgs make sure you know what's going on."

76561197970590721,Recommended,628920,31819696,Posted: 18 May,all,Wraith99,"I have to admit, this game caught me off guard. I usually just automatically tag VNs with “Not interested” and get on with my day. But something about “Tomboys Need Love Too!” kept it from that fate. Maybe it was the art style, or the premise or something else entirely. At the end of the day, it stayed on my list and on my mind. Not convinced that it was worth my time I decided to head over to YouTube and watch a little of a playthrough. About 4 hours later I came back to Steam and bought the game.The premise itself is noteworthy due to the fact that it is a completely plausible scenario that any one of us could have experienced. It is a far cry from the usual fare of saving the world/universe from some danger, and that’s a good thing. Lengthwise the game seemed just about right. I wouldn’t have minded if it was a little longer, but ultimately I didn’t feel like it left any loose ends. Two of the endings even feature an epilogue which really tied things up in a nice fashion. I feel that I must stress again that I don’t usually play VNs, so veterans of the medium might feel differently.The art style is one of the things that drew me to the game, and I feel it deserves a special note. Both characters and backgrounds feature crisp, clear lines with a lot of detail and vibrant colors to set the stage. The whole thing felt like it had a distinct “western” art approach compared to most VNs which lean heavily on the eastern style. I don’t know if this was intentional or not, but it definitely worked for me.The music was unobtrusive and generally pleasant. Each piece was usually tied to a specific location or mood, and it worked well in that regard. Given that the game doesn’t feature a lot of characters or locations the fact that the music worked as well as it did is a good thing. It was also cut off at certain times when your character either observed or realized something important, so the lack of music was used for dramatic effect as well.Writing is the core of every VN, and no matter how good the art or excellent the music, if the writing is poor then everything else suffers as a result. Fortunately the writing for “Tomboys Need Love Too!” is excellent. From the banter between Kai and Chris to Kai’s inner monologue everything comes together brilliantly. I was honestly surprised by the depth each character had, and how this added some much needed context to their actions and motivations. This really is a game where you need to see most of the endings before you truly understand everything.Of course the single most defining aspect of writing comes from the ability to make you care about the characters and the choices you make regarding them. There were times when I made a choice that seemed funny and cute, but actually hurt the feelings of Chris, which then made me quick load back and choose something more considerate. I have played other games for over a hundred hours, and when some critical character died I merely shrugged and got on with it. This game made me care about the characters within a single hour.So should you buy “Tomboys Need Love Too!”? I guess it depends. If you want a VN with plenty of choices, dozens of characters and a story that will take you several days to get through, then no. But if you’re in the mood for a well written, well-paced and ultimately well-made VN, then you might want to give this one another look."

76561198090540772,Recommended,628920,31735135,Posted: 13 May,all,yellowcactus,"While not the hardest to predict, it still was an enjoyable story and experience for those that enjoy romance. My only issue I have, without giving too much information, is how after my first playthough, I don't have an urge to replay for any other endings, knowing what I do just from the first. Otherwise, a pretty neat little visual novel."
76561198162703817,Recommended,628920,31851663,Posted: 19 May,all,aim4thetop1,"The second route was painful.Understandably, this game favors the playthrough that leads to you ending up with your Tomboy childhood friend, which can be seen through the exchanges of dialogue, thoughts of the protagonist himself, as well as the choices that can be made.I'll be honest and say that I bought this game because I was impressed the Dev didn't hide the fact it had 'certain' content. I was pleasantly surprised to find the writing was really decent.As someone who plays games with this type of content, Dharker Studio has been the developer who produces the most of them. However, the writing for their games can be summed down to creating a harem, or going for one, with moments of cheating,This game's writing really made me feel soo bad for both the childhood friend and mom, that the protagonist was so naively optimistic. Even after going for Sophie's route, and finding out what her deal was, it's hard to look past her actions.She's a great actress, and one that had me momentarily doubt whether her later nervousness was genuine. But unless you have real questionable morals, it's difficult to go for her route first playthrough, though it's nice to know why.Will definitely support any future releases by this dev. The art style definitely wasn't bad, and there were plenty of CG that fulfilled the original reason I bought the game.Wished this game had more reviews."
,Not Recommended,628920,32136651,Posted: 2 June,all,Nardio,"Tomboys Need Love Too! was not a bad experience per say. Well at least not as bad as a lot of the other steam visual novels I’ve experienced. My first playthrough had a lot of good moments mixed in with a lot of forced cringe inducing moments. Some were believable, some were just annoying. I get that this visual novel takes place with characters who are overdosing on hormones as teenagers, but the writing was so out there at times that I found myself ripped out of the experience way to many times. Even the first playthrough alone where I got the best ending didn’t feel good enough to warrant recommending this visual novel.Unfortunatly it just got worse and worse. Tl;dr it's not worth your time or money. I endured it all for the sake of reviewing it and hoping it would get better. The creators of this mess tried to appeal to to many different audances and fails miserably.The art is lackluster, the music is stuff I've heard dozens of times before and the story never delivers. I say avoid this.If you want to read more I have a full review below, but trust me, just avoid this VN. This would still suck if it were free. $10.00 is a horrible rip off:http://nardio.net/2017/06/02/tomboys-need-love-review/"

Art is decent but a few scenes are anatomically wierd. It's all full HD though, which is nice.The other route is offputting since the character is highly unlikable and though the author tried to redeem her in the end it didn't seem convincing. But the tomboy was nice."
,Recommended,628920,31857111,Posted: 20 May,all,N E A R H A N,"This game....was a wild ride, from start to finish. And no, I'm not talking about the 'adventures' betwen Kai, the main character, and his crush, Sophie. Barely legal boi Kai, armed with raging hormones and infatuation for some bimbo named  Sophie must do battle with his childhood friend Chris, who is vying for his love. It's a love triangle? Except Chris and Sophie hate each other. So, like a love chevron.Personally, for its length, the game lacked points where you can make choices. These were placed admittedly well in important places to steer the story in the intended direction, but a little more decision-making points would be nice. The decisions themselves make an impact on the story and, to some extent, how the characters will interact with you. Good art style, nice drawings (ahem ahem), decent writing. BGM gets a little repetitive, though, but who plays for that? On a side note, the 'patch' is...interesting. Way too distracting to play with them on, if you know what I mean. I'm only done with one ending, though, so I guess it's back to the game for me.Lots of the dialogs are back-and-forth convos between Kai and his childhood friend, Christine, the eponymous tomboy who needs love. Too. Most of these are banter and some of it feels weird and awkward, and some decisions made by Kai are questionable, to say the least.Who the ♥♥♥♥ goes on and decide that peeping on their female friend in the shower is ever a good idea? Damn, bro, you looking to get arrested or something?Even worse that not all decisions made by him is decideable, as mentioned earlier. What few actions you can decide on can make an impact.Eat the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your crush like its an all you can eat seafood buffet. And somehow you get addicted and start shagging her in school and get caught by *gasp* Chris. And that's ending number 1. It's actually pretty silly if you think about it.Gameplay-wise it's your standard click-dialog-and-see-what-happens dating simulator type thing. It does have a few options to fiddle around with like text scroll speed and BGM volume. There's a 'back' function for dialog and its useful too; if you overclick dialog and missed something juicy, then just hit that and BOOM, you're a time-traveller and Sophie is standing there oblivious that your previous choice led to you eating out seafood with her in a back alley. Useful. Oh, and there's quicksave/quickload functions AND manual save points. Damn useful.So? Should you get it? Maybe. If you have 10 bucks to throw and like this type of thing then throw it and get this. Honestly it would be better to get it on sale or something. Don't expect a tale for the ages type of thing with this. Realistically, expect a decently written fan fiction with pretty decent art.P.S. Don't install the patch if you're playing this with your parents.P.S.S. Avoid the patch if you wanna focus on the story instead of Chris' personality.P.S.S.S. I have no idea how this P.S.♥♥♥♥♥♥works.P.S.S.S.S. Oh and I missed out on buying platinum for Warframe. For this. Huh, maybe it's a worthy investment after all.P.S.S.S.S.S. The endings and branching paths you can take are varied enough to warrant multiple playthroughs. Sure there's an ocean of filler dialogue to sift through but the game has aS K I Pfunction. Lets you fast forward and skip all dialogue until you stop it or you reach a branchpoint. Damn useful."

I only played through the ""best"" ending and I only plan too, so the price is a bit steep for how much I got out of it, but I'm fine with that. It was a good experience.The dialogue and scenes seems to be an odd mishmash of Japanese VN influences mixed with a Western viewpoint, which is odd at times but doesn't really ruin anything. The artwork is VERY simple and sometimes lacking, and there are no voiced lines. While that's not a dealbreaker at all, don't expect the same kind of experience you'd get from a bigger VN maker.In terms of the story, it's nice and real, with just enough dramatic twist to make it interesting. There are a lot of choices you can make, which I really love in VNs, so I really enjoyed that part of it. I couldn't see people behaving like this in real life, of course, but gaming is all about escapism; it's definitely a far cry from VNs like Nekopara, Danganronpa, or Fate/Stay Night, though. All in all, if you're looking to kill some time with a nice, bright, low commitment story, here it is.Pros:-Refreshing art style-Amusing dialogue-Many choices to have fun with-Well-paced H-scenesCons:-Short for its price-Odd dialogue at times and no voice acting-Simple art, sometimes looks off"

,Recommended,628920,31910585,Posted: 22 May,all,Mike L,"I became very interested in this game after watching some videos on YouTube, so I went ahead and I purchased the game and played through the 5th ending. The story of the game was amazing and if you are into romance type of story's you're going to love this game. The story is about two childhood friends Kai and Chris (Christine). Kai has been crazy for a girl name Sophie who is hated in school for getting involved with guys that are in a relationship in order to force the girl to breakup with their boyfriend and then tossing them aside after she is done with them. Chris for a long time had strong feelings for Kai while Kai always saw Chris as one of the guys since she is a tomboy, but as Chris spends a week at Kai's house because Chris's parents are on a business trip he starts to have mix feelings about Chris whether he's starting to fall for Chris or is lusting after her. Of course base on your choices you'll decide whether you choose to be with Chris or Sophie.Even though the game is a virtual novelette the price of the game was fair since there's 5 different endings in the game and when I played my first playthrough aiming for the best ending (in my opinion anyways) took me around 3 to 4 hours to complete, the artwork is beautiful, and the background music is great to listen to . I'm very interested in a sequel after Kai and Chris life is like when they became a couple since when you do finish the game (in ending 5 at least that I know) there is a 7 year gap. What kind of hardship they could have faced as a couple, what job Kai decided to pursue, Chris getting into the police academy, and much more that I want to know.Overall the novelette was awesome and would definitely go through the other endings of the game and trust me you will not regret buying this game it is worth the price.Highly Recommend."

I tend to play visual Novels like that, going only after the love interest I like most.The Artstyle is gorgeous and the theme is nicely chosen. Unfortunately no animated scenes, but none the less, the adult patch does it's magic, however is rather softcore in comparison to other similar games.The only negative thing I have to say, is, that there seem to be only three character models: teen-male, teen-female and mother.

,Recommended,628920,31760225,Posted: 14 May,all,Shadovvk1lla,"So this was my first VN and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. I decided to get it based off of other reviews and thought I'd add my own to the mix. Being my first VN I took the cliche ""best ending"" route but I plan on going back later and getting more of the endings unlocked. The writing for most of the VN was 7.5/10, sound design was 7/10 (it randomly cut out a few times), and the plot was 8/10. It was a nice 2 hour experience that is well worth the money just for a single playthrough. The free patch to uncensor explicit content was a nice bonus too.TL;DR: Nice little love story (or not), kinda short, explicit content. Buy it"

It has 5 endings, but you can finish it each time within the span of 2-4 hours (depending on your reading speed) The constant banter was great between the main protagonists with an enjoyable story, and they nailed how tomboys usually act. If you're into tomboys as much as I am, I say this VN is perfect for you."

,Not Recommended,628920,35407763,Posted: 2 October,all,Cold Popsicle,"I recommend opening this game up as an admin in the steam folder, because of how Python the engine works is that it will not play any audio unless given permission.Downloading the 18+ patch and applying it to this game simply to have the option. though it is highly recommended for the full autistic experience that is reddit waifu simulator.Side note: I could go on about how the BGM is repetitive with an annoying bassline and how the protagnist is clearly a fat neckbeard with less social life skills than myself, but within the first 5 minutes of this game it is clearly stated as such.Hopefully the creator is able to learn and grow from this medicore product and become something similar to the meme that is HunnieDev or greater"
