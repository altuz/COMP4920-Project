,Recommended,628950,34042869,Posted: 5 August,all,[slckr]robilar5500,"Nephise Begins is the prequel to Nephise, and a small, encapsulated vision of Nephise's journey to become an Orb Hunter. As far as Tonguc Bodur's catalog goes, this one was probably my least favorite, and yet it still carries a lot of appeal as its own entity.StoryAs mentioned above, this is the prequel to the game Nephise, and in Nephise Begins, we get to see how she becomes an Orb Hunter. While the significance of such is still left a mystery, it is a satisfying explanation as to how she found her way to the events of Nephise and why she has issues with excess (or addiction, if you will).She starts out as a mushroom hunter, but as she starts to find the skulls of the dead, she is drawn into an adventure to find the origins of said doom.7 out of 10GameplayAs with Nephise, Nephise Begins is set in a small and encapsulated, circular area that she will explore to find mushrooms and animal skulls, which are also the impetus for her finding the path to becoming an Orb Hunter.This is exactly the same style of gameplay as Nephise and similar to other of Tonguc's entries. As such, you can expect a seamless experience with no bugs or glitching.There is one primary puzzle much as with its predecessor, and this is easily solved, yet clever in its design and application.All in all, solid effort here. 9.5 out of 10GraphicsThe graphics in Nephise Begins is where I really see an actual decline from previous entries. Running with the same specs on each game, Nephise Begins was far less distinct and crisp as previous entries. The colors were a bit more blurred, and everything had a less vibrant feel about them (outside of the skulls and mushrooms which really popped in contrast to everything else). I don't know if this was a conscious decision so as to emphasize the mushrooms and skulls, but it just wasn't as effective in my estimation as it could have been. Some of the other stuff, like the guardian fox and the harpy were quite nice looking, and the temple was really cool. So, it is still a visually pleasing game. Just not at the level I expected it to be.8 out of 10AudioThe audio tracks in Nephise Begins aren't too different than in Nephise itself. The old lady narrator was the same and the orchestration was at least similar. Everything was as such both effective and pleasing.9 out of 10VerdictIt might seem I'm a bit down on Nephise Begins but I'm really not. It's still a definite cool experience. I just wasn't AS pleased with it as with past efforts by Tonguc. This game still rates highly though.8.4 out of 10. Must play experience for walking simulator fans."

The setting is pretty much the same: a meticulously created forest where the attention to detail is superb! As opposed to Nephise the season is now summer which, naturally, provides more opportunities to showcase the 4th iteration of the Unreal engine.While the forest is the main setting a little puzzle-solving allows us to proceed to a cave where our journey comes to an end. This was actually pretty similar in Nephise - it matters not as the main emphasis is still on strolling in the forest and climbing the various plateaus to get our hands on more collectible items. Our promenade, at all times, is accompanied by great music and as you get close to your goal you constantly wish for more.Nephise Begins - similarly to Nephise - is mainly for two types of people: for those who love walking sims and for those who are picture aficionados. This is an excellent item in your library to increase the number of screenshots you have in the cloud."

Instead it has what a lot of walking simulators are missing: primitive gaming elements. the problem is that they are boring and just stop you from progressing without reason or explanation. Walk through a level that has barely any landmarks and find random stuff because a voice tells you to. then step on 5 platforms.but to be fair: it looks good most of the time, apart from a few glitches. It feels like the job application of a level designer: ""look, i can handle UE4, even managed to get a few gaming elements and a gui in there!"" thats fine, but nothing I would pay any money for again."

,Recommended,628950,34765043,Posted: 5 September,all,xVermiciousKnidx,"This game is quite beautiful, and feels like a great start; it really doesn't feel like a full game. I felt as though just when the game was getting good, it ended. I was left a bit saddened, and rather confused. Over all, I would rate it an 8/10great graphics, nice soundscape. Please expand this game!"
,Not Recommended,628950,32036106,Posted: 28 May,all,MrDowntempo,"This game is practically pointless. I enjoy walking simulators, not because I enjoy simulated walking, but rather for what those games provide in addition to navigating a 3D space. That might be interesting narative, exploration, or puzzles. This game has all 3 but without the quality of being interesting. It feels like an unreal license, a handful of decent assets, and a quality voice actor were given to someone who had heard of video games but never played one and decided to make this. The narrator explains the 'puzzles' even though they're so simple no explaination is needed. Why is there a giant fox? Why does the main character collect mushrooms? Why are there floating 'n's? Why is there a harpy in a cathedral in a cave? Nothing is explained because no reasons exist. This is just a bunch of assets cramed together in the framework of a game, but there is no plot and no point. It's all senseless and meaningless. I cannot recommend it."

,Not Recommended,628950,31747448,Posted: 14 May,all,derebelizer,"The graphics are good but still have many glitches (the stones on the sides flicker often and look like the texture on the side is missing - GeForce GTX 1050 Ti). I expected way more from the game than walking around over and over to find some items. Also it has a couple of UI bugs like you cannot turn off the music (when you turn it to 0 and then close the dialog when you open it again it shows 1.4 and you essentially cannot turn off the music). I purchased this expecting relaxing short game, however the monotonous awful way too loud step sounds which are much louder than the birds e.g. ruined this for me.I expected it to be more like other ""walking simulators"" like ""Dear Esther"" with a clear path and I played a lot of those games. I didn't expect something like Firewatch whatsoever especially given the low price tag but I actually did not relax at all and was disappointed when it ended."

The game dose have one small puzzle to it but it's nothing to difficult or hard to figure out or understand for that matter. The achievements are pretty easy to get as long as your willing to take the time and explore the surroundings of the game. If your looking for a game that is relaxing or if you are just in the mood into trying something a little different and new than I highly recommend this game.The game in it's self is good but very short so bare that in mind I'm talking less than 1 hour of gameplay to complete. That's also if your taking your time at the game but realistically speaking more like 30-45 minutes of gameplay So I suggest maybe picking this title up during a big Steam sale such as the Summer or Winter sale. I was able to pick this game up during the Steam Summer sale for $1.49 which I think was worth it in my opinion. The game also comes with trading cards to craft badges which is a nice little incentive as well if your into that sort of thing.Overall I give this game a 9/10PROS:Beautiful soothing relaxing musicGood visualsEasy achievements to getTrading cardsCONS:Short gameplay 30-45 minutes

Also the one statue that did rotate had no effect on the gameplay.  Who makes a cabin that is 3 stories high and now stairs.  How am I supposed to get high, the musrooms are red and I am colourblind please make the blue or yellow.  Or make the forest blue or yellow. Thank you, your biggest fan, Disappointed Father."
,Recommended,628950,33565176,Posted: 15 July,all,INCISIVENESS,Nephise Beginsis a very small game with great visuals and a short story. It also has simple tasks such as; solving an animal skull puzzle and collecting mushrooms. The achievements can be easily attained just by collecting all the mushrooms and finishing the game.

This feels like reading first five pages of a 500 page book (for 12 year olds). I'm not exaggerating.Also a few words about the so called puzzles here... Well, the main puzzle is to know English. I feel sorry for those who don't, because the puzzles here have no logics behind them of any sort.There are no hints either. But if you know English and are above 6 years old, you'll be fine.>EDIT: sorry, all the puzzles are explained in the screenshots on the game's Steam page as well as in the video... Figures...<Also be aware that the game lags as hell. If you didn't have problems with the likes of Talos Principle or the Witness and think that qualifies your (not so up to date) PC for this, think again.>EDIT:Well, I just had to add a few thoughts on the story... This one just won't leave your mind. And not because it's good, but rather because it is so bad, it's shocking it saw the light of day. A lousy computer program would generate a better story. The fact that so many reviewers found this story good makes me extremely pessimistic about the future of humanity :(>ADDITIONAL REMARKI would like to encourage those who bought this game and didn't like it to return it and get a refund. Disregard the fact that you played very little for it (i.e. ok, I should return it, but that's a hassle, never mind that couple of Euros...). The author is clearly using this effect to make sure he can sell sh*t. Let's show people like that that even if the price is low, low quality nonsense will not be tolerated."

,Not Recommended,628950,35398135,Posted: 1 October,all,Uncle Sparticus,"Another day, another asset flip. That seems to be my life lately. Today's installment is another Tonguc Bodur gem, Nephise Begins. This prequel to the complete non-entity that is Nephise is basically the same game with a few slight improvements.You play as a young but fragile girl named Nephise who can jump off of sheer cliffs stories high and needs exactly ten mushrooms. While mushroom hunting, she finds some skulls and uses them to persuade a fox to let her enter a cave, where she learns that she'd rather be an orb collector.Things you do in this game include: walking into a house, pick up mushrooms, pick up animal skulls for no stated reason, turn vases around, kill a harpy through your leprous touch, walk through a cave, wake up a fox, and collect one orb. That's it. So that's not much to do in a game.The pros of this game are that you move at a relatively normal speed (which you don't in the first game), you don't have to do any puzzles that lie to you (which, again, the dev had trouble with last time), there are a couple of fun-ish missable achievements, and the stock music was better this time.The cons are that everything in this game is stock except the narration, which merely leaves no impression at all on you. I was meditating on these games a bit, and it occurred to me that one of my main complaints with the series is that the storytelling (and ""progression"") is all delivered via narration. A piece of advice for Mr. Bodur: show, don't tell. Particularly in video games, one of the most interesting ways to deliver information is organically, through in-game experiences. On the other hand, these games suck all the fun out of the point of being a game by telling you exactly what to do in words and not giving you really any information that YOU can glean from the audio and visuals.One of the reasons this sucks so much is that this tell-don't-show method ruins even the slightest amount of immersion you might otherwise have had, since Nephise the character, dwelling in a world with no narrator, would have no reason to solve the game's two puzzles or do anything besides collect mushrooms and go home.A side note: despite what the Store page says, there's no fog in this game. It doesn't really matter, but it is a lie.One of the most damning criticisms a game can get is the ratio of playtime to achievements unlocked. Take me, for instance. I have no need to play this game ever again, and I got 100% of the achievements in about 40 minutes. And that was with a lot of dicking around, like futilely trying to find a lose state or climb the ladder in the game. If that doesn't tell you that this game isn't worth your money, I don't know what will. Yes, the Unreal engine is pretty. The stock assets used here are pretty. The lighting effects are pretty. The stock music is soothing. But there's nothing of value here. Play a game where someone made original textures or music in the Unreal engine. Play a game where someone implemented controls outside of the most basic FPE settings. Play a game where something happens, or you do something that sounds like it might matter. Do people even make games like that anymore?What have we done?"

Have more tasks that arn't as easy as just walking around and there they are. and, if harpies were real, I don't think you could kill one just by touching it. there should have been a spell book in the house. then you could go search for ingredients to make a potion to throw on the harpy. or at least look for a bow and arrow to shoot it with.I recomend this game because it's easy and looks ok and it has no bugs that I encountered."
