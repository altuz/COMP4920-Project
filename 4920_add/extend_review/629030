,Not Recommended,629030,31779854,Posted: 15 May,all,Aythadis,"Wow, no, just no!This ""Game"" is just terrible, if you can even call it a game. You can beat it in about 3 min, and I'm not joking. 100% complete in 3 min. Just to save you time, here is my complete 100% walkthrough for you, from start to finish!- Grab a box and place it on the giant red box switch to open the door.  Achievement.- Go left and grab a hand, go back and throw it at the ""hand scanner"" to open the door. Achievement.- Go into the room. Press the button 5 times then walk away as 500 achievements unlock one after another.- Go down the other hall to the next room, pick up the body. Continue down the hall all the way to the end, there is a ""zapper"" thingy that destroys things. Throw body onto it to ""destroy"" the body. Achievement.- There is 3 barrels on the map, throw all 3 on the zapper thingy. Achievement.- Throw a box (any box) on the zapper thingy. Achievement.- Grab the mop and ""clean"" up all the blood, by walking over it. Achievement.Upon completing everything, game will display a black screen for a few seconds, and restart from the start.- ESC key quits game.- Request Steam Refund."
,Not Recommended,629030,33419498,Posted: 9 July,all,FOXX5,This game is not a game at all. It is just an achievements collector. You can get all 505 in 20 minutes. I let then game run for a hour and half so I could collect the 3 card drops. I only purchased the game because a coupon made it cost just a few cents. I rate it 1/100p.s. if you still thinking about purchasing look at the screenshots in the store and realize that there is one picture for each room in the game. There is nothing more to it.

I feel like it was a weak attempt at portal meets viscera cleanup and then fails to deliver any story at all.  Freaking stupid.Its about the achievements, so expect more trash from the ideaCabinOuthouse0.1/10 for achievements only, and I feel dirty saying so."
,Not Recommended,629030,31934166,Posted: 24 May,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"According to the store page, Employee Recycling Center is about a poor employee who was left trapped and abandoned by their co-workers after an accident in the factory where they work. Other than that, no further information is given, and there is zero storytelling within the game itself, which only lasts 8-10 minutes at best if one attempts to achieve everything that there is to do.At the start, you put a cube on a large red button that's on the floor, after that you grab a hand and put it on a scanner that allows you access to another room; wherein you press a red button that unlocks 500 some achievements. Then, you can take a mop and clean up some blood, disintegrate what's left of a decapitated human body, and destroy the 3 barrels in the game for a few more achievements. That's it. There's no pause menu, no setting options, and the only way to exit the game is by closing it from the task bar. There's one short audio loop, and the textures are PS2-era grade.With literally nothing more to say about Employee Recycling Center, it's obvious that this title is just Idea Cabin's poor attempt at a cash grab asset-flip, while suckering in achievement hunters with easy trophy gains and using the alluring $1.09 CAD price tag. With this concise review, you know now what exactly to expect from the in-game content, so it's your choice whether or not you want to spend your coffee funds on something that probably took 5 hours at most to develop. An extremely lazy release, with ""free DLC coming soon!"". At least the ZUP! games had some substance, but this is just horrendous.Rating:0.5/5.0- Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

,Not Recommended,629030,33577453,Posted: 15 July,all,General Mayhem,Great for if you want 500 achievements for about 10 minutes of gameplay! Otherwise completely boring. Only get the game if its only a couple cents and then just sell the trading cards to get back your money you spent on the game.

,Not Recommended,629030,31804236,Posted: 17 May,all,Maluno,"I've joked before that with the recent trend of achievement piñatas, it would be just a matter of time before we get a game*, maybe titled ""TEH RED BUTTAN"", where you spawn inside a room with, true to the title, a red button, which once pressed would unlock all of the hundreds of achievements at once and case closed.Do I feel like a semi-prophet now. So far, nothing has come as close to my joke/dream/prophecy as this game*There is indeed a red button here. Pressing it will unlock 500 of the 505 achievements. But it's not as simple as I dreamed. You need to press it not once, but five (cinco) times. After that the remaining 5 achievements involve throwing a couple of objects into a electrical zapper and mopping the blood off the floor. Took me about 15 minutes to 100%, and I'm a stop and smell theflowersgarbage kind of guy.As your attorney I advise you refund this and feel no remorse.Oh, but isn't that 'scummy'?Opinions will differ among the community, but mine is that there's nothing intrinsically wrong with a high number of achievements in a game, even if they're trivially obtainable, IF there is something resembling of a game in there. I'm not talking stellar graphics or a completely original concept. The ZUP! possibly eternal series, hated by many, is one such example of a game that is a game. Personally I found it pleasurable to overcome the albeit easy physics puzzles and move on to the next level. They are thought through. For another example, see Turret Terminator, a simple yet satisfying game that doesn't excel in originality or graphics, spams achievements like there's no tomorrow, but is a game and has a gameplay. Those two (among other examples) knowingly exploit the fact achievement hunters will feel the need to buy it, but at the same time offer something in return.Employee Recycling Center isn't anything. If you support this, you're supporting the real ""TEH RED BUTTAN"", which if no one else makes it, I will, and you'll only have to press it once to get 3000 achievements. And if I make it and it goes through greenlight (and you know it will) and you don't refund it, I'll be laying on a beach in the French Polynesia laughing at you idiots.* The term 'game' is loosely used here in order to prevent too much digression. I trust the reader can come up with more appropriate descriptors."

,Not Recommended,629030,33526270,Posted: 13 July,all,Jeath (Spoon Ninja),"Put simply This game is just there to easily get achievments and you can do that in under half an hour. All but 4 of the achivements involve hitting a button. Theres no tutorial no explanation on what to do ,it only contains one stage and theres no menu, intro or ending.Oddly it had no problem with an xbox 360 controller using standard dual stick movement.I got it on special for 33 cents and after completing the achievments I have no wish to play it again.  If you want to get a game for easy achievments then get it when its cheap. If your lookin for some fun this probly isn't for you."

,Not Recommended,629030,31812360,Posted: 17 May,all,Mistah J,"Seems like Employee Recycling Center was made only for the 500 achievements, most of which are awarded after pressing a single button.

If you want a ""game"" that you can spend more than 20 minutes ""playing"" (notice my use of quotes when describing this product), don't settle for this. There are many better free alternatives."

,Not Recommended,629030,34645224,Posted: 31 August,all,TAOZIBUB,"Released in 2017 from Idea Cabin comes Employee Recycling Centre. You play as an employee who was left behind during an emergency, and are locked inside your work place. Covered in blood and bodies, you are left with nothing to do but clean up after the accident.When I first saw this, I thought it was going to be like Viscera Cleanup Detail, just a cheaper knock off version, and decided to get it as a bit of fun before I got Viscera Cleanup Detail.This was nothing like Viscera Cleanup Detail. I assume in some ways it is, from the gameplay I’ve see, but this is a really simple game. You open a door, press a button, clean up some blood and bodies, destroy some barrels, and you’re done. That’s it. That’s the game. Luckily, this only takes under an hour to complete.I was honestly bored out of my mind playing this. I thought there would at least be some jump scares, or something like that, considering that this is classed as a horror game, but there was nothing. There was no audio other than the sound of footsteps, and the buzz of the evacuation machine are the only things to keep you entertained; oh and the brushing sounds of the mop.This game is pretty well made, in honesty. It runs quite fast but that’s pretty much all the positive things there are about this game. Good for achievement hunters – pressing a button gets you 500 achievements – but other than that, there’s nothing that makes this game worth playing."

Got all in 8 minutes of gameplay.Pick up the game if you can get it cheap and are, like me, an achievement hunter. Don't expect much fun during those few minutes however."
,Not Recommended,629030,35199865,Posted: 25 September,all,[ Maxie ],"I honestly don't know what was going through the developers' heads when they made this. Your job is simple: clean up a mess left behind. Why? How? None of these questions are answered.There is one plus point to the game and that's that it runs fast. Bad news? Uh... pretty much everything else. This is a poor man's Viscera Cleanup Detail and to even compare it to that feels weird. At least Viscera Cleanup Detail was fun while you were cleaning various locations! This... clean a few rooms and a few low quality blood decals.The music and sounds are good so I suppose that's another plus point. But plus points are few and far between in a game... wait did I say game? There's really not enough substance here to warrant the title of 'game'.The premise could have been something interesting: the only surviving employee of a facility has to find out what happened to their coworkers while cleaning up the messes and discovering a terrible truth. But the execution is honestly terrible.At least I only paid £0.08 for it with a coupon so that's nice at least.Employee Recycling Center? More like Achievement Farming Center.I personally couldn't recommend this at all. Even at £0.79 there isn't enough substance to justify paying that. Unless you want an achievement and trading card farmer that'll take you two hours or so, if that."

,Not Recommended,629030,31955943,Posted: 25 May,all,Zombie1987,"The game seemed fun at first, but got boring fast. I had a friend watching as I played, and we likened it to a cross of Viscera Cleanup and Portal, which would have been fine if the developer had delivered more than 10 minutes worth of gameplay. The blood cleanup is entirely optional, and only nets you an achievement for your troubles. Maybe the VR version is better, but this non-VR experience is sorely lacking in engaging gameplay. If you have 99 cents (or the regional equivalent) to burn, feel free to play the game, but I wouldn't recommend it personally."

Just an achievement machine, I believe this is one thing which allows this game to stand out. Receiving this for free, I decided to give it a try and after seeing my achievement count sky rocket, I considered this a great outcome. While many people review this in terms of a ""game"" and seem to refer back to the VR. I feel as if it would be greater for us, as well as the developer to classify it as an ""achievement simulator"" as it would be direct, could help attract people who are looking for achievements and possibly allow this game to stand out. I recommend this title, but only for the achievements which could boost one's profile. I feel as if the developer should make sure they are able to differentiate this from a game, then it could have some potential as a simulator."
