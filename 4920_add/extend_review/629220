And its cheap.Heres some Gameplay if you want:https://youtu.be/65KC8mQ2cAM"

If there is more content to come, than I'm very much looking forward to it and think that the price for now may be alright. I will update this review again upon full release. Thanks.Gonna keep this short and sweet. :)I enjoyed this game! I feel like the price tag is a little high for only an hour of gameplay though. I would be more comfortable paying something closer to $4.99.I didn't find any bugs to squish, only a few very minor spelling or grammatical errors. Which is pretty good I think.I feel that this game had a solidly spooky atmosphere and the story was easy to follow. I liked that the puzzles weren't too hard either. And collecting duckies! <3Overall, a neat little spooky game that I would reccommend picking up on sale. I'm looking forward to seeing more from these Devs."
,Recommended,629220,34017239,Posted: 4 August,all,Touch Me I'm Twelve.,"Getting straight to the point this is probably one of the scariest VR experiences out there right now. Not a lot phases me but some parts of this game gave me serious heart palpitations. The music and ambience of the game is perfect, the lighting is great and although it is trackpad movement it was a pleasure to explore the locations in great detail. The game runs without any hiccups, it even offers an option to enhance text on letters and notes if you're hard of VR reading. The ONLY issues i have with the game is sometimes getting the right angle to pick something up can be a little awkward and also this game is TOO scary at times ;p Worth the money albeit a short experience? Absolutely, it's definitely a quality over quantity experience you won't forget."

But this game, or ""experience"" held my attention very well. The music and sound effects are excellent. The video quality and graphics are also excellent.  And the jump scares...I won't even rate! (yea...that good)I sincerely hope there will be more to this game in the future. Highly recommended!"
76561198350815057,Recommended,629220,34047314,Posted: 5 August,all,themackmetroid,"To begin, please note I played this early access version game sitting down with a Oculus Rift headset using a Xbox controller in Steam VR settings (in comfort mode). While I did try to use Oculus mode - as of yet the game is not configured so the 3D rendering of graphics does not configure correctly, so thus I used Steam VR. This wouldn't have been much of an issue if it wasn't for the blue chaperone ring heavily distracting with the VR immersion. Fortunatlely however I managed to fix the problem using less then orthodox methods (I dont blame the developers for the issue as it is a Steam VR feature but Oculus support would be welcome as this then would not be a problem).  Anyhow on to the game.For the price its worth you get a good 60-90 mins of a decent VR experience. Objects look sharp and focused, the option to read documents in text format is also welcome) while mantaining a decent level  of detail constantly throughout. The sound effects are good and effective for drawing out the atmosphere and keeping you on your toes (perhaps one exception though is the sound of your own footsteps which dont sound quite right - more like a horse slow trotting then geniune human footsteps). The controls were fine with the Xbox controller and could easily pick out interactions with the VR headset. However support with the oculus touch controllers would give a lote more to the game (I believe you can play with the controllers, but no hand gestures).Without spoiling anything, there were some nice horror effects that leave you craving for more once the experience is completed - though it must be said all the events and actions are scripted to trigger (so if you know whats to come it no longer seems so tense). Some random actions/effects would go a long way to keep the player in suspense throughout the experience. There are also a couple of times the user actually needs to use the VR headset as a means to control their direction. While doable the sensor isnt as responive as it should be - needing you to still shift the camera with the right stick while controlling your direction with the headset.During my experience there were no bugs of glitches (though to nitpick, the scaling of the film projector and couch at the very begining seemed a bit big). There wasnt really anything of a story or character development besides the clues left behind in the documents you collect - though there are some rubber ducks which purpose remains a mystery?To conclude this is a promising title to play in VR. Oculus configuation and touch gesture support would do wonders - however the game provides a creepy vibe without going overboard with jump scares. For £5 it is a short but reasonable VR experience (believe it can be played outside VR - but I honestly dont see of what the point would be). Looking forward to hopefully the complete version."

76561198191401023,Recommended,629220,34177519,Posted: 11 August,all,DrWhoFan,"Very pleasantly surprised so far. Reminds me of one of my favorites, Layers of Fear. Slow methodical exploration of a very creepy atmosphere. I often buy several games at once and then test them to make sure they function properly and to detemine what controls are used. It's not often that while doing that I just keep playing cause I don't want to stop but that's how I felt about Rise of insanity.There are many games at this price point where you're only in one room or in a small environment, so I was glad to find that you explore many environments. Surprising how some slightly disturbing artwork adorning the walls can help ceate a sense of dread, Cool game.Oh, yeah. I also love Rise of Insanity because it has full freedom of movement using a controller. There's a great impetus to design games to use the Vive controllers but that is not the best approach for many games. Teleporting is for wimps. Deal with it wimp :~)"

76561198014910652,Recommended,629220,34696054,Posted: 2 September,all,Nuttyape,So I am about to finish this game soon. so before i ruin my big ending I think i want to review it (I'll update this review after)I have been playing this game in VR using my PSVR headset and a xbox controllerhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbCyCtrH4mQ&t=52shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTf0H3AIb0&t=15sFirstly the atmosphere in this game is absolutely stunning. You can tell the developers have taken time in adding small details to the world that you are in. Be it from the child's toys or the layout of the family home. It's good to see a budget friendly game that has not just been slapped together using unity assets.The jumpscares in this game are few but WELL PLACED. they Let tension build up long enough to where you expect a jumpscare but it dose not come (untill you start to relax then BAM! hahaha)I love the face this is a seated experiance due to not having a VIVE. being able to play this on my psvr is super cool.I'll be sure to update this rewive once I have got to the dramtic ending.but for now I am LOVING IT9/10!!

I noticed I can just walk through walls and doors like they arn't even there If I want to so the devs may want to work on that.  but just noped out of one senerio for a bit because it gave me so serious willys so it is totally doing what it is supposed to do.  good sound.  voice acting is good. like I said,. optimize the graphics and fix the walls and doors and it's better.  I'm going to reccomend though for 6 bucks.  3 out of 5"

I sit down (as reccomended) and use the steam controller (as reccomended)  but the act of rotating my virtual body with the trackpad always results in motion sickness. Reducing the trackpad sensitivty help a little but then I'm turning sooo slowly that the gameplay suffers. I've lots of other VR games and can play those without issue (even windlands) This is the only negative aspect of the game , it looks great and story is engaging but this is big enough for me to have had a negative experience overall, breaks smy heart cus I really want to play!"

If you're an owner of a VR headset and seeking for a memorable experience, this game is for you. Not sure if this release has anything to do with Layers of Fear or not, but the stylistic approach is very similar and I absolutely love it.

The puzzles were quite easy, but the story and atmosphere make up for that.It would be really nice (but not essential) if we could have the option of room scale, and be able to interact directly with the environment (instead of aiming with the head, use the hands).There are a couple of places where props are not sitting on their surfaces correctly.Looking forward to the full release!

76561197987289348,Not Recommended,629220,34046054,Posted: 5 August,all,Malrubius,"Very disappointed with interface and track motion. Not including teleport as an option cuts out a large potential audience. Playing this in VR is a nauseating experience, especially on a GTX 1050 which is too jittery. Why do you waste processing bandwidth mirroring to the desktop screen anyway? GTX 970 as minimum VR requirements is a flat out lie.This is obviously a traditional PC screen game with VR clumsily tacked on. There is no use of the Vive motion controllers beyond the trigger. I feel this was either released too early, or the developer lacks any VR development experience but wanted to put something out in VR. Just reading the triggers and registering where you are looking seems like a lazy way to substitute the mouse.The actual game content seems intriguing though, and I would love to play this through; it feels somewhat like A Chair In A Room, which by the way, is extremely well done, and fully interactive. Anyone interested in this genre should play that first for comparison -- much better production values.I won't refund because I'll give it a chance to progress far enough to where I can play it, but as it stands, it'll hibernate in my library on the 'not-ready' shelf."

76561198075525997,Recommended,629220,34970357,Posted: 15 September,all,budwheizzah,"Very impressive. There are three main technical issues however: First the recenter key needs to be pressed EVERY scene load (The R key by default). Otherwise you end up feeling like you're crawling on the floor. Secondly the aliasing is too strong, suggest offering a resolution scale option so we can boost this to 1.3 or 1.4x... although I know we can do this through our own runtimes. Lastly and most important: The world scale is wrong, it's about 75% of what it should be. It's not mega jarring, but it could lead newbies to motion sickness by giving them an ""overcramped"" feeling.Aside from that this game makes me think of Layers of Fear in its presentation; heck even the voice sounded familiar. Funny because I first played this game right after a 3 hour long session of LoF so I can compare off fresh memory. I was at one point convinced this was made by the same folks but apparently it isnt'; they're just using the presentation standard built up by LoF and maybe SOMA.Very worth buying if you like some good atmospheric high tension horror."
