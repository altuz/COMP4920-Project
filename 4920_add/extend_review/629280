,Not Recommended,629280,31962772,Posted: 25 May,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"This visual novel isreally bad. I wish I was exaggerating but I’m not. Not only the English translation is awful, the story and the dialogues are badly written (even their names were spelled wrong or the developers just… WROTE OTHER RANDOM NAMES??), all the characters are cliché and honestly, there’s nothing to like about them. They’re just empty vessels playing their role in this small urine puddle that they call “a deep and heartbreaking storyline”.The art is okay (it seems it’s stock art, at least from what I read on the discussion board). That’s the ONLY thing to praise here, and it wasn’t even made by the developers of this title.Like a lot of people already said, run away from this garbage."

I already owned this game when It was a simple badge title with the steam trading cards. Now the dev decided to give it 6666 achievements because why not? The issue is that the game doesnt work. I tend to purchase games, load them up and get the 3-6 card drops for ""playing"" the games so when this had an update for the 6666 achievements I re-downloaded it and came to find out that after the 2nd still image the game crashes to black. Music is there, I can move my mouse, no progression brickwalled.Of course that means I cant get any of the 6666 achievements, the cache was fine, no missing files. Dev isnt really talking but he already got paid so who cares right? I feel like a kid in the candy store and not only can I buy this 100% achievement darling, but they are out of stock with this particular flavor and im only staring at the window display model.I need this fixed."

,Not Recommended,629280,34766057,Posted: 5 September,all,TAOZIBUB,"From bch waves studio comes Run Away, an achievement hunting game that is somehow worse than their previous Sisters in hotel, which featured incest.This is an achievement hunting game with absolutely no interesting plot line, sub par art work, and broken achievements. Yes, an achievement hunting game with broken achievements. Let’s just have a round of applause for the developers here. The “awesome background music” feature on the Steam page is subpar and horrible and I ended up muting my laptop and putting earphones in, jamming to my own music. Luckily, I didn’t have to actually look at this game long enough to even get through the majority of the horrendously boring story line – it can sit on a black screen and get all your achievements for you.Truth be told, I only got this to rank on True Steam Achievements – if you sign up because of this review, please put “transyo” in the user who referred you section, thanks – and even that makes this a waste of £3.99. I highly regret spending £4 on this game, heck I could have bought two or three subpar games with an interesting plot and decent soundtrack and stories.Mistakes were made. Serious mistakes were made."
,Not Recommended,629280,32990411,Posted: 29 June,all,FatBatMan,"This is supposed to be a story about 5 people who go away for a weekend, but I've given up on that because so far I've been introduced to Ash, Ai, Kim, Rin, Kei, Yuki, Emma, Charlie, Scott and, I dunno about you, but that's more than 5 people.The spelling is terrible, the writing is garbage and clearly written by someone who has no ability to tell stories - here are some choice examples:- ""They kiss a few more times"" Wow. Can you handle the steaminess?- ""He turns the car off but it keeps sputtering"" Not how cars work. At all.- There's also a bit where they all toast each other and drink Scotch (I think - the names change a lot)while they're still drivingAnyway...don't get it unless the sole reason you want it is for 6666 achievements."
