76561198022401518,Recommended,630900,32626888,Posted: 21 June,all,Nightnest,"Good program is good.The price is ridiculously reasonable for the software provided.The UI and what you can do within the program are easy to quickly understand.Make maps SO EASILY. Almost requires no effort.I have only a few issues, which may be due to my negligence in looking for answers at this current moment.I’ve run into some issues with larger maps, the lag monster and what have you. Icons seem to produce this effect more so than others. I am uncertain if there is any way to easily remove items.  And lastly, the UI could be built a little more “I’m a newb” friendly, but really, it’s only a fluff thing.Just slight minor things that really don’t change how awesome this program is for the price and what you’re actually getting out from it.I am happy to support this even if it doesn’t take any steps further, though I hope it still receives some love!"
,Recommended,630900,31820564,Posted: 18 May,all,Zeay,"I am not a fan of early access, but I've missed some good battlemaps creation programs, and this one will be a favorite in the future!Right now I do have some problems with lag, I've not checked the settings quite yetted as I only checked it quickly.And for export, I was a little confused, couldn't find a way to remove the grid lines as I preffer to use Roll20's grid line.Otherwise a very good program, I love the style of the maps I did quickly, I'll be checking in on it regulary!"
,Recommended,630900,32838938,Posted: 26 June,all,HeyYouAndrew,"It's beauty is in it's simplicity. I bought another similar piece of software at the same time (which is more feature rich), but out the gate this is very usable. It has options to custom import object assets (though, no tile import yet), can easily set up grids... again, it does what it does, and it does it very well.A few minor nitpicks which you may come across; it stores assets in the .appdata folder, it doesn't have a traditional UI (this is especially apparent when saving/loading files), and exporting a full map in .png format to Photoshop doesn't seem to be a smooth as it could be.Still, very strongly recommended if you're needing to make tabletop maps for print or digial use."

Within the first two minutes after I bought the program I had already finished my first map, this was without having any previous experience using the program. This is a very easy and helpful tool for making game maps.You can save the maps as .png and just drop them in roll20 then right mouse button on the map and under advanced press align to the grid to automatically align the grids. It takes minutes from idea to having a map in roll20.It is a solid concept and If they keep improving it and we build a small community, this could become the tool to use for making D&D maps. I will definitely be using this program a lot in the future to make maps for my D&D games."
76561198064537949,Recommended,630900,31946240,Posted: 24 May,all,Volkor316,"Overall I think this is a decent bit of software. It isn't without its issues, but hopefully those will be addressed by the dev(s). I look forward to future updates to see what they can do with this.Pros:-It looks great, and it doesn't take a lot of time to make something that looks decent-It is easy to use, barely more complicated than Paint.-It has a lot of decent floors and walls.Cons:-Input lag between placing things and them appearing.-It has a limited amount of icons for objects (It takes a Firepit object for example)-It isn't very intuitive and that makes it annoying to do some things.Some icon recommendations for the developers: A firepit, fallen trees, stumps, a better looking chest, some smaller rocks, coloured barrels (on their sides and on their bases), a double bed, a fountain, a cart, coffins, double doors, a small rowboat, some rubble piles and some trash piles.And some other things on my personal wish list:-Something to indicate a change in height (so you can have a hill, or an elevated chamber in a dungeon)-The option to change the size of icons"

I've been using Virtual Battlemap for my Fantasy Grounds game up until now and this software is going to replace VBM as my go to software for making most battle maps. VBM is great for awesome looking maps but isn't great for making small files or large maps.This fills that niche quite nicely and the interface is simple, elegant, and easy to use.Highly recomended!"
,Recommended,630900,33101969,Posted: 1 July,all,Scoobs,Well made compared to a lot of the software that has done the same thing. I am hoping for more in the future but overall it does what it needs to do.
,Recommended,630900,32727812,Posted: 24 June,all,Thecal714,"I DM on Roll20 a lot and am constantly on the lookout for maps that will match the encounters I build for my characters. While this tool isn't perfect, it's a really, really good way to quickly build custom caves, buildings (Edge Paint is your friend), and other areas in which your players will be fighting/exploring. To be totally honest, I still add bits and bobs via Roll20, but to have most of the map done (and at a known size!) is a treat.This is a must for any DM who uses a virtual table top!All of that said, the UI is less than idea and hopefully that gets worked out by the time this leaves early access."
,Recommended,630900,33075646,Posted: 1 July,all,Ozons1,"I experimented a bit with this map maker and so far it looks quite good (of course, need to flesh out some stuff, but it is still in early access so it is expected).It offers enough tools and options so you can make most maps which you want to make (tiles, rotating stuff, undoing wrong changes).For this price you are getting quite a good product, which is still improving. Is great for new DM who want to use map maker but do not want to spend fortune."
,Recommended,630900,31830878,Posted: 18 May,all,Native Faith,"Pros:- It's exporting functions work well, and I have a friend who exported their maps to play on Tabletop Simulator (available on steam as well) and it looks and works great.- Maps look nice for little effort involved. Automatically created jagged edges and such look great, as in the examples given on the store page.Cons:- It isn't particularly a time saver compared to sketching boundaries or labeling stuff with a pen. That will always be fastest and you can control how much the players see that way.- While you can import icons, the current icon set is very sparse. Importing icons is time spent searching for tiny chairs and the like.- Most the tiles demand to be fully colored in, which sucks for printing. You can't just convert the desert tiles, for example, to printer-friendly black and white squiggles representing dunes or something.- Shortcuts are helpful, but slightly archaic. Every key means something.Conclusion is that at under 5 bucks, it's ideal for GM's who have time to prepare their maps beforehand to play online. However, it's so ink-expensive to print these maps that I wouldn't consider these for the in-person games I run. I would much rather use a pen and reveal terrain as it's explored for in-person campaigns. Make sure you fall into one category or the other before buying it."

76561197996971082,Recommended,630900,31833397,Posted: 18 May,all,✏pencils✏,"Tile based paint program with edge painting options. The software has built in edge smoothing. The software is still being developed, so while there is a fully featured manual map creation feature, there is also a mostly functional procedural dungeon generation framework in place, but it is yet to be documented.The software makes maps visually very similiar to Conquest of Elysium 3 / 4 maps, but on a smaller scale. There are also options to lay a hex grid over the map and a set of black and white tiles for ink conservation. A user can export to a specified paint program or output to a pdf. I don't really do any tabletop gaming at this point in my life, but it's fun to play around with the options (like all Illwinter software) and look forward to the procedural generation features. There is no manual yet but I can expect a good 15-20 page pdf up soon.There is quite a bit of utility here for the price. Illwinter is one of those indie development houses that really stands out for their unique and high quality work."

,Recommended,630900,31831041,Posted: 18 May,all,emeralis00,"Deleted old review, which was predicated on a mistake on my part.The game has a few odd UI design choices, and could use some work, but once it was pointed out it works just fine."
76561198227235100,Not Recommended,630900,33723289,Posted: 22 July,all,Tommy,"This program is good for creating small dungeon maps. Key word: SMALL. You won't be able to create a map of a decent sized city, let-alone a world map. I would have been happy if I could just create a map for one continent in my campaign setting, but nope, can't do that. The problem is that it runs out of memory and crashes if you make your map over 50 tiles wide. If you're running a very quick game and just need to make a short, linear dungeon for your play session then this program can probably deliver and make some beautiful maps. But if you're running a more ambitious open world campaign over a long period of time and want to create maps for your whole world, save your money. I'm hoping this issue will be eventually resolved, at which time I will try it out and potentially change this review to positive."

,Recommended,630900,33101973,Posted: 1 July,all,SaltyStormtrooper,"Great for using as a map generator for my upcoming dnd games, could definitly use a few textures for roofs and perhaps being able to change the color of the black and white icons would be a neat feature! regardless, looking forward to the progress made on this and hope to see it progress greatly from where it is!"
,Recommended,630900,33349926,Posted: 7 July,all,ProphetPX | GameKit.com,"This program does exactly what it says, and being pre-release still has a few bugs. But nothing major other than a little bit of lag. The current amount of textures, icons, and other place-able graphics in this app are STILL WOEFULLY LACKING, but you get at least basics. And Steam Worlshop ability is now at least initially supported (there is 1 tiny symbol pack in workshop now), so I believe that there will come, in the not too distant future, a LOT of graphic art contributions both from the developer and from it's Steam user community.It's a WORTHY BUY, and definitely helpful for making things like small dungeons, homes, and other buildings or outdoor encounter areas. DEFINITELY BUY IT because the development is at least going somewhere. Unlike other apps in the past, by other people."
76561198334482823,Recommended,630900,33490766,Posted: 12 July,all,emilcruziv,"I'm very much looking forward to the updates, additions, and full release of this software. I cannot find another like it. My only issue is that I cannot find a way to load my saved dungeons. Early access, yes, but I thought I'd point that out. If I may make a suggestion: I want to print out my dungeons. However, that uses a TON of ink. It would be great to give black and white options, similar to the ones we see on house floor plans, to save on ink, if need be."
,Recommended,630900,32669374,Posted: 23 June,all,Dr.Strangelove,I am excited to see this product grow and would love more content for creating scenes for my PC's in games I host.
,Recommended,630900,34050060,Posted: 5 August,all,Laggytoes,"This is exactly what it says it is: a floorplan generator. It's great for FLOOR plans, not full battlemap creation tool. It has a few items you can place (like barrels), but fundamentally, this is a dead simple tool for building floorplans that you can then populate in other programs (like GIMP or Photoshop) with more detailing. It's worth every penny in my opinion and saves me a ton of time."
76561198004614474,Recommended,630900,34275347,Posted: 16 August,all,DocDidge,"Great tool for creating battlemaps, unfortunally not many Mods avaiable atm. but it´s worth the price.You can export your maps to .jpg and print them. I do that for my group and i realized, that those mini figures from the RISK boardgame are matching the 5 ft. squares."
