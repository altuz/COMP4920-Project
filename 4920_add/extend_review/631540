76561198006524453,Not Recommended,631540,34010307,Posted: 4 August,all,Hassie54,"This game should be in Early Access. It needs to be stated that this game is in early access, as it is buggy, and constantly has problems that, while they may not cause the game to crash itself, it might as well be crashing, as the game becomes frustrating, untennable or just impossible to get anything done for next to no reason that is noticeable to the player. While it may have been common place for games to be released to small crowds for testing purposes  for many years, it has become common place to charge money for games that are not completed, and many times cannot be considered a game. Many devs ruin their games by releasing them many months before they should, and the damage done to the reputation of the game and many times the reputation of the devs themselves can never be fully fixed. This game is not functional to the standard that games should be at to be released at this time.While Community Inc has many interesting game ideas, and fun mechanics that are done slightly differently than other games of a similar type, which gives the player the feeling like they are playing something very new, while also being familiar, if you understand what I'm trying to say. The game does not make the player feel like they are doing anything really different from other games, but it somehow gets the player to feel like they are playing a new and different type of game, which is not something easy to do, and the dev should be commended for doing that, especially at this early stage of development, for a ""completed"" game. This game just needs so much more work.The game's ai at this stage needs a lot of work. It seems like the workers do not follow orders, or build items in the order listed, and at times don't seem to function after an hour the same way they were functioning after 10 minutes. It really feels like the workers mood has too much affect, and the options regarding the map settings are too limited, and the option to either play with no enemies, or play normally need some more in between. The affect of sleeping on the ground, or speed at which the moods go down should be added for balance too. This would not fix the problem, and the inability for guards to do their jobs, because of blocking causes too many deaths, and merely causes frustration. Lumberjacks getting killed because they stand in one spot so the wolf can kill him, yet the guard is running in place and cannot seem to walk around the lumberjack to kill that wolf. This does not cause a crash to desktop, but it might as well, as playing the game after watching 3 people die because the guards cannot do their job because of a simple game mechanic problem, is not fun, and removes any immersion the game may have allowed for up to that point.This game will probably be a must buy if it has been developed to the point that there aren't any game breaking bugs, mechanics problems or UI issues. I don't know if the devs plan on raising the price, though I would have accepted this game being in the $15-$20 range, if they added about 5 times the research subject, 10 times the craftable items, and if they add steam workshop support, this could very easily be genre setting title, being a new type of City Builder/Tycoon/Strategy game with a fun cartoony art style. Steam doesn't give many options for reviewing, a it is either yes or no, and as of right now, assuming no more work is done on this game, I would have to say no, I cannot recommend this game to anyone at this time. I don't know if the dev has plans to make this game into something more, and if you get it on sale, it might be fun for a couple hours, as I spent 3 hours, and if the game ending mechanics problems were fixed, I could see it being fun enough to allow for 10-15 hours of gameplay, although I will reiterate that with a little more work, this game's style, ideas and game mechanics could be made into a very fun, and very unique style game with TONS of replay value. The dev would need to put in the work, though at this point in the game, most of the work has been done. I hope the dev decides to make this game the juggernaut of a tycoon game it was always meant to be.TLDR The game was released too early, and not in early access, but it is early access TBH, and should have spent another 6 months being developed. WAIT for the work to be done, and check back to see if  the dev has put in the fixes the game needs, then buy the game, as it could be worth it, assuming you like the genre this game is in, or the genre split this game could create."

This is an incomplete early access game mascarading as a full release to avoid that stigma. While it is fun it is not entirely wholesome. I do not approve of a game having buttons, features, and options shown that have no functionality or implementation when they are obviously intended for the game to have them all along. This made some of the gameplay disconnected and caused a few issues. It just gives the feel that they pushed the game out early and I can't recommend any kind of product that does that."
76561198019775422,Not Recommended,631540,34048649,Posted: 5 August,all,neocwbbr,"This game is being updated almost daily since I bought it. To be honest, I don't like when buy a game full of bugs but the work developers are doing, even if they havent stated the game as Early Access, is ok. I will keep updating this review til the point I would recomend it or just bringing more bugs to be fixed. Nice job updating the game T4 Interact.2017-Aug-09Agricultors in auto collect mode wont move to the center of the town while attackedI had my entire village wiped out by disease on day 4. Pour guys :(2017-Aug-07Some builds ignore the streets while others wont allow you to build over it.Warriors stay at bed if your city is attacked during night. They should move to the previous point they were before going to the bed.SUGGESTIONS:Include an option to select resources where the player would like the villagers to go collect them (eg. to clean an area and construct some building).Include a screen notification to show an attack (e.g. an arrow on the edges of the screen pointing to where your village is being attacked or on fire)Shortcut key to select iddle villagers.Night watchers: As the guards sleep at night, you could include an option to have night guards or even DOGS! (they could alert the guards)Include an Autosave option (which will not overwrite users save but guarantee the game is saved if the pc/game crashes.)-----------------------------ON GOING: Hit box area for buildings are not 100% ok. (patch 1.0.8 fixed issues for Markets however other buildings still having problem).FIXED: Selecting a warrior and trying to move camera around will make the warrior move to the place instead of move the camera. (Patch 1.0.8 fixed the camera issue)FIXED: Your village will be set on fire at day 6th so save resources and make sure you have a copy of all desks. (Patch 1.0.8 fixed the issue with meteours)FIXED: Workers are not trying to stop the fire or are getting the water in far places (I had a fontain close to the house where beds were on fire and they crossed the village to get water) (Patch 1.0.11)FIXED: If you wont allow to have 2 warehouses give some option to upgrade them. 1800 stock is not enough. (Patch 1.0.8 reduced price for warehouse houver you still having only 1 and 2200 slots. Plus, you can use different items to increase by 30 each the space, but some of them can get fire during meteor rain or attacks) (Patch 1.0.10 and game configs were exposed so you can configure it by yourself)FIXED: Streets need to be fixed as it wont always match the next one. Also needs a way to remove the streets. (Patch 1.0.11. Now you can remove streets)FIXED: Removing objects make them explode so you wont get any resource back. (Considering patch 1.0.11 decreased the price and now you can exclude most of the objects in the game. Still, you cant remove buildings)FIXED: Fishing dock is not working as the fishing profession (which seems to always go farming). (Patch 1.0.9/1.0.10 Decreased time fish takes to spot. Also you can configure the settings check patch 1.0.11 for exposed settings)FIXED: Sallers always go around collecting items and wont stay in the  market. (Somewhere between patches 1.0.9 and 1.0.10 comerciants are now staying in the market)FIXED: Lings ignore the streets which makes them walk slow. (Patch 10.0.11 Fixed partially)-----------------------------------------------------------Developers still working on game so if you dont mind play with bugs its ok."
76561198009418230,Not Recommended,631540,34205643,Posted: 12 August,all,ZakusMaximus,"This game has a number of issues and should be in early access. While I've been having fun with the game I've encountered a number of issues besides my inexeprience with the game. Perhaps the most frustrating is that I cannot remove buildings or even my gardens once placed. My minions fail to gather resources routinely leaving me wondering why, depsite my functioning cotton farms, I have no cotton.On a more fun note however I had an entire community commit suicide after the death of a few lings. This came after a bout of flu, some wolf attacks, and a few fires. It was more of a ""WTF"" moment than a ""holy crap this game is broken"" thing. Very entertaining."
76561198026117506,Recommended,631540,34031078,Posted: 4 August,all,holydoughnuts,"I do recomend this to the kind of people who like hard games. I do not recomend it to people who do not like die and retry game... then again i might just be bad.  Thus said, playing this makes me feel like playing don't starve for the first time, in the sense that i died in the first few days every game in the first hours, but everytime i learned something new that made me last a few more hours in game in the next one. I like that you build empty house and then fill them up how you like. When you look at how many building there are one might think it's really thin, but i beleive it's only in appearance because they do not come furnished. Everytime you try to make something you realise you are missing 3 items and a few professions wich i like alot.It's a different experience from the lattest city management games... i just came out really bummed out about kingdom and castle that i mastered in 3 hours.It does not feel finished yet but i feel confident that it will become even better..Cons for me are a few little wacky things like trader leaving post to bring mats to a building while there are customers in line, and builders ignoring fire when there is an attack resulting in a apocalyptic fire. There are a few important details also missing for some items like how many people can you sit at a table? Do they even use tables and chairs? How many chairs can you put? Why does 1 round table need a level 1 carpeter while the square one needs a level 2 and there isn't any stat difference?Pros: different experience, hard with a good learning curve, big maps, simple yet efficient diplomacy for a city management game. T4 seems to be present and willing to make their game better.I feel that i have written more cons that pros but i do really like this game and recommend it, i just don't know how to write stuffPs: excuse chaotic sentenses and grammar, english is not my first language."
,Recommended,631540,34075916,Posted: 6 August,all,captainzambonee,Its a great game im having alot of fun but i have a major issue with a couple of things i always do just fine until they all kill themselves even if they get sick and one dies the others get sad and kill themselves this becomes a butterfly effect and they all start dying and i have to quickly sell out and start over??? Maybe if i found out how to fix all the sick villagers! i cant seem to get the hang of it but i do get better and my town gets better every go around! Ill chalk it up to a learning curb but i still believe there should be balancing! On top of that there needs to be numerous ways to produce happiness and mood i only found 2 ways to increase mood and 1 way to increase happiness this is important to me for obvous reasons im tired of them killing themselves!!! I mean in real life people are survivors we inhabit the most unimaginable places and when the going gets tough we stick with and and power on only those with physcoligical disorders kill themselfs! Cant there be another drawback of no happiness??? I mean susicide is a last resort not the first when we are sad...
76561198064258829,Recommended,631540,34018837,Posted: 4 August,all,Sleepless Gamer,"Community Inc is a village management game. So far I've enjoyed the time I've spent in the game. If you like games that are similar to Banished, then you may like this game.Pros:- Pricing- Style- Different Races to interact with.Cons:- Some extra micro management (ex: Farmer doesn't auto harvest crops when mature.)- No Radius indicator for building placement and doesnt snap to roads.- No Food consumption indicator on UII'm sure the Cons could be fixed in future updates since the dev's plan on updating the game.

You cant delet buildings you no longer want in that area.2.Some times youre villagers get stuck running into each other and just stand there unable to move, as if the game froze but everything other than villagers still moves around.If the developer would fix those 2 problems this would be great for its asking price and while i enjoy this game, untill those 2 major problems get fixed i dont recommend purchase!"
76561198009490052,Not Recommended,631540,34041463,Posted: 5 August,all,Dezorden,"Very unfinish and unbalance.Many of the mechanics on the game are at 50% functioning and others make zero sense few examples,1.Cotton is not farm by farmers....But helbalists that more often that not they will neglect the crop for several days.2.Hunters Bring no meat.....3.Fishermans get one fish at the time walk all the way to the storage and head back to fish.........zzzz on top of that they need first a fishing dock!!! and river or lakes are pretty far from the main storage.4.Storage containers have no interaction all items go to a cart container or a warehouse if it build. No efficiently at all is imposible to make a effecient chain or flow of resources.5.Many UI problems too many to write them all most of the UI is incompleted.In 5 hours I have been unable to pass 18 days without running into a big problem that ends the game.6. Even if you have 6 farmers they focus on the closer 3 to 4 crops and ignored the rest, making it imposible to grow all the ingredients for recipes the raise their morale and they don't commit suicide.7. Like I mention above most of the food souces are bug making it almost impossible to have more that 8 settlers.8.Random events in a instant all your settlers can get sick or all your crafting tables can caugh fire?#@$ or meteors destory your base making you rage quit after losing everything.Here it is see a game finish by a random event on day 3. :0http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1103475746SAVE YOU MONEY FOR NOW."

However, i do agree they should have started in beta.Pros+DifficultAlot of people are having issues keeping their people alive. I'd say after the 2nd run i was able to do alot better while still having some challenges.+Decent MusicThe music is relaxing and when in times of combat it gives off this urgency feel to it.+CombatIt gets very tatical at some point. Their was one situation where i helped other races soo much in a short period of time. That the other races who hated them started to attack me all at once. The battle i faced was 3 races and wolves all at the same time; leading to a total of 26 enemy units.It was insane on how i had to move my troops to defend my people, eventually i had to give everyone a sword to defend themselves from this attack. Even then i still lost 1 person. I'm just glad i had extra swords in my storage or my town would have been wipped out.+Endless/sell communityLove town builers that give you the option to keep on building or even sell your community to start over with extra cash.++Devs are working on game stillThis is always the best thing to see, they are giving really good communication as well on how the games development is going along.Cons-PathfindingNeeds some work, its gotten better to the point where they don't get stuck anywhere. However the troops after slaying an enemy will return to their post insteead of attacking other enemies.-BuggyAs far as bugs go, the only real problem i faced is when your soilders would return their swords after they eat and not get them back. Making your soilders only attack for like 3 damage.-Lack of contentAs i said at the begining should have started in beta, their are a few things that the descriptions say we should have but we don't. Luckly, as i said in the pros the devs are still working on the game and keeping us updated very well. :D"

Now, why when one ling commits suicide, do all the other lings follow and do the same? I get why, but at least hold that off farther off in the game. And also, I had about 80 plant fiber in storage, but none of my buildings are being built. But I have the fiber, just the lings won't bring it to the building. And yes, I have extra storage space. And the whole thing with the flu? When they /all/ get sick? idk maybe just the ones with the least mood should get sick, but not all. Idk. Its a fun and addicting game, but needs a lot of work"

Seen a couple of bugs but largely cosmetic and none that impacted game play that significantly. Either I have got lucky or they have fixed a lot since some of the reviews I have seen. its harder than a lot of similar games. I like it and it is quite unique. After, as always, refusing to play the tutorial it took a few attempts to learn enough to keep everyone alive for more than a couple of seasons. They die of plague, they get eaten by things and in one disastrous timeline they all committed suicide by throwing themselves on the campfire...  Recommend!Edit: I have to add though once you get the hang of it the content is a bit limited. I had assumed that as you conquer the achievements your title would get upgraded and new buildings, plants, professions etc would become available. But no. Still enjoyable to play though and no doubt more content will turn up soon!"

The ideas are really good and even though it has bugs, its kinda funny when some of them happen like a wave of indestructable wolves. Now the problems I had where like:Why is there no way to cancel orders of gathering? My storage keeps getting way too full because my people keep just collecting random stuff, Also the night time ambiance is so SO loud and you can't lower it. Some times the music just stops and the noises just are so loud, and its sorta frustrating that like your towns people just run and don't defend themselves. I really thought  about getting my money back cause this game seems unfinished, it's fun but it has WAAAAY to many bugs and seems like theres alot missing in it but doesn't mean its not fun and the Dev seems like they are really gonna listen and try to fix some stuff.

Building houses, farming, crafting, selling stuff, I really really really do like this game.Lots of buggy stuff. Needs to be able to prioritize picking up particular items rather than general types. Don't understand why we can only build one warehouse. Multiple barrels = massive fires = late game storage issue. Guards need to be more proactive like patrolling and putting out fires. And them having to reset to their starting position and then engaging a second attacker is poor. Definitely need better defensive options than some dude standing near a wagon and some fences."
