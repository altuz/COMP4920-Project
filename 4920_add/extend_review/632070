In fact, I loved it. the story is about the troubles in Ireland, which is extremely interesting to me in the first place, and I haven't seen any games cover that topic, really.Highly recommended. Beautiful storytelling that really got my feels at the end."
,Recommended,632070,31927881,Posted: 23 May,all,© FuzzDad,"Interesting story, wonderful voice acting, haunting music...very half-lifian in terms of simple puzzles and a few times during the game I was genuinely moved (the music really works here). Some of the things on screen basically shout the general storyline and it's not hard to figure out the ending well before the ending but that's ok...in some game formats (like this one and Dear Esther) it's ALWAYS about the journey and how you get to the end and what you learn is much more important than the end.  There were a few glitches (I could phase half-though a few doors, the plane crash sequence was...choppy, I'm not sure a single achievement worked, and my gametime counter only showed a half-an-hour when I played a good 2.5 hours) but none of them took anything away from the game. In terms of the ""Walkers"" I've played...better than Dear Esther but not quite Firewatch (that's not a bad thing mind-you but IMHO Firewatch was brilliant and it's in my top 10 games of ALL TIME) and getting something original and story-driven makes me happy. 90% FD Score. Buy it!"

I hear you cry.""Sit down...shut the ♥♥♥♥ up...and LISTEN,"" I reply.Alright, so I've been playing a few of these lately, and all you ""this isn't even a game"" people are probably getting mighty sick of all these products even existing. Well, y'know, sometimes life is hard. Sometimes, you don't get everything you want in this world. And sometimes, just sometimes, things come along which can defy even the expectations of those who swore black-and-blue that they'd never, ever embrace them.Let's break it down, shall we?First up, something these ""walking sims"" actually DO tend to be praised for: graphics. The Fidelio Incident allows you to choose ""Epic"" graphics quality, and I have to say, that's exactly what you get: epic graphics, from the get-go. You begin in the cockpit of a plane, and it isn't long before that plane is crashing thanks to a bird selflessly splattering itself across the windshield in high-def. So no, this isn't quite your typical walking sim.Secondly: sound. Top-rate, highly immersive sound design and very good voice acting. The occasional naff line of dialogue (""Ooh, blimey...so fookin' COLD...need to get warm"")...but hey, it IS a video game. Get over it.Thirdly: danger. Yep, there is some. Quite a bit, actually, mostly due to the harsh and unforgiving icy environments most of the game is set in. You will die. Possibly quite a lot. So again...not your typical walking sim.Fourthly: gameplay. The path isn't 100% linear, and there are some (granted, reasonably simple) puzzles to solve. So there is some traditional notion of ""gameplay"", for those of you who are truly fussed about such things. (Poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, haha.)Fifthly: length. Okay, so it's not ""epic"" in length. Nor should it be. I'm sick to death of long games for the most part. A game well under five hours might put some hair on yer sac...try it.And last but definitely not least: story. It's a good'un. A real good'un. Told well. You like stories, don't you? Oh, that's right, you only play Call of Duty. (Sorry, couldn't resist.)On the whole, it's a bit like Kholat (minus the monsters), with a tiny hint of Tomb Raider and the bit when you first crash-land on the icy planet in Dead Space 3 thrown in. High adventure and epic storytelling at its finest. Heck...with a little luck of the Irish, even avowed haters of walking simulators might find something to love here.You never do know, eh?Verdict: 9/10."

As things began to unravel through the collection of the diary pages, the more I was pulled in. The setting and music really did set an eerie tone. You don't always need monsters to have a game be unsettling! I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys these types of games."
,Not Recommended,632070,32307550,Posted: 9 June,all,★ DeputyDoge,"(WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK)I'm not gonna completely bash this game, because it really wasn't THAT bad, but it was not good or that entertaining.First of all its a walking simulator, similar to Firewatch but less interactive because the only things u can do is pick items up and either read them, spin the valves and have accessories activate when they need to. Now I really do not mind walking simulators, because I for one LOVED Firewatch, and this game is pretty simular but it doesn't hit the right spots like Firewatch does.The game had amazing graphics, it was made with a powerful engine and I believe its best played on high settings, if not the highest like I played them on. (Prob the best part of the game tbh)And I don't want to compare it to Firewatch anymore, so lets put that to the side.The game has an interesting story, and the first 10 or so minutes are really sweet but everything after the ""intro"" is boring. After you survive the plane crash and figure out whats up and what your task is, everything gets pretty boring and annoying because you have to walk through a bunch of ice and almost die every time you make it to another small area to warm up, infact I did die a few times luckily it doesnt start over. I wont lie though, at first entering the cave when you get the flashlight was intense because you don't know if something will pop up or not but again after those short few moments things just go back to being boring.The story somehow makes up for it, and I wont spoil that part and I do sort of like the very ending credits when you realize what happened to your character and why things in the environment ended up like that.Another thing that I found annoying was the underground bunkers/maze parts of the game where you had to run around and solve puzzles while trying to avoid freezing to death. I can see why some would think this is enjoyable and I guess if that's your thing then go for it, but for me that kind of ruined the whole game.Overall, the story was ok, I did not really like how the game ended but it was a good ending and it makes sense in the end.The gameplay part is repetitive and annoying at most parts.The game I believe can only be enjoyed in the highest graphics, I haven't tried the others but the graphics really make the game.If you like games where you have to solve puzzles and go through repetitive mazes while trying to get close to the objective but be sent back to square 1 a few times, then this is your game."

A two hour experience to be sure, but I feel the purchase was well justified for the experience, the story, and the visuals that were presented.Pros:=Great atmosphere - The locale and paths were beautiful and fairly well designed, even if it suffered a bit too much linearity, including the occasional invisible wall.=Beautiful graphical fidelity, photogenic views. (Dear Esther level of shutterbug)=Great voice acting, nice conviction and some very well conveyed emotion.=Light gameplay elements that both encourage and discourage appropriately.=Fantastic parallel story, seasoned with Irish revolutionary history and a loosening sense of what's real.=Absolutely fantastic musical score, I hope they release an OST!Cons:=Story doesn't -totally- wrap up at the end, you're still left wondering why certain things were the way they were, given the explanations at hand.=Freezing gameplay element encourages rushing through, when the point of a walking simulator is to walk.Issues:=Encountered the very occasional clip (carried door clips through the ground, saw through the ground for a brief moment while getting up)=Had an obvious invisible wall near some pipes in the cave, even though the space was big enough.=Got stuck in the ""among the dead"" area because of a lack of a way to jump out of what became my inch-deep death. (between some bones)TL;DR -- A walking sim that for all intents and purposes, conveys it's message and it's story serenely and almost totally satisfactorily. If you liked Dear Esther or Firewatch, this is right up there with the great interactive narratives.9/10"

The graphics are a high point most everyone will touch on, as they should. But the setting, and voice acting were highlights for me. It tries to tackle subject matter not often seen in games. And even though it's not the best game I've played this year I wouldn't give back my time with it, and I'd encourage other people to play it too."

The best I can put it is, if I could erase my memories of the game and leave myself with a recommendation, that would be: ""If you're actively looking for a game to play, it's worth $10; otherwise, buy it on sale.  You won't fall madly in love w/ it, but it'll entertain you for a cpl/few hours."""
,Recommended,632070,32876365,Posted: 27 June,all,callcifer,"A nicely done walking simulator telling the story of an Irish couple during The Troubles. Though a bit heavy handed in its symbolism, The Fidelio Incident still managed to impress me. Definitely worth a play."
,Not Recommended,632070,32244849,Posted: 7 June,all,Ryden-55,"I usually like this sort of game (Having recently played Dear Esther, Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Everybodys Gone To The Rapture), and do not get me wrong, this is in no way, shape or form, a 'bad' game. Let me explain TL:DR.When you first play, you realise how beautiful it is, how good the voice acting and sound effects are, and feel really in tune with the atmosphere. For this, I absolutely do applaud the developers. They have done a fantastic job of making you feel within the confines of the island and the temperament of the weather.The main reason for playing a game like this, in my eyes, is the story. The story is very intriguing and it got me wanting more until an hour or so in when, despite telling myself otherwise, i'd realised what the ending may be.SPOILERS AHEADMy prediction was that the events taking place on the island are all in your mind - that stanley is actually in prison and it would come around to this eventually. I then realised that he was not in prison, that he was just remembering past events and that in fact he was there on the island, just trying to get to the top of a mountain.This in my opinion is a very anti-climactical ending that could have really been developed upon much further than just turn a valve and that is the end. Nothing new really came of the last 30/40 minutes of the 3 hr experience (less if you don't take in the jaw dropping visuals). I felt a connection to the lady up until I realised that we just get there, turn valve, thats it. It felt premature.I really wish there was a neutral rating on here rather than just yes/no, because although I dislike what eventually became of the story, I love the rest of the game. I can recommend this for the price, but IMO the developers could have done much more with it."
,Recommended,632070,33736418,Posted: 22 July,all,Screamin' Beave #TF2SP,"Wow....I am in awe. This game, was less of a game and more of an experience, a journey. The immersion was so very well done; the sound design was some of the best that I have ever experienced in any game, wonderfully placed enviornmental sounds, fantastic voice acting, and absolutely beautiful music (the soundtrack is free to listen to once you get the game!!). The graphics are a treat for the eyes, containing cold, wintery landscapes and views of a surreal world where you are never quite sure what is real or fiction. It featured a story line that was engaging and held my interest tightly. I had some FPS stutters at a few points, where it dipped from 60 to 40 while on max settings and the graphics options are very sparse, you cannot change individual settings yourself. However, I am not very upset about these flaws as this is an indie game and the developers did so many other things well. I applaud the creators of this game and will be looking forward to future work of theirs.Bottom line: If you are looking for a walking simulator with very few puzzles and an amazing storyline: you must buy this game."
,Recommended,632070,34276478,Posted: 16 August,all,SirEarlGrey,"The Fidelio Project is a small gem in the rough (2 hours long). Don't be misled by its harsh setting. Unlike The Long Dark, this game is not focused on surviving, but rather travelling through a mysterious world in search of your wife. Where many games over rely on optional diary entries to provide depth of story, The Fidelio Incident gives context through many mandatory pages which are well voiced acted and scattered out of chronological order. This revitalises what could be dry collectibles and keeps the player guessing how seemingly disconnected events led to one another. Even though it is only loosely based upon Bethoven’s source material, its contemporary twist is more relevant and still conveys the key themes of the opera. 4/5"

The game heavily makes steam your friend (the boiled water, not this). No action or anything, just walking/running and interacting with something occasionally.I completed it in 1.5 hours in one go.

76561198046881436,Recommended,632070,33330931,Posted: 6 July,all,Garthorium,"The Fidelio Incident is an interesting game, slotting into the same category as pieces such as Dear Esther, Firewatch, and even a little bit like Kholat.Though your time in this game is mainly spent walking to point A-B so on, discovering and reading the numerous journal pages trewn across the icy landscape, and listening to the remarkably well done voice acting, you have a few puzzles to break the monotony of your journey and add a bit more depth to your endeavour.The graphics are fantastic, the only complaint is forced Chromatic Aberration. It didn't work for Payday 2, it didn't work for Life is Strange, it doesn't work here. It is an awful post-processing effect. That being said, the visuals are otherwise clean and vibrant.The sound design is equally as good, with crackling fire, howling wind, crunching snow and the like. Voice acting is top-tier and is clear as day. The game features a 12 piece score with the main theme being the most prominent piece. The music fits and integrates itself flawlessly, conveying and emphasising emotions, tones, and underlying themes. The piano sounds fantastic here.Your only real downside comes from the somewhat tiresome puzzles as you find yourself repeating these quite often. The story is enjoyable and based around a real-world issue, The Troubles, which occurred in Ireland. Wrapping in just under 2 hours, The Fidelio Incident is a nice little adventure with some genuinely enjoyable visuals and premise, it's just let down a little from its puzzle design.If you enjoy games like the aforementioned, games that are generally a single smooth pace, then this is worth checking out. Otherwise, if you prefer a little more engagement, this may not be to your liking.Verdict: 7-8/10, recommend purchasing when on sale."

I came and looked at the page and was quite interested and that I had to buy it which I did instantly. The graphics are amazing although there are some points where you get some lag spikes/freezing but that only happened every 20 mins or so which didn't really bother me. I love the story and it was quite in depth. There are points where it did  take me some time to figure out how to advance, so that may be one thing to point out. So, make sure to fully explore. I do recommend you get this game, espescially with it being on sale. For me, it seems like a mix of Firewatch and The Solus Project in my opinion, just made more simpler. I finished the game quite quickly I would say, in just 2 and a half hours. Overall, I believe that the game is a good pickup for 10 dollars."

The story is good, and although it helps to know what was going on in Ireland about 30 years ago, it is not necessary. The story gives enough details, if you pay attention. The puzzles aren't too hard, although I did get stuck a couple of times. It's not a long game. I played it through in 3.5 hours and that includes a fair bit of wandering in circles, because I couldn't find the right route (even though the game is very linear). Some things you need to do in the game don't make much sense, considering the environment, but it gets a bit weird towards the end anyway, so I just ended up trying everything, no matter if it made sense or not.

Simply, beautifiul.This game has very stunning visuals, crafted in a way that makes it feel almost real life. --Would be really interesting to play in VR. But not only is the visuals stunning, the story is thoughtful and immersive. Tragic at times, and thrilling at others. Yes (I know I can be a softy), but I did shed a tear or two reading the journals.Basically, the premise is that you're wrecked on a deserted icy tundra in search for jounral entries and your wife. Not only are you having to battle the elements, and a mysterious group of people in the bunker, but you also have to battle your nightmares to survive. Maintaining your sanity is key.I've never been one for walking simulators, as I usually find them boring.

I thought what little they touched on had to be public knowledge.  I think most people know about car bombings and violence, even if you don't know why.  Irish Republicans / Catholics want all of Ireland to be free of British rule and the Irish loyalists / Protestants want Northern Ireland to stay part of the UK.  That's really all you need to know for this.  You really didn't even need to know that much, just that there's conflict though the violence has calmed considerable from 30 years ago.  The story is more about remembrance, regret, and resolution.  Both sides had a reason to fight and sometimes good honest civilians turned on their brothers over this issue.  It's really a great subject to reflect on now that the violence is over and scars remain.As for game play, it was simple.  A couple times I ""solved a puzzle"" without knowing I did because I likely did things out of order.  Only happened a couple times--got the plane door before I knew why I needed it and I opened the heavy door to get the key card without knowing I needed it or why I was opening the door.  Those are minor things though.  A lot of things happened that I didn't really get until after.Opening the last value to shoo the bugs from the tree, but it didn't work, the tree sprayed out water the wrong color and a symbol of Stanley's past fell on the ground...

I did not feel immersed in the story, I simply walked through the game without feeling anything except frustration and boredom. The game takes 2 hours to complete, it's not worth its price.Just go buy Firewatch if you're looking for a walking simulator. This game is not worth your time or money even on sale."

The graphics are doing their job really well (even on the lowest settings) and give the game scenery it's agressive and scary beauty.The plot is nothing spectacular in it self but has some nice twists and turns throughout the entire storyline. I do not want to spoil anything but do play through the entire game in one session if possible (I did it in 2.5h but I'm sure it can be done in less) to get the whole picture. Although it is a shame that the story is entierly linear...Sadly I found the music/audio to be somewhat lacking, which is sad for a game that is marketing itself on being inspired by Beethoven's only opera. The soundtrack in itself is good, no question about it, but the occasional mixing and layering of different soundtracks (on purpose or not...) made me feel somewhat lost. Aswell as the game lacking some clear audio effects:- No footstep or splash sound when walking in water- Mostly the same footstep sound no matter if walking on dirt or snow- Some interactibles lacked sound effects which made them feel ""hollow"" and without weightControl wise the game clearly is made to be played with a controller and not with mouse and keyboard (although it is possible). Especially noticable is this when the cursor randomly dissapears from the menu or the camera goes into som kind of ""hold-and-drag"" mode. Another thing that annoyed me was the fact that I as the player never got any control over when I wanted my flash light to be on or off. I understand that there are some points in the game where the player should not get access to something that makes seeing easier but there are better solutions to that than taking the decision entierly away from the player.My last little nit-picky-critic-point is the lack of some kind of inventory symbols. Although there was no need to know what you had at your disposal (because of the game always using the right tool for you), it would have been nice to have some kind of icon reminding you: ""Hey you got this flash light back there, why don't you use it to get through this dark cave?""Overall I do recommend the game to anyone who likes games like Firewatch or any other pussel adventure with a bit of horror mixed into it, especially if it is on sale!I hope this was helpfull :)Frokes"

,Not Recommended,632070,34643953,Posted: 31 August,all,Shaamaan,"I'm really conflicted about this game. On one hand, while essentially being a walking simulator, it has all the important checkmarks of an engaging game.It has SOME mechanics, it has a concept it sticks to, it has a structure, it has great voice-overs. The visual design is OK as well (more on that later).And it did engage me till the end - I finished it after all.That said, I can't say I had fun with the game, which is why I must, sadly, give it a negative rating. Here's a quick list:1) while the game makes good use of the Unreal engine, the world isn't nearly as ""pretty"" enough (the visuals are high-quality, just uninteresting most of the time) for me to want to explore it, yet exploration is ""rewarded"" with journal pages2) but said journals, while containing a high-quality voice-over, aren't exactly thrilling3) while it's nice the game has mechanics to raise it above a ""walking simulator"", these mechanics are more frustrating than fun4) the entire backstory wasn't really engaging and it felt like it didn't serve any purpose at all aside from a contrived narration at the end5) the game dips nicely into ""confusion"" with a lovely little start, but things go downhill; perhaps it's the backstory mentioned above just didn't grip me enough for me to care about the connections (which felt forced)? ...or perhaps the madness aspect never really kicked into overdrive to make it memorable...6) the ending also feels hallow - it simplifies the experience and doesn't leave much to think about; again, it may be my disinterest in the backstory that's the reason for this?Ultimately, I got the game via a Steam sale, so I don't feel cheated or overly angry. With that said, if you're interested in this title, wait for a sale. Otherwise it's way too expensive."

I finished it but felt like... meh at the end. Not one minute of fun all along the story. Plus the game crashed my PC once I have finished it and asked to quit it. No response at all of anything so I got forced to reboot it.What I did not like at all is that there is no option at all of anything, just following the path and try to stay warm or clear it with a mechanic making it a bit puzzling, but nothing huge either.Well to summarise, it is not worse playing it, an audio book would do the same. sorry"

All these experiences and challenges are nothing more than obstacles to overcome in order to save your wife from this icy hell.There is an underlying storyline here which I won't spoil for you but the journey is an ultimately enjoyable one, a little spooky at times but ultimately it shouldn't take you too long to figure out where you’re going and from where you have come.Contains a few nice shocking moments, a few freaky weird ones and ultimately thought provoking and solemn self-reflection is almost unavoidable.Certainly looking forward to the next story, I just hope it can increase in length, difficulty and complexity as I think each of those three aspects could perhaps be ramped up a bit.

You have to stay warm, so you'll walk quickly from fire to fire and other occasional heat sources, where the landscape and plot both progressively turn into a surreal guilt trip.The few items you need are always conveniently located within an easily accessible short range, so there isn't really any reason to divert much from the clear path. Pipes and switches will bring a series of elementary puzzles to solve in order to stay warm or avoid stingy bugs. This is a thoroughly well executed interactive narrative that nevertheless brings absolutely nothing new to the genre's gameplay formula.It helps to optionally have a basic understanding of Ireland's 1980's political landscape, as the game's underlining setting. Offers around 2-3 hours of icy exploration, a fitting length for a story without filler that doesn't need to be any longer."

Gorgeous scenery:from mountains to blizzards, to a burning forest, to ""dream sequences"", fire and water and ice effects, all rendered beautifully.From the opening scene: the tension of being in a doomed plane, through the final heartbreaking scene (no spoilers), the pace is SO much more than a ""walking simulator"". Am I going to freeze to death? Rescue my woman in time?I didn't at all mind taking time from the journey to stop and collect diary pages (progressing the backstory in such a way that you weren't taken out of the game's ""reality"").OK, not really a spoiler but: the pub.

I dropped my rez down a notch to 1680X1050 and the game played great after that point.-I'd give anything for there to have been save-at-will points, so I could revisit areas in the game (even if it's to marvel at the scenery; it's all really that great-looking). I realize there must be issues with programmers creating options for save slots or else why would so many DEVs leave that option out, and this game does auto-save in many areas. But I'd love for there to have been an option besides CONTINUE. I want to re-play certain areas, and not the game again from scratch, when I've finished the game.That's it.

Definitely a ""Walking Simulator"" however the ""Adventure""-part is quite lacking.An Alternative, ""artsy""-way, of encapsulating: It simply lacks the ""fidelidi-fidelido"" spirit of Beethoven's Opera! :(The story is about a couple of macks and the setting is a sort of small-sized (or ""mediocre"" at best), unstable and bug-infested, island close to Iceland (I'm Icelandic which is why I bought into this game in the 1st. place).The player's character is having flashbacks about his mate's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ father (among few other tidbits - of which there shall be little mention in this review). The final-point is: It's a sob-story about the hero questing to gain pure, and cold, insight into past shame.Not a jolly good game but, really, neither fantastic nor speculative (imo. a sort of ""small-minded"" story-loom - lacks a bit more ""boombast"" to be memorable).  Just rather ""effectless"" and ""affectless"". On the positive it has some atmosphere, a somewhat cool background environment, and certain ""whoop-de-doo"" moments.Overall, the story was short and its dynamism slow-motion. Uneventful, a real sleeper, with dysmal undercurrent: the boring tinge of banalism. Sort of tasteless, with little meat on the bones.(Btw. For some, quite strange, reason I just didn't feel weepy at the end.)"

The puzzles are straightforward and reasonable, if a bit repetitive here and there. The subject matter is an unusual choice from recent history that is both bold and respectful. I found the voice acting to be excellent, which isn't always the case in games developed by small shops.The overall play is a bit short and the puzzles could have been more challenging. Moreover, the puzzles seem a bit absurd here and there. There's a reason for that, but it comes out late in the game and, until you learn what it is, you may find the absurdity distracting.If you liked Firewatch but prefer a richer graphic context, more akin to The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, have a look at this one. Where Firewatch held fast to a rigid realism, The Fidelio Incident might remind you here and there of the ""Twin Peaks"" TV show.  Now, Firewatch, Carter, and ""Twin Peaks"" all got an ""A"" from me, while this one earns a respectable ""B."" If you like walking sims, great imagery, and the enigmatically surreal, that's a ""B"" you should try yourself."

If you like sad stories and are interested by either Icelandic scenery and/or The Troubles, give this one a try. I personally felt its dealings with terrorism were mature and interesting, but I certainly am no expert."

The Fidelio Incident is a beautiful slow paced experience revolving around a man's search for his wife.  The environments are beautiful and the soundtrack sets the mood perfectly.  The experience itself is extremely linear though, with not too much to explore outside of simple progression.  That doesn't necessarily feel out of place here though, because the barriers keeping you on your path are, for the most part, sensible(other than the army of beautiful jelly fish, the flash freezing water, and the swarms of insects).  The story, for me, started off kind of confusing and slow.  As the game progressed, the story began to reveal itself and the payoff was well worth the time I invested.  Is this the best story rich game I have ever played?   No.  Is it worth the investment of your time and money?  I think so."

,Recommended,632070,35400915,Posted: 1 October,all,StevensGalaxy,"What can I say about The Fidelio Incident, was an excellent playthrough, however like many of the other reviews of the game, its very much in the style of a walking simulator. However that is not all there is to the game, there are puzzles you have to solve also, so it does keep you on your toes. My biggest complaint about The Fidelio Incident is the game is fairly short, if I could compare it to another game that is simular in the gameplay style, it would definitely be Firewatch, game play and story mode definitely give you a vested interest in the main characters. But it seemed rushed abit, and moved quickly, from one area to the other. But at the same time, kept a decent pace also. I livestreamed this game for my community, and the reviews are great! But they seemed to think it was more like a movie, based on pacing ect... But all in all it is a great game!  If I could give this a rating I would give it 9 out of 10 stars, the only reason for it loosing a star is just in shortness of the game, and also the fact I do not see it as a replayable game, but I might go back to get all of the journal."

It is indeed loosely inspired by Beethoven's opera “Fidelio”, and while I wouldn't label it a thriller, as the description on Steam does, the game is a rather trippy experience throughout.As with most walking sims, there is little gameplay to be found here. The gameplay generally consists of you walking around in a harsh and freezing environment, scrounging for warmth, lost diary pages and solving a few puzzles along the way. And while the diary pages are integral to the story and character development, unfortunately the same cannot be said for the puzzles. For all intents and purposes, the game would have been better off without these puzzles, as they do nothing more than bore and keep you from becoming completely immersed in the story and the struggle of the main character. Nearly every single one of the puzzles boils down to the player turning steam valves on or off. Exciting stuff, I know. It's a shame this is the case, because given the adult themes of this game, one would hope that the puzzles would offer a bit more substance, ideally in a way where it informs or elaborates on the player character's mental state and/or development. Now to be fair, I did spot a couple moments where this was attempted (albeit, to a very minor degree), but due to the limitation of what a steam valve can accomplish in the game, these moments fell flat as a pancake.With that said, what doesn't fall flat in this game is its writing, narrative and voice over work. The actors who portray Stanley and Leonore are both wonderful, and the writing is spot on in how it illuminates to the player the personalities of the couple, the history they have with one another and the political climate they are outrunning. The game does this with only audio, as character models are used sparingly, similarly to something like Soma or Firewatch. And like Soma or Firewatch, the dialogue, whether it be the player character talking to himself, speaking to another character, or diary entries, all of it somehow manages to feel natural and unobtrusive. This of course  is a great service to the game's story, one that, as I previously mentioned, attempts to cover some difficult themes, such as grief and the consequences of violence. While I have watched and played plenty of walking sims that have attempted to tell ""mature"" stories, The Fidelio Incident is one of those rare few that actually succeeds in doing so. I cared for the two individuals and their relationship, and I wanted things to turn out well for the both of them.Ultimately, if you're a fan of games like Firewatch, Soma or Dear Esther, you may want to check this one out. However, and I do want to stress this, because I know this varies for each person and I feel it's worth bringing up. This game is very short. I finished my first playthrough in 2.3 hours, and that was me taking my sweet time with it. I was able to complete a second playthrough in about 45 minutes, just by bypassing a couple of diary entries and jogging around instead of walking. Personally, I don't mind short experiences like this, but you may want to wait for a sale if you feel the current $10 price tag is a bit much."
