This can be done by either searching for food in bins, talk to people on the street or knock at the chirch's door to get helpful tips on how to get new clothes.By talking to others, stealing, begging etc. you are getting skill points and level ups. There is also a crafting part and base building already, sadly you can't use a rope to hang yourself.There are verious mini games, my favourite one so far are the scratch cards which you have one in your inventory each time you die. The dialouges between the characters are pretty diversified sometimes, but also quite difficult to master at some point. The police, for example, can be complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s when you ask them the wrong questions.The game is using the Unity Engine but the current version of the game suffers from game lags. They are not game breaking but might be annoying, even on low I can't achieve fluent 60+ FPS (PC config on my profile).For what the game is I would recommend it, the price might be a bit too high but if you are into survival games and are ready to try something new, it might be worth the investment."

More than you could think. You can easily understand the game mechanics (even without the tutorials), but the survival aspect require a lot of thinking and strategy. Is it buged as most EA games? Not at all. All works fine, found only some typos and missing translatorions here and there. Worth price? If you want to try something really new, fresh and... different - YES. Is there already a lot of content? Yes and no - most important game mechanics are already there and works fine. You have a lot to do and you will have to work hard to keep your hobo safe, healthy and happy. You can already spend many hours with this title. Still - developer(s) have a lot to do with the city space e.g. there is no cars, there is not many pedestrains, there is no nigh lights etc. I am sure that future updates will bring in this features."

Don't be put off by the negative reviews stating the game is buggy and unplayable, alot of these bugs have been fixed and I personally havn't experianced any of them.Overall It's an original idea with active devs, I would reccomend keeping on eye on this one."
,Recommended,632300,33937137,Posted: 31 July,all,NightWolf151,"From what I have played, I really like this game, it is very much a fresh and new idea (as far as I am aware, I don't know of any other hobo sims) and it is implemented quite well, the graphics are not horrendous, and there is a lot to do, especially for an early access. I am particularly fond of building my hobo homes, and I really hope the developer expands on this. The game is not perfect, though. Far from it actually, there are several bugs I have encounter that have caused me to have to force quit the game and start it up again, and 1 that I have encountered that has caused my game save to become unplayable (can’t open my inventory, can’t click on things in the menu, can’t open containers, reports that all my money, gear, items are gone). The game has a LOT of potential, hopefully the devs come through and don’t abandon it like several other devs have done to their early access games that had potential. I think this game has the potential to be a $30 title. Maybe more if the multiplayer done well enough and they add multiple locations to travel to, such as additional cities. I definitely recommend you at least keep an eye on this one."

(building shelter, interacting with NPCs, stealing, eating, pooping...)Early access Cons:- Right now it is ridden with bugs.- Outdated graphics (buildings, NPC booths are just 3d boxes.

Yeah, it needs polish, but the Devs are already working hard at work on it and taking community feedback as well. Finally, this is the best form of an Early Access release.

No, I honestly don't think so at the moment but if the developers can polish and fix the bugs I'd say it would be worth it.I'm still going to keep track of this game in it's development and if things change for the better I will make a second review."

It has a lot of potential as it is one of the most unique survival games I've seen so far. The main basics mechanics are ready and implemented, but most parts of this game are very glitchy to the point where even the menus overlap and you have to restart to fix it. I definitely would play this game. After it has at least 1 major graphical update, 1 major performance update and some other basic updates to make the game playable.I'd hobo, but later. Not right now. This game is not worth like 16€ in its current state. The current state it is in is more of a max 5€ game"
,Recommended,632300,33932344,Posted: 31 July,all,BillyGachi,"I actually do enjoy this game for what it is. I noticed an update happened already, and I expect more to come. Is it worth the money? It's up to you in how much you like to invest time to it. Remember that most people that down-votes games here and there are in many cases the same people who sends random $4-$10 donations to streamers and whatnot. What is more worth: Doing that, or pay for a game you can actually enjoy for couple of hours? I happen to like that it's somewhat difficult to survive. Music is really f*cking sad tho, lol."

76561198003256777,Recommended,632300,34467710,Posted: 24 August,all,Tiar,"I debated on purchasing this game for several days.  The biggest draw was its unique approach to the survival games genre that sets it apart from the others.  Digging through garbage and begging for spare change may feel demeaning at first, but each success is a tiny victory that will only carry you to the next one.  Failure is harsh and you will struggle with decisions like stealing building supplies to help complete your shanty town shelter, or burning the alchohol and clothes you found for warmth."

,Recommended,632300,34721588,Posted: 3 September,all,ThatsPandaGirl,"This game has seriously so much potential in becoming one of the greatest games, in my own opinion.However, it's early access and has so many bugs! There are a few conversations that just plain glitch and make it so I have to exit out using a hotkey or task manager, because there's no options to use, thus you're stuck. On top of that bad glitch, all my sofas/couches keep despawning every time I re-join my world! Which really seriously sucks because they're not a common find, and they're crucial in this game.Aside the glitches though, I honestly have so much fun playing this game. It can be difficult at times, but when you get the hang of it you start to have so much fun and enjoy it! Learn the map and you'll be set.Best things to memorize--Spots: Bathrooms (side of gas station), Mall (giant silver building), Charity (stairs beside mall, keep going accross bridge, big door on left), Master Hobo (first place on left after gas station, has a giant ""MASTER HOBO --->"" before entering).People: Hipster-looking fellas with the big beard and glasses, they're rich! Win the mini-game on the blue, and get 50 crowns!Always check vending machines/pay phones/anything that would accept coins. Sometimes you only can find 0-5 crowns...however, other time you can find 40 crowns! Definitely worth a check!Be wary and simple with dumpster diving when you first start to level up faster, to be able to not be as careful and simple with it. Each level will give you a warning sign instead of poo. :)I reccomend this game to all!"
,Not Recommended,632300,34419631,Posted: 22 August,all,MHTLuca,"I would not reccomend this game in the current state. While the conversation text and dumpster diving/speech and begging mini games seem fleshed out for what they are, there are multiple other problems that don't make the game worth the current price.When building in a hideout, your entire build inventory will be overwritten by copies of the last item you placed. The only remedy for this is too log out and back in, and if you do that, you run the risk of losing your progress. This is purely anecdotal, but I had 5 hours of work undone due to some sort of roll back.The other bug that I'm running into is that the hobo master (the NPC that you increase your skills and learn new things from) wont refresh their conversation points and I can no longer progress.When hideout building does work as intended, it's rather clumsy and getting things to line up the way you'd like is extremely difficult.I will reiterate that overall I do enjoy this game, and I'm not going to stop playing it. It is enjoyable for what it is, but not worth the 18.99 price point right now. I would wait for either a price drop or another few months of updates. At such a time I will review and edit this review to reflect any changes made."

Saved characters disappear, and corrupts the savegame, requiring you to delete the savegame and start from scratch.It does seem to be a lot deeper than it appears at first glance, so it may be worth getting at a later time, but as previously mentioned, it's just too full of bugs to bother with at the current time.Pros: Active developers, interesting gameplay, original concept.Cons: Bugs, bugs, bugs, and more bugs, and a few more bugs for the weekend.

Of course, it's completely unfinished right now and about a hundred miles away from the nearest can of polish. Fighting the first few nights keeps things compelling as you explore newer parts of the city, figure out which areas tend to house the wealthier folk and are more worth scavenging from.The game, however, is obviously unfinished at this point because it has little to offer beyond some basic survival systems. What concerns me more is that the engine doesn't seem to be built with the idea of adding much more depth. What's worse the game somehow looks and runs worse than games from over a decade ago. Especially with it's bleak eastern european art style, all I'm left thinking is that it would be neat if this whole thing took place in City 17.I really do wish the developer the best and commend them for starting to put together a survival game in an area that has seemingly been completely untouched, but for now I don't think there is enough content to justify a purchase."

Too soon to release even for early access. I followed this game in greenlight for long and I am very very confused of the state the game is after all the time developers had.Terrible graphics, controls and even the mini games concept is pretty bad.

They are stating the game features interacting with others, pickpocketing etc...yes, it really is there but...in a game being developed for almost 1,5 year I would expect some better mechanics than just click this and click this and you have robbed something...You can even lit a fire everytime and you do not need any match or lighter...yes, this game is a survival simulation game with a lot of features as dev team stated but each of the feature is made the way that every arcade game is more real than this ""survival simulator"".btw, how many people models there are? one single lady skinned model...used even for male characters.

I fell through the map in under 10 minutes which I think is some kind of record. It broke even more when I joined a game and the inventory started breaking. Getting a refund until it improves. 0/10 wouldn't hobo again (in its current state)

Its very early access but there is enough content to keep you occupied. Its obviously not bug free although I havent encountered any game breaking bugs of yet. Developers are definately heading in the right direction and if the promised features and content are continually added this has the potential to be a great game.
