,Recommended,633130,31889111,Posted: 21 May,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Guys, this roguelite is super fresh.I didn't expect much out of this for a mere five bucks, but this baby has layers. And new ideas. And polish. It is clear that every little detail was intentional...And it works.Where do I begin?Alright, so there is an overworld 'hub' where you have some interesting things to manage. You populate the hub with characters you find in the dungeon (a la Crypt of the Necrodancer). The currency is points that you get from combos, and later, followers. Some of the characters you unlock are 'followers' that generate points just like an idle clicker game.Yeah, it's really wild.Okay, so you have these points and you spend them in the overworld on loadout options.The core combat game has a heavy deck building theme going on. It's neat. You can keep any given card and reap the buff, OR you can burn it to get health. Really neat risk/reward thang. You find the cards in chests, but opening them will cost you some health (it shows you how much before hand). Some cards are 'bones', and you take them to the hub... And craft dudes.You can leave the dungeon by jumping out of a window. This takes you back to the hub world to save cards for future runs, spend points, get full health, and restart the dungeon (new random layout). So really, you can 'grind' your way to a more powerful state if you play it safe and leave a few times. Brilliant.Look, look, look I'm getting ahead of myself. There is a metric ton of new ideas in here, and I can't go over them all BUT if you are interested, I highly recommend reading this guide here (the game is super obscure, sothis guide was built by the devs to get you started - and I think it's required reading before you even play).If you like roguelites, you really should give this a spin. The asking price is absolutely too low.Pros:+Doesn't get any fresher than this+Artwork is beautiful+Tons of new mechanics and ideas that work reallyreallywell+For the small asking price I expected something much less ambitious; turns out I was wrong+I love the idle clicker part and the deck building aspect+You will play a friggin' ukuleleCons:-BIG 'con' here, with the starting pistol (which you will use an overwhelming majority of the time) requires you to spam the shots in a twitch-like manner; I actually fatigued during the first boss battle which was super frustrating-Music is great (veryIsaac-like IMO), but repetitive-I wish there was only dodge-roll, and not BOTH dodge-roll and slide; I still underuse theseThis title is a great and welcome addition to the roguelite genre.It's so nice to see some innovation in a generally worn-out market."
,Recommended,633130,32838048,Posted: 26 June,all,[LUE] TormakSaber,"Nongunz is a game that I could easily see appealing to people, but just does not for me.The game bills itself as a purposefully obtuse, nihilistic roguelike. What might not be immediately obvious in the teasers and trailers is that the game is also an idle clicker game. (Yes, I know it says it in the description and am probably stupid for not realizing it. I know.) Much of the game revolves around managing your economy properly, and grinding for followers for a better idle economy, to get different boosts to start runs with, entailing leaving the game running for hours in the background. It's a neat idea in theory.The problem with this is that as soon as you activate any of the boosts, the game immediately ups the ante and spawns stronger monsters. Your upgraded guns have limited ammo, which means using them just spawns stronger monsters in exchange for a gun that will run out of ammo. All true roguelikes with no saved progress are inherently nihilistic in a way, because you always start again from scratch with a new run, but this one takes it a bit beyond: you spend hours idlnig for weapon or item boosts only to be repaid in stronger enemies right off the bat - so you don't even really benefit from the upgrades. There also appears to be crafting you can do with bone items to construct skeletons - but I never finished a skeleton, and everything goes away if you die, so I could never claim any rewards.There is little to zero text in the game, so you need to suss out what upgrades do on your own. The iconography is pretty intuiitive for the most part, which is a plus. My problem is that once collected, none of the item cards seemed to actually do anything. I didn't jump higher, run faster, or shoot faster (a worthless upgrade as all the weapons I ever found shot as fast as I could click, and much slower otherwise. I admittedly never found a machine gun. Probably relevant there.) Consuming your item cards gives you health back, but then you lose the boost (? - maybe an obtuse mechanic I missed here? Again, could not tell any differences.) You can also idle-grind to start with, and find skeletal heads that give unqiue active abilities, like dashes, teleports, slow-time, and gravity manipulation. Unfortunately - opening chests costs you HP. So you could spend life to get an item card that doesn't benefit you at all, but because it's a bad card, you won't even get much HP back by consuming it. Even the 'rewards' in the game feel like they're working against you. Nihilism may be the theme, but it wears thin quickly.The gameplay itself is pretty standard jump and shoot, and really isn't terrible. You can't free-aim, so shooting little enemies is either done by constantly jumping, or using the slide to shoot upwards. Most enemies are bullet sponges right off the bat, so the most dangerous enemies tend to just be a cloud of flies tat you have to awkwardly jump 'n gun at, and dodge roll from. Platforms can only be passed through upwards and not dropped back down through, and enemy projectiles play by different rules than yours, making some rooms feel inherently 'unfair'. I didn't find the game particularly difficult in and of itself once I grasped the ropes, just not very fun, and not very engaging.The presentation is super slick, the aesthetic and sound effects and music and graphic design are very cool and very thematic for what the game is doing. It's just that, what the game is doing isn't all that fun for me. Your mileage may vary pretty wildly. I'm going to give the game a positive recommendation out of an appreciation for what the game is doing and for the excellent presentation, but understand that the game outside of the 'nihilism' and 'figure this♥♥♥♥♥♥out yourself' theme, and the clicker game wrapping, it's a pretty standard roguelike jump and run and gun. I'd rather play Risk of Rain or 20XX. You need to decide for yourself if that's worth playing."

If you like Downwell, games from Vlambeer, Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, and Cookie Clicker this is probably up your alley.  It's a weird mish mash of seemingly disparate games that works really well.I would highly encourage anyone remotely interested in this to go in blind for at least the first hour. Part of the fun is figuring out what is going on.edit: I forgot to give props to the soundtrack. The music is so good!"
,Recommended,633130,31862494,Posted: 20 May,all,Legion,"Nongunz is a Roguelite bullet hell platformer, if you enjoyed Enter the Gungeon then this will be your jam.Find 40 minutes of gameplay with some commentary at:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzZMF07JxxEThis game does not hold your hand, explanations of the items in game are limited. All guns except the starter gun have limited ammo, deaths are often and health is hard to find. There is some carry over between deaths, depending on how you played the game before dying.I'm over 2 hours in and still don't know how most of the items work. Your character can change skulls though, with each skull offering a different special ability. This too had a limited use before it was lost. But at any window you can leave the dungeon and return to the starting area to store items you have collected. I suggest you do this often, especially when you start the game for the 1st time."
,Recommended,633130,31916640,Posted: 23 May,all,AkulBIG,"Nongünz, is a fresh take on the overplayed roguelite genre, if you like roguelites and platfroming this game is a must have.The striking and masterfully done pixelart complements, tight control mechanics, so you can enjoy diying one hundred times to many different enemies and in 100 ways. As with many roguelites diying is part of the mechanics so you can gain more items and resources to defeat the bosses.Its a hard game but has enough variety in the items and guns to push through frustration so you an get that inmense satisfaction of defeating a boss.Also I can't leave out the greatl vocal soundtrack that acompanies your suffering.YOU ARE DEAD, GO PLAY."
76561198158149244,Not Recommended,633130,32950224,Posted: 28 June,all,tuckboat,"Nongunz is an oddball platforming roguelite that also happens to incorporate elements of idle or ""clicker"" games.Whil I love the creativity in the game design and I have to say I was impressed by how the visual style worked. In the end however I can not recommend because the game itself wasn't fun to play.The biggest gamekilling issue for me was that the controls are sticky and movment/hitboxs in general is a bit jerky/janky/. Poor controls are further frustrated by the fact that your basic gun will need to hit most enemies multiple times in order to take them down. Some other lowlights include poorly designed levels and enemy ai those two things can and do exist in many other games but when they get married together it leads to boring and repetitve gameplay.While not an issue for me personally I would like to point out that this game is also a bit difficult to digest in terms of understanding it's mechanics and nothing is explained in-game.4/10That's probably being a bit kind as having janky unreliable controls in a platformer is pretty much an auto 0 and don't even both to write a review territory. However the visual presentation, interesting concept, and low price prop it up a bit."

They are very active in the forums, engaging with their customers and I really like that.  The game looks like a lot of fun and I really dig the music in the trailers but I won't get to experience it.  I bought in good faith based on the claim that it is linux compatible.  Unfortunately, it wouldn't start.  Attempting to launch it led to a blank black window that would never actually do anything.  The devs, while polite about it, had no solution to offer and recommended requesting a refund.  They claim it works with ubunbtu but I run mint.  So I'm posting this as fair warning to other linux users: caveat emptor."
,Not Recommended,633130,32114337,Posted: 1 June,all,Xelias,"Okay, so.This game looks really cool, I really expected to enjoy it. but sadly, bad design and gameplay make it a frustratingly obnoxious experience. It's just simple little thing that make most encounters extremely annoying.You cannot aim your shots, and a LOT of ennemies are just a couple of pixels too far up or down for you to kill without taking dammages.The hardest ennemies that you will fight is a fly. too small to be hit it flies and comes close to you, forcing you to flee before it because you cannot hit it.Most small enemies have a ton of life (fly takes two shotgun blast to the face to kill, 6 bullets)You cannot aim below you when you fall, meaning that if there's a monster under you, tough♥♥♥♥♥♥you can jump through platform from the bottom but not fall through them afterward (?)The game randomly generate rooms, sometimes putting hell in front of you early in the level without any regard for a proper difficulty curve, letting you get some gear, etc.Too bad, it looked really rad."

Your map is made up of nodes, each node represents a room. The items in this game are pretty bizzare and don't have a detailed description apart from an icon and some numbers, but you'll figure it out quite quick. Also, DO NOT rush into the boss in your first run :D. Retreat, stack up on points, also store your items in coffins, because if you die, you lose them forever. Also, to exit a dungeon you go through the window.This game offers such good amounts of fun and challenges for 7 euros. Grab this game if you're into challenging roguelikes. This game is a must.Quick tips:-When you kill enemies, you get a bit of health and  points.-You use points to buy weapons, or skulls or upgraded versions of them.-Items are stored in chests. You open them sacrifcing a bit of your health, but you can sacrifice the item to get some health back.-Skeleton worshippers that give you points per second :D-Learn that dodge button!"

It explains nothing. You need to learn everything by yourselfe. How the stats work and other game mechanics. (or use the wiki which will probably come :p)The core mechanics are platforming and shooting. Platfroming works really good and the shooting is something you will learn and master after enough time.Everytime you enter a new level it is generated out of a pool of rooms.I think the ~7€ are a good investment for many hours of challenge!I hope you liked my review, if you have anything to criticize please let me know. :)"

76561198119598306,Recommended,633130,32352335,Posted: 11 June,all,dripkidd,"I don't like recommending games, b/c capitalist propaganda etc.But I recommend this one, it deserves more players. It offers some great and refreshing ideas in the action-platformer genre and in the rogue-lite genre as well (looping runs by abandoning levels and starting over, grinding and stashing equipment, card deck building, farming an 'economy' by idle gameplay). The mechanics are bewildering at first but it's really fun finding out what is happening in the game, it's not just a superficial cover. The gameplay itself is old-shool, slow and kind of punishing platforming and combat, slow but deadly enemies and even harder bosses. You are responsible for balancing your own difficulty as using higher tier guns makes short work of the bosses but levels up all the common enemies. There's no rush toward the final boss either, you have strong incentives to explore every room and loop back to the hub town to stash your findings before you lose them. It creates some nice incremental progression. Managing decisions of cost and reward is big part of the game. You can clear rooms, but that will reduce your ammo, you take damage, but heal from kills, cards offer stat boosts, but consuming them heals you more, take too much time and your cards get used up, take even more time and you can gain enough points over time to buy new skulls and weapons and die to a boss and lose everything.But what I most love about it is the visual design. So many game tries to show gore and macabre themes and ends up being timid and boring. This game really grabbed me with its desolate death-ridden cathedral and its tormented squirming inhabitants. Resurrecting bones to do your bidding, freeing caged imps to worship you, paying their sacrifice to an altar of weapons, dying to a small bit of bouncing flesh gagged up by shapeless hunk of meat and bone and then resurrected climbing out of your own grave without a head back to the demons. Makes me feel warm and fuzzy."

Nongunz would be that glorious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The design is great. It doesn't hold you by the hands and actively encourages you to experiment and learn the game mechanics on your own. There is some trial and error involved. There is a strong theme of death, gore and violence within the monochromatic 8-bit world.The game is a metroidvania-esque rogue-lite shooter, with 8-bit enemies clawing, stomping, chewing, and even shooting caustic mucus at you. There is a risk-reward element in place to encourage you to play defensively and not rush in like leeroy jenkins on crack. You can burn your stat cards to get a bit of health back and continue exploring the mausoleum, or you could keep the stats and try to recover a tiny bit of health by viciously murdering enemies in quick succession without getting hit. You can invest your points in your loadouts, like purchasing ability skulls, stat cards, or weapons.The weapons themselves feel satisfying. The shotguns are beastly at close range, while the rocket launcher vaporizes most enemies. You inner murder beast will feel sated.The minimalist approach to story is very reminiscent of the Souls series. You know there is a strong thematic connection between the elements in the game's world, but it is up to you to dig deep and find out what that is for yourself.The cemetary hub and funeral parlor world of the early stages let you know youre in for a dark treat.The game is well worth the price of admission, so check it out!"

And this sense is presented in a wonderful way, you don't wonder ""how am I supposed to do this or that"", you just naturally and organically learn new things and go ""ooh, so that's what that is, how cool is that"".It's a riddle, it's a puzzle with no hand holding. And underneath that there's a tight and brutal roguelike platformer. With its own rules and quirks that you'll have to discover (again) and learn. It's brutal, meaning you will have to start from scratch time and again, but it's not inhumanly difficult, it feels just right.And then there's yet another layer, an idle game. And if you find those addicting it'll scratch that itch just fine, by being quite original, as it has to fit within a platformer.The art style is gorgeous, the atmosphere is palpable, everything is so polished it's unbelievable. I most certainly wasn't expecting anything like that.Do youreslf a favor and try this game.

Some like this but others might not. I think it just slows down learning and proceeding aka makes the game unnecessarily long. Menus are a mess and quitting the game is horrible. You have to search the right menu, hold down the correct button to activate it and you enter this weird room ""mini-game"" where you have to go sleep to really quit.The ""points"" you can see from the screenshots are gotten from long combos and shooting and can be used to buy items, guns, masks etc. but once again you have to try out what happens or search for a wiki since there are no tips, only symbols.Controls are very responding but playing longer would kill my fingers since you have to bash LB1 in order to shoot fast. Holding down shoots way too slow...To sum it up:A very controversal title that tries a lot of different things but doesn't quite get there.

Button mashing to try and figure out how to get out of it and hit Y which opened a window to the outside. Only problem, I am still stuck in the air. I have quit and reloaded, still stuck in the air. I have deleted and reinstalled, still stuck in the air. The options are all cryptic so I don't know if there's a way to start a fresh game. I get being cryptic with your story and hell even upgrades, but have your menu be user friendly. I mean come on. Not the best experience up front and I actually love 2D rougelites. Will be refunding and not thinking about it again."
,Not Recommended,633130,32031568,Posted: 28 May,all,Chimera,"Uninteresting, annoying and unecessarily tanky enemies. Dated, repetitive and boring platforming. No real feeling of progression and controls that are just not nicely tweaked(Having to do an awkward slide just so my gun can face up to shoot the ridiculously tanky abundant flying enemies?No thanks). Roguelikes got too popular and good ones rarely pop up anymore. I don't recommend Nongünz as it just doesn't bring anything new to the table or has anything interesting enough going on to justify its cryptic and confusing nature. There is a guide that actually has to explain what even the menus do in the game, that is just plain bad design."

How does your character respond to input? How are the physics of your shots, and the enemies' shots? Is shooting a single enemy satisfying?Nails the feel perfectly.It's got the shooting, it's got the exploration (levels are randomly generated with usually a good mix of stuff to find and/or fight), and it's got the attitude: It is a Good Game."

,Recommended,633130,34112672,Posted: 8 August,all,Moraes,"Lets start off by saying this is not an easy game.The tutorial will literally only teach you how to move and shoot, other than that you will need to learn everything by playingor looking up on forums if you willbut thats what they were going for! So its definitely not something bad for the gameThe game consists of you going inside a dungeon to try'n defeat all bosses, the premise is simple but its easier said than done. To help you achieve that you will have many different guns and skulls with different powers to do that and when it comes to getting those weapons is when the game gets a little grindy. Every monster you kill will give you points wich are used as currency to buy the equipment but thats not the only way to get those points. Throughout your gameplay you will find a few ways to generate points while idle wich make things way easier. Other than the weapons you can find/buy inside the dungeon cards that give you different powerups when you have it in your inventory or they can be consumed to regen some of your healththe cards only have sybols tho, you need to figure out what it does by yourself.As anyone can see, the game is nihilistic and from my interpretation the way it manifests in practicality is that it doesnt matter what you do, everything you're carrying and the points you have on yourself when you die are lost. But its not like the game is over, there are coffins in the city in wich you can store itens that you can't afford to lose or is simply too scared to take with you so if you're conservative about what you're bringing into the dungeon you won't ever be out of itens to keep exploring the dungeon.I can't explain much more without giving spoilers. Its a great game overall 10/10, just now what your getting into before buying: its very hard and the game is definitely not your friend, you will have to learn almost everything by experiencingor with forums. But when you do..."

,Not Recommended,633130,35354136,Posted: 30 September,all,Al Djeafnte,"I was intrigued by the notion of the game not telling you anything.  After beating the first boss and figuring out there is no other first boss, and never wanting to fight the first boss ever again, I decided to break the convenant of self discovery to make sure I wasn't missing anything.To the best of my discovery, there isn't.The only ""part of the game"" I seemed to not be able to reach were permanent ""town"" upgrade cards.Beyond this, the entire game loop is engage in mediocre platform shooting, find chests for miniscule upgrades, take chip damage, consume upgrades for health, maybe find a useful item, maybe leave the dungeon to bank your loot for a better run later, repeat until you want to try the boss, maybe collecting minor upgrades in the interim, and then fight a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss.  Eventually you'll beat the boss and nothing will change, you're just now dealing with harder things.The game has a charming presentation and has interesting theory behind it, but not much of it seems to have gone toward the game design.This is something exceedingly niche that'll work great for those that like it, but is going to be completely opaque to everyone else."
