76561197966614606,Recommended,633950,35285641,Posted: 29 September,all,Edgemorn,"I just finished the demo, and wow, I love it. Here are my notes:1. People say this is like Dark Souls, BUT...I want to clarify this. Fall of Light is its own game. Yes, you die a lot like Dark Souls and the number crunching is minimal. You have squares that represent HP, you start with 5, so it's very simple, but not in a bad way. I like number crunching a lot, but I was not detered by this system. But this game is very much different. I love the camera (it does not jack with you), I love how it feels like an isometric ARPG in its presentation, but it is not an ARPG.2. The comabt is really well done. There was a game called ""Examina"" that tried to do very physical-based combat, and this has strains of similarities, but Examina failed miserably. The targeting makes this game awesome, but even without, it was far far better than Examina. I liken this to the combat from Gothic 1 and 2 (LOL Gothic 3 was terrible). You have to learn enemies and time your attacks and defensive moves. Once you learn an enemy, you can dominate him.3. There are fresh ideas in this game and they are good ideas. The companion you bring with you adds some really cool elements. The aesthetics are fantastic.Really well done devs, well done. I immediately bought this game upon completing the demo, and the price is right!!"

Its not hard to see the influence of Dark Souls and Eco but how it is shared is unique. It strips away a lot of number crunching rpg elements to the bone, but its visuals and combat is solid and challenging♥♥♥♥♥crossbowmen). If you need an indie Dark Souls fix at least try the demo which gives just a little taste of what you get in the full game.I will give a finalized review after finsihing the game."

In the start you might feel that you dont understand whats going on or how to play this game. But the further you get the better it gets. Its almost that i think its a part wich made melike this game. i hate to compare this game to dark souls but it certainly got the same mysterious feeöing as my first time playing just that.. not knowing how to play or what to do. the longer i played the more i learned and the better i felt.im still just a couple of hours in to the game. and will edit my review later..But i really recommend this if you aree a    fan of soulslike/soulsbourne type of games. but still want something new and intressting. there is so much smart and good game design and though behind this game.. i cant give it enough praise. and beg you.. give it 2-3 hours if you dont feel sure if this game is for you

I though this would be another generic indie action/PRG but it actually hooked me up with excellent and simple combat system and cool atmosphere of dying world."
76561198220910308,Recommended,633950,35424902,Posted: 2 October,all,Slade,"It reminded me of Resident Evil 4 somehow. Do you remember the pain of carrying the girl through the zombie infested RE4? The pain and occasionally excitement that was, hehe :). It kind of works in this game as well but imagine the you would need to carry that some girl through DS :). tough ? yes very tough . in fact this game so far breaks me and I was not able to compete it. Nevertheless, it is pretty enjoyable and I could note a really nice visuals and sounds. Quite high production quality for an RPG that I haven’t heard much about."

I can't understand whether I really like this game or it only speculating on my feelings for DS and ICO.. but even if it does - the feeling of accomplishment from DS is there, and the feeling of companionship and care from ICO is there too. If you have not played the original games then I would recommend them over Fall of Light but if you already did and enjoyed then this game could be be fun. 3 out 5 - very high rating coming from me. Perhaps too high, but i will change the recommendation if the ending sucks."

,Recommended,633950,35421403,Posted: 2 October,all,silentpanders,"I like the game but it definitely needs some work. Thankfully quick swap seems to be on the lis of things to add, but either hit detection needs to be more reliable or weapon swings need to show where they're hitting better."
76561198220902984,Recommended,633950,35407227,Posted: 1 October,all,Ron Ricco,"Love it! I love everything about Fall of Light - the fighting, the survival, the need to take care of your daughter. For me this is one of the best games I’ve played in years - definitely the best indie game. If you, like me, enjoy action-PRG then this is a game you should try."
76561198188774043,Recommended,633950,35383682,Posted: 1 October,all,NatashaGamer,"No, I’m not a Dark Souls fan. I tried playing Dark Souls and Dark Souls 3 and did not enjoy much. Too difficult and very unforgiving. Also gargantuanly huge. Fall of Light is smaller, not as brutal and also has elements in really love from classic Japanese games like ICO and RE4. So far I’m really enjoying the game."
76561197981436938,Recommended,633950,35468714,Posted: 4 October,all,WhiteRaven,"I've spotted this game a long time ago and played the demo a few days ago, which I enjoyed very much. I'm playing the full game now. This is an indie game and I'd like to ask those who downvoted the game after playing for 20 min, why haven't you played the demo first? This is what the demo is for. The game itself is far from being perfect (I'm looking forward to the hitboxes patch :) but it is very solid for an indie game and IMHO quite enjoyable. Try the demo and if you like it - it's an easy choice to buy the full game. Or not."
76561198220849852,Recommended,633950,35374089,Posted: 1 October,all,Stalker,"Expected more...I’ve spotted this game at Gamescom and immediately got interested so when it came out i picked it up. After playing the game a bit i have to say that i expected a bit more from it. The combat system is not perfect but pretty smooth. Visuals are ok most of the time for an indie game, but not super impressive. Still somehow this game managed to capture the atmosphere of desperation from Dark Souls 1, which I personally absolutely love.The game is not a difficult as DS though at least so far. I’m not sure how far I am from completing the game but this is most probably going to the game that I will compete, and this is not something I do too often these days."

,Recommended,633950,35362162,Posted: 30 September,all,ChaoticPanic,"Great game, just hard to play with a Keyboard, you really need a Controller IMO. The game play is smooth and people who like hardcore action are going to love this.  I would recommend this game if you liked Dark Souls.Check out my game play for hidden Weapons in the first area:https://youtu.be/4kliqDyn5Tk"

,Recommended,633950,35334343,Posted: 30 September,all,Yariok,"A really nice game, it is worth buying.I had the chance to talk with the team during the Milan's Games Week! they  were extremely kind and shared many tech aspects of the game. They have worked hard to create a great atmosphere that will accompany you during the whole game ...and the final result is just amazing!"

THE BEST WAY IS PLAY IT WITH  A  CONTROLLER, OR U WILL FEEL BORED WITH ENDLESS DEATH . I HOPE DEVELOPERS CAN DESIGN A MORE INTERESTING  COLLECTION SYSTEM  AND ESAYER MODES."

I mean heart. Seriously the game is pretty decent, but simplified DS clone. Play top difficulty if you’re a veteran, then it’s pretty cool."

76561198085590932,Not Recommended,633950,35475960,Posted: 4 October,all,Joshaw,"As a big fan of DS and bloodborne series,I think this is the worst soul-like game I have ever played,well,maybe I should delete ""soul-like"".----Terrible combat system,you roll,you don't know if you hit the enemy or not(no hitpoints for enemy),and you died.If you try to use a two-handed weapon lik axe or great sword,you will find that every enemy attacks faster than you.----Weird and extreme unfriendly bonfire checkponit setting,if you died,you will lose all the Exps and can't get them back,That means it's very difficult to gain enough Exps to level up,and low level make the game more difficult,it's a vicious circle.Sometimes when you reached a new place,you can't find the bonfire anywhere.If you died during the searching,you have to experience the disgusting route over again,Not to mention that you must to save the little girl first.----Graphic is too dark even you adjust the brightness to the higest level,that's really annoying ,I know maybe the developer thinks  dark graphic is proper for the story.But if you explore the way inch by inch and still die from theubiquitous traps in the dark, you'll know that's not cool.Oh,and you can't even change the camera angle,can't belive it's a game in 2017.All I can say is  DO NOT buy it,it's a waste to both time and money."
,Not Recommended,633950,35370350,Posted: 1 October,all,Mcswine,"Had hopes for this and I really wanted to like this, but in the end it came up short.I dont mind the simple graphics or cheap sound effects. I like the atmosphere. I like the premise of the game.What really kills it is the combat system, combined with the AI and enemy abilities.You move slowly. and very sluggishly. Which is not necessarily bad, but the enemy will always move faster than you, good luck catching thos crossbow men with a 2-handed sword. In short the enemy will kite you to the end of time and you can do f.... all.The enemy kites you and there are many, many places in the beginning of the game where you get 1 hit killed, both by traps or enemies.You can carry 2 weapons. A loot based game, this is not. Which is fine.In short:The combat is sluggish and just doesnt feel right.The enemies do not seem to operate under the same ruleset as the player, which makes combat frustrating. Hard is fine, but this is just being an a-hole to the player. I do not agree with other reviews here stating it is ""fair"", as it surely shows it is not."
76561198065267777,Not Recommended,633950,35404900,Posted: 1 October,all,MajorJoeFace,controls are sluggish un-intuitive and game breaking.  apparently its better with a controller.  Game was not engaging enough for me to go into the next room and grab mine.  I was just annoyed too much by the voice acting and controls.
,Not Recommended,633950,35399145,Posted: 1 October,all,cavemansamurai,"the attack system is SHOCKINGLY BAD  (explained)the mechanics for the archers are not good. The reason for this is ul eventually dodge the arrows they shoot, you will be in attack radius but the swing is so slow you never hit them. They do this weird almost buggy looking AI backwalk so its nearly impossible to get them. I always lose 4squares of life just trying to kill a simple archer. I swear 0..0The game has a  'lock on' system but the lock marker keeps jumping between 3 different people.  You cant control who you lock onto it just locks onto a target at random. and my issue is that it will just constantly either pick the wrong target or it does this buggy thing where it keeps locking on shifting between each enemy in a frenzy without my control.the combat is very clumbersom and slow attacks, swinging into air or even double swinging bug which leaves me just open to any attack. I normally have to use the AI walk bug to run back and swing before their hit animation goes off...However the style of the game is good, I like the laid back style of a overhead game and the puzzle elements.But it just doesnt feel complete and  I just cannot recommend the game. is it unplayable? No. Is it a bad game? No but it is 100% not complete. If I was being brutally honest I would call this game ""early acsess""Another annoying asf fact. everytime why do I have to grind through the same creeps when I die. Just makes it so tedious and very frustrating. Also the shadow imp things that take ya daughter away are just too hard to kill and almost 80% of the time I then have to tediously go back and grind to get free her."
76561198111050030,Not Recommended,633950,35395819,Posted: 1 October,all,Midex,Great game but the combat. Unfortunetly for me the combat is the most important part :(. Oh and the reason I dont like is your hero is way too slow. Dodge + 1 sword hit ( thats if you land it before the ennemy super fast strike you) and your out of stamina and back peddling for the next 5-6sec.
,Not Recommended,633950,35428594,Posted: 2 October,all,kmp,"I didn't play this game for long because I couldn't bring myself to do it, the controls were just too unresponsive.Pros:-Interesting graphics-Decent sound-Good use of particlesCons:-0.1s-1s delay when using a control-Story isn't presented very well in the beginning-Weird inventory system-No camera angle adjuster-Stupid tutorial segment where all you do is read signsGoing to return this game, I might buy it again if they fix the unresponsive controls because it's honestly game breaking and annoying, it's like playing with 15fps when you actually have a locked 60."
