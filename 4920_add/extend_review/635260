,Recommended,635260,33530301,Posted: 14 July,all,Stripstroke,"I never played this on mobile but this is how you port a mobile game to PC... you improve it. I would have never guessed that this was a mobile game if a bunch of people didn't tell me it was one and that's a good thing.The good it looks great not amazing but for a mobile game it looks damn great, not much options but enough to satisfy your needs. The gameplay is the best part it's not a simulation or anything but if I didn't read the title I could have easily fooled myself into thinking this was Forza Motorsport 3 or 4 when it comes to drifting. The game has quite alot of cars 20 or more if I remember correctly and they can be customized too. There's also 20 tracks in the game and they are all so much damn fun. Online works great for anyone wondering it's a lobby based system the host picks the track etc, you can free roam on the chosen map or compete against the players in the lobby.Now the bad first off I wanna say while this is fixable this should have been looked into closely before release considering this is a car game, the controller has problems with the trigger which stops you from accelerating properly but this is easily fixed with a couple of changes in the settings. The reason I didn't add audio to the good section is because it's actually not that great cars don't sound awesome at all... barely passable, online has the worst of it with random distortion, crackling and popping engine sounds etc.Honestly this is a great game for $7.99 USD but only for drifting fans because that's really all there is to the game, this isn't for simulation or arcade racing fans. This game is quick drift fun and it does that perfectly!Edit: For people having trouble with the problem that I mentioned in the review.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=975452891"

Pretty much anyone can run this game with max settings and it has the easiest drift mechanic I have used so far compared to other cheap drifting games on steam.

A few problems at the start with controller on axis setup (-1000 for gas and brakes, easy fix) and some sound glitches, but other than that it's a fun game to waste time on.Aesthetic customisation isn't that deep, as you can only choose the colours of your car, wheels and smoke but customisation regarding physical performance of the car is broad which range from tyre width and grip, camber angles, suspension, PSI and many more, which all contribute to your personal playstyle."

,Recommended,635260,33725262,Posted: 22 July,all,Haruna,"This was originally a very well-made mobile F2P game that had been wonderfully ported to PC. For its price it is one of the cheapest drifty fun you can have on Steam. The game controls very well, with a physics system that is probably not terribly accurate but makes enough sense. The graphics is almost the same as if you are playing on an iPhone, but with 4k support working very well on my PC which is no longer top of the line (i7 2600+GTX970).It is important to note that, back in the day, CarX Technologies produced a PC demo that was considered to be a real competition against Live For Speed (which was one of the best simulators on the market, and arguably still is). CarX Technologies clearly understand how to make a racing game that is both enjoyable and reasonably challenging. Their PC demo, along with the mobile build later on, both handled extremely well. The drift handling in this game easily blows any recent-year NFS game out of the water.Highly recommended for any racing game fans."

Other than that, great game mechanics and car selection, but i have a suggestion: the 1998 Subaru Impreza, you should name it Syberia Impaler or something. I think thats a nice name. thanks though for making this game, I've been looking for a game like this."
,Recommended,635260,35056667,Posted: 18 September,all,btal,"I've played CarX Drift Racing for years, starting on iOS when there was just an R34 GT-R and Silverstone for a track. Even then in its early stages, I thought the game was pretty good and that it had a lot of potential if the devs decided to make it better. I've played it on and off in the following time, watching the game continue to improve and grow. Years later, the developers have created this PC version, which is a port from the mobile version with minor differences. As a relatively seasoned player, CarX Drift Racing is one of the better drift games around in my honest opinion. Here's why.If you're a completely new player, the game is relatively easy to get into. If you play other racing games, especially other drift games, you should have no problem getting into CarX Drift Racing. The game has keyboard/mouse support as well as controller and wheel support (not sure if there's force feedback or not yet), meaning that you have a range of options for you to choose for input.When you start off in the game, you barely have enough money to buy Class 1 (C1) cars. After buying your first car, it will be stock and you will not have enough money for a tuning or paint, so you will have to try the car in a quick race. You can choose from Training to Time Attack races to Drift races to online lobbies. As you complete more races and earn coins and XP, you will be able to level up and unlock more customizations and tunings for each car. You are able to change your car's base paint, rim paint, window tint, smoke color, and engine tuning. There are 5 classes of cars, C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5. The higher the class a car is, the larger coin multiplier it will have in races (i.e. C5 cars have a x5 multiplier whilst C2 cars have a x2 multiplier).For players returning from the mobile version, CarX Drift Racing is still mostly the same game that we all know and love. Not much has changed, as this is a port with minor differences. The physics are the same, the cars are the same, the tracks are the same, etc. If you were a fan of the mobile version, I would highly recommend getting this for a better, PC-oriented experience if you're considering.There are a few small changes I have noticed (based on iOS version):- No microtransactions / secondary currency (well the game is $8.99 USD so I would hope there would be none)- Drift races have a somewhat different points system- Even more settings for graphics, controls, etc.Overall, I believe CarX Drift Racing is an entertaining drift game that anyone can get into, whether it's a player that has been drifting in the game for years or someone who wants to try a new racing game. It's generally a laid back and easy game (also makes for a great time killer) and the grind for cars and tracks is not prevalent until much later into the game. I would recommend it to anyone willing to try a new drift game and any older players considering getting this version on PC. I've had fun playing the game for the past few years and I'm happy for it to be on PC, where it could potentially become even greater."

It takes a long time to level up, and certaincustomization features are only available to the higher-level players.-The controls are too sensitive when you don't have the assists on.I would definitely reccomend this game, as it's currently quite fun.

,Recommended,635260,33818455,Posted: 26 July,all,Falcon Took a Bath,"A pretty decent looking, great-feeling car game about tuning, racing, and (surprisingly) drifting. It's really fun and although at first I was on the verge of refunding it, after unlocking a few things I realised how much I enjoyed it. Don't worry about the mobile port, it's pretty much unnoticable.Most of the negative reviews are talking about how the game's handling or physics are terrible, which they seem at first in the stock starter cars, but after getting a bit further in they're much better, after an hour or so.The GoodDecent GraphicsFun, smooth, moderately realistic in some areas gameplayGreat performance tuning, far surpassing pretty much all need for speeds, and probably many big budget racing games.Nice car selection, and multiple ways to setup each carRuns well and 0 loading times for meMultiplayer works great and is super fun to just drift around with other peopleEasy to learn, hard to master type of thingController and steering wheel support works greatNo microtransactions (sad that this is seen as a reason for buying a game)NeutralPretty challenging and not so fun at first before you've unlocked anythingSounds aren't the best, but they're not disgusting eitherThe BadNot a whole lot of contentLimited maps means that earning money can be quite repetitiveNot much visual customisation (isn't a major downside but would be nice)No tutorials or anything like thatPhysics are definitely questionable when doing anything that isn't racing or driftingMobile quality textures are still around in placesA lot of fun though, definitely give it a try if you're a racing fan, this is the most fun drifting i've ever had. I didn't start properly enjoying myself until about 90 minutes in, but then it was great. Give it a try. Updates should sort out most of the downsides with this game.8/10"

,Recommended,635260,33381483,Posted: 8 July,all,Ringo Sheep,"Early impressions are a mixed bag here. The music is kind of a bore, but it's all royalty free so... whatever that's fine. The sounds could be a little sharper. The graphics are nice enough, but simple enough that it won't be melting any GPU's any time soon. the physics are more or less identical to the android/ios version of the game, so no complaints there.  My biggest issue with the game at the moment is on the control front. The gamepad support is virtually nonexistant. I understand they made this with wheel at the forefront, but the inability to set deadzones on the various axes makes it damn near impossible to play with a gamepad. I do recommend this if you have a wheel, or immense patience, or were just a really big fan of the mobile one like I was."

I understand this game was a mobile game and is moving onto the pc but the menu needs a giant update. I say go for it if you have that pocket change to get it but beware of the probs such as the Xbox controller bug.

I have put countless amount of hours into the mobile version and when I got the notification that this game was released on Steam I immediately bought the game. Now bear in mind the game is in early acces and there are going to be bugs. So far the only bugs I have found are bugs with my controller. For example the deadzone needs to be tweaked a bit because veering to the right sometimes is kinda annoying, also the controller axis is messed up a bit but was easily fixed, the button mapping was a little confusing at first but I eventually figured it out and all was well. But other than that the game is great, im always looking forward to new updates and am real pleased with what the devs are doing. Listening to the community and trying to meet everyones demands is hard work, and I think they are doing a fabulous job.10/10 would buy another one of their products if ever made."

Very good PC port, with amazing Xbox controller support(can't speak for wheel users though), online multiplayer is setup just how it needs to be with lobbies created by people, and not matchmaking crap as in newer Forza games etc.Car list is small, but to be completely honest if they added Steam Workshop support to this game and allowed people to make car and map mods, this game would be the best drifting game on the market at this moment in time. The handling isn't exactly simulation spec, but I think with the amount of experience CarX has gained in creating these physics, they could easily make small tweaks for wheel users to get that real feel sim physics style as in Assetto and LFS.Very very excited for what is to come from this game.

I got the Mustang g350 and the ultimate tune and I can't stop smiling. I have been borderline brought to tears of how satisfyingly beutiful the gameplay is. I can max out the graphics and resolution in single player but be warned that you will have to lower your graphics or turn off antialiasing if you have a lower end system and want to play multiplayer. 10/10 you can't go wrong with this purchase..d

There is a good selection of cars, some of my favourites!If you are like me and don’t know much about tuning cars, there is a ready built “drift” setup which will allow you to get in and start drifting without a steep learning curve. If you do know what you’re doing, the “ultimate” setup lets you fine tune pretty much everything!I am using a PS4 controller through DS4 and it handles and feels great. If you are using a controller, I recommend turning off steering assist and reducing GAS linearity to 0. You can also reduce the Steering linearity to 0 if you wish. These tweaks will significantly improve gameplay. I also highly recommend switching transmission to manual, with or without clutch. Leaving it in auto significantly reduces your ability to maintain drifts as it upshifts when you don’t want to, losing power. With manual, you have control over downshifting to get the most out of your drifts.Game is cheap, game is awesome, game will continue to improve…not a hard decision."
