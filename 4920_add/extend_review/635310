76561198000397205,Not Recommended,635310,31832963,Posted: 18 May,all,Fremming❤,"Writing this review as a completionist.I would recommend it to someone wanting 10 minutes of amusing gameplay.Gameplay:Choose 1 out of 9 sniperspotsLook at objectivesWatch the skijumper prepare for the jumpWatch the him go down the slopeWatch him jumpShoot himWatch the trajectoryWatch the impactWatch the skijumper tumble downRepeat(1-4 jumpers per round)Each round takes 20 - 90 seconds depending on how many skijumpers and if you ""skip"" the slow mo.Objectives:These objectives range from easy to almost impossible. Which is great.4-6 objectives for each of the 9 sniperspots.ExamplesHeadshot 15 timesRibs 20 times(neck, kidney, liver, lungs, foot)8 kills in a rowKills without zoomingHope that the body flies 165 meters.Unlocking Weapons and Pills:5-6 weapons and 3 pillsUnlocking by paying money you get for killing skijumpers and completing all objectives on a sniperspot.Problems and why I'm giving it a thumbs down:The gameplay gets boring, fast. Why? Well, because most of the time you watch a skijumper go down the hill. 1% of the time you shoot him. You can't skip it, you can't fast forward it. You can however skip the slow motion, so you watch it in normal speed instead.Money and Unlocking weapons is too easy. I think you start off with 300k(Not 100% sure if it was a bug or not) which unlocks nearly everything in the store, took me maybe half an hour to unlock everything. Never tried every weapon, just because I already had something better.Buggy and boring objectives. To get the objectives you have to do it on the last jumper, meaning your headshot on the first jumper doesnt count towards your objective. One of the sniperspots have ""hit 20 ribs"" and ""hit 15 heads"", which takes alot of time. It's super easy, but it takes up to 20 minutes of gameplay.100% of the achivements:Be prepared to play 10 hours, 9,7 of those 10 hours will be spent watching the animation and simulation. (EDIT: I completed it in 3,5 hours. You might be able to complete it in 2 to 2,5 hours)Imagine having a 20 second animation every time you die in games likeSuper Meat Boy,VVVVVVorI Wanna Be The Guy.To the developers:-Add a skipfunction to slope, impact, raggdoll to next jumper.-Objectives should count on every jumper, not just the last one on the round.-Unlock weapons by completing objectives, or give the player less money at the start. Grinding is not fun, but then you actually have a reason to have more than 1 weapon in the game.Easy fixes that makes the game alot more enjoyable.Bugs:- You sometimes spawn on a skichair that's shot down- ""Hit * in a row"" Sometimes there are only 6 jumpers, but you have to hit 8 jumpers in a row. So you have to hope that the game gives you enough skijumpers."

The hills in their snowy blanket enchant the scenery. It’s a great day for all kind of people. Couples, families and friend travelled together to Engelberg to admire this spectacular sporting event.The first jumpers prepare themselves for the jump.The people are visibly excited as the first jumper now finally races down to the ski-jump. The skies on the track make a reassuring sound. Ten seconds later he’s in the air and flying towards the crowd.The tranquillity is mesmerising.*zgiuuuuuuuu**baaaaaaaam*Suddenly a hiss followed by a loud bang.The ski jumper tumbles uncontrolled through the air. 2 seconds later he hits hard, with his back first, the ice cold unforgiving snow. The public does not know at this time that he was gone long ago.The first paramedics rush to him. Too late, no one can help him. The bullet went through both lungs and brushed the heart.The peacefulness is over. Everything gets hectic. Children are crying and people are panicking.And I?I calmly collapse my Bipods put on my white camo hood. Collect the empty cartridge and get moving as I have a long way to go.…I will return……kill again……they’ll never catch me…10/10 would kill again"

76561198005283699,Recommended,635310,34781455,Posted: 6 September,all,Bodhi's Pool Repair,"Like the name suggests you are sniping people on skis running down a slope. You have different locations to choose from and each comes with its own tasks (5 headshots, 8 hits in a row and so on). With each guy you snipe and each task you complete you earn money to unlock weapons and pills. The pills can be used to slow down time to hit more accurate. Some have a higher total duration but shorter slow motion - you get the idea.I was able to 100% this game in just above 4 hours. It's a fun little timewaster while you are waiting for a Steam download to complete and you can progress in short sessions. Despite the trashy feel Ski Sniper offers solid programming and I didn't encounter any bugs. There is a sense of progression and the difficulty level is balanced. It actually got me thinking a few times how to hit the right spots, considering my viewpoint, the angle of the guy and the relating position of his organs.Is it worth 5 bucks? No. Should you get it on a sale? Only if you like cheap silly games to kill time. Do you have to feel ashamed for buying and playing it? Absolutely!"
,Recommended,635310,34524259,Posted: 27 August,all,Spooky Ol' Untrustable,"Ski Sniper is just a prettied up flash game essentially. People ski down a slope, you shoot at them, you get a knockoff Sniper Elite X-ray shot view. Doing this all earns you money, which you can use on new sniper rifles and pills to steady your nerves and make stuff go in slow motion. The game has multiple sniper spots with increasing distance and difficulty but as the challenge ramps up so do the rewards, allowing you to buy bigger rifles with better zoom. Its fun for a couple hours or if you just want something to play without starting into a grand adventure or anything like that. Mindless fun."

Buy it, try it, then maybe refund it. Your choice."

Someone who came up with this idea must have been laying in a chair and thinking of something stupid.Gameplay of this game is okay. If you want a better gun, you have to grind. It is actually somewhat entertaining but not for a long time. If you like to relief stress by killing some skiers this game is for you!"

,Not Recommended,635310,33839311,Posted: 27 July,all,One Man One Pole,fun time waster but after 3 hours and unlocking everything there is absolutly nothing to do.no word from devs if more will be included.

,Not Recommended,635310,34339943,Posted: 18 August,all,maxsalhab,"Its a cool concept. However, it is made artifically hard for no reason. And the energy focus boost  you get at first when you press it is wayyyy to short."
,Recommended,635310,31927668,Posted: 23 May,all,WAFFLᴱ,"I began to play this game and I thought it was trash, I tried it again a little bit later and I was hooked.  While it isn't the best looking and optimized game it is kinda fun.  Something about shooting people skiing out of the sky is just kinda nice."
,Recommended,635310,31911789,Posted: 22 May,all,Fuzzy Crumpet Nuggets 257,Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is amazing. I didn't expect much for the price but it's challenging and addicting. It's an f'd up plot but I can't stop giggling like a school girl at the insane hits I get and watching the bodies fly forward. You have to quickly make a target acquisition and fire at just the right moment... something I was getting good at before I realized that you don't actually need to work as hard because there's a sort of bullet-time you can do with left shift. Oh well. Fun as hell and definitely worth the price.

,Recommended,635310,34005235,Posted: 3 August,all,Ballistic Otter,This is a video game with an extremely misleading title. You shoot skiiers in this game. 4/10 thought it was a biathlon simulator.

Looking at the specs I would assume a windows 10 with 8gb of ram would be good enough. Not been able to get a hold of any devs yet and it won't let me post in the message boards for unknown reasons.I don't suggest anyone waste their time or money on this.If you're looking for a fun single player game, try 'We Happy Few', you can contact the devs and usually get an actual person's email response in 15 minutes."
,Recommended,635310,33272525,Posted: 5 July,all,zogingu,"a very well executed novelty. gets pretty repetitive very easily, maybe the price/playtime ratio is a little too high. you'll probably get more out of it than i did if you're a completionist (who's into fps) and can put up with some questionable difficulty variables"
76561198251423332,Recommended,635310,33325881,Posted: 6 July,all,Herre,"Simple but fun game. Perfect if you want to play a game for a couple of minutes to fill up an emptyness in your day. Or if you simply want to shoot some monkeys (Skieërs that is) out of the air.To my believes it would've been better if:-it was more difficult to unlock the guns because cash is comming in rather quickly and you can immediately buy any of the rifles.Better would be to earn less money for every shot (bone/organ), or make the rifles more expensive. Another option is to release the rifles when you've achieved certain missions- possibility to skip the cutscenesI started to get annoyed with the cutscenes (falling when hit or landing when missed) as they took too long to my opinion. You could increase the speed of the falling cutscene but still...The start of the skieër you could skip (Yipee!), But if you are too quick you missed if it was a multiple jump.- the hits (bones/organs) with a multiple jump also count up for your objectivesIf you hit the first jumpers the hits (in the organs or bones) don't count up for the objectives.On the other hand, it made me play a little longerAlso shooting from the chair lift was anyoing as ♥♥♥♥! bars were always in the way, which made the chair drop when hit. Causing you to fall down to a place with a bad visibility (sometimes also better...) In order to get the sniper back in the lift I had to restart the game.But overall a fun game on which I enjoyed myself for 10+ hours already (just bought it this week)!I recommend to buy it (in sales!)"

Very enjoyable waste of time and you can jump in and out in 5 minutes if you just need something quick.  There is not a lot of content, so don't buy intending to find your ""next big game"" but as a time kill it is most definitely a keeper."
,Recommended,635310,34364259,Posted: 19 August,all,shrek 2 factory worker,"Overall a pretty good game. It does get quite repetitive and boring after a while.Could definately use some new weapons, maps, perks, etc.Right now the game is like a 6.79/10 for me but I think it has the potential to become an 8.5+/10 with some improvements.(Don't waste your in game currency on the crossbow, it's not that great)"
,Recommended,635310,34512535,Posted: 26 August,all,justgivemeanamegoddamnit,"For 5$ it's definitely giving enough fun.I feel though that there's missed oportunities here, the game is rather short (In 1h42 I got almost every weapon in the game), there's only 1 map (but with a good variety of positions from where you can take your shots), the killkam looks pretty basic in the trailers but in games it's actually an ok cam and features a decent amount of bodyparts-specific scores.....I hope the dev(s) will make more games in this style, would gladly pay for more like this."
