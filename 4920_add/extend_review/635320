76561198192525535,Recommended,635320,34637377,Posted: 31 August,all,yevgenyt11,"This game is simply amazing.I'm a long time fan of Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree fame but actually better as a solo musician in my opinion) so a video game based on one of his best songs and videos was a dream come true and it didn't disappoint. ""Drive Home"" was touching and the video was visually stunning and this is also true to this game.The watercolor-like visuals are smooth and manage to be soothing and melancholic at the sime time. Steven Wilson's music here is mainly instrumental versions from his solo albums and it works effortlessly as a soundtrack.The story of the game is mainly stripped down to pure emotions and although simplistic, the raw emotions of the experience are more than enough to keep you intrigued.So, a basic summary of all the good things here:- Simple and touching story- Great and emotive music sells the feelings- Stunning visuals will suck you in"
76561198139747820,Recommended,635320,34699563,Posted: 2 September,all,Emma7,"This game is incredible. The sheer aesthetic and emotional beauty of the story is breathtaking. Its simplicity is just one of the things that makes it so enjoyable. There are options, but not too many. You'll find yourself going back and forth between characters as you try to lay the foundations in an attempt to achieve a more favorable outcome, but not so much that it gets irritating. The story will keep you going, pushing toward an ending you wish for - whether you get that or not, I won't reveal, because the beauty of this is the unsurity of what, if anything, you can change. The music throughout sets the mood wonderfully, and the soundtrack is something I would buy in its own right. It took me 4.6 hours to complete the game - granted some of that time was chasing my unruly pup away from my mouse lead - but I feel the game is worth the money. I highly reccommend it. It really is a thing of beauty."
,Recommended,635320,34666162,Posted: 1 September,all,[IDOCCSIMMP] Holysharky,"This game is immensely emotional. Don't expect to play it without crying.The artwork is gorgeous and nothing needs to be said about Steven Wilson's music - as a huge fan I already knew what I was getting myself into... even his music videos can make me cry.I think it's fantastic how the faces are drawn - every character is uniquely identifiable by a particular trait but because all of them are ""faceless"" it's easy to empathise with them; put yourself in their shoes if you will. Each character has their own (sad) backstory so there's something for everyone who's been down and out in life. This makes the game so much more relatable and emotional, especially if one has been through emotional trauma.A game about experiencing life, loving and letting go... sometimes this is just what we need given the stresses of modern life. It's absolutely worth the money.One gripe though: if you don't get all the achievements in one playthrough it seems like the game forces you to restart at the end which can make it tedious."
,Recommended,635320,34769833,Posted: 5 September,all,CONIN,"The first time I heard about ""Last Day Of June"" was a few months ago while reading about and waiting for the newest Steven Wilson's album; at that point I couldn't but wander about: what could offer as a whole a videogame where Steven Wilson is involved?.He once told not being the kind of videogames-interested person and almost neglected the idea of ever participating into them.But, content-wise, aren't his songs the kind of emotional stories with all of the necessary elements to develop a proper history and turn them into something else, besides the music and lyrics themselves? That's what they did with the song ""Drive Home"" (from the 2013 album ""The Raven That Refused To Sing - And Other Stories"") in order to bring ""Last Day Of June"" to life.If you're the kind of person who's really into music, if you're someone who would take its time appart with the sole purpose of enjoying a new album, and, literaly listening to it, you'll easily catch what this game is about.PROS:- Catchy.- Emotional.- Atmospheric.- Trippy.- Really colourful.- Music by Steven Wilson.CONS:- Kleenex tissues not included.- A little bit repetitive in some parts."

Crash 5 times before I get into the ending. Other than that, no problems.Please watch until the credit roll (Hence, the achievement said 'wait for it')7.5/10Recommended!P/S It is coincidence that the game release when Muslim celebrating Eid al-Adha which is emphasize more on sacrifice for the love one.

76561198141835920,Not Recommended,635320,34646808,Posted: 31 August,all,Lyph,"Last Day of June is a good game.So why I don't recommend it ?First : it's short. You'll end the story in two hours, maybe less, a bit longer if you want to complete it 100%. I usually don't mind shorts games, but this one is... Well. It's a bit of a puzzle game, where you switch character to solve a problem. But it's too easy, too quick. When you start thinking it can give some nice puzzle, it's already over. I was expecting at least four hours of actual game, and it's not even it.Second : It's not challenging. I understand the game is supposed to be mostly a story you're being tell, but... There's no real puzzle. Everything is too obvious, you almost get the answer before the problem is even there. I think it's a problem.I could talk about the price and the actual content, but hey. It's a good game, the story is nice (but kind of obvious too), but it's really little. I think the main problem is a lack of ambition. This game has a nice artistic view, it has nice details, but they're not used. And I even feel one of the character is underused. That shouldn't happen in such a short game.TL;DR : Game is cool, but underexploited"
,Recommended,635320,34785776,Posted: 6 September,all,Jordan!,"I've played video games for the majority of my 30 years of existence. Occasionally you'll find that game that is so far exceeds your expectations. That leaves you mouth gaping and unable to stop thinking about it, even hours after you're done.Last Day of June is one of those games. The one that spoke to me. The one that's mechanics intrigued me, that challenged me, that made me slowlly take my time and try to savor each scene.Although it may have it's own flaws, when it stands strong and proud it outshines any gripe I may have had. The story takes twists that I didn't see coming, made me care and connect with clay people with no eyes -- the same ones who display some of the best traits and signs of emotion.If you are even remotely interested in this game, turn away from this review now. Don't read anything else. Put on some headphones, turn down the lights and just let this short (~4.5 hour game) make you run the gamut of emotions.Last Day of June tells a complex story but one that doesn't leave pointless ends loose or show any sign of being pretentious or ""heady"". I can honestly say, from the bottom of my heart, this game is a top 3 and candidate for GOTY. To say that in 2017 should speak words for itself.Last Day of June is a masterpiece and one that should be played by all."

And the end result is just pure beauty and art!Yes, the game is short and not very complex, but the animation is outstanding and the artwork is very beautiful, plus you get to listen to Steven Wilson's instrumentals the whole game and enjoy this little journey to save your beloved one.or not :'(Get ready for a roller coaster of emotions with this game!"

His music was well edited to the game, and the world flowed nicely with his music.As I expected I cried at the end of the game. I knew I would - even SW music videos do that to me."

I can't really say anything without spoiling it but I highly recommend everyone to play this, especially if you love games like What Remains Of Edith Finch.This is one of the most beautiful looking Unity games out there. The use of image effects and art style is brilliant, the depth of field is actually used extremely well. The soundtrack is also very good, after playing this I had to look up Steven Wilson and now can't stop listening to his music.The story is based off this music video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycYewhiaVBk"
76561197993559501,Recommended,635320,34644202,Posted: 31 August,all,Nirami,"Masterfully animated and modeled. The fact that it's difficult to put down and seldom too hard means that it doesn't overstay its welcome. I beat it in three hours and I think that was the perfect length for it. Wilson's music works perfectly as a soundtrack with different tracks giving each character their theme, and the crescendos on some of the songs from Grace for Drowning amplifying the weight of the dramatic parts.The game was not as emotionally gripping as I had anticipated but I really appreciated its blend of drama and whimsy.I experienced no crashes during my playthrough."

,Recommended,635320,34647091,Posted: 31 August,all,d3fin3d,"Last Day of June is... Stunning. This game is a masterclass in multi-angled intertwined storytelling, emotionally captivating an audience and simple yet gorgeous animations & visuals. Without giving too much away, this is a wonderful example of an enthralling and empathetic game that combines logical awareness and a small cast of endearing characters with an ocean of personality.Not without it's flaws, Last Day of June is fairly short (3-4 hours for most), relatively simple and has an unskippable cut-scene system. The latter makes perfect sense in the early stages of the game but, as you familiarise yourself with the game mechanic, some skipping would have helped the general flow of progression.That said, this title is one of only a handful of games (including Firewatch & Alan Wake) which have successfully tugged at the heart strings and have beautifully absorbed the player into a whole new vibrant and characterful world.In my book, Last Day of June is a winner.Prepare to feel!"

So there's no need to say the soundtrack is great and there isn't much happiness in it. At some point you understand what's happening (or will happen). It's basically a game about death in a cute art style that makes you want to hug the people that matter to you."

The art style, animation quality and music are all phenomenal.My only gripes are that there is no fast forward mechanic like in life is strange, without this the game starts to get a little stale.And my game lagged severly at 1440p, I have a beefy system so it shouldn't do that, and I can run much more demanding games at 60 fps 1440pBut at the same time with the art style, bumping it down to 1080p there wasn't much of a difference in visual quality. The game even launched in 720p and I didn't even notice until about 30 minutes in when I dived into the options menue.overall if you want a unique story... sort of a groundhog day meets tim burton then this should be right up your alley."

While crafted, while planned out story and it will keep you on your toes to think. Not a very long game but it really didn't matter cause the storyline just drags you into the jounery to save the one(s) you love. Question is: for anyone whom played this, if you was put into this situation, would yo follow the same path? For me, yes. All in all, this game won't waste your money, it will keep you busy (again, thinking on your toes) and beware--it is a tear jerker."

76561198007252580,Recommended,635320,34664914,Posted: 1 September,all,Sordel,"Last Day Of June is a slightly frustrating, repetitive, arty puzzle game with a slightly Groundhog Day theme. Thanks to its distinctive visual style (with saturated colours and doll-like characters) the game is good-looking, and a soundtrack based on instrumental passages by Steven Wilson means it sounds good too. The reason to play this, though, is not the visuals, the puzzles or the music but the emotional payoff of the sombre tale of a widower trying to fix the past so his wife survives a car accident. If you like games that make you feel something, Last Day of June will do that, and it repays the small time investment of 3-4 hours to take that journey."

,Not Recommended,635320,34714943,Posted: 3 September,all,Wanky mcWankface,"Love Steven Wilson, enjoy games.  Not this one.  There are moments of poetry and beauty, but not enough to spend hours repeating the same cut scenes over and over.  The game requires you to make obvious mistakes, to go and watch the same cut scene again and again, rather than have the choice to simply fix the inevitable in the first place.There is also more of an idea of a story than a game.  There's not much in terms of 'playing' which is I beleive what games are about.  It's closer to pressing A, until you're given another repeated cut scene or some dull task that literally feels more like a chore than a video game.I feel bad for writing such a crappy review, but this needs so much more work before it's entertaining.  I have spent several hours now on it, and as much as I want to play to actually see a story unfold, I am already bored to death and giving up on this."
,Recommended,635320,34827871,Posted: 8 September,all,ElusiveOne,"TheLast Day of Juneis a heart-touching story based on the simple premise of going back in time to introduce small changes in hope of saving one's love from a terrible fate.Gameplay alternates between June, Carl and a handful of other sympathetic characters living in a tiny bucolic village, where each one plays an unsuspecting role in the unfolding tragedy. Trigger and relive memories and then rewind the day.Altering mundane but significant details enables new perspectives. Go back again to undo previous changes for yet different outcomes. Designers did a great job of shortening the process by not resetting the simpler completed tasks, conveniently avoiding most of the tediousness of repetition.Fixing timelines is more about solving the story's main conundrum rather than crafting a personalized narrative. There is only one solution and one final ending. Dealing with time travel almost invariably incurs implausible circumstances in other fiction but writers here successfully avoided that pitfall entirely.The game features a great selection of some of Steven Wilson's more accessible songs in mostly instrumental versions. It is a delight to appreciate his evocative music in interactive fiction, here perfectly fitting the theme and story, without stealing the spotlight.Characters speak in gibberish voices of uneven quality and often exaggerated tones, perhaps unsurprisingly voiced by the developers themselves. Nevertheless, characters convey a lot of emotion entirely without facial expressions, especially from the finely detailed animations.PositiveOver-saturated palette and unique watercolor art styleRomantic, childlike ambianceEmotionally rich story with teary-eyed endingEnveloping ambient soundtrack and chilling scoreOriginal character designSmooth controlsNegativeInconsistent framerate on even moderate resolutionsInfrequent save pointsMissable memories must be collected before entering the final segment (or start over)Concise, beautiful, delicate and personal; recommended to all fans of story-driven adventures."

The art style is just incredible - take a screenshot at any time and it'll look like a handmade painting.All the little stories as well as the overarching main story were interesting and emotionally investing.Steven Wilsons music is always incorporated tastefully and supports the story and the emotions it delivers.If you want you can discover extras scattered across the detailed and lively game world to reveal more about side characters. I also like that there is a sprint button so you can progress at your own pace.Though gameplay is not the main focus in this game, there are some clever gating mechanics. Certain characters can unlock various areas for each other so you have to think about which characters to pick to open your path as the current character.Get this game if you want a nice 4h interactive story-heavy experience with loveable characters and a strong emotional impact.

I was not expecting much: a short, touching story (check), good atmosphere (sort of - check), a good game (no check).The game gets slow and repetative around the middle part and there is no stopping to it. The only ""game"" parts in it are the puzzles, but they are easy to figure out but take a long time to complete them.The story itself is fine, with a neat little twist at some point, but from around the two thirds of the game I just wanted it to end.You may want to watch a walkthrough on youtube for the story, it beats playing the game for sure.To sum it up:Pros:- Nice graphics- Good story- Extras give more backgroundCons:- Easy puzzles- Takes a long time to solve them- Slow, repetative gameplay- The game is short- No replayability"
76561198025926363,Not Recommended,635320,34954531,Posted: 14 September,all,Exodus,"This very much is a game I'd like to rate mediocre instead of thumb down/up, but since I can't do that here is my reasoning for rating it down. Story, world, characters and artstyle are really well done. The whole game is a groundhog day scenario in which you want to alter the events of that day to change it's outcome.So far so good.The 20$ pricing is fair, but also not a bargain. If you buy the game at launch you will get Brothers a Tale of two Sons as well, which makes it totally worth it. In case you're not absolutelly sure about the game I recommend waiting till a sale.The game could do with a little more optimaziton, shadows and even a few objects can have a fairly small draw distance, especially if you consider the small world space you're messing around in. And the blurdness for everything that isn't super close to you is actually uncomortable to look at.Loading times are fine on PC, but can be kind of lengthy on console (just a heads up).By the way, make sure to get all collectibles for the first three characters before you head on to the next. You won't be able to go back and a free roaming collector's mode or a chapter selection are nowhere to be seen.Now to my two major complaints with the game:With a groundhog day scenario you're bound to experience certain things over and over again, but the excessivness of cut scenes you HAVE to watch again and again is absurd. A skip functionality is very much needed here. It reminds me of the travel videos in Mass Effect Andromeda and I don't understand how things like that slip through.My last point is very much a personal opinion than anything else, but it bothers the hell out of me and is probably the biggest reason for my down vote. I'll talk about the actual ending of the game so i'll come to my conclusion for the game right here before that. Make sure to avoid the part after my conclusion if you wish to remain spoiler-free.In the end, what you want from the game and what you make of it is entirely up to you. That's also the reason why I totally understand why other people had such a good time with the game.Spoilers ahead!!!Story games with a focus on choices often only give you an illusion of choice, for reference just look at any Tell Tale game, but in the end you can still enjoy the story even if it doesn't really change with your choices.The problem this game has however is, that there isn't that much story in the game to begin with. The ""story"" is you changing up things to alter the outcome of the scenario you're presented with. The choices you make here do actually matter for the story. The story of course being highly linear since you work towards one specific goal makes this game more like a puzzle game in that regard.The problem occurs when the story ends with the most typical way possible for all those ""changing the past to alter the future"" games. It nullifies. The past cannot be changed and that in return makes the whole story, the whole experience I had so far sooooo much less enjoyable. Since everything in the end was for nothing I am left wondering why I even bothered. The ending can result in an emotional response for some people - it teaches you about letting go and goning forward, which for might do the trick for you. But as someone who isn't looking for everyday life lessons in a game I'd rather have developers move away from the idea of ""you can't change the past"".The ending comes with a second twist as well, which I saw coming, but it was still just as impactful in my opinion.The question I have is: Why not be bold and actually have changes alter the future and you could choose from a couple of event-chains and the multiple endings resulting from that. For example: would you sacrifice someone innocent to avoid your own mistakes? If you like time travelling I can recommend Life is Strange or Zero Escape 3: Zero Time Dilemma."

No saving in the game until auto-saves (which are far apart in the game) at what I would describe as ""chapter points.""If you've spent a half hour wandering around or trying different options in gameplay, but need to quit out, it brings you back to the last checkpoint area,which in some instances is WAY back in the game. Replaying huge swaths of gameplay,even a game as enjoyable as this one, is not a pleasant thing if you're an adult and need to attend to non-gaming matters thus necessitating the need to quit out of a game.I can't for the life of me understand why developers nowadays, especially devs of a game as complex in choices as this one, wouldn't either create more save points, an F5 (quicksave) option, or, like many games: multiple save-at-will points.And now that I've finally gotten through this (otherwise wonderful) game, my only option is to replay the ENTIRE game from the beginning (restart)? That seems quite unfair.To be truthful, as mentioned it is a BEAUTIFUL game, with a rich storyline, a rich soundtrack and unique graphics. But because of the complete lack of saving at will, the option to replay from the beginning doesn't entice me.NOTE: if the almost complete lack of savepoints and/or the only end-game option being restarting from scratch the entire game doesn't bother you fellow gamers....then you're in for a treat with the game as it's beautiful and the story will leave you emotionally spent. SO: ""frequent savers"" beware!"

,Recommended,635320,34942223,Posted: 13 September,all,KingOTRats,"Last Day of June is a short but beautiful story book tale of a quirky man trying to cope with, as well as influence the events leading to his wife's untimely death. The game is heavily cinematic with some aspects of basic gameplay and one well constructed sequential puzzle. If you are in the right mood, and open to being moved emotionally, this is a really intriguing and touching experience. I do not recommend this game for when you have just 30 minutes to an hour of casual gaming. Save it for when you have time to get swept up in the story. My only criticism lies in the fact that the game is very limiting on what little, if any, choices you can really make. This is not the choices matter type of game that I originally believed it to be and I believe it is important others understand that. The game does not progress unless you make the right decisions. But it was clear to me after playing through the whole game that this was done in order to deliver the same powerful narrative to each player. But all in all, the story is well written, and the animation as well as voice acting of the main character's actions and reactions is hauntingly beautiful. I got about 4 hours of gameplay on this game in my first play through. There are some interesting collectibles that reveal more story that I missed however and I am very much interested in going back and collecting them all. I highly recommend this experience."

So, is this game for you? Yes, if:- you are interested in strong story driven games (Telltales, Life is Strange,...)- you do not care if the challenge is not really strong (no puzzle like the Witness, Talos theory: puzzles are really easy in this game)- it doesn't bother you if a game is short, as long as it stays true to itself (3h of gameplay, but amazing graphisms, ambiance, music and story)- you are interested in immersion (the last part of this game is breath taking)- you are tolerant to repetitions (some scene have to be replayed a sometimes 3, 4 times without skipping - luckily they are short)- YOU WANT TO CRY LIKE A M****** *****R (husband/wife post game hug not included in the package)Despite a price a bit too high right now, if you have answered yes to these questions, this game might strongly be for you. For me it was."

The art style is gorgeous, the game itself beingbasedon Steven Wilson'sDrive Home, it'll move you unlike another by the time it ends. With a humane story, fun-puzzle gameplay, and a colourful cast; this game takes that emotional experience from melody and tragedy to much more.This is the sort of game few hours with makes you appreciate life again."
,Recommended,635320,35097190,Posted: 20 September,all,DimDito,"A nice heartfelt exercise in frustration.I really enjoyed it! Not as much as Brothers, but I can justify its length and price tag from where I live. Game looks nice and unique, reminiscent of an oil canvas painting, and I'm willing to forgive it for its inconsistent DOF, dropping framerates and blocky shadows. Music is appropriately subtle and not having intelligible dialogue does great for the visual storytelling. It's still pretty fun to wander around and interact with things just as it was with Brothers, though you do run out of stuff to explore as the story takes place in roughly the same few areas with but a few differences.The groundhog day scenario did start to bother me as a large part of the middle section involves doing some things several times over and not being able to skip cutscenes. The game also breaks a few rules of cause and effect in favor of the story, but I'm willing to overlook that despite having played some other games with much better understanding of time travel. Despite the game's pacing issues, the story it sets out to tell is worth seeing through to the end and wraps up perfectly for what it's going for.I can't say I've never seen stories like this before, but I think Last Day of June has more than enough clever ideas in gameplay and mute storytelling to warrant its existence as a short but decent time travel game. I liked it. 3.5 hours well spent."

I reached the point where you select the next scene, but the bug was that the same selection was always active, I could not activate another one. Within the retrospection, when you shall select various charactes, I could only select the boy, it was not possible to shift to the right and select the next one.Obviously many other people have not seen this problem and could complete the game. So of course I thought it was me stuck in a puzzle and tried on (man it was boring to watch the same scene on and on). But there was no solution.I need to admit that I have not tried to connect any controllers. I played it with mouse and keyboard, only. Maybe with controllers it would have worked.The good news for me was that it was early enough for me to request for a refund on steam. So if you want to check this one out for yourself, get it and test it quickly to find out if it works for you."

,Not Recommended,635320,34889202,Posted: 11 September,all,Gemanoneko,"An update:I've finished the game. Still not recommended. I din't get the point of an ending...It could have been much more mature, but devs decided to go with bittersweet fairy tale. Nothing is wrong with it - even ""Twilight"" has it's audience, but in my opinion game would have much more value if devs would finish it differently.What a hipster game...It's probably just me, but I dislike too much about Last Day of June to recommend it.- art style is awfull in my opinion. It's a thing of taste, of course. I'd probably recommend this game if it used the same style as Brothers- somehow the game is lagging on my PC in 4K (1080 GTX, I7 - 6400K, 16GB ram). If I can run Fallout 4, Resident Evil 7, etc in 4K, I must be able to run Last Day of June- whole gameplay concept feels too simple- it's impossible to skip scenes that I've already saw, which is a bummer, since there is a lot of repetition in this game.- It feels like game creators are very insecure (which is weird, since it's not their first media product). It was somewhat funny to read name of *critically acclaimed director Massimo Guarini (Murasaki Baby, Creative Director for Shadows of the Damned)* 4 or 5 times during the first 10-15 minutes of the game and 5 times during the ending credits...There are some good ideas and some good material in Last Day of June. It's hard not to recommend this game, especially taking into account that ""Brothers"" is one of my favorite games that I finished in one sit, but ""Last Day of June"" just made me feel bored. It's 22:45 and I guess I'm going to sleep (my usual time is around 2AM)."

There is about half an hour of gameplay at best, The rest is cutscenes to get you over the 2 hour mark. I left the game running by accident when I left the room. So now i can't get a refund....The gameplay is decent. (all 25 minutes of it)The graphics for the world/landscape are very nice.The character models aren't very good though. Particularly the protagonist. (slaphead poindexter)Whose idea was it to give the characters no eyes?? That was a crucial mistake in the design of the game and comes across as amateurish.You are forced to watch cut scenes as a way to get you over the 2 hour mark. So you can't get your money back.That alone makes this game kinda trashy.YOU EVEN HAVE TO WATCH THE CREDITS FOR TEN MINS TO GET THE ""REAL ENDING"" AND UNLOCK AN ACHIEVMENTThe narrative is awful. Like it was written by a novice.The story is predictable. And it tries its damned hardest to manipulate you emotionally.If these scum devs had just added a decent amount of gameplay I would overlook all the other things and I honestly would have given this cash grab a good review.EDIT:The clown dev has posted a FAQ on the forum AND refuses to answer questions about the lengthof the game or refunds...GO AND ASK FOR YOURSELF.....EDIT 2:The dev has finally added game lentgh to FAQThe dev also flagged my review and failed lol"

It's what mainly sold me into buying and trying this game in the first place.My only gripe with this game was the inability to skip some of the cutscenes as the game mechanics do require you to go back and forth between characters. It as frustrating, but overall, didn't take away from the story telling.9/10 recommend."
