76561198182932007,Not Recommended,635670,32842530,Posted: 26 June,all,AstronautCat,"I went into this game really wanting to like it. The story really has potential, the atmosphere and design are minimalistic yet very unsettling and brooding, almost monolithic. There was a lot about this game that really seemed to be filled with potential, but ultimately never delivered.I came out disliking this game, even if it was inexpenisve. I think that ultimately there wasn't enough substance in this game to really make it a complete piece. The story, while very mature and grounded, ultimately never really makes you care about the characters or choices all that much. Just displaying depressing dialogue isn't enough to create a narrative. The gameplay really doesn't feel engaging, either. While I understand the overall goal of trying to create a sense of dread with the long, repetative nature of the game, there simply wasn't enough world or character building for the player to really connect with. A better, more engaging narrative with conflict or more important decisions could have really made this a much better experience. Too much minimalism really takes away from this, both in narrative and in gameplay."

Haha...only kidding.You'd be forgiven, at first glance, for wondering if Playdead have rushed out a new game so soon after the glorious Inside. This isn't the case, I'm afraid (though I'm probably also grateful, as great things take time, and I'd much rather they didn't start favouring quantity over quality). So yes, this game looks, sounds and ""feels"" utterly gorgeous. But what about story and gameplay?The story is dark. Or at least, the one iteration which I've played thus far (there's five endings) was very, VERY dark. Which is something I always enjoy, but then again, I'm not everyone. I would certainly say that anyone who DOESN'T enjoy more downbeat subject matter should probably avoid this like the plague. Similarly, anyone who exclusively enjoys fast-paced, action-packed games with lots of stuff to ""do"" won't find much to love here. Team Fortress 2 this ain't.Think of it as a 3D, isometric ""walking simulator"" with a limited number of locations, and a small number of ""decisions"" to make, and you're getting much, much warmer. Some might even call it a tad pretentious, and I wouldn't entirely disagree with them; but sometimes in order to make art you gotta stick your neck out a little. Being ""safe"" is one thing this game certainly can't be accused of, in terms of subject matter OR execution.If any of this still sounds remotely like you, it's only two bucks. Less on sale. The guy who made this game took a risk, so what's YOUR excuse? Life sucks, get a ♥♥♥♥in' helmet.Verdict: 8.5/10."
,Not Recommended,635670,32536064,Posted: 18 June,all,Yagimutsu,"Its a very short game, a dark story in it, the ambience is quite good for the story and graphics & art & sounds are very nice but the thing with this game is that there are some bugs in this game. (For example: sometimes the game stuck at black screen and to get rid of that you should change some in-game settings) Another thing is that game crashes sometimes and unfortunately you cannot save the game so if the game crashes in the middle of the story you have to start all over again. If devs fix these problems then its a playable and a good game."

That said, I highly recommend EMPORIUM. This game is a slow paced, story driven piece that is:- minimalist- relies heavily on character interaction- relies heavily on sound- relies heavily on PACEEMPORIUM gives you a lot to think about, so if you don't like wandering around and reading between the lines, don't buy it. The game is short, has two endings and is a great find for the price."

If you are looking for hours of exploration and boss fights, look elsewhere. This is a very dark story with a perfect soundtrack accompaniment. There is approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour of play and should be played in one sitting. Can't beat the price when it's on sale, but it is well worth it at full price.

Having a small contained game that can be completed fairly quickly feels good, especially ones as clean, crisp, and interesting as this one. It's very short, but quite potent. I've only completed it once and I feel like there are other endings so I'll be jumping back in soon."

76561198001565857,Recommended,635670,33697719,Posted: 21 July,all,SleepingGiant,"Emporium is meditative and ethereal, and immensely sad.Effectively a 2.5D walking simulator, with minimal interactivity, a fractured narrative, and haunting mood. It is beautifully presented, with dreamlike imagery and ambient sounds. It lasts about 30mins, and is worth playing twice to see all dialogue.For me it was an unforgettable experience, but it won’t appeal to everyone. It’s slow, echoingly empty and lonely, and aching with despair. But if you like experimental non-linear narrative, or just appreciating a dreamlike and melancholy mood perfectly evoked, Emporium excels at this.The atmosphere is a bit like walking around in the surrealist paintings of Jeffrey Smart: a tiny figure beside vast, anonymous urban buildings, which warp into each other impossibly. Even the vantage point of the camera, distant and detached, reinforces the sense of loneliness that pervades every scene.It’s one of the most emotionally affecting games I have played. It is heavy with feelings that you could name as depression or regret, but no words really capture the pure wordless sorrow of it. It’s all the more impactful for being slightly abstract and ambiguous, creating a world that you experience as the reflections of a despairing mind, in the fragmented but looping form that such mental ruminations often take, with minor details left unclear. Language, as with other aspects, is used sparingly, so that “less is more”, as well as matching the theme.It’s rare that a game evokes such emotions and does not try to define or make sense of it. Emporium presents its story without judgement, without telling you what to feel, and without pretending to resolve anything.Emporium is a game doing what a work of art should: letting you glimpse into someone else’s mind, expanding a medium to convey its story, enveloping you in its world and moods, and making you feel something beyond what there are words for."
,Recommended,635670,31821055,Posted: 18 May,all,Mrhammers,"Good, short game. Simple mechanics, a story driven game that is pretty linear, only 2 options for each event, so 2 playthroughs will one hundred % complete the game. Well made, easily worth $2."
,Not Recommended,635670,34623561,Posted: 30 August,all,THE KRAKEN,"I don't think I'd recommend this one; not as long as it costs money, anyway. It's a short (I finished a full playthrough in less than 30 minutes), surrealist, walking simulator that seems to have been mistakenly labeled as both ""Horror"" and ""Story Rich"". I don't think this game was at all horrifying and what little story there was was presented vaguely and seemed to think it was far deeper and more emotional than it actually was. The soundtrack was pretty good for the most part though, so it has that going for it at least."
,Not Recommended,635670,33211371,Posted: 3 July,all,ElusiveOne,"EMPORIUMproposes a passive stroll through a dreary museum of dispiriting life memories that influence an inevitably somber denouement.Make vague introspective choices through poetic one-liners with unpredictable consequences. An effectively disquieting mood explores the deep discomfort of being, afflicted by extreme loneliness and the despair of a broken childhood turned into an unfulfilling adult life, and ultimately suicide.""I had built a shrine to monotony.""A young boy routinely meets an old man in a depressing loop of repetitive events. Each scene contains exactly one viable action that reveals a passage to the next one. There is literally nothing else to do in these brief static vignettes, instantly killing exploratory desires and leaving little else to absorb.Sluggishly moving a tiny character in such large expanses of nothingness belies a questionable choice of impersonal scale.The game's unsatisfactorily thin narrative does not successfully elicit a strong emotional bond with its barely defined characters. Two largely similar paths and subsequent endings essentially convey the same story with minor alterations.ConclusionMy expectations of a revealing experience waned into detached boredom, aside from a few key moments where I appreciated the author's efforts, such as interesting perspective shifts or a selection of clever lines. It's a good effort for a one-man project but it falls short of being fully appreciable on its own.Note that without any save option, each playthrough must be completed in one sitting (less than 1 hour)."

Although the gameplay is almost non-existant the atmosphere more than makes up for it. The graphics reminded me a lot of Inside and the sound design was incredible. In my opinion, the story is great however it can be a little too poetic and pretentious at times. That being said, I loved that it was focused around such a dark, taboo subject and I enjoyed both playthroughs to get both endings. It has it's downsides but it is absolutely worth the $2."

76561197995669628,Recommended,635670,34763905,Posted: 5 September,all,Sorokonojka,"EMPORIUMis a psychological walking simulator that is focused on narrative and creating a chilling atmosphere. I usually dislike games in this genre when they have too much downtime but Emporium had a very stimulating progression. I have to compliment developer on having a very consistent tone between dialogue, metaphorical visuals, and sound.  It takes about 1 hour to get 100% completion which included 2 endings. Although it is a short game it had enough time to deliver the narrative and make an emotional impact. Personally, I think it one of the best walking simulators at a very insulting price. Then again it seems like no matter how good a game in this genre is, it can't please everyone. Why buy a walking simulator to complain that it does not have things to do?Aesthetic.I really love the use of metaphorical imagery. Every plot point has a location associated with it that helps in setting up the atmosphere. There is a good amount of psychological effects like surreal events and unrealistic structures. Even the camera use was done in a way that complemented the mood. Although I really wish I could zoom in and out manually to appreciate the environment more. Overall I think the game looks fantastic, especially those light effects that create shadows.Dialogue.The narrative was somewhat vague which is okey because it leaves just enough breadcrumbs to wonder about what really happened. Throughout the game, you get a couple text choices which change other text lines down the road. Each choice seems to have an object associated with it that spawns in specific areas. The format of the game has a bit of a cycling effect where you go through the same area multiple times while things change. You definitely want to play the game twice to get as much story as possible. I thought it was handled well and I most of us can relate to the character.Use of ambiance and sound effects.It is worth noting how well the ""music"" or the lack of was used. Most of the areas have very ambient score almost fitting for a horror game. Sound effects were also well placed to create themes. Like there are no people in the office but you can hear them talking (which is a psychological focus only on the main character)Final Thoughts 8/10I would have to be pretty ignorant to ignore how much attention to detail went into making this experience (cough, cough). Emporium really nailed the atmosphere and creating immersive settings. It would be pretty hard to make a good argument against it at $5, let alone $1. It just comes down to loving or hating walking simulators in general. My only nitpicks are lack of manual zoom and small text (which is completely tolerable) Definitely one of the better games in the genre, at least from those that I played."

You need to go through at least 2 playthroughs to see all the information in the game and to unlock all the achievements.The game is minimal and implicit in its expression, with one-line dialogues and choices leading to unlocking different items and ultimately to two endings (with little differences). Refer to community guides for more information.The game is disturbing in a few scenes, but it should not by any means be considered a horror game. If you are looking for one, you might want to pass this one. The game has a story, but it is not explicitly told; your understanding of the story relies heavily on your speculation. If you are looking for story or interactive novels, this isn't for you.This game is very similar to a previous game by the developers of this game:Mangadon. It is a free game on Steam and I have reviewed it. Both games rely on piecing together scattered information and maybe sumbols for understanding the story. But unlikeMangadon, the story is not clear even if you read all the lines in the game. Maybe it's because my interpretation skills are not good enough, but I did not get nearly as good an understanding of the story. My interpretation is thata boy under an abusive mother commited suicide in adulthood.The game also has shortcomings, like you would get bored easily due to the low density of information and feedback in the game.I would put this game into the middle ground due to its overly implicit expression of information, but unfortunately Steam doesn't offer an option like this. Even so, the game is recommended to those who are interested to interpretation and hidden messages in games.To normal gamers...it's hard to say.6.5/10"

It's not very much a game as it is a story about depression, not how to overcome it but to wallow in it, because things are as they are. You can't make choices to help your character crawl out of it. How it's vague adds to the eerieness, you don't have to know exactly what happened, just that it did. Don't play it if you want something actiony, play it when you want to watch a very sad movie.

I really enjoyed the camera moves and walking through spaces (or running, otherwise some areas take forever), which some remember a few of Monument Valley. Oh, and the atmosphere created is very good with a good help from sound effects (I even got one little jumpscare haha).Now about the narrative. The story with no doubt is dark. Talks about suicide, parenting going wrong, difficult childhood. And the storyline is not given ready in your hands, making you think for some time after playing to connect the elements and think about characters and events.But I don't think it's totally compelling and empathic. Maybe these elements seem a bit far one of another, or there's no big significant event during the journey to keep me interested. The repetition thing of the start is something I still didn't get and made me a bit impatient, and the dialogues seemed too vague. I don't know, that's the impression I've got.But I really recommend the game. For it's price and play time, it's worth it to enjoy some story.
