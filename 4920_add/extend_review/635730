Can barely understand anything cuz it's written in Chinese, so correct me if I'm a little wrong about the story. There is English text in the language text file of the game tho, so if you're interested in the ""plot"" you can go read it there.If you buy this game you should definitely install the 18+ patch, easily found in the top review of this game. For $1.19 I'd say it's worth. It's shorter than my d*ck tho...if you're looking for something to invest a lot of hours into this probably isn't for you.Also, the trading cards are currently selling for like 36 cents, if you sold them all you could probs make your money back. But gotta go fast yo.*Edit: There is a gallery that fully replays all the sex scenarios, so if you want to speedrun the entire game and then come back to jerk that's a legitimate strat too. The game itself is very easy, spin your mouse around in circles and you will wipe out all the enemies. Once you kill enough mobs, the boss will spawn. The boss is easy too, keep a safe distance away from him and mow him down."

It'll sure sell anyways ;).Let's quick check:-The english translation is awful (Not like someone would care).-Gameplay is totally unpolished (was this an uncompleted school project?).-The interface and the menus were probably made with mspaint.-And the story? Well, the story is just as bad as the translation. -.-This game is only selling because of the (kind of) uncensored content. Don't take me wrong, I like my games uncensored, butthis is just like an insult to steam and all of the community. Probably most of the positive reviews are from underage people that have experienced an eroge game for their first time.In conclusion:If you're buying this game, don't leave a positive review just because of the hentai it comes with. It doesn't and it'll never make it a good game. Seriously, think twice about it, this is clearly total trash."

I also think the devs could use a primer course on twin-stick shmup design. I'm not going to list all the 'cons' because the whole thing needs work. I'd be happy to chat about this if anyone needs more information. The game is worth a buck, but I'm downvoting this on the principle that I don't think it's cool to put out titles this low in quality. I will also add that this is one of the most pornographic titles I've run across on Steam. The dialogue is pretty intense, and very cringy.

You get quite fun gameplay and the story of a kind hearted dragon girl, trying to make the world a better place, while being in danger of being corrupted herself. Especially the morally ambiguous ending will change your impression of the seemingly lighthearted tone. My only critique is the length of the game (finished it in about 3 hours), which doesn't do the story justice, but at least there's a game+ afterwards (same levels with increased difficulty).Also it's the perfect source, if you are in dire need of a drinking game just for yourself. Drink every time you see the word ""comfortable"" show up and you'll have the night of your life. Not hard enough for you? Well, don't worry. If you really want to drink yourself to death, then take a shot every time you think that the sentence was being translated by google translate. Cheers!P.S.

,Recommended,635730,32113495,Posted: 1 June,all,Adorable Actions at Kawaii Costs,"Attempting An Actual Review.I've been on a recent kick of wanting to play kusoge games (mostly off steam) or japanese indie titles R18+ or not. So when I saw this for sale for barely a dollar I figured I would have nothing to lose. Along with the Guaranteed Refund.Alright so let's start with the obvious. Yes this is an Adult Title, It's pretty evident. The game has an amount of ""risque"" CG's. (you can get them uncensored if you browse the discussions for more then a minute). The CG art and PLOT is delievered after 2 levels and is basically a reward for finishing that stage. For Titles like this That is what most people prefer rather then only getting to the CGs via losing. The art itself is high quality, detailed and good for the most part. It's not going to win awards but it's better then most indie H-game art by a longshot.The story is just an excuse to present the CGs and is mainly in the background. The translation isBAD. It's kinda funny to be honest and it can produce a few laughs. The plot itself is hard to follow due to it (yeah I know, who cares about H-game plot).Alright so gameplay. It's bare bones Shump. You have a rectangle arena in which to kill evil dragons. After killing a certain amount you encounter a boss and after defeating him you move on to the next stage or ""purify"" him. There's power-ups, an upgrade system and basic 101 shump stuff. It does get steadily harder and you will die until you upgrade to a certain point. It woud get old quick if the game wasn't so short, and most of that time is spent reading the plot (unless you are ctrl like a Mad man.) A minor complaint is smaller enemies are sometimes the same color as the background and are hard to see. Resulting in cheap hits. The gameplay is just painfully average, Upgrades seem useless once you get 5 shot and the Healing super move (why would I use anything but the healing move when heath is rarely seen?) Some bullet types are useless or I just didn't need (bomb and the purple one are easily the best, along with crossfire shot).The game is only 2 dollars (or 1.39 for what I bought it for) and it gave me 3 hours of decent gameplay and a good laugh at the dialouge. The creator will also refund you no matter how much you time you played so you can do that afterwards or use steam's refund policy, (you can also sell the cards to make most money back, Weebs love H-game cards I guess) I'll give the game a recommendation since for roughly a dollar I did get some fun out of it."

,Recommended,635730,32223161,Posted: 6 June,all,cklodar,"As someone who has played both the original and the Steam versions of this game, I believe I'm in a unique position to commend SakuraGame for the fantastic work they have done. If you think all they did was translate the text (into multiple languages too), then you're dead wrong. The Steam version has seen so much improvement over the original that one might as well call it an entirely new game. For starters, the original game does NOT allow controlling with your mouse. Yes, you heard that right -- everything you know about this game that involves moving and clicking a mouse is thanks to SakuraGame's work. I won't go into details as to how exactly the original game's controlling works, but suffice it to say that it induces a lot more unnecessary wear to my keyboard. In addition to controls, the original game is also horribly balanced: I had to fail several levels in Stages 1 and 2 dozens of times just to accumulate enough soul to acquire the necessary firepower; (Did I mention there're 5 levels in each stage, instead of 2?) after that, I breezed through an entire stage (either Stage 3 or 4, can't remember), before needing to grind again. The Steam version, on the other hand, has changed everything from what you can pick up from eliminated enemies to how much soul you can get during each level, and how much you need for each upgrade. The levels and stages also progress much more smoothly in terms of difficulty. Overall, completing the game has become easier, but I'd take that any day over the braindead controls and non-existent game balancing of the original. If you want more challenge, you can always return to Stage 1 and start all over again, which gets a lot harder even for the Steam version.There is, of course, one area where the Steam version fares worse when compared to the original, and that is the ridiculous ""mosaic"" SakuraGame applied to the art. But, as a seasoned eroge player, I generally can't care less about games that don't feature voice acting, and that's why you see me focusing this review almost exclusively on the gameplay aspect. A shooter game is what this title is to me.So, if you're coming for the eroge aspects of this game, do realize that this is only a low-cost doujin production (as opposed to commercial) that has some nice art but lacks voice acting, and that there are many, many better titles on the market. (Mostly not available on Steam, or in English, to be sure.) If you're coming for a shooter game, then I'm sure you'll find the value of the hours of fun this game offers way exceeding its price tag, all thanks to SakuraGame's hard work."

Also, if you're weirded out by awkward and forced sex scenes (like me), skip through them with volume on low. Beyond the weird cut scenes, it is a great game and mildly challenging. Don't forget to level up your character and boost your stats of you do play. I made that mistake and only realized it halfway through the game. If you beat a level, don't hit ""start game"" when you log back on-site that will make you redo the game with saved stats; instead, hit the scene selection button. Both ways will save your stats, but unless you want to keep re-doing the same levels over again, go with the latter."

,Recommended,635730,34257359,Posted: 15 August,all,Renigami,"Some user interface design critiques.1. The only way to skip cutscenes is to painstakingly hold down CTRL. There is no one button press to skip to the next scene or the entire cutscene sequence.2. There is no way to clear one's saved progress, allowing to start fresh again. Many games with save features allow deletion of data.3. When clicking on the ""Status"" on the level map selection screen, there is no indication to press ENTER to return to selecting things.4. You cannot use the mouse wheel to scroll power up items in the upgrade shop.5. There is no in game volume control for music or sound effects. The only way to control the game's volume is through Windows Sound Mixer.6. There is no way to customize controls. I prefer a ESDF setup if I have to use keyboard for movement. Why? Because the F key has the raised bar for homing in my hand by feel.The good things about the game:1. A cheap thrill shooter using a ""dual stick"" approach. One where you move fully in 2D, the other where you fully aim 360 degrees around your character.2. Variety of upgrade bought power ups with currency being your destroyed enemies.3. Bullet hell and enemy hell keeps you dodging.4. Did I mention it is cheap?The bad:1. Can be grindy to easily get past bosses with a favored shot/bullet/skill preference.2. Not much variety in the cutscene sequence and too long of a dialog to skip with CTRL. Not substantial enough to warrant a long sit through of each cutscene sequence between levels.3. Convoluted way of describing the story. Too long did not read, dragons are evil, kill dragons, purify dragons, save world by getting some mystical fruit; oh and somewhere sex is forced in.4. All of the above in game's UI design decisions.Summary:Enjoyable short time sink shooter, Like flavored popcorn, will not fill you up but at least some taste is there and mostly full of air and fluff."

,Not Recommended,635730,32098977,Posted: 31 May,all,Imban,"Don't lewd the dragon.Dragonia is a rather unimpressive top-down shooter eroge. As a shooter, it suffers mechanically from a system where getting hit is punished rather severely, reducing your attack power and taking off a significant fraction of your life with each hit, and yet the controls are rather floaty (especially when you pick up a speed powerup) and your hitbox is fairly large, making it difficult to dodge attacks when things are hectic. Towards the end, the game becomes even more degenerate, with it basically being required to take a special ability that makes you temporarily invulnerable and the stage providing enough enemies, special powerups, and invulnerability powerups that you can remain invulnerable for essentially the entire stage.Some of the weapons you can get (like Five (shot) Wave (bullet)) are impressive visually and fun to use, but unfortunately, needing random powerups to switch between bullet types outside of when you die makes things awkward, especially since several bullet types are terrible and will likely lead to you dying. Likewise, building up to full power after dying can be quite annoying, since you have to get 9 powerups, while losing one of them whenever you get hit, while having significantly weaker attacks.Dragonia is also probably the most pornographic game on Steam, with the ""Steam version"" just having goofy stickers placed in front of the pornographic content while the text goes on and on explicitly in horribly-translated English. While I'm all for the release of R-18 titles on Steam, this is a good example of how the current system doesn't suit them well and they need their own separate section. (Also, given that the English is basically gibberish, the pornographic scenes are... very, very strange.)Finally, despite being a very simple game, Dragonia is rather buggy. 5 of the achievements didn't work on launch, it lacks an options menu and tries to automatically select your text language for you (which also didn't work on launch) and has no way of lowering the sound volume or changing the resolution without messing with system options, and I'm pretty sure I found a spend-money-and-still-have-it-afterwards exploit towards the end of my playthrough.So, yeah. While Dragonia may be of niche interest to some people, by and large it's terrible and should be avoided."

I was expecting a fairly challenging bullet hell but what i got was extreme spikes in boss diffuculty which is what made me mad and 1.5hrs later after giving up on ONLY the 3rd boss i decided that this game was not worth it felt incomplete and in general just broken.Overall gameplay is 2/10 generously speaking that i couldnt finish the game the story i didnt care for that much just a cute dragon girl that ♥♥♥♥s others to purify them so 4/10 and the scenes are solid 8/10 but not worth raging over, just go to♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and youll find better stuff.My overall score will have to be 3/10 needs difficulty system and lots of other things"

In the buy screen when you equip a shoot, switch to another tab, then switch back, the highlighted icon is always the first one, which makes me very confused.2. When you get hit, you not only lose a portion of your hp, but also a level down, which is very frustrating considering the hitbox of the heroine is so big, sometimes it's just impossible to avoid getting hit, IMO this is bad design and should be removed. Killing stuff while dodging bullets is fun, but in this game you just just can't do much with a one star shoot, especially later on in the stage where you have endless swarms of enemies(with high hp) flying into your face.3. Difficult <> Fun. I got to stage 3 and that bone dragon kept charging at me while making bullet walls in front of me, I can't think of a way to survive this beside using the shield skill, after dying like 10 times I decided to just go to the steam page to request a refund.This is a game full of confusion, frustration and pain, the ARTWORKS are great tho, the cut-ins somehow reminds me of Mushihimesama."

Yes please!It's pretty short and you can finish the game in 3-4 hours but it's also fun! Since it's not a vertical/sidescroller bullet hell, there's a bit more strategy involved than pure reflexes and pattern memorization. There are different bullets and skills to be used but best build is Penetrating laser  + 5 shot + Hyperspeedburst shield. Why? Because it covers range and damage. It takes longer to clear a mission but it's the safest way. Also around the last few stages, you'll spam shield literally since there's pretty much nowhere to run, kinda bad design but still fun in a way. As for the content, the art is good but translations is hilariously bad. It's also pretty cheap so yeah go for it if you have spare game cashOverall 7/10"

One was the price and the other was because of how much I enjoyed another game, Hell Girls, by this Developer/Producer.During my first playthrough of this game I was seriously at a loss. Regardless of my language settings, the game was set to Chinese which I couldn't read. I found myself clicking through the cut scenes confused out of my mind. There's quite an abundance of boobs and ""milk"" in this one.A couple days later the game was patched and was finally in ""English"". I say ""English"" instead of English because I'm pretty sure the dialogue was copy/pasted into Google Translate and then posted onto the game. The story at least made more sense now. Apparently she was cleansing dragons, not milking them. Science at it's finest.Once you get into the realm of NG+ the diffiiculty of the game jumps up. I just can't seem to get past Stage 3 on NG+ after quite a bit of trying.

The story is pretty much non-existent and the dialogue (once English was working) is so laughably poor that I found myself just skipping it all by end of stage 2.Control-wise it is decent enough. One issue I had when using a controller was I couldn't utilise the analogue stick to move slowly for more precise dodging, it's either full speed or complete stop, which got me hit more than anything.This brings me onto another problem that got so much worse by the final stages - losing your bullet power!When you die you lose all your shot strength - fair enough. However, getting back to full power is such a pain when continuous streams/sprays of bullets are being fired at you from both the small and large enemies because your shots are that much weaker and you can't kill things quick enough, as well as some of the larger enemies try to ram into you constantly. The amount of enemies ramp up quickly. Oh, and to top it all off, when you get hit you lose 1 level of power, which makes it that extra bit more frustrating (especially when some of the small enemies blend into the background).The stages themselves are big but have nothing to fill them - no obstacle's that you can use to your advantage, to name one flaw.I wish I could give a more positive review, but the negatives do tip the scale for the worse.It's cheap, and thats about it."

I'm not enjoying even trying to work my way through this game so I won't be.The gameplay isn't the best, it's sometimes clunky or slow on the response, the optimisation isn't always the best either as a weapon combo like the Wave + Explosion can make your computer lag to all hell even on the lowest settings. In saying that the variety of the weapon combos is nice even if a few are replicas of each other and don't really do much differently. Also if you get hit in battle, you lose not only a level on your weapon upgrades but also any little dragon helpers that you found too, one before the other would be much better.The art is good quality, which is nice to see.The story: you're a young dragon chosen to go out, defeat and purify the evil dragons. What they don't tell you is that you have to make them feel happiness and this is done through sexual acts. While the story is meh because it's a porn game... what the story contains... is a little much, especially for steam.Scene 1: You give a dragon a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ semi-willingly, he cums all over, we move on with nothing new here.Scene 2: You get held down and r*aped by a dragon... it's bad but I didn't stop because I wanted to see if it used this to evolve the story...Scene 3: This is where I just stopped playing. She lets the dragon f*ck her because she doesn't want to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥again, doesn't want it, doesn't enjoy it. Just accepts it as what she has to do... this kind of thinking isn't the kind of thinking people should have, nor should it be in games that people can just buy on a platform like steam.The game may say that you shouldn't buy it unless you are over 18 but that quite literally doesn't stop anyone from lying about their age, 10 years ago I did the same to buy porn online. But steam as a platform for games and the general gaming community should not have porn games (uncensor patches, sure, they are provided elsewhere so why not), especially when the game is just flat out porn even when censored.I can't recommed this just because of the story so far and from what I've seen people saying, it gets no better.

Buying these types of games always irks me because the adult content is usually censored by bright white lights and such.  That's bad enough, but the censorship in this game completely breaks the immersion, even moreso than the poor translation.  There's no way to undo the ridiculous aspect of the censorship and it completely ruins the game for me.--EDIT--  *This review was not recommended before this point.*I managed to go into the discussions and look at the first thing I could find in English.  After scrolling down to the bottom, someone finally posted an 18+ patch.  Granted, it's still censored, but much better than it was prior.

,Not Recommended,635730,32421031,Posted: 14 June,all,Red,"Okay, I don't even know where to begin with this one.Firstly, with the main reason I (and most of the people who owns this game) bought this game: The porn.Yes, as the pictures in the store page shows, the art is great. There is a good amount of sex scenes, something around 7-8, I believe. As I already mentioned, the art is great. The dialogues, on the other hand, are absolutely awful. Of course, no one expect porn dialogues to be great or anything, but they're so bad that I couldn't stop myself from laughing at the h-scenes. But hey, the translations are so hilariously bad that I found them to be amusing, so I won't say it's a reason not to buy this.However, that's all the game has to offer.I wanted to like this game. The dev is a great guy, I've played another game of his before (hell girls), and he made some huge updates, even after the game was ""old"", and it would, most likely, not make the game sell much more. He even offer inconditional refunds for his game, something I've never seen before on steam. However... Nothing of that can make me enjoy this game...There are so many bad things about it, so many that could be EASILY fixed, that I can't simply delete the game and move on with my life, without writing a proper review.First, the terrible optimization. I do have a low end computer, but I can manage to run games that should be way heavier than this (Killing Floor 2, for example) with an average FPS. In this game, however, it gets some HUGE FPS drops, to the point that render the game almost unplayable. I could try to lower the video settings, but the only options you get are choosing between windowed mode or fullscreen.Second, the ""customization"". There are a lot of shot types, but most of them feel the same. You usually expect the most expensive shot type in the game to be way stronger than everything else, right? No, not really.. It follows the enemy, but it's range is so short that you can barely hit the bosses without getting overwhelmed by their attacks.Oh, talking about getting hit, the most annoying thing at the game. You can take some hits before dying, so get hit shouldn't be a problem, specially since the game throw a lot of situations where it is impossible to dodge. But it is a huge problem, since getting hit lower your shot strenght considerably.  To add insult to injury, there is no invencibility frames. Got overwhelmed and can't dodge? GG. You'll either die, or barely survive and your shot strenght will reset to level 1 (so you'll end up dying anyway).Another problem with the lack of invencibility frames are some mid/end game enemies that are WAY faster than you, and attack at flying in your direction. You can dodge once or twice, but they are so fast the'll catch up to you and, since there are no invencibility frames, you will end up dying because of the continuous damage. And let's not forget the fact that those bigger dragons (that are not bosses) take a couple of minutes of direct fire to die.Also, this is a porn game. There are people who play it mostly for the porn. But there is no way to select the game difficult. Want to play it on easy, just to finish it and enjoy the scenes? Want to play on hard, to have a proper bullet-hell game experience? Nobody cares, you're stuck at the same difficulty, like it or not.In the end, there are some redeeeming factors, but this huge amount of problems makes it impossible for me to believe that this game has such a good rating (93%, positive, at the time im writing this review).If those things were adressed, I would easily recommend this game, but not the way it is right now."

I made the mistake of purchasing this due to its sale price and it being a shmup. Once I learned how trashy Hell Girls was, another game from the same dev/publisher that was also on sale at the same time, I knew I was in for a mess with this game. The moment the game loads, you're presented with a busty anime girl drenched in what I think is Dragon♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- oh dear. Start the game and you have a poorly translated tutorial that has a 3/10 chance to respond to your input to skip to the next slide, that explains you can attack with Z, but really, you move with WASD and shoot your mouse. Kill some grunts that stand around you in a circle waiting for you to kill them so another poorly explained tutorial comes up to teach you about drops, that actually don't drop from the grunts, which then loads up the Boss, that is just a bullet sponge that doesn't attack and waits for you to die. Then you're presented with a topless anime girl on the results screen - of course, the results screen is covered in tutorial text, so all you can really notice is a heavy chested girl basically pointing at the player with her♥♥♥♥♥♥Look, I have no problem with Hentai in general - I've searched for it on more than one..hundred occasions. Honestly, the H-Game crowd doesn't need my review because if you like H-Games then you don't have the same tastes in games as I do anyways. But as a lover of shmups, this is an atrocity that is Shamelessly smutty to make money off of easily amused H-Gamers, and is poorly made to be worth your time and money. If you have the time to waste on this game, you have too much time to waste considering much better quality of games and smut on the Internet.Just stop.I quit this game before the five minute mark, and relaunched it so I could get to five minutes so I could leave this review.

That can be expected from a game so cheap, but still, should be mentioned. The game only has 7 stages, which are all very similar becasue of the re-use of enemies, goals, and controls. The RPG-style upgrades and customization are fun to play with for a while, but are still very simple.The biggest reason I don't like this game is the translation. Horrendous. Awful. Funny sometimes, but still inexcusable. Not only is it hard to understand who is talking, if anyone at all, but the dialogue has gramar errors, and uses terms and speech that sound very unnatural.By all means, feel free to try it for yourself if you like boobs and sexual material, but this is not the best I've seen by far."

(Even though the translation is in the game files.) So you're not gonna get any story out of that except for pictures. Which are okay, the art jumps around a bit. Sometimes it's good sometimes it's okay at best. Game comes censored but there's uncensored versions out there.Gameplay wise there's not much to say. I feel like it lacks all sorts of balancing and with some early upgrades you pretty much become King or Queen of the game with no problems at all. It's a cheap game, but the author could've at least tried to balance it just a little bit so that you're not overpowered in the first 5 tries. The sound is okay I guess, but I wish the enemy dying sound had more variety cause as it stands you hear the same sound bit a few times a second because of how quickly you eradicate the enemy since you're overpowered in no time.I liked what this guy does with his games before but now I feel a bit burned. Don't just throw games out with no control at all, even if they're cheap. I'm sure you can find someone who'd help you translate and it wouldn't hurt to take an additional look at the game and tweak numbers. If you love the games you make you should give them some polish. Hell Girls has become pretty nice after all the work you put into and I'd gladly recommend that, but this is getting sloppy.I've given it time since it's release but it doesn't look like much will change as of now."

Backgrounds can be unclear making it difficult to see smaller dragons.Difficulty curve only maintain through increased enemy hitpoints and improved movement speed far beyond the players.Powerups too short in duration to be useful.If you'd like to see more check out my video below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgCZh647Jjc&t=25sIf your looking for the decensor patch it can be foundhere"

I don't have an issue with porn games (not any worse than all the hyper-violent games out there imo), but if Steam is going to sell this stuff, they really need to beef up the parental controls and maybe create a separate sub-section of the store for it.I almost gave this game a negative rating, but it's not the game's fault that Steam is mixing this in with other not-porn games. I ended up playing through the game since the core gameplay is fun, but I really didn't sign up for a♥♥♥♥♥♥themed porn game.I'm a bit torn on how how I feel about this overall. On one hand, I think it's good to see game like this have a real chance to sell and be available on a major platform.

The Upgrading Menu is difficult to handle. You can only see possible upgrades by clicking on them - which is followed by the question if you want to buy this upgrade. If you don't have enough ""souls"" (the currency of this game) you can't even click on it to see what comes next (as it the description and all following upgrades are outside of the frame).2. If you are stuck, you need to do a lot of grinding, which takes away all the excitement. An option to upgrade your bullets or skills (right now, you can only choose different bullets/skills) would help extremely, and it would make the game more fun.3. What really sucks is that during a fight, you pick up all kinds of bullets that you don't actually want because you already have a stronger one. It would be nice if you could ""deactivate"" certain bullets, so that they are not dropped by dragons anymore.4. Please. Hire someone who actually can speak English to write the subtitles.
