A nearly for free cyberpunk theme with amazingly triggering music and rapid gameplay, featuring a large number of randomly generated enemies, cool powerups and manageable weapons.However, acquiring 500 easy-going achievements with zero effort suchlike the Zup! franchise is rather unlikely, so please be a little patient."

Thanks for the free game I bought the soundtrack out of appreciation :)"
,Recommended,636150,34630128,Posted: 31 August,all,SPHERE,"So you are probably thinking of buying this game... Well it offers a lot at a low price...Let me list everything for you:+ price is good and it's even better if you buy it on sale+ retro style and vibe+ hardware requirements are low+ 500 achievements+ achievements contain letters for your profile (blue/cyberpunk theme)+ achievements are easy to get+ steam trading cards are available+ i have seen the developer helping people with his game+ you can buy an additional soundtrack which isn't bad+ simple / can be finished in 2 hours (100%) but keep in mind that the game probably never ends- soundtrack is annoying after a while (looped song)- soundtrack dlc isn't worth the money i think (contains 1 song)- after you get all achievements there is nothing to do- you will get bored after 40mins because you can't even die (you have more than 20 lives) and all you do is holding the ""fire"" button (when using homing missile / laser)- if you are looking for good graphics then you should pass- you can't rebind the controls- no linux support for such a simple game (probably WINE / WINETRICKS / PlayOnLinux can help you with that)ControlsX, L or Control (fire) / Z, K or ALT (bomb)After certain lvl (around 40) tanks aren't spawning anymore (perfect environment to get all achievements except combo ones).If you want to get combo achievement (x12 etc) you must do that before lvl 12 or combo timer will be too short. (use missile / special bombs to keep the combo up)Keep in mind that after some time things may change because the developer is improving his games.In my opinion there is no reason why you shouldn't buy this game.I bought all games that ""NukGames"" created (with all dlcs) and i don't regret anything."

So really this only cost me 4 cents. Ah, trading cards.Anyway.This is a highly enjoyable and simple game (with nice achievements for your profile) IF you can stand the non-rebindable controls. I tried this game with keyboard and it didn't go very well, so I quickly switched to controller, which works like a charm."
76561197993664311,Recommended,636150,35320851,Posted: 29 September,all,Scarran,I crafted a badge and it gave me a -90% coupon and ended up getting the game for $0.11. I have played almost 4hrs and god honest truth it's quite fun to play casually. I'd recommend picking it up and you have 500 achievements to get to boot!!
,Recommended,636150,33744722,Posted: 23 July,all,⎛⎝dowutevadaFUCKyouwannado⎠⎞,One of those achievement hunting games that DOESN'T have spams. 9/10
,Recommended,636150,32143961,Posted: 2 June,all,Slgmatix,I have never played retro shooters like Asteroid or Space Invaders prior to playing this game and I think this game is great to play. There is not really much to say asides from the game being nice to play on a casual gaming session.
,Recommended,636150,33661778,Posted: 19 July,all,Blue ;3,"Pros:Simple game with easy to learn controlsAchievements are good for Steam profilesSteam cards are always nice.Music is alright.Good price for a game like this. Maybe could be a little higher but not by much.Cons:It can be hard to control the ship and aim, this is 2017, not 1979. Some mouse controls would be nice.Not fun for me to replay really, after the first time playing I got pretty bored. (That's just me though.)The pros outweigh the cons so I'm recommending the game."
,Recommended,636150,33900692,Posted: 30 July,all,Ranseurs,"Cyberhunt, another casual shoot 'em up game. So your job is shoot every enemies that appear in your monitor.+This game will boost your Steam Achivement. 500 achievements can you get in less than 4 hours.+8 Steam Trading Cards are available.+It's cheap, especially with discount coupon.-You will get bored after get all achievements (except you pursuit the global leaderboards).-Well it's cheap, so the don't expect too much for the graphic and the other component.It's still recommend by me: 6/10"

,Recommended,636150,33949291,Posted: 1 August,all,Sergio Alonso,What I like:- 500 achievements to collect. Each with a letter so you can write your name on your profile.- Variety of Power ups to change the rhytmn of the game;- A lot of quests to try surviving without attacking;- I can fool some enemies by teleporting from the left of the screen to the right of the screen.What I dislike:- Music gets repetitive after a while;- The emotional wave only drops when I die;
,Recommended,636150,34853083,Posted: 9 September,all,Skeletor,"Very good game, to have fun in. Many achivements, and dem swag  letter's so you can spell out you're name! Very fun for time wasting. Music is good, Graphics are sexy. I love it. Great deal when it's 50 cents. Do get if you can."

,Recommended,636150,31926402,Posted: 23 May,all,Boomstixx,This is - by far - the best game from the Indie Devs Nuk Games... well...Decide yourself if this is a good or bad thing.You like achievements popping up for EVERYTHING you do?This game is for you.
76561198399046791,Not Recommended,636150,33444736,Posted: 10 July,all,hot.crondis,"This is the last game in the Nuk Games/Nuk-o-games(?) colelction. I was really hoping the dev could make something that wasn't just shovelware.It's just asteroids. But with somehow worse controls. If WASD is going to be movement don't make the fire buttion X. The ONE song that plays is alright, sounds like something from a Phantasy Star game.But ultimately Cyberhunt, and all of Nuk Gmes/ Nuk-o-games' products have just reminded me that we live in a cruel godless universe were there's no hope. We're all going to die, probably alone, in great pain, and probably full of regret. Reality is meaningless and trying to put any kind of meaning into like God, money, ideas of success, or family is all just a cheap distraction. Billions of livings beings have cried out in the sheer horror of existance and gone silent in the time it took you to read this.We, humanity, have some how gained sentience, a thing which no other creature we know of has. This is what we've done with such a great gift."
