,Recommended,636450,34136535,Posted: 9 August,all,William Shakesman,"It's Rez! It looks gorgeous, and comes with an extra mini-mission with some pretty fancy, high-FPS visuals. There's not much else you need to know. The port is fine.Well, you might need to know more if you don't know what Rez is.The short answer is Rez is a game designed as an experience for people who are high. More of an audio-visual experience than a game, Rez is quite good at the former and... acceptable with the latter. It is hard to do it justice in words, but Rez becamea darling among game connosieurs due to the sheer amount of quality that went into the audio, the visuals, and the pacing, and how all that that drew you into it as an experience more than as a game, bringing you to calm mediation, intense focus, or adrenalin-powered aggression as the game pleased. It also became a darling among game journalists because, again, being a druggie enhances the experience and because it requires next to no actual gaming skill to play.Starting out way back on the Dreamcast, Rez is a rail-shooter with no dodging to speak of, simply stick and one-button aiming. A simple lock-and release is your only weapon and it fits quite well with the game. That ebb-and-flow and hold-and-release, of varying rhythms helps draw you into the proper mood to enjoy the game, as Rez's strength is in the graphics and music. Wireframes and geometric shapes abound in pretty shapes waiting to be shot and drawing up evocative imagery in the background all while a pulsing techno soundtrack, with music hits tied to your gunfire, gradually builds up intensity as you progress through the level. It's all incredibly simple, but it works quite well if consumed as a mindless experience. Playing for score would be the absolute wrong way to enjoy this game, though there is an option to do so.This version includes all the content from Rez as well as an additional brand new level that feels more like a decent length tech demo of a new engine. For that level only you have some limited free-flight, while retaining the same lock-on shooting scheme. While the visuals are a step back, and the free-flight so forgiving I don't think I was in danger of being hit once the whole time I played, as a Rez-like experience it is certainly solid and worth a visit for old Rez veterans and newbies alike.Rez is something unique in shooters, a game meant to take your emotions and your senses for a ride rather than your gaming skill. It is quite good at this, and you ought not turn your nose up at such a hipster-sounding description of it. The amount of love it takes for a forgotten Dreamcast classic to get a remake with added content on PC is proof enough that this game knows what it is doing. And a chance for PC gamers to have a fine port of it for the first time is certainly a nice bonus."

Along it, your actions will the world react and transform around you, along a brilliant soundtrack that will also react with your action.Reduce the enemies to wireframes, and face off against planet-named computers systems on your path for a visual-auditory sensation.Turn up the settings as high as you can, bring your noise cancelling headphones, your VR headset, turn off the lights, and get ready to be immersed.Your mind and brain will thank you!Don't forget to check out the previously exclusive Area X, a brand new addition to this 16 year old game that still delivers to this day!"

It's also one of the only reason why I still keep my PS2; I just keep getting back to it, time after time. This is the game that proved my love for rail shooters, this is the game that proved my love for weird experimental game, and this is the definitive edition of that game.I've yet to play more than the Area 1 again (for what, the 50th time?) and i'll definitely play again later after work.... Gotta say, it will be an hard day, without thinking about playing more of this game."

,Recommended,636450,34130604,Posted: 9 August,all,Rafport,"This is a great surprise, Rez Infinite was a PSVR exclusive without confirms about a future PC porting. Instant buy for me, but not instant review, I can't understand how people can put reviews with 0.something hours in it (positive or negative).Let's see what it's in. Rez Infinite is a remake (same game, better details without miracles) of the original 2001 Dreamcast game, one of my favourites of that marvellous and unlucky console. You can beat the 5 levels, with 10 chapters each, in an hour. You get also an additional ""Area X"" mode, than is a modern revisiting of the concept: you have some freedom in flying around, the graphics is just incredible and is as mesmerizing experience. Mesmerizing but short, you can beat in 20 minutes. After this you unlock additional game modes, the most interesting in my opinion the ""assault"" one, where you play the full adventure in a single session to win different world skins, and the ""trance"" one with random and extremely psychedelic environments.I'm not insensitive to nostalgia, but I have to say than if the game was 100% brand new with the massive quality standard of the Area X mode and maybe an higher price, I would be way happier. Rez Infinite has a nice replayability, but in is core is a short game than is 75% a remake of a 15 years old application, even if for PC is totally new, Rez and Rez HD never met the PC market.About the VR implementation, they did a good work. The default setting is quite low and a bit aliased, but you can crank up things even with entry level cards (970 owner here). The two modes, classic and Area X, are not the same in VR: in the classic you play mostly frontally, sometime you had camera rotations, the handtracking aiming works but is not flawless (EDIT: set mode2 in options to solve aiming issues). Area X make you fly in any direction, and if you set for free camera you can play 360 with a greater immersion, and just feel so better in VR.I can easily suggest this game, I am SO happy about this VR porting and they made a nice work. Only a good game anyway, not an absolute masterpiece like it was Rez in the past."

I bought it 3 times now, on the good old Dreamcast, on the XBox and now on PC. My greatest fear for software preservation was this game and i am so happy that it's on PC now. Please devs, release more tracks as DLCs. I will buy everything as long as I am alive! I need more Rez in my life!I am no reviewer, just look at the storepage and youtube some tracks. To call it a on-rails shooter isn't enough. It's happiness in software form. It's life essence. Tip for VR users: activate the trance vibrator option so your second controller acts like one and rumbles along."

This was one of my favorite games ever. I use to play it on Sega Dreamcast and PS2 for hours. This was the only game I actually consider to buy PS VR for. Only because I thought this would be PS4 exclusive. Luckily I was wrong and it is finally on PC. And what a port this is.It plays so well. I can say this is the best looking VR game so far. I run it on my MSI 1080TI on highest settings and it runs like a dream. I never played the new AREA X level. It is an amazing addition to the original game. I play it with the HTC vive controllers, which makes the game quite easy. You can also aim with your head. As some people stated the 3D is not as immersive as in some VR titles, however the new Area X level is spot on.I am experiencing the motion sickness on some VR games, this is not one of them. The picture is very sharp and smooth and the framerate never drops. The sound quality is very good, the use of headphones is highly recommended.This game was made for VR. It is a must buy for any VR owner. And it’s £8 cheaper than the PS4 version. This is my new favorite VR game. Love it. Buy it, you will not regret it."

Sweet.So I was thrilled to finally be able to purchase it on PC.Well, this release looks gorgeous and plays well, so why the thumbs down?The audio mix. For many users the mix is way off. It seems like certain channels in the mix have very weak signal.I am using stereo studio monitors in my set-up at present and it sounds like the game is trying to play 5.1 through them. The audio problems have been discussed at length in this STEAM community discussion, Rez thread;http://steamcommunity.com/app/636450/discussions/0/1471967615865529381/Unfortunately, two weeks in, Rez support will not acknowledge let alone advise on a fix, for the audio issues many are experiencing. So with about a day left in my return window, I have no choice but to refund."

Because I played it to death on the PS2, and it has a warm place in my heart as one of my favourite games of all time. I missed the original HD release as I didn't have XBOX 360 and I don't have a Playstation 4 for Rez Infinite. But man, am I happy to see it here on Steam.Rez a simple rail shooter with stunning visuals and probably the best sound design I've ever heard in a game. In under 2 hours I've completed all the areas again, but having gone back to it time and time again on the PS2, there is no doubt I'll be going back to it time and time again now.Yup, this is a totally biased review as I have a lot of love for this game.

76561198001900781,Recommended,636450,34212342,Posted: 13 August,all,yagamikun,"What has already been said before:Rez is an astounding classic on-rails rhythm/shooter that pushed genre expectations when it was originally released in 2001 on the Dreamcast. Rez Classic runs great on a wide range of hardware and at high resolutions if you have the kit. It is fun, mezmerizing, and has some great moments that still impress today. If you enjoy great music, and a solid shooter experieince, you should give it a look.Rez Infinite: Area X Mode:Area X is a 15-ish minute level made entirely in Unreal Engine 4 which takes a more modern approach to this classic design. Instead of just controlling the reticle, you also have full control over the player character in a 360 degree environment with the ability to boost or stop at any point on top of the classic Rez gameplay. While it looks great in 1080p, if you can run this in 4K/60 (or higher) it is a spectacle that should not be missed on a large monitor or TV. Simple enough, right?Rez Infinite in VR:But what about VR? To be candid, I will not be playing this game any other way now that I've exprieinced the definitive way to enjoy this experience. Rez classic is a great time in VR - it is some of what you expect and some of what you don't. The aiming is infintely easier when you can actually use your touch controller to point at objects to target, and the ability to look around the entire environment allows a sense of space that was not available before. Because the whole world moves to the beat, you quickly find yourself dancing to the rhythm while shooting down computer virus scum. It is a rediculous amount of fun.Area X is altogether a different beast in VR: On top of the enchanced graphics, the added control options in a 360 environment while in VR provide one of the best movement options I've yet used in a VR space. After 3 minutes the intuitive controls take over and you are whisked away into a world of endless particle effects and pulsing psychedelic backgrounds while twisting, bobbing, weaving, turning, ducking, and shooting your way out of enemy swarms and massive bosses. Much like a psychedelic experience, this mode is hard to describe to somebody that has a.) never has experieinced high-end VR with an Oculus or Vive, and b.) has never played Rez or the new Area X.Rez is not a game for everyone, and Area X is entirely too short for the quality of the experieince. Rez is easily worth the $20 for those that have nostalgia value, or are looking for another VR experieince to show their friends. Is it worth it for the casual onlooker? Maybe - if you like rhythm games and on-rails shooters. With Steam returns, I say give it a shot if you have access to a supported VR headset. You really have nothing to loose. If you don't have access to VR, then maybe wait for a sale unless you were in love with Rez in the past and want the definitive way to keep the affair going."
,Recommended,636450,34129339,Posted: 9 August,all,ARTHUR THUCKSAKE,"Many moons ago, I bought a Dreamcast just so I could play Rez. With breathtaking visuals, simple gameplay and one of the best interactive soundtracks ever produced, I immediately bought the surprise Steam release.I never got round to playing the remasters on console but I""m glad to report that the PC version is even more visually stunning thanks to modern hardware. It's a shame Rez Classic is capped at 60hz because Area X isa magnitude more beautiful at 144hz. I really hope there's a patch that unlocks the frame rate in the future.Playing with a mouse feels like the way it was intended all along. No more slow, clunky movements with the awful Dreamcast controller. Mouse control actually makes the game a lot easier now, especially some of the later boss fights that could unfairly punish the slow reticule movement.The soundtrack is as timeless as ever. The aural feedback from shooting down your foes is as satisfying as ever although I'm not convinced that there's any surround sound effects.Overall, if you haven't played the remasters this is well worth the price of entry. Area X may be a little disappointing as it feels like a short tech demo of one stage but it's still a great experience."

Well, this is one of those games that you can't get the full experience just by seeing. You need to put your headphones on and play with a controller (with vibration) to 'get' it.It's a bit of a hard sell.Note that this is anarcade styled game.Shooting down maximum possible enemies, collecting as much powerups as possible and getting a high score is the core game. You can complete all the stages of the main game in about 3/3.5 hours. There is a score attack mode and a ""beyond"" mode, which a challenge set.Also, there is the techno music. If you don't like this style of music, this will be a much harder sell.However,there is nothing quite like it.Yes, it's 3 hours long, but those could be the most thrilling 3 hours of your life. The feeling ofsynesthesiait creates is amazing. And don't think this is some pseudo-artsy thing, this is a challenging video game. The level of difficulty grows with each stage, with the final stage (Area 5) being an epic showdown.Hell, I'd say the price is worth Area 5 alone, one of the best final stages I've every experienced.TL;DR = If you are skeptical, then I suggest towait for sale.But this game is aMUST-PLAY.Esp. if you are the kind of person who prefers gameplay over story.However, if you want to have slice of how it plays, the emulated PS2 version runs great, so try playing that version."

,Recommended,636450,34129735,Posted: 9 August,all,Woofmute,"Runs in widescreen, textures have been redone since the original Dreamcast and PS2 releases, and the music doesn't suffer the same issues as the Xbox 360 port (Some samples were too high pitched there). Offers texture quality options and AA options, but no classic Rez mode. Not that it is truly needed.The inclusion of Area X provides a new experience similar to Child of Eden running on a seperate game engine to the standard Rez levels. One downside of the level select is they've gotten rid of the old level select screen in favour of another title screen menu with no music, showing gameplay footage from the levels similar to the title screen demos from the original Rez instead of the colourful pulsing ball and player form, but this at least reduces the time it takes to start the game and to get into a level.I've bought this game every time it has been released, and would absolutely recommend this version over the others.  The game looks great in HD with the texture updates and better filtering, and sounds good too. If however you truly want classic Rez (4:3, original textures, original audio effects), stick to the Dreamcast and PS2 versions."

But with the game's simple and unique visual concept, I think it still ages very well and it doesn't take away from all its great design and the fun of it - the game's looks were always minimalistic to begin with, anyway, it was always about the gameplay/""experience"" and the music.The new Area X however looks absolutely fabulous, and with the aforementioned VR, it really is something to see and experience...

There's some content added since I played it last on its Xbox 360 version, and though I've not seen the end of the new content yet, I would place what I saw of Area X as on par with the main game's best levels (other than the untouchable Area5).Especially if you're a music-person, you should experience this.And to the devs: Steam port of spiritual-successor Child of Eden?

,Recommended,636450,34132518,Posted: 9 August,all,Aphex Pesuto,"Rez is a very classic game, and one very dear to my heart as someone who likes videogames and music.I originally found out about this title by remembering it from a review I saw on TV once. It looked completely out of this world, but it wasn't until the Xbox360 that I was able to play the game myself and experience it. And holy crap.It was something just playing it yourself. There's something about this game that makes the music and your actions just... fit together like puzzle pieces being put rhythmicly (is that a word?) into place. Now, before I get to the good bits, I'll put this up front for people who have never played or heard of this game before:The main Rez experience is a remade port (more or less) at 60 fps and 4K resolution of the original Rez game. There's 5 Areas (or levels) to explore and the game is pretty short. But there's quite a good chunk of replayability if you care for score or 100% certain stats (like enemies shot down, items collected). So is this a 15-17 year old game re-released for the modern audience to explore? Yes and no. It is the good ol' Rez in much better graphics, with everything looking better and more amazing than it did on the 360 HD port. There's still some difficulty in the game (in my case, I have a hard time differentiating the bullets at times from enemies), so it's not a cakewalk. Area 5 takes the cake for being a literal marathon level. Now, the original Rez only had Area 1-5, making it rather short.Oh yeah, this game doesn't♥♥♥♥♥♥around with being a shoot'em up at times. But the instensity of that feels... actually really good? Even if I got my butt handed to me at times? It's a weird case of ""I want to keep going and going"", even if I feel like I got unfairly barraged by enemies.Now, mentioning some of the bad points and the good points, there's a new thing I forgot to mention:Area X.I did not know that this level existed until I saw the Steam trailer. I was surprised that there would be a completely new level to Rez. And it's not based on the old engine, it's an actual new level made from the ground up in Unreal Engine 4.And holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥I was speechless as I played through it. I was shedding tears at how Rez had evolved and changed in that specific level, how everything flowed and felt amazing. It was like it had shed the past rules that the base game was grounded in. I honestly couldn't believe my eyes.It was such a nice experience to see that Tetsuya still loves this game that how willing he is to bring it back for new and old fans. The music is amazing, the gameplay is fun and fluid (albeit a bit old for Area 1-5), but it's a game that still holds up as an amazing experience.If you've never heard of this gem of a title, or have and wanted to try it out, I highly recommend it. It's a visually and audibly stunning title that deserves the praise its gotten. Hell, the port in and of itself is just mindblowningly smooth!Once again, thank you Tetsuya, for such an amazing experience. I hope to see more of you and Rez in the near future."

I've bought it on the PS2, managed to snag a Dreamcast copy, rebought it on the Xbox 360, and now happily plunking down more money to buy it again on PCI've sincerely been wanting a PS4 just to get Rez: Infinite. But I literally just found out minutes ago that it came out on PC, so here I am! Though to be honest, if I ever get a PS4, I would happily buy this game again. I'm that serious about it.Where to even begin with this game? The depth, the beauty, the sound, my god. It's all perfection, in my opinion.The very first time I played this game, I was completely sober. I loaded up Area 1 and immediately felt like I was on a drug induced, synesthasic (sp?) trip. It was that moment I knew that this would be my favorite game of all time.For those who haven't played it: If you enjoy rhythm games, if you enjoy electronic music, if you enjoy rail shooters, then you will enjoy this game. Buy it.POTENTIAL SPOILERS FROM HERE:In terms of story, you're a computer hacker trying to reboot a system called Eden, which has been devestated by viruses and firewalls. That's essentially it. But there is absolute beauty in its simplicity,  because then the depth arrives with the Areas themselves. Each Area is themed for some ancient civilization, with Area 5 being unique in that it tells the story of evolution. Area 5 also happens to be my favorite level, though I'm excited to try out Area X asap (I literally just started up the game so I could write this review and spread my love of it all over these internet parts).Each level starts out calm, and you're just kind of cruising along an infinite rail system. Viruses and firewalls pop up, and you aim and shoot them down. With each explosion comes a synchronized sound to the background soundtrack. As you level up in each Area, the music gets more intense. There are more instances of enemies. You cruise along faster. If you use a trance vibrator, the vibrations get more intense. It all culminates with the final boss, whose difficulty is determined by three different levels (mega, giga, tera with tera being the hardest). That is determined by how well you do in the levels, and how many enemies you shoot down. Each boss is of course unique, but you essentially have to determine what is ""shootable"". It's easy to do so, you just hold the shoot button down and drag across and lock into the targets. Each boss can be difficult though, especially playing through the first time, and you need to figure out timing as well.Honestly, I can go on and on about this game forever (as evident by this stupidly long review already). All I can say is that, as a gamer of 27 years, this game has touched my souls in ways I cannot even begin to explain. It's forever a part of me, I can play through each Area in my head alone, and it means more to me than a lot of things in this world. I think even if you experienced a fraction of the love I have of this game, you'll get enjoyment out of it.Buy it, play it, love it, cherish it."

I also seem to have some tracking drift with both my headset and the controllers, which I've not had in other games. All of that said, it's a stunning version (I'm reluctant to say port: it feels like a lot more than that) of the game.It's been a bit of an odd day all round, so I'm feeling quite emotional in general.

I see lots of reviews of fans who played the older version, so I wanted to leave a comment on what I thought of the game seeing as I never heard of it before today. I loved this game. It was a trip that had me questioning quite of interesting ideas. This is probably due to my love for the advancement of A.I. and I often think quite silly and scifi based ideas, so I can't gurantee that you'll be asking the same kinds of questions yourself, but I can say that if you enjoy flying through cyberspace and shooting waves of viruses whilst listening to intersting and action based music, then you'll quite possibly have fun playing this game. The enemies are interesting and unique. The first time I saw a series of polygons turn into the shape of a giant running man before shapeshifting into a menacing mechanical squid that swallows you whole and you shoot its insides like a venful Captain Ahab, well, it was freaking awesome. I found myself constantly bouncing in time with the music where your very actions create notes of their own, adding to the music in time and making you feel like you're shaping the song as it plays. Also, you do this while growing in complexity, from a few polygons, to several stages of man, and then finally into the ultimate existence of a floating orb that summons death lasers for all it sees. If any of this sounds appealing to you, then please, try the game. It was fun, and I enjoyed it thoroughly."

This is *not* a crummy console port, yet it still preserves the feel and charm of the original.  I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth, responsive, and well-tuned the controls are.  The graphics are entirely re-done, complete with high-res textures.  It looks great and plays even better.  This was not merely some hasty cash-grab, this was done with love and respect.  They did the title justice, and I've got to commend that.For those unfamiliar with the game, it's a musical rail shooter.  It is not a rhythm game; instead, your shots and kills generate sounds and tones.  The soundtrack is great (and for a music-centric game, I suppose it had better be!), and the graphics are simultaneously simplistic and flashy.  It's a good combination.  The graphics are actually quite similar to the original, but just updated.  Very tastefully done, and works well in the modern era; they didn't change anything, they just upgraded everything.  There's a mode where your goal is basically just to shoot down as much as possible, and then another couple of modes where your goal is to gain as many points as possible (mainly by shooting down as many things as possible, but doing so with as many things as possible *selected* simultaneously).  It's fairly simple and easy to get the hang of, but it has very high replayability because you'll always be striving for that next high score (while enjoying the very nice soundtrack).Also...  They added this new ""Area X"" thing.  I spent some time playing around with it, and I am very impressed.  It's a huge improvement in all areas: graphical, auditory, and gameplay.  Instead of sticking you on rails, it gives you full 360 degree flight control.  My only complaint about Area X is that there is not enough of it.  Perhaps some DLC, or even a sequel, would be appropriate.Additionally, the game is VR-compatible.  I don't have a headset yet, but after I get one, this will surely be among the first games I try, and I'll likely have some words regarding that here in my review.One last thing I'll say is that if you have the option, you may wish to re-balance your audio settings on your PC for optimal sound.  Crank up your treble and bass a touch, as the mid-notes can dominate a bit.  But maybe that's just my personal preference!Overall, I strongly recommend this title."

The same should of course be true with the mouse. AFAIK you can still use the gamepad in VR, but controlling the cursor with a gamepad is kind of frustrating to me.Playing it in VR, I never at least in the first two levels had any sense of danger or accomplishment, it just felt very easy playing through the levels. The VR experience was pretty impressive and trippy, although the sense of 3D wasn't that great and especially the more solid and bigger enemies revealed the locked 60 fps instead of the 90 needed for a proper VR game. Head movement etc. remained smooth throughout, probably though because of ASW on the Rift. No idea how playable this is on the Vive.Testing the same content in the none VR mode revealed just how low the resolution of todays headsets is for this type of graphic. Even with MSAA to the max and 150% render scale the VR image still looked rather pixilated and jaggied compared to the super smooth lines of my screens 1080p output (with 250% render scale and MSAA max). That being said, after just experiencing the vision filling VR mode playing on my 24"" screen felt super boring and made the game look like a retro title from the 80/90s.The new level though was a completely different experience. The point clouds looked nothing other than stunning in VR and had of course none of the pixelation / aliasing issues, even though the image was a bit blurrier thanks to the used FXAA. The gameplay was more challenging as well as interesting and playing through it in general was more fun. Looking at the desktop mirror after finishing the level revealed though how much better the game could look with a higher contrast level than current VR headsets can provide w/o showing the god ray effect.Btw in terms of motion sickness, the classic levels even with full camera movement (can be limited in the options) didn't made sick at all, even though I am normally very susceptive to artificial smooth rotation (but I am fine with smooth / full locomotion). The new level with its not on rails movement made me just a little bit dizzy, but not to much to keep on playing. So in general, motion sickness shouldn't be an issue for most people.The main reason for returning the game other than the IMO lackluster difficulty though is its length. I played through the first two of five classic levels as well as the new level in just 45 minutes.In general, I find those types of shooting games could work really well in VR and Rez has great visuals, I just would love there to be a hard mode or something.IMO, if you haven't played Rez before, buy it on Steam to be able to get a refund if you end up not liking it."

Despite the game running consistently at full (hard capped) frame rate (4GHz i7, 16GB DDR3, GTX 970) there's frequent timer errors which make the game harder to play and completely screw up the synchronization of the dynamic music. I was most excited to play this with the mouse but the cursor speed is locked to the maximum gamepad speed which is disorienting - fast movement is capped and slow movements are jumpy. Audio mixing is also off - music is too quiet, sound effects are too loud, and everything sounds muddy and muted as if the sound is a low bitrate (I own the Dreamcast and PS2 versions and the sound is way better than the PC version on my 192KHz sound card).This could be a good port some day but as it stands this was released too early. I love this game so much but in its current state it's extremely frustrating. It looks nice and sharp but sounds and plays badly. A rhythm game with timer errors is infuriating.Not recommended."

,Recommended,636450,34271021,Posted: 16 August,all,ManCannon,"This is the definitive Rez experience. For those of you who, like myself, are longtime fans of Tetsuya Mizuguchi’s audiovisual masterpeice -- or, as I like to put it: a synesthete’s wet rainbow dream -- this is pretty much all that needs to be said. You have it all in perfect detail: the sublime soundtrack synced with controller vibration; the hypnotic audio feedback; and the retro-futuristic, wireframe acid-trip visuals. If that sounds like a lot of adjectives, you try being succinct after experiencing Rez in 16K with surround sound or, even better yet, in a VR headset with good headphones. Either way, if you strap yourself in for this ride prepare to be dazzled and reaching for your thesaurus, desperately trying to find new words to describe -- or even just begin to contextualize -- the experience you’re having.For those of you new to Rez, allow me to attempt to explain. Rez is a rail shooter. Which means that you’re essentially a body floating through the air and you have an aiming reticule with which to target enemies and fire at them. Examples of this genre include Space Harrier, Panzer Dragoon, Sin and Punishment, and Kid Icarus: Uprising. However, there is one key difference between Rez and the aforementioned titles: you cannot move your character. That’s right, your on screen avatar is locked in place and therefore cannot dodge incoming enemy missiles. Your only defense then is exactly the same tactic you use on offense -- you shoot. You shoot a lot. In fact, the gameplay in Rez can be summed up thusly: you aim at stuff while holding a button down then you let go of the button. Repeat for five levels.It sounds simple. Even mind-numbing. But Rez is a prime example of something being more than the sum of its parts and the fact that an excellent -- I would even say TRANSCENDENT -- aesthetic sensibility can elevate a pretty rote game into something approaching perfection. You see, when Rez gets a hold of you and you find yourself truly absorbed in its abstract atmosphere; under the spell of its geometrical, spiritual hypnotism; it really is like being transported to a totally new world that is both utterly alien and yet somehow wholly familiar. Paradoxical, certainly, and a bit like having a near death experience or all of a sudden remembering the entirety of your birth in a flash -- there is a feeling Rez imparts that I have never felt from another game or any other artistic medium at all, really. It’s the kind of feeling you can only attain through meditation, psychedelics, or losing yourself in nature. Or, it seems, by playing Rez.Personally, I am enjoying the game with the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and I really cannot recommend the VR experience enough. It’s funny, actually, because up until just a few days ago Rez Infinite was a Playstation VR exclusive and though I didn’t own a headset, I was desperately hoping it would be ported to PC because I knew one day I would buy one for that platform. Well, I bought a Rift, and two days after it arrived this was surprise announced and released on Steam. To me, that’s the magic of Rez. True serendipity. Synchronicity. The more harmonious world we’re all striving toward. Unleashing perfectly timed maximum combo energy barrages to the beat of Rez’s eclectic, electronic soundtrack and being rewarded with pure visual spectacle feels like everything in your life locking into place and moving along the way you always imagined.It’s a very simple game. But if you allow it into your soul, it will reveal so much more. There is a forward thinking beauty to be found within its abstract world, and its simple gameplay presents a low-barrier of entry to an experience that is singular and extremely difficult to quantify. This game receives my highest recommendation and is a must have for anyone who appreciates the unconventional or is in search of a truly engrossing space to inhabit within the confines of their virtual reality headset."

It's just 3 or 4 levels long empty area with 3 enemy types and a boss fight. The boss is just a giant statue of a woman spawning enemies.You can experience all the content this game has in less than 1 hour and it has no replay value. There's a score attack mode but the game is so scripted it's not worthy as a competitive arcade game.I really like the original Rez and having it on PC is something I wanted for so long, but I think $20 is too much.Devs also are trying to sell you merchandising in the main menu, and the ""deluxe"" content is there just to promote a book and the OST.

I'm  playing through the game with an Oculus Rift and my set of Audio Technica ATH-a700s'.  However the new area of the game is what intrigued me the most after reading about it when the PSVR released.  I've played Rez dozens of times and enjoy it every time, but Area X is one of the most breathtaking experiences I've had in VR yet.  It elevates Rez to a full experience that cannot be seen or heard any other way through any other medium, at least in my opinion. The visuals are stunning in color and clarity and the new soundtrack is just exhilarating.   It is a short experience but it is everything that I could've hoped for, and it leaves me craving for what next project Mizuguchi and his team can do in VR.

If you have somehow never heard of this gem, that's an incredible shame, but now is the time to fix it.The game is hard to describe, because it's not really like anything, before or since.  It's a 'rail shooter' but calling it that does it no justice, as it plays like a song (and you can often tell when you miss a target or fail to pick up something as it sounds just a hair 'off').  It's not exactly a rhythm game or a visualizer as you are an active participant in the game.  In short, there are only a few controls- you  press one button to 'lock on' to targets that you move the reticule over, up to your maximum of 8 or so, then release and the bullets/shots autotrack.  You can track and destroy the shots of enemies attempting to harm you, as well.   Everything that you destroy, lock on, or 'pick up' (with the same method as shooting at), or even fire at, gives a slightly different audio and physical cue (highly recommended to turn on rumble controls), blending somehow into a coherent piece.Works perfectly well with my 360 controller, though you do have to enable the rumble features (not sure why they are not on by default).  The original game is more or less intact, runs very smoothly (obviously the requirements for the base game are laughable at this point), and the 'expansion' area is really beautiful.  It had no problems running on my 970 on a 1440p monitor with most/all settings very high (I haven't actually tried to overstress it yet), and the last bit definately takes it into a new direction.Highly recommended for just about anyone."

I bought it on the Dreamcast as soon as it came out, then again on 360 and again now.  It holds very dear memories with me.  So I would say I was enough of a fan of the game and franchise.  I was so stoked when i heard this had come out on Steam in VR, something that I hoped would always happen but never thought it would.For reference I'm playing with a 780OC and a DK2.  So not officially supported hardware but irrespective of timewarp, I felt framerates were fairly perfect.This conversion of the game is in part good and bad I'm afraid.The badThe music is too slow and some samples used in the music are either too slow or too fast.  I actually stopped playing Act 4 quite early on as it was too disappointing to continue.  I remember the tempo of all of the music and this was noticeably slower.VR has made the game incredibly easy.  I 100%'d the first two levels and was 0.5% out on destroy on the third level.  Because you use your head to aim and can often see targets from above and below way before they would naturally appear on screen, this makes things way too easy.  In addition the third level boss was far too simple to take down.Area X gave me the sweats and motion sickness, probably due to me swooping around too much.Area X's controls don't really work that naturally.  Not a disaster but they did feel a bit clumsy.The goodFond memories still come back despite the issues.Area X is one of the most beatiful experiences I've had in VR.  It shows a promising direction that a sequel could be taken in.In summary, if any of the technical bad experiences I had were as a result of running on a slow GPU and on DK2, then I can take some of the criticism back.  I mean, the game should be coded to account for imperfect framerates and because the crux of the game is it's music I still see this as a massive problem.  I haven't tried the game in 2D yet but will update my review if these problems aren't evident.Would I recommend?  Yes, although if you are like me and expect to be immersed in the world as you remembered it then be prepared for some disappointment."

That said, it controls wonderfully, as long as you set it up first, change the control method to controller only if you don't like gaze-look aiming, and if you've got some serious VR legs, put the VR mode on dynamic. I've become pretty okay with locomotion, but I'm a bit queasy now, some of the movement is intense and made me feel like I was legitimately falling.I don't like that my off hand controller doesn't work, I know you can't dual wield but it'd be really nice to have it vibrate, maybe use it as an additional HUD for the upgrade progress and bomb inventory. I ended up putting it away and going with the single controller, which worked fine.But being able to look around so freely, around inside of a game I spent hours playing as a kid, to quickly spin around after missing an enemy and getting it, intense doesn't come close to describing this. I'm an hour in and only have beaten the first area, played it twice through though, and several (failed) attempts at area 2. I had forgotten just how evil this game is, where if you're higher up in the upgrades, stuff gets way harder, in lots of subtle but panic inducing ways.Must have. Absolutely must have, even without VR, but if you've never tried Rez before, this is a spectacular edition of one of my favourite games. Also they fixed the audio issues from Rez HD, which is fantastic.(Do bring the menu's a bit closer though, I'm supersampling and I'm having to squint to read some of the options text ;_;)"

,Recommended,636450,34169433,Posted: 11 August,all,jsenek,"TL;DR:If you have a VR system, Area X makes Rez Infinite a must buy.The remaster is excellent.Difficulty in VR is much lower.Give me Child of Eden Infinite next, please.It’s quite amazing that a game that originally debuted in 2001 translates so perfectly into a medium that, at the time, did not exist outside of human imagination and specialized laboratories. At its best, Rez, a game about flying through a virtual reality, feels like it has simply been waiting for consumer-level technology to catch up to the experience it was trying to provide.The game is much, much easier in VR with motion controllers, as your control over where you are looking and where the reticle is pointed at is much quicker and more intuitive. Being mainly a PC gamer, my lack of thumb stick skill prevented me from beating Rez’s previous releases, but with a Vive and its wands I took only one hit during my first playthrough.Area X takes all of the VR successes of the base game and exceeds them. Movement is fully three dimensional (but underutilized), the frame rate is given a bump, and the visuals are simply gorgeous. The pairing of sound, visuals, and gameplay is at full tilt, and with a forgiving difficulty, it really felt to me more like an interactive art piece, meant to be experienced more than beaten. The biggest shortcoming is that there simply isn’t more of it, although there is some incentive to perform at least two playthroughs.I really hope this sells well enough to justify more like it. I’d love to see a sequel of Area X, a remaster of Child of Eden, or something entirely new in the synaesthetic VR genre."

For indie games this is definitley well planned, designed, executed. All of the graphics flowed perfectly together at its high pace. I played on factory settings in 60FPS (VSYNC) and it was just beautiful. My first impresssion when I watched the video on the store preview it looked ""basic and colorful"" although it is colorful it is far from basic- everything is moving, changing colors, tempos, expanding, retracting at the same time while your eyes are focusing on less fast moving objects so you would almost worry it would make you sick (I did not play in VR but wish I had). I give the game a solid 9/10 - It's arcade style and mind you I am not the arcade style type.

And if you don't know what Rez is, then you'd better read on.Looking back at the 15 hours or so steam says I have in Rez... I think it's fair to say it's worth it. In terms of mechanics and gameplay, it's simple, it's a rail shooter. It's plot, rudimentary. Go into a computer system (strange world of little sense) and restart (rescue) an AI (princess)... oh hello Mario.So what is there to recommend about Rez? The experience. The graphics, music and sound effects (and vibration if you have a supported peripheral) combined are... this is the stumbling point. I've made multiple runs of ""Direct-Assault"", all 5 areas back to back in their score attack forms, and I start the Area 1 log in, next thing I know an hour has gone by and I'm in the boss rush at the end of area 5, taking on the recreations of Earth, Mars, Venus and Uranus. Engrossing is wrong word, especially when you can come away the experience melancholy.The only true complaints I can offer is that Rez itself can be beaten in an hour, since the 5 areas in their none score-attack forms are shorter and in the ""story mode"" you're not trying to farm the bosses for score. But the replay value again comes from the sensation. The second one is that the PC port is nowhere near as hard as the original PS2 version. Turns out a mouse is muuuuch better than an analog stick.Area X throws a fatal error in the boss fight... as such I can't judge it properly, I'm guessing it's something to do with the fact my hardware is 7 years old. But my impression of it at first with the particle clouds and random dots was ""this is not Rez. Where are the lines?"" Then the second stage music starts and the trance sinks in... and it's Rez and it's like playing it back on the PS2... until the final boss and crash... eh, Area X is not what I bought Infinite for, so it's a nice bonus. For me, the meat of this product was Rez itself."

Area X is the best 15-20 minutes of video games I have experienced this year and would I think be life altering in VR. If you're one for rhythm games, electronic music or particle effects you won't be disappointed."

Just a really cool surreal experience that you can easily get into. Very simple gameplay that anyone can pickup in the first 10 seconds. Getting from menu to game is very easy to explain as well. One of my first recomendations when im demoing my vive"
,Recommended,636450,35508034,Posted: 5 October,all,BLISTER LORD OF VR,"One of the best gaming experiences out there, it's aged fantastically from a PS2 game and with the addition of VR, Area X, and more options. The experience has been made even better, the graphically style has held up to the test of time and even somehow improved. The gameplay is simple, but greatly enjoyable and has plenty of replayability even if the initial offerings seem slim.An experience everyone should witness, audio, visual, and gameplay harmony."
