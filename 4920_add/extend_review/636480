I'm gonna be blunt....best timewaster game ever. Legit. If you need minutes...or hours to kill, play this and the fun never stops. The AI is pretty good, and hilarious at times. Huge scale battles, ragdoll, tanks n planes, guns.Do you love shooting lots of sh!t on big ♥♥♥♥!ng maps with totally random events?Do you love watching your teammates drive over your face in a jeep?Do you love watching a tank turret or quadbike fly up 100m in the air?Do you love watching some dude fly 2 miles off the map?Do you love shotguns that act as sniper rifles?Do you love enemies that either walk right past you not giving a f$ck, or having aim that can compare to the hand of stalin guiding KV-2 shells?Then buy the game. Honestly, updates Im sure are going to keep coming out. The dev does this permanently now anyway. I bought it because he deserves the money imo.Buy it. It will get better. Trust me. (talking about workshop support here, once thats in....its gonna be insane)"

,Recommended,636480,31854304,Posted: 19 May,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"It doesn't take long in-game to get the appeal ofRavenfield. It's a simple concept of military sandbox shooter, yet executed in a way that nearly anyone who mildly enjoys FPS titles would find engaging and addictive.Essentially, there is a military battle occuring on medium-to-small scale prebuilt maps.It is only you and bots; there is no multiplayer what-so-ever. The landscape is dotted with 'zones' or 'bases' that you can capture and control, which then act as spawn points for whenever you are (frequently) killed. There are several cool vehicles that you can use seemlessly. The airplanes and helicopters take a quick bit of skill to operate, which is neat.You only control one soldier at a time (FPS-style), and as far as I can tell you can't give orders or anything like that. This is a run-and-gun affair.The only strategy that matters is the oneyoubring to the table.There is a map you can consult in real-time that shows the battle unfolding, and helps you develope your approach. The guns are standard military affair, and all feel different and lend different strategies.This is one of those titles that looked 'meh' to me in videos, but when I played it - I got it.Being a sandboxy type of game, your mileage will vary in how much fun you get out of it. There are not currently any missions or 'story mode' (apparently planned), so you have to enjoy simply going for the thrill of the win at this point in time.Pros:+Really engaging warfare on the FPS scale+AI units 'feel' and 'act' real and give this game legs to stand on+To me, 'single player only' is a good thing for SOME GAMES, and it works well here - so bravo for that+Graphics are clean and work well for this game; the performance seems great and I bet this can run on a toaster+Addicting gameplay that also offers some depth and strategic variation+Guns are all fun and play differently+Vehicles such as tanks, ATVs, helicopters, airplanes, boats, etc. that you can seemlessly operate+Slow motion mode+Battle customiaztion options; if you want (and your computer can handle it) hundreds of soldiers and mass chaos, great, or you can have just a few soldiers and much more strategy going on+This title has been in developement for a long time which gives me hope that chance of abandonment is low and there is a long bright future of work that will be done+Steam Workshop support is comingCons:-Yes, there are rough edges at this point in time-No music (which is kind of neat and makes the warfare feel more 'real', but it would be something I'd like to see in the future)-Controller support is here, but you still need the mouse for the menus - and really, you should probably think twice before buying this with the intent of controller only at this point (just my experience)Ravenfieldis an ordinary concept executed extraordinarily well.Well worth full price if this is your kind of jam."
76561198179621994,Recommended,636480,33442977,Posted: 10 July,all,GCurnutt,"I stumbled upon this game looking through a game queue, and I am glad that I have. If you like shooters with no nonsense, this is the game for you!The thing that stood out the most when going into my first battle was the simplicity of the game. There is no gaining levels, no buying weapons, and no attachments. (According to Steelraven7 - the sole developer, this was to keep the weaopns being used for what they are meant for). You hop in and enjoy. You (and your computer) are the limit, not the game. The hype you get at the beginning of the match is based off of the experience of the game, and not the next thing you are trying to unlock.Another highlight of the game that I noticed later, when the two teams met up at a point to fight, was the use of physics. When a soldier is injured enough or is within the blast radius of a ballistic weopon, he will fall over or be sent hurdling 30 feet into the air. When vehicles wreck, they don't just break. They explode. Personel carriers will be blown sky high and lose their wheels when they run out of HP. Helicopters and planes will hilariously flail around in the air before exploding after making contact with the ground. Sea veichles explode and sink. The occupants of these vehicles will also be sent flopping through the air and/or on the ground with the game's ragdoll physics.The aforementioned aspect of no levels is another important piece of the game. The progress of the game is based off of your ability, rather than the equipment that you unlock. The game will let you decide how to progress, rather than take away equipment until you are ""good enough to handle it."" To challenge yourself you can change the game's difficulty settings instead of drag yourself up the ladder of ranks that most games make you do.Ravenfield is a stark contrast to most other well known contemporary shooters. While those games try to make the game feel like a movie where you are the main character, this game lets you do and feel how you want, yet you are not the center of the experience. You can fight alongside your fellow blue or red soldiers, you can take to the skies with planes and dominate the air, you can use a helicopter to tease the ememies defenses, you can bulldose your way through enemy infantry with a tank, or you can group up with a few soldiers and hop in a personel carrier, all while being able to go wherever you choose on the map. There are no invisible walls, or voids, and the game is not limited to paths or buildings. The game is pure freedom.The developer keeps things interesting with frequent updates. With each update there is always at least one big change. When Beta 6 came out, the character models were changed from block characters to low-poly soldiers. An in-dev version of the most popular map, Archipelago, was also added. A temple map was also added.However, being a game in very early development, it has some problems that will need fixing in the future. The AI can be hit and miss sometimes. For instance, leaving the aircraft carrier on the Archipelago map. If you spawn many soldiers, they will crowd the dock part of the aircraft carriers to get into small boats. They do not have problems getting into the boats, but they do have issues driving the boats out of the ship. In this phenomenon, boats fill run into one another and become piled up like a stack of pancakes. AIs that are in land vehicles never fail to flatten you if you are within 20 feet of the spawn area. They do not look where they are going yet. They will always try to shoot you from across the map if they have seen you, even if there are more important things to shoot. This can be seen as funny for some players, or frustrating for others. The game also lacks a large amount of maps. Of course, the game will be updated to have more in the near future. The maps you get are good, but there only a few unique maps at the moment. As of right now though, you can download maps from other users or make maps for yourself with the map making tools if you are not satisfied by these maps.All in all, Ravenfield is unique, but also reminds me of simpler games. The game is a refreshing break from the grinding involved in many modern games. If you enjoyed the days when games were simple freedom, I garuntee you will like this game."

76561198323509505,Recommended,636480,34334607,Posted: 18 August,all,Bloodreck,"This game is great, but it could use a few improvements, such as- Being able to customize your class and name them.This would make things a lot easier, since you constantly have to select the items you need when you die. I would prefer to just select a class and play the game.- Being able to give commands.I really hate how I these npcs run around the place, it would be nice if you could give a command where 2-4 of of them follow you, so you can have your own little squad or when you enter a vehicle, you could give a command for them to join you.- More game modes.I feel like there isn't much this game has to offer, it would nice if we had a few fun modes (e.g zombie, survival, hunger games, etc)- Spectating when you die.I really hate it when I die, i can't spectate the other npcs or view the map, I strongly feel this feature needs to be added.These are just some features I strongly feel this game needs, so it can continue to progress and get better. Keep in mind, i've played this game a lot by a friend of mine, I probably have 30 hours in total, it's because of him, I decided to purchase it.Do I think this game is worth 15 dollars? No, but understand that you're helping the developer and i'm sure in the future, this game will be worth it.  Don't expect a lot from this game, it's still imcomplete and there is still a lot of work to be done but the game gets updated often, it's not just some game someone posted for the lols, it's a game that has a serious developer who is trying his best to make this game better."

I like the thought put behind it, but I do say this:Why not add Character Customization to your 'soldier'?Perhaps different armor types for those who prefer running at the speed of sound, maybe a chest carrier for extra rounds and explosives? Oh, and a nice cap to go!Or Medium armor, the one we have currently. Helmet, Kevlar or other specified material combat vest?Or those who want  as much protection as possible, perhaps a Juggernaut Suit or Riot Gear?Maybe make a new 'small' CQB Map designed for the Spec Ops game mode?Oh, also improve on the A.I's 'sight view'. They know exactly where I am and specifically target me, even if I'm miles away from them!Those are my 'ideas' for Ravenfield. I like the game, and I love the work and effort.Have fun continuing to make the game Steelraven7!"

,Recommended,636480,31825402,Posted: 18 May,all,Spyyre,"I only just recently discovered this little gem. I started playing literally less than a week ago on Beta 5. This steam release is what is supposed to be Beta 6, but is now Early Access Build 1. I can very easily say that this game is fun and addicting. Below, you can find, in my opinion, what are some of the pros and cons.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROS---++ I've heard many many great things about the developer, and he promises alot in future updates!+    This game is very easy to pick up++ You're gameplay is only limited by what your computer can handle (You can play with 5 bots, or 5000 bots..depends                on your PC)++ This game is silly fun, and the ragdolls are hilarious sometimes.---IN BETWEEN---~~ There isn't a lot of customization, BUT this is a singleplayer game, so there is just enough to keep you entertained. The developer also plans on adding mod support, so, hopefully, in the near future, we will have more than enough.~~ Not alot of maps or modes, HOWEVER, you can choose to play them at night, at day, normal, reverse, you can change the balance of teams, etc...so not many maps, but many options for those maps. More maps are eventually planned as well. A total of 9 OFFICIAL maps I believe. Custom maps will be supported in the future.(((Before I state my opinion on cons, this is an early access release and I realize this)))---CONS-----Remember how I mentioned singleplayer?? Yeah. Singleplayer ONLY.--Very buggy..as in, the ground doesnt match up with where the ground appears to be..you can walk through the floor, and some walls in places..more noticable in this release than Beta 5, or maybe it's just me..--AI are kinda dumb, and there is no way of commanding them. Sometimes they walk right past and dont even notice you, other times they just stand around instead of fighting for the objective.--I have a decent PC, if I must say, and I can barely pull 60fps on the lowest settings with more than 120 bots in the game, so if youre looking to play with a ♥♥♥♥ton of bots...let me tell you now that it's not gunna happen------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anyways, I DO RECOMMEND this game. Pick it up. $15 to support this hard working developer, and it is well deserved.If you've ever wanted to play battlefield multiplayer with bots instead of people, GET THIS GAME.EDITSince people are obviously asking about my specs, here they are:OS: Windows 10 64bitCPU: i7-4770RAM: 16gb ddr3GPU: Nvidia Geforce GTX 950"

Sure in the future this could have a multiplayer option, but I just love having AI involved as well! I can play quick offline games or somewhat long matches depending on the settings!Now, I am looking forward to what else the game will bring. Like more maps, more vehicles, more weapons and a bit more robust shooting system (Even if the current one is very good, it needs work). Also, longer matches with gamemodes similar to Battlefield would make the game feel much more immersive as wellOH! Another thing that I personally would like added that will make the game feel very different is a much better sound system. Where distant explosions sound different and less repetitive"

,Recommended,636480,34002427,Posted: 3 August,all,Larry The Lamp Guy,"This is going to be the crazy, wacky, insaniac game that will break through CoD and Battlefield, but first SteelRaven needs to get more developers, so that more content can be made in a shorter amount of time, not saying the game is bad now, but it has SO MUCH POTENTIAL. The new Steam Workshop addition makes it alot easier to download maps, so thats a good thing. I guess the AI needs work the most, not because it's odd or wacky, (I think that's how this game was meant to be) it's just that firefights turn into a grenade-fest, I think the script is to throw grenades at large groups of enemies, but continuous amounts of grenades thrown by your team and theirs keeps you on the ground. Otherwise this is just about the best game I've ever played."

The Red vs Blue concept is by no means new, but their blood being the same color as their team color is not only creative, but also an indicator where both allies and enemies have fallen. The weapons aren't super varied, but all act differently enough to warrent expermintation, not to mention that they don't have crazy recoil, so hitting targets at longer range is actually plausible.My only real complaint is the price tag. At fifteen dollars this game is lackluster at best, relying heavily on mods to increase playability, with mixed results. Now, of course, this game is early access, but at the moment it's difficult to see how this is worth fifteen dollars. Luckily a campaign mode looks to be on it's way, which will hopefully make this title worth the price.Overall if you're looking for a simple fps to scratch your itch than this game with do so well, and with any luck the developers will continue to expand on this game and make it a worthy addition to your Steam library."

It's a nice singleplayer game, akin to the Battlefield series, but with less complex graphics and no multiplayer. Other than that, you have different game modes, vehicles, night and day (and night vision goggles), and a bunch of weapons. (It's not class based, you get to choose your load out with no limits).A campaign mode is under development, but not yet playable.This is a nice game to practice for other multiplayer FPS, to have a little fun with out the competitiveness (or seriousness) of other games, but it's a light game in general. (Not that you can't be really competitive and obsessive about k/d ratios and so, or about pulling stunts, check the yt videos).In my opinion it's a little priceyYou can get a good mp FPS for about the same price, some with ""training"" or local server options (if you want to kill bots).

The AI is pretty darn good (for the most part) and the weapons use ballistics rather than hitscan which makes it even better.

I personally loved the betas of the game, and I hope it gets much better than it is, though it is already great. I only have 3 issues with the game:1. Aim sensitivity (So I can make my look speed when aiming slower)2. Making some sights for guns (like the patriot and rk44) not zoom in as much3. Planes need to be able to drop a bomb (Preferrably just one bomb, then a very slow reload, so it isn't a spam weapon)Otherwise, great game!"

It is why games like Battlefront 2, Battlefield 2, and more are still fun and playable years later. However, they have recently died off, with only Call of Duty and Arma bothering to include them. That is why Ravenfield makes me so happy. It is so fun for me to have 200 men wars without dealing with lag and annoying people. I really enjoy this game, and while its a bit barebones right now, the devs will continue working on it. I would buy this now if A) You want to support the devs or B) You really want to relive Battlefield 2 bot matches. Otherwise, I would wait.

I like 'em. They help my computer run it fast and i think they look nice. I've always loved the minimalist style. If ya don't like them, whatever, its up to you. Plus, if you prefer the boxy-men player models, its in the game options to enable them. If you've played the Beta, you'll be happy to know that most of the weapons have had a visual upgrade.The weapons all have a crisp feel to them. The only thing that I don't like about them is the sounds, but thats pretty much just for the weapons that carried over from Beta 5. The sterling, the new revolver, and the new rocket launcher-type thingy sound great. There seems to be a weapon for every situation, which is great.The maps are okay, for the most part. I've found that the snowy temple map and archapelago (I probobly butchered that spelling) a bit unbalanced at first, but after a bit, are quite balanced. The Island map has stayed mostly the same, but Dustbowl is very different. I have not played on it much, but from what I can tell, lots of cover was added.(There would be stuff about the campain here, but it isn't here yet. Maybe I'll remember to update this.)Plus, the game will be updating and getting better and better.Its well worth the $14.99 (or $12.74 during the first week or so of realease) price tag, even in this state.

76561198021562603,Recommended,636480,33439648,Posted: 10 July,all,Sharak Ka,"I first heard of Ravenfield a couple of weeks ago, whilst browsing through the typical grand-scale YouTube videos that certain users have taken to - I'm looking at you, UEBS. The game was played off as some kind of hands-free squad battle simulator, and I was smitten by the simplicity of it. It wasn't for another half an hour that it occurred to me that this isn't a strategy game.Ravenfield takes me back to Battlefield 1942, when I used to play bot matches because I had no feasible internet connection. And, to put it in simple, unflattering terms, that is basically all Ravenfield is - a singleplayer sandbox faintly masquerading as an online warzone. However, its strengths don't lie in realism, competition or graphical prowess, but rather in the versatility of the physics engine and the sprawling ragdolls that ensue when a grenade hits a 12-man beachhead position, the ability to enter slow motion and snipe at leisure, or gape as fighters crash into mountains as your landing vessel approaches an enemy spawn point.Obviously, this is not a triple A title, and it is an early access development - the AI is decent but will derp out occasionally. Whether it's an AI driver refusing to move for two minutes whilst waiting for a third person to enter, or enemy troops running straight through you without firing a shot. The weapons currently available cover all bases, but vary very little in terms of their mechanics and with the exception of the shotgun, only their damage and iron sights seem to vary. That said, using a revolver sidearm to send an opponent sprawling over the edge of a mountain is one of the most satisfying applications of exaggerated impact I've seen since playing around with Pyro Sand.There is promise of mod support and campaign facilities in the foreseeable future, which will be direly needed as the game matures - the concept is fun, but I can't bring myself to play more than two games in a session. Whilst incredibly fun, the longevity is limited and as awestriking as having 400 bots fighting over control points can be, five maps and no real purpose would otherwise get old.It's a fun experiment even now, but as an investment, I have full faith in Ravenfield."

While the game may be exclusivley singleplayer (and don't go asking for multiplayer, it ain't happening), the AI offer a diverse challenge ; at the moment they are neither too stupid to shoot straight, nor too overpowered. Whether you're looking for hours of boreom-killing and mindless shooting, or something to test your trigger-reflexes, Ravenfield is a game that is ultimatley worth investing in.Oh, and if sanboxy/casual warfare isn't enough to justify the price, workshop support is incoming, and the develloper has proven to be quite punctual with updates to this point."

Even though the game says early access, it defies stereotypes about early access games never actually being developed and then the developer running off with the money. No, this game is being constantly developed by one person and the updates are frequent and on time.The gameplay is very fun and engaging. The vehicle controls play very well. The AI is decentish, although I wish they would enter in the same car as you so that you at least have some support when heading to an enemy-held point. Also, I wish there were some more vehicles like APCs or transport helicopters/planes for paratroopers, as well as some more weapons of course. The game is great so far, and I'm excited to see what the developer will add as the course of development continues."

Nothing really new, feels like a larger scale Battlefield but it is nicely done.Hopefully the developper won't abandon it and bring multiplayer and some content to it.Depending on the map you're playing on, the game can handle around 200 to 300 bots with playable framerate, around 30 to 40 fps (my GPU and CPU never reached more than 30% and 50% each) and can go up to several hundreds more, as long as you don't mind playing at 10 fps :)Also, too much bots messes up the AI and the soldiers just end up ducking behind cover without doing anything. Just as shown here :https://imgur.com/a/sdfOQI'd say 100-150 (depending on the map) should be just enough to avoid that.So yeah, pretty nice game overhaul, not too expensive i'd say, needs multiplayer asap and it should be good for you to enjoy it for countless hours."

I hope they'll implement a game mode where you can fight a numerically superior foe, hold the line like an actual battle at a single spawn point and win (see what butt-hurt gamers deride as ""camping"" despite the fact a sniper's entire purpose is to camp).Some annoying tid-bits though:1) Nade. Happy. Dip-short-a-chromosome-or-five. A.I. (example: one AI bot thinks ""Hey, there's this one enemy in the midst of five of my allies, better throw a frag *just* past him so it injuries him, three of my allies, and kills the other two giving the enmy team two free points"")2) compounding one is that, at the slightest provocation, your character will ragdoll for eight years before getting up again (this can be extremely annoying when 50 different bots are chucking a frag and a flashbang a piece).3) again, compounded by the first point, Friendly fire counts towards the enemy's score. Which can get under one's skin as the AI has no qualms about not only nading, but also shooting three of its allies just to kill a single enemy.4) Almost forgot: night battle are unplayable, especially with NVGs as you can't tell who is on what team.Otherwise I thoroughly enjoy this game, 7/10 too much frienly fire - IGN."

I could see this being more interesting if it was more tactical, sort of like 'Running with Rifles' which does the whole Team vs Team AI shooter concept incredibly well. but currently this game is basically a twitch shooter with AI. And honestly, a twitch shooter Isn't really all that fun when you are fighting an inferior enemy that provides no real challenge and is just a brainless AI that's designed to be killed.If this game is going to continue taking the AI only approach, they seriously need to rework the AI. pretty much the only thing AI does in this game is run at objectives and shoot whatever they see on the way. they dont try flanking, they dont have any sort of planning, they dont move to take cover. all they do is run in straight lines and shoot. The AI doesn't even remember your existance. If you hit them, then run behind cover, they immediatley forget about you and just keep running at the objective. I dont even see the point of letting the player take ammo and medic bags since the AI is basically cannon fodder and wont even bother to use things you dropped. the AI in Battlefield 1942-2 was like this but those games had an excuse because it also had incredibly fun online which this game doesn't have. For a game which only has the ability to play vs AI, the AI is inexcusable. It's not even passable, just downright horrible no matter what type of game this is. The AI in counterstrike is seriously more fun and engaging to fight than the AI in this game.Currently I can't reccomend this game, I will gladly change my review if the game fixes the bad AI.btw, I'm not writing this out of hatred. I'm only writing this because I care enough to want this game to improve."
,Recommended,636480,31962603,Posted: 25 May,all,Some Guy,"Ravenfield is, as of right now, a very simplistic FPS that perfectly encapsulates almost everything that people like about FPS games!It has fast paced action with custom loadouts, and you can have an unlimited number of enemies on either team (though you probably don't want to go over 100 vs 100). Each map plays very differently from ther others, and this is what really stands out with Ravenfield: how unique everything is.Each weapon is of a different ""class"" (assault, shotgun, sniper, etc.) meaning that they all perform differently, there are several distinct vehicles that you can ride in, and the secondary weapons/gear are all unique and perform their own role. There is also a whacky physics system in the game that can make you laugh from time to time, like if you shoot someone with a rocket at their feet, they'll probably go flying off into the distance. You can also warp time and slow things down to get a better shot, or just to take in an epic moment, with the caps-lock key. I rarely use this, though, cause I tend to forget about it, and it feels kind of cheaty.There are also really amazing hidden weapons on each map that you can unlock. They are really worth looking out for!On the other hand, there are currently only 4 maps, 3 finished, and 3 gamemodes, 2 finished. The campaign isn't finished and the AI can be a pain at times.The biggest drawback for a lot of people is that there isn't, and never will be, multiplayer. I feel like this is a really important point to stress, because everyone seems to want multiplayer to be in the game, and it has been explicitly stated by the developer over, and over, and over that there will not be any multiplayer in the game. This is a single player game, but a great one at that.Overall I would recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS games. The first time I played this game I didn't even realize that I was playing with bots until the second match, and I just love the simplicity of it all.I also forgot to mention that you can pick up an earlier version of this game online for free if you want to try a demo before buying."

Veterans of the series can jump right in.  Same controls. You can pick your loadout.  Weapons are what I would describe as... standard offerings based upon features available in state of the art weaponry.  It's modern combat.Mods are fantastic.  I hadn't played in maybe a month, only to come back to a very active modding community.  I immediately downloaded a bunch of cool maps.  I'll have to check out the workshop to see how easy/difficult it is to make content.  I used to make assets for BF mods back in the day.

,Recommended,636480,32004876,Posted: 27 May,all,Planey_McPlane_Face,"Amazing game, it manages to both be engaging and difficult, while also full of laughs and general craziness from all the ragdolls. I have a good computer, so setting it to 300, 400 bots is very entertaining, because the front line just becomes a field of grenades, RPGs, and death. Ragdolls are hilarious, an AI throws a grenade into a ditch full of enemies, and suddenly a bunch of bodies go flying out of that ditch and 10, 20 feet into the sky. Although the AI does have it's issues, the AI is still very good, and honestly better than many other major title's AI. It's pathing, aim, and general actions are effective, and the AI takes cover, uses different equipment, and honestly seems a lot like people. The only 2 issues I have seen with the AI is 2 things, 1 funny, and 1 annoying. The annoying one is that AI tend to get ""locked"" onto a random object, such as a tiny flagpole that offers no cover, and will lean around it, or otherwise try and use it as cover. It will do the same to icicles, or anything else. The funny issue, that I really don't want the devs to fix, is the hilarious driving/piloting of the AI. Imagine walking along with some of your blue comrades, and suddenly, out of nowhere, a friendly tank drives through, plowing over 5 of your allies. Or a helicopter crashes into the enemy line. Or a plane crashes, and then proceeds to slide along the ground, clotheslining everyone with it's wings. Or leading the charge, and suddenly a grenade flies through a doorway, and then watching as blue blood, bodies, and equipment goes flying everywhere. Like I said, this game manages to balance a challenging, engaging FPS, and a hilarious, crazy, insane physics engine."

76561198054049936,Recommended,636480,32077927,Posted: 30 May,all,OVERLORD,"Kind of a weird game. I'm a little dubious about giving it a recommendation, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt for now.It's a lot like Battlefield multiplayer. Interestingly, it is single player versus AI modes only -- there is no actual multiplayer of which to speak. I'll do another list, since that allows me to think more clearly:PROS:• The basic gameplay is fun. It's basic, but it works. It plays like a standard FPS in terms of controls.• The damage from player to enemies and vice-versa is effectively the same. Be careful about being shot. I enjoy not being all-powerful in games. You may feel differently.• The ragdolls are enjoyable, and they have a little bit of animation to them.• For the most part, all of the current weapons feel somewhat unique and useful in their own ways.• You can sneak up on enemies and use suppressed weapons on them to remain hidden.• The scale of the battles can be increased, meaning that if you have a more powerful computer, you can see a lot of units on the map at once.• Planes and helicopters are fun to pilot, and have satisfying weapons.• Many of the weapons in general feel satisfying to use.CONS:• The AI is often dumb enough to use rocket launchers in CQB and doesn't seem to care about friendly fire at all. This includes vehiclular team killing.• Explosions affect you through walls. If the terrain was destructible, this would be cooler, but instead you sometimes just get knocked down or killed by an explosion that you couldn't see.• AI is as often injured as killed. I would prefer this to be less common in favour of outright fatality. It's a nice touch, but I hate always having to stop and finish off enemies.• Aside from the planes and helicopter, the vehicles feel a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the controls department. The plane/helicopter could use some gauges and additional HUD elements, but they control okay.• As a suggestion, I'd like the option to set a time for corpse persistence.• Not a whole lot of content. Only 2/4 maps are interesting IMO.• The game is kind of expensive for what you get currently, and this is my main point of concern for now. It's 15 US dollars, and I've milked about 2.5 hours out of it. Not a lot, considering.My suggestion is to maybe wait a while, until more is added, or it goes on special. It's okay, but you might get your money's worth later. I don't think it's there yet."

,Recommended,636480,31867968,Posted: 20 May,all,Whistleblower,"Let me start off with something.Yes, the game is buggy.Yes, the price is quite high for what is currently in the game.Yes, it's singleplayer only.If the first two turn you off, skip this until 2018. If the last one makes you cringe in disgust...well, then you're just not gonna like this game.That aside, Ravenfield is an incredibly fun and ridiculous experience. You got ragdolls flying through the air, big explosions, ridiculous hidden weapons (except one, which just seems to be unfinished), and all sorts of hijinx.There are planes, helicopters, tanks, jeeps, ATVs, and turrets. The aerial vehicles are really hard to get used to and the tanks aim like absolute crap.The AI is pretty good, defending and attacking and taking formations. They're incredibly frustrating at times though, especially on the Challenging setting (WHICH YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING AT) - there are times where they will literally 3 round snipe you with the RK-44 (it's an AK) while you're 10 feet underwater. Their aim is absolutely ridiculous and should be toned down a bit.There are four-ish maps: Island, which is a small island, Dustbowl, which is a large desert with two airfields, Temple, which seems to be what would happen if the Nordic countries had Japanese-style architecture, and Archipelago, which is very clearly unfinished. There's an air carrier docked by an outpost, and attacking the ship from the outpost or vice versa is stupidly difficult. It's still fun.There are three-ish gamemodes, too. Point Match is capturing points until either one team caps all of them or one team gets 200 more points then another. Each flag acts as a score multiplier AND a spawn point.Battalions is basically Point Match but instead of outscoring the other team, you're trying to outlast them. Flags act, again, as score multipliers and spawn points, but capturing all the flags doesn't immediately grant you a win; instead, it causes automatic drain on the enemy's reinforcements, no murder required.The final mode is Spec Ops which, like Archipelago, isn't finished. It seems to be sort of a hack job of Point Match; Ravens patrol their point until they see an Eagle, at which point they go around the map trying to...capture...disabled...points...when the only way for either team to win is to kill all members of the other team...and there are no respawns...yeah, it's weird right now.There is, nor will there be, gun customization. But there is loadout customization. So that's good.I guess I'll just end off the review with a pro/cons. Thing.+Decent weapon variety-Like, 3 pistols. Two of which are the same gun.+Competent AI-Stupidly godlike aim (at times)+Fun maps+Fun gamemodes-One of each is unfinished+Great developer+Future features are exciting-...Future.-Quite buggy-Not a lot of content in general - overpriced at the moment~No multiplayer. I think it works well, but others are clearly put off by it.+Have as many bots as your PC can handle+Decent amount of graphical options-Option to change Point Match's required score difference for victory (200 ATM) isn't changeable anymore :c"

When we got the news that it was going on steam and was going to have new guns, maps, and gamemodes, we went berserk. Although not everything has been implemented in like campaign mode, it still is fun to mess around with the maps andfind all the secret weapons. Overall, I think it's worth the price and I would like to see the developers try and add a multiplayer mode."

,Not Recommended,636480,32556741,Posted: 18 June,all,BloodFartThePirate,"Pretty much the same exact game as the free one. A couple new cool maps and like 3 new weapons. While the maps and weapons are neat the AI is no different despite the better models, in fact I think they've been dumbed down from the free version. In the free version they would run and seek cover when enemy fire came down on them which added this sort of tactical suppression dynamic, now they just continue to dumbly sonter into barages and die without even reacting. Not only that but the same problems exist in from the last one with the AI having two accuracy levels in which they randomly switch out between which are ""blind retard who couldn't hit the broad side of barn if they were sitting next to it"" and ""psychic world class proffesional sniper"". Seriously I'll run across a field that is directly in enemy sight, sometimes even running past multiple enemies who don't even acknowledge my existance, and hear bullets wizzing all around me but the moment I poke my head out of cover I instantly die.If you have never played the free version then I'd go ahead and say you should buy this and give it a spin, while the AI is sort of trash the fights can be some incredible scenery which I very much enjoyed for sever hours in the free version, just make sure to set an alarm to let you know to stop playing before the 2 hour return limit is up so you can really stop and think if this game is really worth 15$ to you.If you have played the free version you really aren't missing out on anything new. I'd give it a couple months at least for when they release the campaign mode, that at least sounds interesting and new. They'll probably fix the AI a bit by then too."

You'll get a couple hours of entertainment out of it, and likely many more once the games features are expanded and mods are added. It's reasonably priced, and as long as you understand that it's a somewhat unpolished EA game going in you're unlikely to be disappointed."

Sadly, the low poly models, and the high poly assets are somewhat clashing.Gameplay: 9/10The gameplay is fast, and addicting. The battles take place on 4 different maps, between a red and a blue team. The gunplay is easy to learn, hard to master, with complex mechanics such as bullet drop, and mastering the different guns. The gamemodes are varied, spanning from point match (earn points by capturing bases, and scoring kills), to battalions (something about draining respawns by capturing flags, dont know much about this one) and spec ops (a close quaters stealth-like scenario where you and your small team go in with silenced weapons, trying to take out the reds with no respawns) A negative about the gameplay, though, is that a lot of games result in stalemates, with you desperately trying to take over the final flag, with the entirety of the red team guarding it.Variety: 9/10The game currently has 4 maps, and a pool of varied weapons, each with different playstyles in mind. The maps are: island (a close-mid range map, set on an island. the map is the smallest of the lot, but one of the best), dustbowl (a mid-long range map, set in a desert, with canyons, desert town and planes!), temple (a mid-close quaters map, set in a snowy landscape.) and arcipelego (a WIP map, set on an aircraft carrier. this map has only 3 flags, and most of the combat takes place trying to take the deck of the carrier, or in the air, with planes!).Bugs: 10/10As with all early access games, it it littered with bugs. Sometimes i sink through the floor, sometimes i get stuck in the ground, sometimes i die on a machine gun emplacement and the skybox is replaced with the scenery, and i sometimes turn upside down. It's a generaly buggy game, but the same can be said for all early access games. I also noticed my framerate signifigantly decrease from the previous betas.TL;DRRavenfeild is a fun, easy to pick up and play game, with addicting and varied gameplay, but a handfull of bugs, and annoying stalemates. 9.5/10 too much of the coulor green."

Just one thing that i would add are ways to get various skins for your weapons just to customize the game a bit and if possible SteelRaven7 please add a multiplayer function that would make this game amazing and really worth the price tag.

Please add more pistols and overall just more guns. Would you ever make the pistols never run out of ammo? One more thing.

,Recommended,636480,32566022,Posted: 19 June,all,Kwertyuiop,"Ravenfield is like a single player only mix between Battlefield, Unturned, the sandbox battles of Mount and Blade and some TABZ thrown in for good measure. While a campaign is planned, the current sandbox mode is fantastic on its own, pitting you against another team for control of respawn points. The main gamemode is a bit of Domination from Call of Duty, with the number of respawn points you control filling in a points meter at the top of your screen. You can defend a single point and never lose it, but if you have 1 and the enemy has 5, you're going to lose. The interesting thing about the sandbox style is that once the game ""ends,"" you can still keep playing, you just get notified of which team won and then it keeps going on forever. There's vehicles (tanks, jeeps, ATVs, boats, planes and helicopters), gadgets (grenades, health and ammo kits, launchers, etc) and a decent amount of weapons for being in early access. There's also 4 secret weapons that for some reason the AI are allowed to use at any time, but I've had some trouble getting them to stay in my loadout screen after closing the game. Overall it's all you really need to entertain yourself if you like pure gameplay, no story, no anything other than constant fighting. There's also no-respawns TDM gamemode called spec ops and another one that I don't know anything about because I've been so entertained with the default conquest style gamemode.One big draw is the ""active ragdoll physics."" The game models may look like they're from Totally Accurate Battle Simulator but don't be discouraged, your movement is just like in any other FPS and your aim is elastic-y like a ragdoll but it's quite comfortable to use. The ragdoll physics become active when you fall, swim, get caught in an explosion or get shot enough and it's surprisingly great for the gameplay. When being shot by powerful guns, or a lot with weak guns, you'll obviously take damage but at a certain point you'll ragdoll and fall down. Explosions that aren't close enough to hurt you may still knock you over and so will near misses from heavy machine guns, but without hurting you. (also there's no fall damage, which is good for pilots) The ragdolling adds a second penalty beyond death, which is occupying your attention. You can't do anything as a ragdoll and this is a fate worse than death, literally. Rather than respawning with full health and armor in a matter of seconds, you stay where you are, not rearming and respawning and you're taken out of the fight, not for the time it takes to respawn but until you can get on your feet and stay that way. Stun grenades and heavy machine guns make it so that a single soldier can defend a position against 5 or more, even knocking them over through cover, taking them out of the fight without giving them their ammo and health back and letting them spawn where they can get a vehicle to take vengeance, and of course that applies to you too. If that's not enough depth, the AI can be knocked down but not out, meaning you can't easily tell if someone's dead or alive. You have to decide between wasting ammo and time shooting every body you come across, or risking a bullet in the back when a dead soldier turns out to have fallen out of a helicopter or tripped on some splash damage.There may not be a ton of content so far, but the game is easily worth the money and absolutely worth your time, especially with planned Steam Workshop support. There's night versions of each map to add some variety and if you enter the beta branch you can play the old version of one map (it's basically a totally different map), bringing the level count up to 5.Pros-Great replay value if you can make fun for yourself in a sandboxReally solid combatInteresting and unique ragdoll systemVehicles are simple but easy to control, feeling just like Battlefield.Active developer with updates being released often.Cons-There may not be enough content for some people, particularly in the map department. If you're worried about this, consider waiting for more levels or workshop support so you don't get tired of the game too soon.Vehicles aren't too well balanced, tanks feel a bit weak with any of the launchers being able to destroy one and having ammo to spare. Helicopters are glass cannons and the missile boats are titanium cannons.Overall 9/10 game, it's really fun and deserves a spot in your library."

I personally feel it needs a few things added such the ability to set the amount of points a team needs to victory and more weapons but i feel both of these will likely be added in the future. Also the shotguns need a nerf because they may not do a lot of damage at range but they can knock you down something that needs to be changed. The animation of getting up takes too much time and most of the time can lead to a string of getting knocked down and never beening able to get up due to the animation taking too long.

It certainly can be quite interesting at times when you have around 200 bots on the field.  And while there's not a whole lot of content just yet, the games constantly being improved, whether it be new map updates or general improvements to the AI. It is early access, after all. And although it may not seem worth $15 just yet, I can assure you it will most definitely be worth it's price tag later down the line.

That doesn't change anything though, I absolutely adore this game.Pro:- Brilliant time waster, spent 90 minutes immediatly after I bought it.- Very easy to play, if you've played a FPS before, then you can play this game.- No DRM, DLC, Microtransactions, it is not a pay to win in anyway, or pay to get ahead.- It is singleplayer, meaning you can play this offline.- It is being constanly updated by a single person.- It is fairly priced.- The AI is quite decent, there is some funny moments in which an enemy can go right past you. Other times your Allies can hold points so you don't have to stay at one point.Con:- It is singleplayer, so you won't be able to play with your friends.- There may be a few bugs, I haven't encountered any."

You basically start a match with x number of bots, and each team has half that number. You, the player, are one of the soldiers on your side, working to capture flags and kill enemies. There are tanks, planes, helicopters, jeeps, jeeps with mounted guns on them, emplacements, you name it. If you have the ""squad leader toolkit"" item, you can get up to 5 bots on your side to take orders from you (attack one of the flags, enter vehicles, follow you, attack a certain point, etc etc).The matches can be fairly long, depending on what gamemode you're playing and how many bots you have in it. The more bots you have, the more it feels like you're fighting in an actual war. Without using the squad leader toolkit item, you're another soldier in the army, which is still pretty fun because you can follow other groups of bots and help them take a point. With it, though, you can lead that group of bots and strategically maneuver around the flag to take it easier. Also, custom maps integration via workshop. All around great game.10/10, would storm a castle with my squad again."

Multiplayer will NEVER be implemented. This is a SINGLE PLAYER ONLY game.Ravenfield is a solo Battlefield/Battlefront-esque game which can involve literally hundreds of bots fighting over an expansive map. This is everything I wanted in the DICE Battlefront and never got.Official maps are somewhat limited, but there is an active modding community which creates some truly amazing maps with professional levels of detail. The develeoper has provided a suite of free modding tools so that you can create your own battlefields, as well.My only complaints are regarding a few nitpicky things. Vehicles are very difficult to control, especially aerial vehicles. I find the game to be difficult to play with a controller. Some level of auto-aim needs to be implemented, along with smoother movement acceleration. However, these are things which will almost certainly see some improvement in the future.Overall, this is a fun game that fills a neglected niche in the gaming market."

People could play this game for hours per day. I don't play Ravenfield as much because; I'm a mac user and Ravenfield tends to drop in frames every few seconds. I recommend that you should play Ravenfield on windows. The main problem I have with the game is the lack of weapons. Sometimes I get bored using the same guns but, when Steelraven7 released gun mods for Ravenfield I was playing Ravenfield more and more. My favourite part of Ravenfield are the maps.

The 'Slow-Mo' feature is great as well as it makes you feel awesome as you find yourself in 1v5 situations. However, I do have some issues with the game. If you are injured, you can't just hide in a corner and watch as your wounds disappear. There is NO health regen, and that kind of puts me off as I normally find myself constantly looking at the ground in search of a medkit instead of being out there, fighting. If even a little bit of health regen was added, it would put me in a 'I can survive this' kind of attitude, instead of 'I need to find a medkit' kind of attitude. And any of you reading this may think that i have played too much COD with the health regen thing, and frankly, I think I might have.I recommend this game, but if I were you, I would wait when the devs release more features, as in it's current state, there isn't a lot. however, it is a very well-made game and I hope that will not put you off considering to buy this."

I cant wait to see what kind of maps and such will be added for the campaign, and what guns we might see in the future. I do have some recomendations, but they are all in the discussions."

A great FPS, and with more updates on the way I can wait! I knew I had to come here and spread the word.For those of you asking for Multiplayer, dont look here. The Dev's are making a singler player game, and its a great single player game too. The AI is great for an Early Access could use some work but the game is still very much enjoyable.Dev's Keep up the good work I look foreword to what you have instore for this game.I'll update this later with more specific Pros and Cons after I spend more time playing the game.UPDATE 1 Hour of playtimePros:1. Easy Gameplay very simple to pickup and have some quick fun.2. Good AI. When it comes to FPS single player games AI is key for good play session. During this build AI is good but could use improvement, but no major issues.3. Average grapics, obviously grapics are not the goal here but you must point that out, but because of this you can have a a large number of bots for very big battles, and you can run on almost any PC.Cons1. Currently only 4 maps and 3 game modes all of which are fun but get dull very quickly.2.Not many items or guns. This will change as the game updates but this is were it is right now.3. No Multiplayer. There won't be any mulitplayer ever but still a good game but because of this, this game will always miss something.Will Update on next major build.7/31/17New custom map support for Steam Workshop!After getting the Hoth Map (yes Star Wars Hoth) and the Dogfight map, you can still clearly see how awsome this game is, and how the developers are giving it all the love they can. I contuine to look foreword to the next build. Buying this game now though, I would say is a worth while investment, its fun, time consuming, and addictive. I'll write more on the next MAJOR build, something that will inculde new feautres or something worth writing about."

So at the moment, the game is quite fun; it has all the offline Battlefield Player vs Bots essentials. However, what excites me most is what the community will be able to do with this game and its full modding support. Maps and weapons are being produces with varying quality but many out now are very detailed. I cannot wait for vehicles to be fully manipulated and put on the workshop!Gameplay wise, movement and gumplay are smooth, it supports hundreds of bots, large maps are possible, vehicle controls could use some work but are still capable. Also, nothing has frustrated me or made me wonder ""why did the developer decide to do it this way?""If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, go ahead and pick it up.

The steady flow of development and maintenance on the title has been well paced- allowing us players just enough time to play around with new features while building on our knowledge of the game as a whole. Overall, the transition from indie beta to Steam release has been smooth. I am already completely satisfied with my purchase, and it's only in early access!To anyone considering getting this game- don't hesitate. If you're looking for a fun purchase that'll keep you well entertained throughout development, this is for you.Update -I still enjoy the game for what it's got going for it currently, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the game is in need of content if it is to sustain interest.

Oh yeah and it was free too. Ever since it came to Steam, I felt that this was going to be such a perfect game, especially with the extra funding the devs would get, however this just isn't the case right now. I really believe that the devs deserve the $15 they ask for, but they simply haven't added enough content to keep me playing for more than 20 minutes. Sure there are some secret guns to find and a few new maps, but after a while it gets a bit boring really. I feel as though the devs need to polish it up a little, maybe add a multiplayer aspect to this even though it might go against what the devs wanted to get out of this game. Keep in mind this review was written before the campaign was released and that might change my mind but for now this is my verdict. I've kept myself from refunding it in the hopes that later on I'll start to enjoy it more, but for now we'll just have to see."
,Not Recommended,636480,34075475,Posted: 6 August,all,Xela,"ADHD Version: Don't buy Ravenfield unless it's $10 or under in its current state. There isn't enough content in the game to justify it being $15, however it is fun for what it is (just not $15 worth of fun). It shows potential, that's it. Wait until there's more content, or wait until the price drops to a more reasonable level.Full Version:This game shows promise for what it may be able to achieve by the time this game is no longer considered 'Early Access'.It runs really well, which is to be expected with these graphics, and that's really great for gameplay purposes since I can have hundreds of Computer players without framerate drops. Speaking of graphics, they are very unique and adds to the charm of the game. There's a wide selection of weapons to be used as well as vehicles (that take a bit of time to learn how to control it right) and land weapons like cannons. There's a lot of potential for modding capabilities as well. However, that marks the end of all the good I can say about this game.There's not enough going on in this game to justify it being $15 on Steam here, in other words you're paying for more than there actually is in-game. It didn't even go on sale during the Steam Summer sale which is rather annoying. In its current state, Ravenfield is just a promise of a lot of great things to come. Maybe give it a year and it will be worth $15, possibly more.So in conclusion, wait until it's on sale, costs less in general, or has more content to justify this kind of price. Other than that, Ravenfield is awesome."

More weapons and weapon customisation too would be nice (also fixing them, like you can't see through the holographic sight at night time...?), as they haven't said they would be adding more.Not the worst of games, probably doesn't deserve a big ""No"" to it but unfortunately there's no ""Meh"" option."

However, this is not much of an improvment from the previously free version. Audio is rarely synced with the direction the sound originates while in a vehicle. I've also found that the red blur that indicates where you are being shot from also points in the wrong direction.  Also, AI of the opposite team tends to spawn on captured points, i.e. raven controls point A, then a eagle will spawn on the point A. This happens more frequently then it should. Overall, this version is as glitchy, if not more, than the free version online. Everytime I launch the game I consider applying for a refund, but I hold onto the hope that it will improve, given time. Until that time however, I cannot recommend this game."

,Not Recommended,636480,33317244,Posted: 6 July,all,lfiea,"this game is good for a bit of fun, however it is nowhere near the asking price in terms of content or quality, i really dont understand the rave reviews, you only realise how much of a rip oiff this game is when for example a steam summer sale is on... this game did not take part in the summer sale, when the witcher 3 is £14.99 i expect this game to be £1.99 lets be realistic here, and if you say ""the developer needs to earn their money back somehow"" you are kidding yourself, base colours, flat textures, ok AI - decent vehicle AI, most of the game looks like it was made on untiy asset packs... so again, can someone explain the rave reviews, am i missing a big update?none of these things would be an issue if the map design was good (theyre so bad) the developer clearly plopped some random objects around a random map and then decided they were ok the way they are...also, early access is no excuse as from what ive seen the only real big changes theyre adding is a really basic campaing mode and some updated models... i really wish i could refund,,,one good review says that this game is the best game for boredom ever... has this person ever played Gmod? it is basically this game but with thousands of mods and online community and access...do not buy in current state."

,Not Recommended,636480,33013878,Posted: 29 June,all,Dagger32304,"This game is fun, but it needs a lot of work before it is anywhere close to being worth its price tag. As it stands everything is very poorly balanced, the guns all feel very weak and are wildly inaccurate at any range, reload times are god awful across the board, vehicle handling is either insanely tight or wildly loose, the bots are dumb as bricks or the best marksmen in the world (on the easiest setting I was insta killed by a headshot from a bot over 500 meters away on dustbowl), the maps are decently spaced out but feel very empty, all the action tends to happen in a few spots and thats it, there is no fighting for space and pushing back the enemy. A few suggestions of mine would be to balance the guns so that they all feel useful, shotguns are good even at long distances because they dont have bullet drop (another feature which needs work) but they are too slow to be useful even at close range. Fix AI pathing so that they are more coordinated, have them make pushes for spots and flank your position instead of just randomly wandering around until they find something to shoot at. Give players the ability to kick friendlies out of a vehicle or gun placement without having to kill them, also being able to call friendlies over to get in your vehicle would be great instead of having to wait and hope one gets in. The game performs kinda meh, but its Early Access and Unity so ill give it a pass on that for now. All in all, I would recommend this game after its polished more and given some of the tender loving care it so desperately needs. So if you wanna buy this, wait, save your money and let the game get developed more."
,Recommended,636480,34125547,Posted: 9 August,all,Cipodoboz,"Ravenfield is still very early in development. Although the look and feel of the game is evident, being a fun, easy to pick up, chaotic and diverse single player FPS, there are some rough edges that are being cleaned up constantly. The sound is not the best and incomplete, the graphics are good but not refined and often cannot decide what aesthetic they are aiming for and some of the combat is occasionally choppy. The battles however are nice to experience and some features, like temporary immobilisation, knock back, bullet drop and travel time, tons of vehicles (tanks, boats, bombers, quads and choppers just to name a few) and huge maps. And since the game is actively being updated by a dedicated developer, new features and fixes are always on the horizon to improve an already good game. I personally cannot wait to see what this game will bring in the future."

No matter what difficulty they're generally very accurate and don't even need to reduce you to 0 health to effectively kill you. Shots will make you ragdoll, which allows them to stunlock you to death. Also, certain weapons just barely work. You fire a rocket launcher at a squad of enemies and only the one you hit directly gets knocked down. And of course, the fact that you can't Battlefront style kick out the AI from the vehicles so you can drive them competently instead of having them run straight into the enemies to die.I could see this being very fun in multiplayer, but I'm not sure if that's happening."

Whether it's firing upon raiding dingys bound for friendly territory, harrasing fighters looking to prevent your carnage, stopping missile loaded attack helicopters, avoidng anti-air bullets narrowly missing you and exploding at the sides of your craft, or just laying down suppressing fire to let your ground forces advance; its all very entertaining. Would be nice to see new additions added to the planes like the capability of dropping bombs out of the bottom of its apparatus, multiple pilots, diffrent plane mounted weaponry, or perhaps even fast paced jet fighter because the current line-up of airborne armaments leaves much to be desired."
,Recommended,636480,31873553,Posted: 20 May,all,Arkdoodle,"Ravenfield is like a sandbox Battlefield game, but it doesn't take itself too seriously like most military shooters. Between the unlimited amount of bots you can spawn, and the silly ragdoll physics, any FPS player or even casual player can have a lot of fun with this.Pros:-Ragdoll! Not just the enemies, the player can get ragdolled too.-Vehicles including planes-Tight overall fps feel-Customizable loadout-Runs on my potato, even with 150 bots on lower settings (Intel HD 5500)-Active dev-Upcoming mod support-Diverse maps, but only a handfulCons:-The AI is currently VERY hit or miss. Sometimes, the enemy impresses me by sending a death squad of 40 soldiers that absolutely stomps me into the ground as I try valiantly to defend a spawn point, other times they run past me and don't even notice me.-Not enough guns... yet. When the game is more polished and workshop support comes online I'm sure we'll have plenty then.-Guns are too accurate. I know, weird complaint, but I hate how a soldier can basically snipe me with an AK-47.-No music now.-Game modes seem somewhat irrelevent. Point Match can end very quickly (because we cannot adjust how many points must be earned since it is decided by a multiplier), and Battalions makes the respawn points less important. I won't review the Spec Ops mode since it is a ""preview.""A Neutral point:Slow motion. Is it fun? Very. But it can quickly cheapen the experience if you spam it every time you run into an enemy. I hope the dev considers giving us a limited amount of Slow Motion with a  recharge or something.Despite the cons, I do recommend this game, and I think with time, polish, and a modding community, it will be one of the better military shooters I have played."

Currently 4 Official maps released and more on the way. The developer has been busting his balls lately coming out with two new guns and adding, What I like to call, Commander Mode, Meaning you command strategically what your team does throughout the battle.

The combat reminds me a little bit of the old Star Wars Battlefront (the one from 2005 or so).No cutscenes, no crappy memes, no terrible characters or voiceovers... just shooting stuff and getting shot.Ravenfield doesn't take itself too seriously. You've got red guys vs blue guys and ragdoll physics. The AI isn't good at taking cover or flanking, but shoots well and drives vehicles better than I do. I get killed quite a bit and find the game challenging enough. You get a fair variety of weapons and vehicles, and I've got no complaints about the one map I've been playing on so far.I play with an Xbox controller and had to lower the sensitivity in-game a bit... it was hard to aim and hit anything otherwise. That's the only play issue I had - no crashes so far, no weird stuff.There is no multiplayer and the dev does not intend to add it. But that means they focused on solo play and this game is more fun than the singleplayer option of pretty much all of the FPS's out there.It's EA, but believe me, I don't fool around with crappy alpha early access stuff. This is good right now. Ravenfield would be worth full price even if the devs all vanished tomorrow. I highly recommend it."

Seriously can not wait for the new additions in the future.Updated:Aaaaaannnnnnd ruined.Everything was moving along swimmingly, all fine until thee dev pulled a serious drift into twatville and change the ""balance"" so that it is nothing of the sort.The way the AI can act is amazing, but guess what. ONLY the AI on the ENEMy team can act smart. None of your fellow soldiers on your team will do anything that signifies that it isn't just another dumb program. Hell it tries to solidify that fact.But when you look at the map and see the enemy, they get perfect auto aim across the map, perfect flanking, change weapons mid-life, holy canolli they even go to a point just to spawn kill with a damn tank.This game went from a solid 9/10 to a 0/10 in one update. When they whole game is powered by AI the least you can do is make sure it works on both sides PROPERLY AND FAIRLY, but thats too much to ask for for the majority of devs. I hope this does get fixed because what this was before was actually enjoyable, but no longer.Don't buy."

,Recommended,636480,32006177,Posted: 27 May,all,✠ Speed Wubs ✠,"Im playing the game since it was just a file which you needed to download online.Now its available on steam, which makes me happy. Now i need to pay for almost the same content, but thats no problem. Im looking forward to the promised game contents which would extend the game pretty much and make it worth it.Anyway, first i will explain how the game feels like.Just for the people who consider to buy this game. It is pretty much like Battlefield Play 4 Free or the old Battlefield games. You have your spawn with tanks, choppers and other vehicles and your main objective is to capture the enemy or neutral points. Yet there are three Gamemodes here. First point capping, like i already said. Then ""battalions"", which is kinda like a mode with tickets where your team just have a limited amout of manpower. I really like that one, its more realistic. But you will also cap points there. The last gamemode is obviously still in development but you can already try it. Its sort of a stealth mode, where your objective is to defeat the enemy soldiers and cap the points. But its not a huge battle, its just you and a few against the normal enemy. This mode isnt really special because you cant be stealthy and you cant command other troops yet.Some veterans who played the game before it came on steam maybe want to know what content has been added yet.A new revolver, a new silenced MP, a new cool rocket launcher, two new maps and planes. Ah yes, and the desert map changed too. Now you can fly planes there.I can recommend this game for people who dont need online action and are rather in retro-like mood. Obviously this game doesnt want to be a multiplayer shooter, so i hope it will focus on a great singleplayer skirmish experience in the future.Now some things i would recommend and wish to be in the game:-The possiblity to lay down-The possiblity to help teammates up after they felt on the ground (Because of explosions etc.)-Anti-Person and Anti-Vehicle Mines-More weapons / an alternative for the AK47 + a MG-A map with buildings you can enter / more close combat possibilities in-door-A Gamemode where each team has a general in their base who is planing the teams actions. Goal is to kill the enemy general. You could do it with an invasion of your troops into the enemy base, or stealth like."

It's sort of just like playing against bots in Call of Duty for example, but with MUCH less content. I don't believe there is enough content to justify a $18 NZD price tag. This game should be valued at around $5.99 USD, to $9.99 USD.I do reccomend that you keep an eye on this game though. Or give it a try, but keep an eye on your time limit. After 1.5 hours, stop. Exit the game, and think about whether the price you paid can give you more hours of gameplay than what you just played."

,Not Recommended,636480,32738656,Posted: 24 June,all,Smurfinator,"This is a review for the current beta (06/24/17)Ravenfield is a 3D, single player first person shooter designed to be great for all people of all skill.Here is what I think of the game.It runs on virtually any PC. Look at the minimum hardware requirements! It could run on a potato because of its simplicity.The graphics are simple without being an eyesore. The bright colours makes it easy to differentiate betweeen different buildings and different teams.The AI is not bad, but could be improved because sometimes they are MLG YY quickscoper South Korean pros and sometimes they are so dumb and ignorant they don't realise that you are in front of them. These points do not affect actual gameplay but do annoy the hell out of me when I get sniped across the map by some dude.There is enough content for it to keep you entertained for an hour or sp, but not enough to keep you entertained for more than that. I understand this game is in its early stages so more maps and weapons will definitely be added.There are secret weapons for you to find. This is great and the OP weapons are really fun to use.Vehicles are really fun to use, and they require skill to use well which means there is a lurning curve (not too steep though)This game is great for people of all skill, because of the difficulty settings.However for a steep price of $10? Nah. I would only recommend getting it on sale, or if you are really interested."

The game somehow runs at 30 fps and dips even lower on a GTX 1080Ti despite using simplistic graphics.You can find Battlefield 4 for less than the price of this game and this game is just a poor Battlefield clone top to bottom (they even used the same font for the title), and gets boring very quickly.

The game is less than a damn beta, with every gun missing sound effects, and the ones that are there lacking any sort of punch or satifaction. The weapons themselves feel like airsoft guns, with no recoil or sound effects, and, for a singleplayer only experience the AI sure is dumb.This game is so remarkably far from being complete that I absolutely cannot reccomend purchasing it. With no tangible mod support, no multiplayer, no campaign and lacking basics such as actual map boundaries or sound effects I can only advise you to download the free ""beta"" from their website (if thats the beta, what is this?)Honestly my largest complaint for this game is in its sound design, it is so difficult to play an FPS that lacks simple reloading sounds. A modification to the sound would surely make this game one of my favourites."

This game is awesome, and I've given it to my brother. It is a little laggy but I thought the lag would be way worse! I have thought of a few suggestions to further improve the game:-Zombies: I know this may be a little hard, but I would like to shoot at things that can still kill me but not shoot back. Waves would further improve this, as there would be more zombies every wave (obviously). You could possibly make apocalypse maps, as in crashed vehicles, dark skies, and a lot of smoke. Sorta like you would see in zombie games.-Zombies CO-OP: Same as Zombies, but able to play with actual people. Online CO-OP and local CO-OP would be nice if you only wanted to play with your family who has the game.-Multiplayer: I know this may not come for a long time or at all, but it would be nice to be able to play online against other players. Bots would fill empty spaces on the teams. You could also choose the amount of players you want to join the game.-CO-OP: This would be pretty much singleplayer, except all the players would be on the same team, with a few bots to even out both teams. Online and local would be nice. You could also choose the amount of players you want to join the game.-Ability to change bot weapons: The ability to change the bots' arsenal would be a SWEET feature, if you wanted to make it a sniper match or all rockets etc. Changing of weapons would happen BEFORE the match starts, while you are adjusting the settings.-More guns: At my brothers request, I am adding this to the list. He would like more snipers (.50 cal, and more!), more pistols (Glock 18, and more!), and he LOVES old guns, so he also requests more old timer guns like the Quicksilver.-More maps: I know the Steam Community has worked hard on some maps, but it would be nice to have some maps that I don't need to download to play. It would be nice to have a city map, maybe a large airfield, and some others!-AI Assistance: I know you worked hard on this game, and especially the AI, but I would like if they actually got in vehicle I got in, so if I was a gunner on a jeep or driving it, they would all pile in until it was full. It gets annoying when I have no gunner on the tank, jeep, and helicopters.Thank you if you are reading this and I hope you are able to add these!"

And now you can’t even run the game at least just about fluent: it is VERY VERY stuck and Bots are running strangely.

But what is the purpose behind that? It flies very fast, and because of they cancel the slow motion, I couldn’t even practice it. And the controlling is diffused. How could I practice based on this?I play it on MacBook; I know that macs are not good at running the games. I’m not writing this bunch of stuff to persuade the players not to buy this game.

,Recommended,636480,31868158,Posted: 20 May,all,That_Guy,"First of all, I have followed this game since beta 4, and I frequently check the Ravenfield discord for news from the developer.  Ever since I found this game, I have been in love with its simple, but fun nature. Many say this game has little content, at least, for the price. Yet, the game is so addicting and unique, that the ""lack"" of content is made up for through the amazing gameplay itself. If you think beta 6 has little content, check out the older betas. In the betas, there was half the content and I still loved it.Now for some more detailpros:-Lots of replayability (played the betas for hours and hours nd never got bored of shooting bots)-A variety of maps (while there aren't a ton of maps, they are unique and fun)-Graphics (maybe this is just me, but the new player models make me long for this game)-Guns (the guns feel amazing to use, each is unique and fun to use in different scenarios)-Mods comming soon! (with an amazing commuinity, this game could have endless amounts of content for people to play with)cons:-Lack of polish (while this isn't a big deal, the maps don't feel finished or all that well made, there are all sorts of mistakes in the terrain)-Bots (the bots can be a little easy to perdict, I have noticed that matches always start and end in very distinct ways, meaning there isn't a ton of variety in bot behavior)-lack of gamemodes (im not sure if the developer plans on adding more gamemodes besides campaign, but the three currents ones aren't quite enough to keep me satisfied, battalions and point match feel like the same gamemode, spec ops is the only unique one)Overall, the game is great, don't get me wrong, but its a one man team making this game and I am a bit worried as to how SteelRaven7 is going to be able to make this game big enough for me to enjoy till the full release. Mods and campaign are planned, along with some other things, but I'm curious to really see how big this game will grow to be.I say though, that you should buy it, the gameplay is fun, and if the developer can really push out good updates, it could become even greater. Plus with a bigger community, this game could have content coming from more than one guy!

,Recommended,636480,31866818,Posted: 20 May,all,eman_,"For a one man project developing an early access game, it is very well done.I had a blast playing this game for the initial 2 hours I've started [5/19/2017]. It is a very straight forward, single-player fps game that really puts the emphasis on fantastic gameplay. The game does play just like battlefield(Replace the ""raven"" of the title with ""battle"", and you get battlefield. Clever~),but to me this was a trip to nostalgia of battlefield 1942, where fps games were just simple and and oozing with hardcore action with little to no story. This game does a fantastic job in contemperary gaming, and it's developed by one man.Like I've mentioned earlier, it's a very straight forward game, you dive into fire and try to beat the objective. The game was literally meant to be a pick-up game, as it is not emphasized by multiplayer but a singleplayer experience. There's been a good ongoing rise of good fps games, but putting these games on scale as a whole through the years, there has been more multiplayer-based experience than singleplayer experience. What really distinguishes the multiplayer game with single player games is replayability, and most single player games don't have that long-term replayability. This game has that potential of putting that long-term replayability because each match (I've played more on point match than battalion btw) is intriguing.Firefights are intense, Ai's charging from one point to the other, and an unexpected explosion comes out of nowhere to kills you or that whole squad of men that you're running along with. Vehicles in game are interesting, fun and hard to kill, especially if you have no rocket on you. There are those moments where you happen to run away because you couldn't dent a vehicle with you gun and have to rely on squd members to take it out. When you drive one, it's fun to get squad members to take the turret and side seat with you, but the Ai's aren't quite smart, yet. I sometimes see them run past me to the point without realizing I was driving a car or a tank that needed a turret. because of this, sometimes I noticed I haven't been moving but hoping that a squad boards in.Speaking of Ai, there's something that I find amusing in-game: enemy snipers are scary. Ai snipers seem to do there job right. Sometimes when I do storm into a stronghold that has no enemy Ai's guarding the front, out of nowhere I've got shot and died laying there as the squad moves in. As I respond and move back to the area I died on, I notice a couple of Ai's moving around on the highest part of the hill (This experience was on the map: Island). There are some cases Ai's do play there role in game and it's interesting when you do view match in spectator mode.Ravenfield is a solid early access game and many settings can be adjusted such as respawn time and number of Ai's in-game. There are a few bugs in game (such as running through the field with you legs planted through the ground) but overall it's a good singleplayer fps game with a promise of replayability and fun. I really do look forward to new features promised in it's store page, such as modding and squad command. Since this is an early access game, my opinion may change as the game molds itself.I'd give it an 8/10 for now, but I do look forward to it's future updates and further development. Good job!"

First, I was a bit skeptical, as I assumed it'd be like Running With Rifles, it lagged really bad; then I find a review saying ""this game could run on a toaster"", and he wasn't wrong. This game is a diverse and fun enviroment to just fight.Pros:Doesn't lagQuality and accurate weaponryPretty good animations (For the most part)Multiple maps, gameplays, and variables to shake it up.Great first person shooting, very accurate.Overall just well done.Cons:Animations are a bit shaky; Falling and swimming.Patriot, Air Horn, HMG, and Hydra don't save to your loadout after quitting the game.No type of account, stats, or any form of signing in. Which I think there should be some stats, and at least a type of save feature, if more things become *aviable* to warrant it.Falling messes me up a lot, and half the time I don't even know what causes it.Almost impossible to get the NPCs to drive the jeep with the SMG. I usually have to shoot the gunner then hop on.Game becomes a bit repetitive. (Campaign will change that)The NPCs should be a bit more trained, but I guess that's why the balance scale was added.Comments:I think the speed limit for the ATV should be set lower.Keep up the great work!"

You have your basic needs like a Machine Gun, Sniper, Shotgun , Pistols, and rocket launchers -8/10Maps - So far there are 4 maps. 2 of them being pretty large and the other pretty small. I find that the amount of cover avaliable is acceptable by my standards but there is no interactive map features like opening doors or breaking down trees. -7/10Actual Combat - Combat feels like a fps to me as it should which is all I can really say about that part. The game does not have any multiplayer mode or co-op which heavily disappoints me but I can manage. The A.I tends to walk in big hordes that can be easily taken out by explosive weapons and sometimes feel like they really can't see anything. A campaign is said to be coming soon but since that is not in yet I will give a small boost to the score - 8.5/10Excuse any Grammar mistakes or stuff I may have missed :P"

The concept is very similar, but the gameplay is unique in its own. Although limited to singleplayer, this game doesn't leave you feeling bored as the matches are engaging and action-packed. The player models remind me of plastic army guys, and the art-style is reminiscent of Unturned. Minor bugs and annoyances are present in this current version, but it's easy to look past them when you got lost playing.PROS-really easy to run-quick to start a game-animation is fluid and satisfying-gameplay is high intensity and addictive-ragdoll physics-bullet-time ability is uniqueCONS-AI is meh-sound effects are lack-luster-only gamemode worth playing right now is Point Match-water is a real annoyance if you get trapped in it-currently not worth 15 USD in the version it's inTL:DR A Battlefield/Unturned lovechild"

Maybe the price is also a bit high related to the amount of content, but i'm really happy to pay - first of all to say thanks to the developer - but also because i'm sure that in the future the upcoming updates are gonna be awesome (i think that this game could become in some kind of way the fps version of ""Simple Planes"")"

,Recommended,636480,31826042,Posted: 18 May,all,I'm a Cuut Liddle Poany!,"This review was written the day the game was released, and may have some edits as updates come out.TL;DR: The game is great, but lacks the much vaunted content that we were excited for, and at $15 it's a little pricy for just matches.The detailed review:This game is a single-player only military FPS. You may think that makes it boring. It's not. The game is FANTASTIC. To be fair, it's a little overpriced at $15, but that's on release date, perhaps that number will go down as the game goes along.So pros and cons?Pros:Relaxing yet not TOO relaxing gameplay.Fairly decent AI for an indie game made by one person.Guns are fun to play around with.Controls are good.Vehicles are pretty neat. It's fun to hop in the machinegun port of a tank right next to the enemy flag and blast everyone away.For a singleplayer game, can be decently challenging.Cons:Fairly limited gameplay as of now, but it was JUST released, so that will change soon.I was disappointed that the mod system isn't even released yet, but that's to be expected. However, the dev didn't even release the much spoken of campaign mode. Come on man, AT LEAST get that ready.To be honest, the game doesn't feel...ready for even early access release. I got that feeling from another game that had DISASTROUS updates, Castle Story (which I also reviewed). Hopefully, this game won't go down that path.I LOVED the free Beta on itch.io, and was hopeful for this game, but it really has been a little...disappointing on release.STILL, this game is fun, even as is, and I have no regrets forking over $12 to get it. I'm excited to see what the dev will do as the game progresses.Should you buy it? If you want a fun, single-player FPS game experience, sure, but maybe wait for the much vaunted content to come out before you dole out $15 for this game. That's a little pricy"

,Recommended,636480,33342533,Posted: 7 July,all,MasqueR,"This is the first time I bought an early access game and I gotta tell you, I really like Ravenfield. This is also the first time I write a review on Steam. Ravenfield is how BattleField series after BattleField 2142 should have been. I really love old BattleField style, which is in the games BattleField 1942 to BattleField 2142. Not all open world war games should be too realistic. Too much realism usually kills the fun. However, a game like Ravenfield can be very fun without too much realistic graphics and gameplay. It seems to me that the developers worked hard on game concept and this is the important part for me. They could have been easily made this game a multiplayer war game but instead they worked on AI which has enough hardness and fun to play against and this is a good choice since I shouldn't have to be forced to play a game only multiplayer.Some parts I noted about the game according to my playing experiences:1) Planes and helicopters should also be flown with arrow keys.2) Instant games are pretty fun but a campaign which will be developed later sounds great. After campaign, multiplayer, especailly multiplayer agains the AI would be great.3) I remember BattleField 2142's Titan games were amazing. So this game mode can be applied to this game such that there may be two big battleships on each team that players can attack after they control all the points on the map. After the ship is destroyed, the team that destroys the ship wins.4) Commander mode can be applied and a squad based system would be great.5) If teams can build their own bases including sensor towers, commanding center, artillery, etc., this may bring a new concept to the game.Finally, I want to thank the devepoers for a great game and I hope that they will continue the great work. I am happy that I play and support this game."

I heard nothing about this and I bought it on a whim because its 12 dollars and I figured if it was bad I could just refund it. But its great, for a small team and a game made in unity it is an impressively solid Battlefield 3/4 clone with suprisingly solid shooter mechanics, I've legitmately seen AAA FPS shooters that have worse shooter mechanics than this game made by a couple guys in Unity.Its got a suprisising ammount of content in it so far, and its a good way to kill a few minutes, spawn in 100-150 bots and just embrace the chaos of a massive battle.I'd say its worth making the dive, the devs have a promising track record and this game is going to be huge when they finally add mod support and custom maps. The only complaints I really have is there isn't nearly enough variety in vehicles and guns and the four maps it comes with get old after a few games, this problem should be solved as they intend to add more maps as development goes on and they're adding in workshop support, the fact that this is made in Unity will probably mean the custom map support for this will be huge and will have a low barrier of entry.Anyway its a fun little experiment and as far as I can see it has a promising roadmap, its worth 12 dollars at least, and I mean you can see all it has to offer in under 2 hours so if you end up hating it you can just refund it right?"

PLEASE READ OTHER REVIEWS AS I WILL NOT GO INTO DETAIL!If your like me, you often played Battlefield 2, BattleFRONT 2 and sometimes Black ops in offline mode as all three have bots. This was when either I wasnt very good (for the most part) or I just didint want to play online.This game, at a fair price, is that to me. I spent hours playing those games offline and with mods and hopefully workshop that means tons of maps, weapons for me to just play away.At the time of making this I only played (acording to steam) 36 minutes. Hopefully as time goes by I shall play it more. Its a good time waster.There is of course, campaign coming soon. so that could be exciting."

Here's what everyone I think is hoping for and thinking of....New modes: needs a eliminations (1 life only) mode, King of the hill, Capture the flag, Juggernaut could be interesting, A deeper input could be nicer too. Can we assign how much life our guys have? Edit the ammo you start with, set the ragdoll mode higher so that funnier things happen, add explosive ammo to pistols? There's lil tweaks that add a lot of different playmodes people coule love.Map Styles: There's alot of elevation on these maps, need some maps with rows/halls with lots of cover, even a large flat battle ground with trenchs and towers would really look nice.Weapons: There's some basics here but what about restrictions? All Pistols, all grenades? Let us pick what we want. I think they might as well add some different genres of guns too, old style and futuristic. Make a fun gun like a rail rifle that launches bodies.Minimal AI control: Ok I understand ordering everyone is harder to do. But I think you should have a couple guys be able to follow you if you want if you want to do a flanking move or maybe just so you don't become the only target that is straying from the sheep herd."

At first it might seem that it will get boring after some time but the freedom of this game allows you to make different approaches to it and try out different loadouts, vehicles, maps and gamemodes. It can run on almost every PC which is good for gamers like me who haven't got a great PC.  The game just came out in Early Access but it's already a great game and the developer is promising new maps, guns, vehicles, a campaign and Steam Workshop which will allow different fun mods to change up the game. Only con about the game is that the developer said there will be no multiplayer. I think there should at least be an option to go into a game with a friend or two and enjoy killing bots together or pick different armies and lead them to victory.

76561198095544608,Recommended,636480,32052686,Posted: 29 May,all,Tschami,"Ravenfield is a simple singleplayer shooter reminiscent of the Star Wars: Battlefront and Battlefield Series. The player sets up a match, chooses the location and circumstances, and charges into the fray. The gunplay is simple yet satisfying, the spawn system is quite nice, and the vehicles are a joy to use (my favorite being the plane.) This is an early access title, yet it has a nice foundation already, which is far more than can be said of other early access games. Low-end machines such as mine will handle this wonderfully, and the game is an excellent means of killing time. While cooperative play is widely requested, the developer has stated that he isn't interested in developing the netcode required; he is, however, planning to add a campaign mode of sorts, as well as official support for modding. Think of it as a hybrid between Unturned and Battlefield. As it stands, I heartily recommend this little gem to anyone that doesn't mind somewhat repetitive play and meathead fps gameplay, or simply to people like myself that enjoy fps games but doesn't want to deal with an obnoxious online community. With any luck, we'll soon see some complex squad command systems (the only area in which I find this game sorely lacking.)"

Thank you SteelRaven7 and thank you, Ravenfield community!"
,Recommended,636480,31882338,Posted: 21 May,all,87Oscar87,"What is Ravenfield?Well, it's a fun FPS akin to the Battlefield series except without the multiplayer. There is no class system, fun physics and limitless bots (you can change the amount(s)). It is also only made by one developer, Johan Hassel A.K.A Steelraven7.PriceI have been playing the Beta versions before this, from Beta 3, however they were free from itch.io and Gamejolt. The game was originally a physics engine test, however ultimately became a top-notch game. Since Beta 5 (you can still get this for free), a lot has changed. Not quite £10.99 worth, but still a lot.WeaponsThere is many weapons, including real-world knockoffs like the RK-44 (AK47) and BIL Scalpel (Javelin Missile). There is also kicking, however that limits the melee (except the wrench) (you will die before this, however). There is also four secret weapons:Airhorn, HMG, Hydra and Patriot which can all be found on Temple, Island, Dustbowl and Archipelago respectively.VehiclesThere are many vehicles. The quad-bike, the helicopter (virtually unchanged since initial release except heli controls), the boat, the jeep (now with HMG) and the planes. Controls for flight are hard at the start, however they are simple after a couple hours. Also, I think it's simply if opted in Beta (I am (to do this just go to Ravenfield-properties-betas)), however they have added a new attack boat to Archipelago. This is a two-seater and includes an anti-air turret and a mortar (which is hard to use at the start but better later.GamemodesThere are multiple gamemodes, the in-dev Spec Ops (new) in which it is permadeath and you just have to eliminate the opposition. Point Match (original gamemode) where you have to accumulate a certain number of points more than the opposition and Battalions, which I shall not spoil. Unfortunately, Assault Mode has been removed since the Beta so I hope that is added back.MapsThere are four maps; Island, which is a small island with no planes and only a few anti-air guns; Dustbowl, a massive map with all vehicles except boats and is just amazing; Temple, which is very close-range and barely any vehicles (except 1 tank, I believe) and Archipelago, a large aircraft carrier and small island. Recently, Johan has added a new Archipelago. This is much better, with the one-flag aircraft carrier, single-flag small island and a large island with a bridge connecting to a slightly smaller one. This is much better than the old one, which, if you want to, is still for use.SettingsThere are other settings, such as night mode, team (Eagle is blue, Raven is red), controls, etc.How Could Hassel Improve?Well, first off, add assault mode back. I loved that. Second, add back the golden wrench. Also, make wrenches more useful. All they can do is fix standing HMGs and Anti-Air turrets.Final Score8/10 for now. Very promising and after about 6/18/etc months (and with workshop support which hopefully is soon) this can become one of the best singleplayer FPS-es I, and others, have ever played.P.SAlso, a campaign is supposed to be added soon. That's a plus."

It's a little lengthy but feel free to read if you would like a longer form review for this game.----It's too bad Steam has the simplified Y/N Recommendation system, especially for games like Ravenfield. If you're spending $15 on this game now, you'll probably find that the game doesn't quite meet the content you'd excpect at that price, though it does have enough to dig your feet in -- 3 maps and a preview of a 4th, a handful of weapon choices, two game modes (which don't really play that much differently from each other), and a few customization options like how many bots you want added, how you want the teams balanced (bot distribution), a respawn timer, and an option to reverse the teams' starting points or switch your own team. There's also a Day/Night option (with night-vision goggles) which makes for a fun variation to play with.What you are getting for you money however, and you'll see this right away -- is a game with absolutely massive potential for fun and replayability. When you open the game, you'll be met with a very pleasant sight -- a grayed-out ""Coming Soon!"" button for a Mods section. When you get yourself into this game you'll see quickly why this button will potentially unlock a huge world of various time settings, landscapes, game types, and more if a community grows from this game.The game is simplistic, easy and quick to jump into, and all-around perfectly made for a game you can throw on and start playing in 30 seconds. By far, my favorite feature in the game is the Slow Motion feature. This is so cool when you are playing some great music in the background, it looks GREAT and it can be like controlling your own frag movie in real time with how you switch back and forth from slow motion and regular.What I love about this game so far also is that you can tell the single player only feature is actually what will make a lot of things about the game shine and give it potential for features that simply would not work in a multiplayer setting. The slow motion is an example of this, there is no timer or powerup needed, you can use it for any duration and there's no cooldown, which is exactly how I want it. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff and you can control everything yourself -- if you want to only allow yourself to use it for 3 seconds, use it for 3 seconds! If you want to use it for 5 minutes straight, go for it! All the choices are yours and you can make the game as easy as you want or as difficult.The bots on Challenging are good enough. They're decently quick and if they run in a group it's easy to get overrun. They're pretty accurate from far distances too. You can use Slow Motion to dodge bullets, as the bullets in this game are not instant point-click-laserbeam, they have velocity and move (what looks to me) almost slightly slower than regular bullets. This means you have to lead shots from far away which adds an extra challenge to keep you wanting to improve your game. Alot of the bots get stuck in places and will repeatedly get stuck in those places after dying, so that will have to get fixed.The vehicles are pretty good, a little bit plain though and they feel more like World War II era vehicles (next to modern guns which is weird). The mechanics of them are really good, I think I might just suck♥♥♥♥♥with the helicopter but it does feel a little bit unstable, I can't seem to get it to hover, but that might definitely just be me.I love the guns. It's a great start, not sure if they plan to make more (it'd be cool if they did!) but it gives you a basic multiplayer FPS layout of guns with a variety ranging between shotguns and revolvers to snipers and assault rifles. The explosives are a lot of fun and were a great addition. The scalpel is really cool, especially in Slow Motion!It didn't take very long at all for me to eat through most of the content this game offers, but it has enough for me to have gotten enough playtime and enough enjoyment to definitely make the $15 worth it, and I am REALLY looking forward to seeing where this game's future is. If more and more content, maps, weapons, game modes, and mods come into the picture -- this could very easily be a game I continue to play for years to come.P.S. I recommend turning on the ""beta branch"" for the time being -- Right click in Library --> Properties --> Beta. This will get you a head start on the new features the developer is working on. For example, right now there is a newer version of the Archipelago level that really opens things up, one new gun, a whole new awesome type of vehicle (a warship with a beastly mortar that is a ton of fun to play), and some mechanics updates. If you want to get extra/newer features and don't mind a rougher edge on some of them (which doesn't seem noticeable) this option is for you."

Great time waster. Literally every battle can turn out differently even with the same setup, so you cannot guess the result. Would want to see the bots improved though, especially the bots of your team. I mean literally every time you are winnning in a game the bots will just start spawning at the farthest point possible (half o f the times it's the original spawn point) and defending it for no reason, while the reds take every point they can and win. 4/5.

The idea is really cool! Although 15 dollars is a little expensive i still do recommend buying! The game does not have much bugs and I have never seen an game like this before! I really look forward for future updates!Oh yeah Steelraven7 if you read this i had an 2 little ideas for the game! It would be really cool that you could press a button to jump out of your chair in an helicopter/plane and fall down with an parachute! That could make it look really cool when you shoot down an helicopter/plane and then seeing those people dropping with their parachutes! My other idea was that it would be cool that you can land with planes! I have tried to land with a plane but it didnt really work!And i found a bug that you could maybe fix! I see that you can lean with Q and E and bots can do that too which is really cool! But its weird that they sometimes go and lean as example in the barracks in their own base... Maybe you could fix that?

I played it for a few hours and never grew tired of it. For a game in alpha that was just released, I was surprised that I didn't run into any bugs and it ran smoothly. I LOVE the Slo-Mo mode where you can slow time and kill larger groups with ease when you are outnumbered. This game reminds me of my days playing Serious Sam on the XBOX.Cons:Wish there could have been a few more vehicles, but hey its only been out a few weeks. Same thing with maps. The rag doll physics when swimming is silly but frustrating. It took a while to get back to land when my helicopter crashed. It's young and in Alpha, so if thats a game breaker for  you, go in with that knowledge before hand.PS: apparently 1 guy made this entire game! Kudos to you sir and thanks for the fun."

Game.I've been playing this game since it was in Beta 4 on itch.io, and it's been my go-to game for when I'm bored since then--and that is said as an absolute compliment! There are so many things I like about the game: it's simple, it's singleplayer, it's got a ton of stuff to do, it's still in development (more on that later), and it's so, so fun. I will play this game for hours, and never get bored. There's so many combinations of things to do that you never get bored. When you get tired of flying planes you start sniping. When you get tired of sniping, you run with the Patriot (my personal favorite gun). And when all else fails, you start killing your teammates with rockets and grenades!Now, I've seen on the Community page of the game that many people think the game isn't worth $15. And I will be honest: in its current state, it's not. But it's Early Access, which means it's an investment. You buy it now for, admittedly, too much, and you get to play it through its development until it's worth as much as you paid for it, and often times more. I love Early Access games, especially with developers like SteelRaven7, who is constantly updating the game. I truly believe that this game will one day be worth more than $15, so I had no issue paying that much for it now--I bought it without hesitation the day it came out on Steam.Now, nobody can argue that the game is perfect right now. Go to the Community page and you'll see post after post of bugs, glitches, mistakes, and possible improvements for the game. Off the top of my head, right now, I can probably think of several dozen things this game needs to have no be cosidered anywhere near complete: more maps, more game modes, modding, a Campaign Mode, better AI, more weapons, more detailed maps, countless tiny details to improve general gameplay---plus a ton of bug fixes. But the great thing is that SteelRaven7 has already said he would address many of these things. Archipelago is costantly being updated to be better, along with the other maps, and almost every week a bug fix comes out. It just takes time.So if you're reading this now, and are considering purchasing the game, just do it. I guarantee that you won't regret it. If your patient and enjoy this type of game, you will have a ton of fun playing it. And also: don't pirate the game. That's not cool. It's $15, and if you want it that bad, just buy it legally. SteelRaven7 is the only developer--one person!--who is making this game, and he has spent so much time and energy doing so. If you want the game to go anywhere, get the game from Steam, and save yourself the headache of getting a virus in the proccess. And good luck fighting those pesky reds!  :)"

I quickly bought Ravenfield early access once I saw it. I see lots of space for improvement on this game but love it already. A workshop for this game would be excellent. I see this game as more of a Garry's Mod type game, pretty fun as a standalone but a lot funner and whole with workshop mods. I love this game and, as a lot of other people say, it's a big time-killer. I recommend this game for starting gamers since not only is it cheap, but it shows a lot of aspects for other games and, to be honest, helped get a lot better at mosft first-person shooters. Excellent job, Raven."

76561198059031285,Recommended,636480,32180722,Posted: 4 June,all,Pearson_Realize,"Honestly, one of my favorite games I have right now, (and I have a lot of games.)Lets start off with the fact that it's early access. Right now, it has four large maps, 3 modes, about 7 weapons (including an assault rifle, snipers, shot guns, smg's, etc) 3 different anti-vehicle weapons, a couple types of grenades, and some support items like medpacks, ammo packs, and night vision goggles. It also has vehicles (planes, helis, tanks, a 4 wheeler, a jeep w/ a gun on it, and boats) as well as an anti-aircraft and anti-infantry emplacement. There are also a few different amplifiers you can set such as night, no vehicles, and whatever reverse mode is. This alone is a decent amount of content, but the maps can get pretty boring. However, soon the (single) developer of this game will be adding mods (which will be AMAZING,) a campaign, and new weapons.Pros*Simple yet fun gameplay, easy to understand, no tutorial*The ability to toggle slow-motion whenever you want, letting you take out a group of enemies with ease*Game amplifiers*Variety of weapons*Variety of vehicles and emplacements*Growing communityCons*Only four maps, can get repetitive quickly*No multiplayer, which isn't THAT important to me, but still*helicopter and plane controls are definitely hard to understandNow, I do think the price point should be a little lower, maybe 12 or 10 dollars, but its only one developer so I can understand. Of course, as the game gets more content, I can definitely see 15 dollars being a low cost. One thing I think would be awesome (and would even pay for them in the future as DLC's) is taking different movies and making them into the game. Think about how cool it would be to gun down xenomorphs running at you, or killing rebels or stormtroopers abord a star destroyer. The possibilities for that type of stuff is limitless, really.The lack of mulitplayer is kind of a downside, and it would be cool to have it.As I read through the negative reviews, I saw that most of them were for the price being too high, lack of content (what did you expect from an early access game?) and no multiplayer. If you are into singleplayer and simple games, I'd recommend it.Things I want added*more weapons*more maps*more vehicles*more teams, that would be AMAZING*better AI*more difficulties (the game has only 2)*simpler controls for vehicles*multiplayer or at least co-op"

I stumbled apon this little masterpiece while browsing the store for some new games the day it came out. And i'm so glad it did come out, because this game is GREAT. I'm not a big fan of only multiplayer games to be honest, so this why this game really hits the spot. It gives you MOMENTS. That epic moment when you bust into a room in slow motion, firing your AK-47, like your the coolest guy in the world. Ravenfield gives you those moments. It has a few weapons and maps, but it is in early access so I understand that. I love the fact that there is no pay to win type of stuff, it's just you, your team, the enemy and GUNS. Now if you want a ton of content check on this game a bit later, because mods and a campaign are coming. It's a good adition to your library, and worth the money.Overall this game is great and I hope you have a great time.Oh, and I love the easter eggs, there are great:)Thanks for reading my review, happy hunting!"

I cant wait until this game is fully Updated.I have some recomendations, however GET THE REDS OFF THE BOAT ON ARCHIPELAGO!! MAKE THEM SPAWN ON LAND. Ok with that out of the way. How cool would it be to have  naval assault map. Another request please Add Campaighn and AI  Commanding before all the workshop integration crap.

Then beta 5 came out, added some pretty cool features, and then nothing really happened after that. I did however notice that the game was on Steam Greenlight. I thought that was pretty cool as well. Still, nothing happened. Then, I found out that Ravenfield had been Greenlit. The following day, Paulsoaresjr uploaded a video about it. I bought the game soon after the release, since I knew it was great in the betas, I have only invested 1 hour so far in the Steam Early access version, but I have invested much more time in the betas. I know this game will amount to great things in the future, and it already is taking multiple steps in the right direcion.If you're thinking of buying this, and you're trying to figure out if it's worth it, you need to ask yourself, whether you are interested in supporting the developer so they can add more features, and deal with a few occasional bugs (which I have only found 1 so far, plus, it's early access, and every early access game will have bugs.)Anyway, I reccomend this game to people who are fans of shooters, that can provide lots of fun in the future.(Keep in mind, new features are coming soon, such as the spec ops game mode, and the campaign mode)You can have a lot of fun with this game.

The animations are really well done and very fluid, it's like a minimalistic battlefield. I would post some ideas/criticism about it, but the game is so early on and the developer already has tons of people suggesting things to add or bugs. My thoughts (which I'm sure have been said before) are things like gestures for the AI to follow you, get in your car/tank, drop ammo packs, etc. And of course customization. Changing things like your body armor to effect your weight (Like Insurgency) and speed. Also for weapons, different sights, mag sizes, stocks, you get the point. However the weapons you already have are well done. Other than some missing features and controls, this game is perfect."

76561198135263843,Recommended,636480,31926625,Posted: 23 May,all,Mega Milk,"I should preface by saying that there's a free version you can download from the developer's website. It doesn't have as much content, but it's very much the same game, with a lot of the same features. I've played it a lot, and have had hundreds of bots and explosions and♥♥♥♥♥♥ but have never encountered a low frame rate/lag. This game, on the other hand, i can't run more than 30 bots on, without a maximum of 20 fps. So, basically, if your computer's not a gaming computer, or much of one, you may not be able to play this very well, in which case i'd suggest you instead download the free version. That having been said, the (ridiculously) poor optimization in comparison to the free version is one of my only two complaints, the other is that there isn't much content for a $15 game. That's not much of a problem though, since it's in early access, so I wouldn't worry about it.Overall, TL;DR, Ravenfield is a great game if you think your computer can run it, even though it has poor optimization in comparison to its free counterpart. I'd recommend itEdit: Launched the game in not-fullscreen mode, and it works fine, not really sure what's up with that."

76561198162236961,Recommended,636480,33028491,Posted: 30 June,all,Eapple1145,"By playing thisBattlefield gamemodern singleplayer FPS game, you get a true sense of being one in a hundred. The entire map is just filled with fairly smart AI, in groups or by themselves, hunting down the enemy. You never feel like an overpowered singularity, as you have the same weapons and vehicles as everyone else, and that's what makes it feel more immersive.You aren't being shouted at by 8 year olds or raging through a microphone calling hax on the other team, everyone is AI and the game itself isn't even rage inducing, at least in my experience.The best thing about this is that the map is just small enough so that you can see every individual plane, helicopter, and boat, all raining hell upon the field. However, the map is also just small enough so that it doesn't take an impossibly large amount of time to traverse half of it by foot or face another enemy group. It's just all out war, you're rarely not shooting or getting shot at, everything feels so intense, especially with planes.When I drive a plane, I simply get so into it, I can see all the action below me as bullets rain from above and below, while chasing down another plane just to get shot down by an AA turret. There's just enough content to make it a time-killer, whether it be short 20 minute matches, or 300-man hour long wars.As of right now, the amount of weapons are limited, bugs and glitches still happen, the AI sucks with boats, there are only 3 different maps, and the vehicles are constantly changing and getting rebalanced.But hey, the AI is flipping amazing at piloting planes, has just the right balance of accuracy, mis-fires, and range, are able to spread out and path among the map almost similar to a real player, are great at defending, and are funny to shoot in the head when they steal that helicopter gunner spotTHAT YOU REALLY WANTED BECAUSE THE AI JUST COULDN'T BE HUMBLE AND LEAVE IT TO YOU WHEN THE MATCH IS CLOSE TO AN END AND YOU WANT TO GUN DOWN EVERY REMAINING POSSIBLE SPECK OF ENEMY BLOOD!!"

,Recommended,636480,32358819,Posted: 11 June,all,WONTON,"10/10 Gameplay, excited for its future.So far this is one of the most fun games I've played on Steam.I even voted for this to be on the Steam Store while it was in Greenlight and I still stand by that. Considering the fact that it's still Early Access and provides so much variety of things to do with an alright AI shows that this game is gonna go far in the future.I enjoy how the soldiers actually work togetherand tend to be in groups, while some may decide to stray off from the rest and flank from another route. Because of this, and how you can even pair up with them in a few select vehicles, allows for many interesting battles and games. One simple move by joining your fellow soldier in an attack helicopter can open up an objective for the rest of your team to take, which can help you begin securing the rest of the map.The choice of weapons and secret unlockable ones you can find around the map are very sufficient at this point of development.I'm impressed especially at how even your own teammates as well as the opposing team will have different weapon choices. One of my favorite moments of this is when I joined a crew of soldiers inside of a jeep, and as we got out at an objective, I was equipped with a scoped rifle(you are prompted to select your loadout every time you die, if not you just can choose from the captured points your team has and spawn there), and my other teammates either had regular rifles, or had something for suppressing fire and or to take out vehicles. It just makes the battles really interesting since they'll change every time.The fact that you can even change some variables to suit your next experience in a match allows for less repetitive gameplay.Before you start up a map, you are given the option of a team to join, whether you want it to be day or night time, if you want vehicles or not, reverse mode (not sure what that does), and a slider to decide how you want the teams balanced (more or less soldiers on a team). There are also 2-3 gamemodes, however I haven't really tested them out besides the normal one, in which you try to take all of the capture points. The scoring is based off of total team kills, and every kill is one point, unless you have multiple captured objectives, which then is multiplied by how many you have.(Ex: 1 kill with 2 objectives is 2 points, 1 kill with 4 is 4 points.)Because of these simple things, you can pretty much change how you want to play the map. I personally enjoy messing around with it a lot, like making one team have tons of soldiers and see how long we can hold them off, or making it night time and attempting tactical takes of objectives.At this point in development, I would strongly reccomend purchasing this game at any time.This is an excellent game if you need to waste time, or just play it for hours on end. To me a game like this won't get old, especially since the solo developer (huge props to SteelRaven7 for doing this alone) is planning on adding a Campaign Mode, as well as Mod Support for the community to create their own maps and other modifications. There really isn't anything I would change at this point, besides the lock on for the heat-seeking missiles. There are occasions where I'd like to lock onto a specific attack boat, however it decides to automatically lock onto another one, which may be completely empty or going in a different direction. This isn't really much of an issue, but it would be nice to select it (unless there's a feature I'm missing). Besides that, the missiles work amazingly, and aren't too OP since I've seen planes and helicopters out-maneuver them.You will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED if you get this game, I rate it 10/10 and I will support the developer fully throughout the entire process. You have done an amazing job so far Raven! Keep up the amazing work! :)"

This allows you a simple but fun experiance. This game reminds me of the orginal Star Wars: Battlefront with large battles centered around command posts. There are enough guns to keep you satisfied for now, and with mod support I'm not worried about a lack of content.

I'm not gonna harshly judge this game like I would others cause this game literally came out 2 or 3 months ago. It's very early in development. And for this game only have one developer (yes, there's only one guy working on this), it's a nice game. This is one of those games where you make the game what it is. You can say ""oh this game is boring and monotonous"" or you have a complete blast and say this is the best game you've ever played. Overall this game chugging along quite nicely. There's a little youtube communtiy for it, and the modding commuinity is starting to show what's possible in this game. SteelRaven7 seems to have a solid roadmap for where he wants this game to go.So time for my opinion, if there was a middle thumb on steam, that's what I would've put it as. It's a good game no doubt. But sometimes, I don't know if this is just me, but I feel like I could be playing other games. I'm not really sure why I feel this way about it. But if I see a map that catches my eye or an update comes out. I'll get on and see what there is to see. and then go play another game. I'm not saying that this game doesn't have enough content. I'm just say that when I'm staring at 10-12 other games, this wouldn't be my first pick.If you wanna get it, catch it on sale and give it a go. If your playing on a ""family"" or school computer, or just can't play M games and are tired of playing browser games or can't seem to find anything else. Then for sure grab this one, it'll be worth it. As for me, I've got a nice desktop, so like I said earlier this wouldn't be my first choice when I log on"

Don't let the graphics fool you, the gameplay more than makes up for it. From tropical islands, to dusty deserts, this game lets your childhood fantasies of playing with toy soldiers run wild. The best part in my opinion is the abilty to download some awesome community made maps from the Steam Workshop. The base game gives you a few, but the Workshop can easily double or even triple the number of maps you can wage war upon. All in all, really good game despite the occasional bug here and there.

,Recommended,636480,34104490,Posted: 8 August,all,Small Bear,"The main issue I have with the game (and I'm sure it will be fixed) is how scripted everything feels at times. For example, whilst I was flying a plane on Archipelago, I noticed the same two speed-boats (1 Raven, 1 Eagle) crashing into each other in the middle of the water. The AI on both sides clearly kept respawning, getting into a speed-boat and following the same path; inevitably colliding with one another in the open water.Another example is when I captured Reef on Archipelago, my teammates respawned from the same (but different) locations and followed the same path toward the bridge. At this point a speed-boat belonging to the opposing team came crashing in to reclaim the Reef and all of my teammates on the bridge turned to kill them. Then an enemy tank came and killed most of us before being destroyed. Teammates respawn in the same (but different) locations, run toward the bridge, enemy boat crashes in, they run back, kill them, tank confronts them at the flag, most die, blah blah blah.It's frustrating because I want to be able to have an impact on the game by playing well.I've also noticed (playing as Raven this time) we were losing on Temple despite controlling 3/5 or at times 4/5 outposts. Even if it comes down to kills we were clearly dominating? On the other hand, when playing as Eagle I noticed quite often we're losing badly, but it turns around and we start winning? Nothing really changes, though. I kind of feel as though perhaps this done so the player feels ""oh wow, we were so close to losing! What a comeback!""I don't know... I've played the game for 2 hours and I've noticed all of this, so.However: fun, good range of weapons, reminds me of Halo: Combat Evolved multiplayer or the old Battlefield games. Basically my all time favourites."

I would especially reccomend the Dogfight map by Campister, it's basically why I am still playing the game. I am liking the direction of development from Steelraven for Ravenfield, and I think it will be positive. The game is buggy, but the somewhat stupid AI makes for great moments.If you like multiplayer, and plan on purchasing this game for its possible future implementation, don't get your hopes up. We're certainly not getting multiplayer servers but LAN mp may be possible.In conclusion. If you like ♥♥♥♥ing around this game is for you. The original maps are decent, I'd reccomend Island.

You'll forget you are not playing humans...the AI is surprisingly cunning. I have played everything from Doom, Quake,  Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Half Life, Tribes, along with Unreal Tournament and way too many to list here...but this Ravenfield is simple to pick up and play and just an all out deathfest at times that I find keeps my interest. I should say that, years ago, I got a bit burned out from playing fps all the time and I haven't really got into those type games for a while. For some odd reason, when I saw the trailer for this game I just bought it. I am not disappointed. Old school shooter with excellent maps and many diff types of helo's, jeeps, planes, ships and tanks...and even ATV's and Kodiak(tm) rubber assault rafts can be controlled by the player. There's more weapons and stuff, so I won't make a huge list, but the standard fare (plus) is available...M-16's, AK-47's, silenced side arms, grenades, Stinger AA weapons, RPG's, etc. I definitely recommended this to my friends and they enjoy it."

Much like Battlefront II it is very fun to obliterate armies of idiot bots, and if you play sniper wookies can't ♥♥♥♥ing walk in front of you when you fire or obstruct your shots.  It is an early access game and is definitely worth the $15.My only complaint is the spawnpoints, they are the same as the flags you cap, meaning if the flag you're spawning is being cap'd, you just die.  It is infuriating, especially because of explosives.  There have been many a time I die, respawn, die, respawn, die and respawn just to lose 70 health.Really, thats it.  If you like singleplayer FPSs it is a must buy.  Expect to be trashed by bots, except for the most part your deaths are likely deserved and can't really be explained by OP bots, considering this is Unity they're fairly well made.  If you decide to buy it, good on you."

,Recommended,636480,35195903,Posted: 24 September,all,Someguy539,"It is a ok game. The bots are problematic, as they will lose the game and waste ammo to kill you. The bot's accuracy is amazing (not a good thing in my opinion). Also the bot's guns will oftern glitch through the bot to kill you. The bots will always kill you when you are on the ground because they know that your still alive whilst you rarly tell wheather they are alive or not. One last problem with the bots (enemy) is the fact that they stay on the ground just long enough for you to turn around and kill another bot. This in my opition ruins the game in a way because it means you (if you are not in good cover) will be easly killed by a bot that tricks you into thinking that is it dead. Another problem is you stay on the ground for  a fraction of the time of what a bot does. I like the fact that it uses funny graphics. It is also very hard to capture things in the game (which makes it more fun) Also the game is very funny and rediculous. All in all I personally think that it is a good game, with some problems that are expected in early access game."

Since the release there has been, new weapons, a new vehicle, better AI, a command feature, improvement on vehicle stats and AI, custom map making, and weapon modding so dont think that its the same game as when it first came out. I hope that this developement goes for a much longer time, and I hope for more updates, custom vehicle modding and more.

Once Workshop was added, these maniacs started churning out weapons and maps like madman; and they are great to boot; so Ravenfield has an incredible future ahead for itself just based off the community involvement already.Absolutely worth full price, worth supporting, worth watching, worth enjoying; it's straight to the point fun, FPS action and you end up in some crazy situations constantly; tank shells whizzing over head, jeeps jumping over you, all in slow motion when you want; it's fantastic, I love it.Really looking forward to where this title goes, between the dev and the modders.Twenty stars up."
