76561197991505382,Recommended,636970,32086584,Posted: 31 May,all,mshagg,"This is a day one review, so take that as is appropriate.  I will certainly revise it as the game develops.There's a lot to like about the game - it has shipped with a tonne of content - lots of maps, lots of unique weapons to choose from and some very large scale battles to be had.Visuals are excellent and the sound design is on point.  Performance for the better part is good, although in very busy scenes i experienced some fairly heavy reprojection (with a 1080Ti and a 5930k).  This of course can be resolved by scaling back the number of active NPCs, but in doing so you lose a component of the game's appeal, which is the large, hectic battles.The weapon handing system is excellent and will serve the game well into its future development.  Heavy weapons feel heavy, light weapons feel light, and they play out rather differently on the battlefield.My key gripe is the actual fighting mechanics, which is a bit of a problem given that's the raison d'etre of the game.  There seems to be little ryhme or reason to how hits are dealt with.  Most of the time when I hit someone with a sword they stumble back as if I've just shoved them with a shield - the stumbles being more like a sudden warp rather than movement which looks like a reaction to having any force imparted upon the opponent, and regardless of the direction they were facing or efforts to block the attack.  Direct hits dont seem to be a function of skill or weapon placement and feel somewhat random.  As a result an effective strategy as any is to simply approach groups of opponents swinging your sword back and forth.  It just doesnt feel particularly rewarding.This is amplified in really large battles when you have a lot of soldiers to deal with - paradoxically I felt the gameplay was better with fewer numbers of opponents.The gameplay does improve significantly when you issue commands effectively and have fellow soldiers picking off opponents with arrows and javelins, although often I find myself dealing with a 5 on 1 situation with no idea where the lads have all run off to.I dont want to be too critical, as the game is incredibly ambitious and it is a very unique experience.The command system could benefit from some visual cues, particularly as it's a combination of trigger and a soft press on  a quadrant of the touchpad, which doesnt have the sort of haptic feedback you get when 'clicking' the touchpad.  Perhaps some colour feedback on the blue highlight rings could give you an indication of the order you are about to give.I am somehwat hesitant to to recommend the game given my views on the fighting mechanics, but have done so given the overall state it is in on day one of its early access journey.  Hope to see the dev continue to improve on the feeling of the core fighting mechanics rather than content (given there is already a lot of conent in the game).   The asking price is at the higher end of the early access scale and I think the player base will have fairly high expectations.At the end of the day it's a fun game and im looking forward to hacking some serious hours away in it."
,Recommended,636970,32156996,Posted: 3 June,all,"Disastro, Often MVP.","This is a really great combat system, especially for Early Access (and I do hope it improves). This is the best medieval fighting, and the closest thing there is to Chivalry or Mount and Blade in VR right now. That said, despite the numbers of enemies and very reasonable selection of environments it's at its core, a very shallow game at the moment. Furthering the Single Player, or the addition of Multiplayer should change this so it's absolutely one to watch, and if you're keen it deserves your support.Pros:The best Medieval fighting you can get in VR.Lag based weapon system feels robust.Mechanically, kitting up is great, switching your gear works a treat. Helps the fight feel like contains phases - e.g. your Archer phase, Sword and Board, and going HAM with an axe.Decapitations, sounds, music all great a fairly epic fight.Cons:Hitboxes are a bit inconsistent and I'm concerned with how this will translate to Multiplayer.I think it needs more deep Single Player before anything else - objectives, more enemy types.The minimum recommended specs are high, and they're pretty honest. It's a bit of a beast.I have to recommend it, but currently I don't think it's ""worth"" the money. The gameplay is just a bit shallow, and doesn't vary depending on the map you choose very much at all. Fundamentals are incredibly solid and this is a great game, but it's also expensive for what it is at the moment.Video review available here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pktXfa-3bU8"
,Recommended,636970,32111128,Posted: 1 June,all,Moon,"This should be an instant buy for me if not for the fighting mechanics, the first demo didn't show the real shining part of this game: allowing hundreds of units fight against each other under your command. Dev has updated demo to show the full battle after that, try it!It is a simulator of medieval war, not medieval martial art. The hitbox and damage registration in this game is not so satisfying, but neglectable when the fight scale up to 100+ solders. AI is quite decent in such a chaotic battle field, and the background music is great. Once you learn how to control your troops, that part become very easy and intuitive. Dev has added movement speed option and onward style movement in the new version so I expect more player could find a way to deal with their motion sickness.on the other hand,  this game is more expensive than onward, sairento, vanishing realm,quivr and many other great vr games, so I expected to see more polished menu, tutorial and art/map design. Good news is that the dev is pretty active and response to community feedback. This game can grow into something huge if it can keep getting updates."

The combat feels great and realistic (although it still needs some tweaking)2.) The AI is great, it feels like the NPCs know what their doing3.) The maps look great, and they feel real4.) Lots of different maps5.) You can defend your castle, or you can attack one to try to take it6.) The developer is very active, and i'm pretty sure he has no life except for this game7.) The Developer takes every suggestion under consideration, and most end up in the game8.) You can command you troops with your voice, you set it up in the settings9.) Can customize how much of each troop is in each army, how many units on the field at a time, and how many each army hasNegatives1.) Lag, lots of lag with bigger battle2.) Unit control feels weird at first3.) Throwing things like axes, and spears, is very hard to get used to, i still haven't gotten the hang of it4.) The throwing spear people are a pain, i just turn them off5.) Still has lots of bugs (but these are getting fixed very fast)Overall, this game is worth the money, but if you don't trust it enough to spend $30, there is a great demo that shows off the game, and you can see if your PC can handle it."

It’s early-access, but getting better every day, with an active dev, an experience offering tons of gameplay already and a full campaign plus multiplayer on the horizon.At some point quickly, after playing for a bit, you will find yourself sweating, weapon in hand, standing over the bodies of your enemies and realize how awesome this game is. Still unsure? Try the free demo. Do it!Long Version:A Mongolian general once turned to a Cimmerian and asked, “Conan, what is best in life?”Conan responded, “To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentation of their women.”Tales of Glory is what is best in life. Command 100’s of troops in a massive, sprawling, medieval battle with voluptuous variety of weapons from which to arm yourself. Pick your favorite arms, tell your troops what to do, and wade in to the absolute BEST massed melee combat experience for VR.Similar games: Mount and Blade, Dynasty Warriors, Tiger Knight, but in first person VR!Notes:-100’s of npcs in a battle requires a decent PC, especially in early access, ymmv.-It’s early access so there are some bugs. Pathfinding can take a while (like lots of other, released, games), considering you are dealing with a large number of NPCS in large, detailed maps. There are sliders so you can adjust for optimal gameplay until optimization is finished.-Single player campaign is beta atm.-Multiplayer is planned, but not ready yet.All that being said, this is one of the most fun and immersive VR battle experiences, if you are cool with early access and your PC can handle the NPC load. Strap on your favorite weapon and write your own Tale of Glory!"
,Recommended,636970,32095941,Posted: 31 May,all,Kontur10,150+ active NPC fighting in VR is just a blast. But you'll need a decent rig to run it smooth (I don't even know if any CPU is capable to run it smooth at large scale battles). But I like this game even at it's current state.Pls notice - there is no single player campaign with story here right now.
,Recommended,636970,32167957,Posted: 3 June,all,Solid,"A very visceral midieval game. The battles are amazing and intense, and sword fighting is so much fun."
,Not Recommended,636970,34217761,Posted: 13 August,all,Crafty,"I could tell from the start that this game was rough around the edges, so I waited before buying into it.  Seeing that the developer is actively updating the title is what swayed my decision to purchase.  For me I think the thrill this game brings to the table was worth the price of admission.  However, it is that steep price of admission that prevents me from giving this a complete thumbs-up at this point.  It's buggy, and that's expected with an early access title. However, I'm finding that there are areas that are currently completely unplayable, and maybe I don't understand the underlying problems, but the frustration it brings to the game should not be present at this price point.  So I do not recommend it for the average frugal gamer, but not for the reasons others have stated.  I am not affected by motion sickness, so I could ride that horse all day.  I'm not seeing much in the way of framerate loss, except in really big close-quarters battles, but if it were an issue, the game allows you to decrease the activity level and graphics quality to compensate.  I do not recommend it for the current price, and for the reasons below.  Lower the price, or fix the following issues, and I will happily change my stance.First and foremost, the in-map menu (which I stumbled upon) only allows you to exit to the main screen.  It should also allow for an options change.   I loaded three custom maps today and was stuck on the opening screen in each case.  Castle Siege - Stuck in Tent, Docks - Stuck on boat, Forest - Stuck in Tent.  So, in all three cases, I could not progess, and I could not escape.  So I had to force close the game and start over.  At the time I didn't know about the popup exit menu (not in the tutorial).  Maybe changing to another form of locomotion would have allowed me to escape the tent prisons, but didn't have access to the options.  An in-map menu with some options would help if the underlying bugs can not be corrected easily.  For instance, give is a clipping option, so we can get unstuck if a respawn point puts you in a bad place.  Currently, there are at least three maps that are unusable, that a switch like that would allow us to use.  I doubt I'm the only one experiencing that.Controller issues.  I sometimes find that the controllers temporarily switch roles.  Where the right controller will start affecting movement, but only partially.  It's weird.  I have also had problems inadvertantly summoning the horse by accidentally hitting the left menu button.  The horse was ""parked"" outsidet he castle, and suddenly I was riding him inside a tower.  You should only be able to mount the horse when you are near it.   Just a frustration, but character control in general needs some work.  Another annoyance is if you hit the System button while in-game and then return, the orientation is messed up and you need to restart.  That may only be a Vive thing.Giving orders is a pain, there has to be an easier way.  Since I'm using a Vive, the touch sensor and trigger combo is difficult in the heat of battle.  I do like being able to single out your men and give them individual orders, but when trying to coordinate the group it gets crazy.Gameplay itself is fun, and after completing a map I feel like a badass.  The AI and animations are done very well.  The feeling of being in the chaos of battle is conveyed nicely.  For me that was worth the price.  I would however suggest adding either an equipment area where the character can equip their weapons before going into a battle map, or allowing the player to select a start timer for the battle, so that you could equip the character and set up your troops before the enemy attacks.  It's too rushed right now.  It would also be nice to see statistics after a battle. Number of kills, men lost, etc.  It just ends and nothing that was accomplished is recorded anywhere.  Each battle is a new battle.The custom battle option is great, and if the ""battle bugs"" are cleared up it can help to keep the game feel fresh.  I see there is work being done on a campaign mode, but it doesn't appear to be anything more than a world map at this point.  That would be nice if the devs could get a story behind it.  I would then change my recommendation.  I would also like to see a battle map editor where we could design our own battlefield in sandbox fashion.  Either a campaign or a sandbox would keep me coming back, the custom battle as it stands only has limited replayabliity and is not worth the price.In conclusion, this game is a great VR experience, but for the price it needs to be more than just an experience.  For any interested buyers, I would suggest bookmarking this title and returning to it when it is slightly more polished.... or cheaper.  That being said, if you want the thrill of being in a battle with 200 other NPCs shouting battle cries, then you should buy this.  That makes it worth it for me."

Can't believe this is early access, as it already has a lot of polish too it.  ~13 Maps, all very different & very detailed environment.  Attacks castle, defend a castle under seige, pillage a village, etc.   Lots of weapon choices that all play differently, you can even tell the effect of different lenght swords. (Must be about 15 different swords alone)"
,Recommended,636970,33173135,Posted: 3 July,all,Arin,"I've never written a review before but felt compelled to give this game a bit of attention. It is, in short, an epic battle generator. I've had more moments of excitement in this one game over the last few days than I have with my VR setup in quite awhile. Just tonight - rushing up a hillside, I follow a fellow swordsman who raises his blade to bring it down upon a small cluster of enemy at the top. Before he can however - THUD! - he drops to his knees in front of me, an arrow notched in his head. I, two steps behind him, cut the archer down. It felt amazing. There's tons of variety in the adventures to be had. One might find themselves knocking one of their attackers off a bridge while ducking the swings of another. Or leaning down off a horse to lop the head off a pikesman.The developer is the most engaged one I've met. You'll regularly find them hanging out on the discord responding to and integrating suggestions for the future of the game. As it is now, it's admittedly a little rough around the edges. There's not much of a campaign to speak of yet and the easy selection of units still seems to evade me (Im using Oculus Touch controllers which may be part of the cause...) but what we have here is an amazing foundation for things to come. The animations, music and sound effects are brilliant and the graphics are crisp and believable. The sheer number of characters on-screen alone seems too good to be true.I can't wait to see where this one goes."

Feel so badass riding my horse up a steep hill, looking behind and seeing my soldiers following, then taking an angle on an enemy soldier ahead, swinging my axe, and ahhhhh off goes his head. Lots of battlefields, weapons, and options already. Work up a good sweat too. Movement takes a bit of getting used in the heat of battle (cord twists like crazy) and some things are still rough around the edges. But getting better by the day. I was actually surprised at how good it looked when I first tried the demo."

The developer is active and responsive, the game is highly replayable in its current state, and it is updated frequently. The combat needs a little bit of work to balance out the enemies and make the fighting more fluid, but overall I'd say Tales of Glory does a good job of making the experience of a large scale battle possible on VR. This is definitely a game to support and watch closely as it develops. Personally, I can't wait to see what else is in store."
,Recommended,636970,32261424,Posted: 7 June,all,Southpaw,"Tales of Glory offers a refreshing VR experience, it strays from the overdone wave shooters/zombies/unity asset flip garbage that has wormed it's way onto Steam. In it's current state, it is a ""medieval battle simulator"" allowing you to equip a variety of weapons and charge head first into massive battles. You can give orders to your team, capture areas, ride a horse, use 1h and two hand weapons, use siege weapons, fire bows and crossbows...the potential this game has is massive, and in my opinion is deserving of your support. The  developer is very active and responsive to the community. I really enjoyed my time playing the demo and bought the game. I've been enjoying customizing battles and seeing all the maps.This game does have a ways to go as far as polish and features. I'm really hoping for more physics in the game..such as reactive body movements when hit, ragdoll effects, weapon collision (like in Gorn). Controls can also be improved, giving orders to teammates is very clunky at the moment. I'd also like to see different game modes...but overall the foundation for a great game is there. Honestly I do think that the current price is a little high given the content that is in the game so far and the lack of polish/features. I highly recommend trying the free demo first as it gives a good overview of how the game plays."

I do reccomend this game if your system can handle it and your willing to put up with early access bugs.  I think the price is about 10-15$ to high.  I just bought witcher 3 and all expansions for less than this (on sale).    I do wish for this dev to recieve support tho and hopefully make this the vr mount and blade goto.To the dev-I found the combat to be without any sense of impact.The weapon weight and speed is great,  but often the weapons pass thru enemies, other weapons etc without and damage dealt or collision recognised.  My system was in constant reprojection,  heuristics points blame at my i7 2600 cpu.    really want to enjoy this game but at the moment i cannot due to limitations of fps and the frustrating lack of collision.  I'd like to be able to hold my spear out to keep a guy back,  but he can just walk thru it no problem.  also 2 handed weapons often have the wrong hand forward and the hands get all crossed when holding with both and trying to swing.i7 2600 gtx 1070.   constant reprojection,  even without any npc's. ** 90% other games run fine.  looks like im runnung into cpu bottle neck.  i love mount and blade and this is great,  but the price is too high and performance renders it unplayable for me.  ill buy it again maybe if things are improved down the road. good job anyhow"

However if you take it for what it is and thats an early access game that looks and feels like a Mount and Blade game in VR then this game is for you. The game has its issues but if you lower the number of bots in a battle it will run smoother and load quicker in game. I love grabing an axe and shield then throw myself into the thickest of the fighting and take off a few heads or arms...or legs... once you have a feel for the game its addicting not unlike mount and blade."

I knowticed that some of  tree's rotate with the HMD...the fix in unity that I have found is to hand place the tree's and not paint them on the landscape , thats seem to fix it when I was using the unity engine in VR, also I would make the tree's static with no movment that should help the frame rates... I have high end system with a Gtx 1080 and noticed frames as low as 40FPS, I have the same problem with high amounts of foilage using the unreal 4 engine in VRI'm not an expert with unity but I have used it, anyways keep up the good work !  and if you add multiplayer 5 on 5  kinda ""Onward "" style then Damn!"

If you turn on reprojection, it runs just fine on my 1080 even with 120 NPC's on the battle field at once. It is hard to describe just how amazing this is!! Full on massive battles. Like real warfare without all the actual dying and sadness. I wish it tracked stats, I'd love to see how many people I mowed down on my horse :)"

Th combat system is fluid and you can almost feel as if you are in the middle of the battlefield. The only cons are the somehow confusing control commands, especially when ordering several groups of soldiers; and some may find the horse riding a bit disorienting (which the game makes sure to alert you to in-game), other than that it is absolutely beautifful and it woule be even more amazing once vr headsets go untethered."
,Recommended,636970,33567577,Posted: 15 July,all,hentai.,"I am recommending this game. Some of what I will say may sound scathing but dear god, if you have the hardware for it, this game is fairly worth it and I think it will be even more worth it in the future. Yes, the price is steep. But I think the VR community should get more used to higher prices as we get higher quality games. Much in the vein of titles like Arizona Sunshine, this game is an actual game. It is a sandbox skirmish game but it is a real game, nonetheless. The problems it has do show but the good news is that they aren't problems with the core gameplay or the core mechanics. The main issues are technical. So, to preface...My Build:CPU - i7 6700k @3.6 GHzGPU - 1080 ti Founder's EditionRAM - 16gbThis game has crashed my pc twice.That's kind of a problem. I don't usually have Vive games crash, or any games for that matter, much less have them crash my pc. Now, the circumstances in which it crashes are hard to pin down but for the moment, I have to assume it's too many NPC's on the battlefield at one time. I will be lowering this number as is necessary (last time it crashed, I had 70 on at a time downed from 100)Second problem, it's a little clunky. Not very, once you're used to it, but it can feel pretty clunk. This is mainly due to the full body awareness the game has (which, gah, I'm glad it's there. Muh Immersion) clashing with the games inventory system. From what I can tell, you have place your equipment on your body according to where your headset is but sometimes the headset and the body of your character offset so you are really putting a left shoulder item on the characters back if you're looking left. Hopefully that makes sense. The game does a good job of keeping that out of the way as your body does turn with you most of the time but still, it's off putting.Lastly, the horseback riding is a little clunk. I'd like to see it change just a little bit. In my opinion, it'd be best to have the horse act slightly of its own accord. Not as in give it an AI but I'd like it to accelerate without me having to continuously keep my thumb on the track pad and maybe have to pull on reigns or something to stop it. I don't know. Not really an issue as the riding mechanics work but it's just a little niggle that I had a gripe about.All in all, the game is pretty solid. The melee feels fine enough, the bows and crossbows feel pretty good, if not again a bit clunk but mainly what you're getting out of this is a really, really solid battle sim. You'll feel pretty f***ing good walking a feel with your troops to meet the enemy on the other side."
