,Recommended,638200,33972241,Posted: 2 August,all,SquashedOrange,"YES!It is finally on steam. I have been playing this game (via CD) since I was in school.It is by far my favourite game. Business Schools such as Harvard use it.Be warned, it has quite a steep learning curve but once you get into it, its addictive and extremely fun. Certianly makes you think differently."
,Recommended,638200,33986414,Posted: 2 August,all,L. Armani,"This game is the most immersive business game, that isn't text based, I have ever played in my life. The stock market is so realistic, it's scary. When you need to have another screen on with Investopedia up for reference, you know it's real.  There is another, and much better, version of the game call Capitalism Lab that adds in subsidiaries, city economics, and politics via DLC's. Capitalism Lab has another DLC comming out about software/technology/e-commerce companies. The game also has support for player-made mods. 11/10 game.If you are not interested in business and learning more about it, this game is most definitly not for you. If you are, and have been looking for a very immersive experience to simulate real life to a tee, you have finally struck gold."

Of course, you will spend some time in tutorials section, but once an achievment of basic gameplay rules will be unlocked by you the real show will begin. Good luck with bargaining!"

Hundrets of hours spend ingame(before steam), trying to produce best engines, cars and motorcycle that everyone would want.  Or do you like socks? Or sofas? Coke? Or do you just want to be egg dominator? It's on you!It's not a simple game, so if you are simple minded don't bother. If you like challange, go for it!"

I had this on CD-ROM before it came to steam, and could not pass the opportunity to get it once again. If finance, accounting, marketing, stocks, and/or economics interests you in the slightest, you will be overjoyed to pick this up."
,Recommended,638200,34075812,Posted: 6 August,all,benedict cucumberbact,"i give a solid 75/100. i played this game 9 years ago, and this game is 16 years old, so you are to expect UI and graphics the standard of 16 years ago. the reason i am giving it a positive score at all is because it is truly a unique experience to play this. this is a game for people who want to be a millionair and learn to make even more. Recommend to buy it on sale tho, a 16 year old game shouldnt cost nearly as much.Gameplay :the game itself is quite simple, it all boils down to earning money, the depth of the game comes from the numbers themselves, there are so many factors that results in a profit or loss, some of them you can control while others are inevitable, there are so many ways to do it too, you want to invest in stock market? sure. you want to buy out all there competition? sure. you want to specialize in selling a single product out of the 100s? sure. you want to buy/sell property? sure. and the game ensures that every method you use is able to profit from that. however if you do mess up in investing into an area, you will feel the loss, that which makes it so entertaining to play, despite your millions of dollars you can still be left with nothing if you do not carefully plan your moves.Audio/UI/Graphics :i put this together because you have to understand its♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to what we have now, but it delivers what it needs, i was 12 when i played this and i manage to profit without knowing literally what 80% of the buttons and menu does.Replayability :highly replayable, you get to determine the game's win condition in custom games, the game have enough content to keep it interesting until two conditions are met, knowing how to solve the problems the game brings and knowing how the AI works. once you figure it out it becomes a little too easy.Price :i bought this for 2.5usd nine years ago, so i dont know why you're charging more now for a 16 year old game. i guess you're profitting off my nostalgia"
