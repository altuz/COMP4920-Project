76561197965334713,Recommended,638850,33327010,Posted: 6 July,all,NukSooKow,"It's Good!So, I am basically just going to assume that you have read the store page and have an idea of what this game is about. You should if you are here.My ExperienceSo I had watched some videos on Youtube earlier today and knew nothing about this game until today06/07/2017. I bought the game without any expectations and off I went. Right of the bat I felt intrigued to search about the starting area and get to grips with everything. All the usual things are there like the crafting, scavaging, slots on your character for clothing. You know the drill. The crafting menus need love as you can really only scroll from the top to the bottom at present. You also have your typical hunger, thirst, health and stamina management.Upon further investigation, I found what is like an underground science lab. Hmmm so? So this is the area where you can cure and tame animals. I am not going to waffle on about how you do all the different things, but this is the main feature (or so I believe) and how you go about building your reserve with different animals. The starting area contains your empty reserve with various different enclosures for you to start building up your collection. So far I rescued a dog and a Deer. From doing a liitle researching online, it seems there are different grade animals from common through to rare. Could be a lot of fun finding these?So, I went out and had a good roam around the starting area and collecting resources lying about as well as hacking trees and rocks etc. I managed to make some tools and also a construction bench which opens up the next tier of items you can build as well as crafting stations like a tannery and all that good stuff. The crafting menu grew massively from laying down that initial crafting station. I can only imagine the crafting options being insane once you get all the core stations in place. And there were lots! Maybe slightly overwhelming for some. From food, to clothing, to structures, to tools, weapons, furniture.....there's loads!I decided I wanted to just explore at this point. I had fun looking through all the structures in the starting area and gathering up all the materials I could find on the way. I even went for a look in the sea (seems almost empty other than weeds you can collect). I stumbled upon a ship on the shoreline and this is how you navigate from biome to biome. You click the portal and you are presented with a menu. Each box represents an area. Sorry about the pics. Taken on 3 screens.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=966398516http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=966445492http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=966445529There are quite a few places to go explore already, but based on those pics, this looks to be huge. My hope here is this becomes seamless rather than porting. I tried only one other area and the biome was completely different. This biome was more akin to the lands where Conan makes his stand (Conan the Barbarian - Battle of the Mounds) and the enemies were also very similar, though none on a horse back.That said, I felt like the identity of the game was confusing. We go from the lush starting area and into the next biome where the portal area has a helicopter to indicate the protal area rather than the previously mentioned boat, which sort fits the biome. It's worth mentioning there were different animal types in the second biome. Want some camels? that's the place to go. I think this will be the case per biome, and searching each biome is gona be a lot of fun for me.Speaking of animals. Once you capture, cure and tame your animals, you can have 5 of them as companions at a time. I have not tried this yet, but they can follow you around and attack or standby on your command. They also come labelled with their gender and rarity and so on.It's Early AccessAnd it shows it....Basic crafting menuBasic vitals meterNo numbers on your quick barHorse camera is janky and might make you feel sickManaging your inventory is a game in itselfNo FOV sliderNo search funtion for craftingAnimations and ai could use workCombat feels basicSurvival is easy. Chug water and food.That said, It ran very well on ultra settings on my rig 50-60fps (GTX980Ti/4790/16g/Win10) and it also ran decent in Nvidia Surround at 5760x1080 at around 30-40 fps.To sum it up, If you like exploring, lots of crafting, and building an animal sanctuary....this should be right up your street. But remember it has a ways to go. The potential is there and I'd honestly say there is plenty of content to play with right now. I will add to this as i go."

Out of a lot in this genre, Animallica is really far along in the Playability factor.  It's almost overwhelming the amount of crafting already in the game.  The amount of finished Points of Interest are like nothing you have ever seen, and lets talk about building styles!..Now take out games with mod support and for a core game to have this much variety..it's downright insane.  The Vast potential that lies ahead is mind boggling.  SImple put, if you like Open World, Sandbox, building, crafting, survival games..Get it...I left out Early Access because this game could compete at the full release level already and come out surprising the audience!  10 out of 10 Well done!"
76561198241936530,Recommended,638850,34785167,Posted: 6 September,all,dingus mcghee,"With almost 250 hours in game, I feel it is time to review Animallica. It is a SINGLE-PLAYER (co-op is a future possibility, according to developers multiplayer IS NOT, please stop clogging discussion page with the same repetitive question, ""Is this game multiplayer?"").  It is an open world, animal-themed crafting game.  The developers created the Animallica mod for Skyrim previously.  As it is a post-apocalyptic setting, animals are diseased and must be captured and cured. They can then be released or kept as companions or put in enclosures. Animal interaction is still somewhat limited, but breeding, and possibly genetics, are planned. Currently, there are around 15-20 different animals including many of the large African mammals.  Additionally, there are enemies which consist of mutant animals and bandit humans. These are found randomly and around spawning nests.Crafting is accomplished through building increasingly complex stations including a science lab to cure and heal animals. The variety of craftable items is currently somewhat limited particularly in relation to unnecessary to game items like furniture and decorations. Resources are the typical wood, stone and various ores. Additionally, rare multicolored shards allow upgrades and other perks.Exploration, discovery and resource collection are primary at present. While some people call it a survival/crafting game with an animal theme that is a little misleading. After initial gameplay, survival is rather easy particularly after acquiring armor. Food, water and stamina come into play but do not hinder the experience, all readily available or craftable.Without doubt, this is one of my favorite current games and one of my all time favorites. Remember, it is early release and content is continually added (15 updates in first two months of availability). Updates always address bugs but content is also regularly added. The visuals on this game are stunning and on my newer system I notice very little lag. Have not done a fps analysis, sorry.  There are numerous biomes to explore each having a different theme and availble loot and animals. The developers are readily available and regularly respond to questions related to bugs and gameplay as well as reasonable suggestions.  For an early release game it is one of the best looking, well developed ones I have seen in a long time. If you like an animal theme, great graphics and a responsive development team, give this one a chance."

Animallica has the potential to be my summer favorite game.I like survival, base building, open world games - like 7 Days to Die, Rust, Miscreated, H1Z1, Planet Explorers, Fallout 4. Animallica ticks all the boxes for me, and to top it, the graphics are gorgeous. Even in the Alpha, the places available to explore are many.Plus - so far no bugs at all.On the minus side, as there's no tutorial it can be tricky figuring out how it all works. But this is not a huge problem, I found it fairly intuitive."
,Recommended,638850,33890088,Posted: 29 July,all,Alfigue,"*First I want to apologize because my English is not good, it is not my first language*I do not usually write game analysis, but Animallica has something that leads me to write.I love the concept of the game, the idea of ​​mixing the open world in the first person with a management of an animal sanctuary; Is the game that for many years I searched, tirelessly looked for mods for zoo tycoon 2 to transform it into something like that, but they do not exist.Years later I find this surprise that comes to fill that gap left in me the fact that more games of animals of good level did not come to the market.I feel that this project has a huge potential, I love that the game is not the ""typical"" classic multiplayer survival shooter such as ArK, Rust, etc etc etc that NEVER come out of early access. That animalistic touch and to preserve the fauna and flora, that altruistic mission entrusted to us is one of the aspects that I loved Animallica.Another thing that for me is excellent, is the fact that they focus on the singleplayer experience, I'm fed up and really tired of seeing Early Access ark clones, rust, where they launch a product without any clear objective, with a multiplayer being Falls to pieces and without background.Now I will talk a little about the fears or anguish that this game produces; Like many people here, I have tried MANY Early Access, I have seen projects that dazzle at the beginning, they shine a lot (I will not give names, because the list would be eternal), but that after a few months, this flame slowly begins to extinguish, The development becomes slower, the reviews change to varied, and finally to mostly negative; Then some developers slowly abandon projects and leave them unfinished.My biggest fear with Animallica is to have discovered a game that in its essence I loved, that I would love to play it finished someday with all its mechanics implemented; But that over time is abandoned as it happens with many Early Access.Please developers, do not let this flame go out like many others I have seen ascend to glory and then plunge into oblivion (DayZ), or even completely abandon its development and cancel the project (Stomping Land).In the current state I recommend it ONLY if you are aware that it is an Early Access which contains bugs, incomplete aspects and is devoid of concrete objectives; But if you like animals, walk through fields, forests and beautiful landscapes, then buy it.Suggestions:- Improve interactions with animals, it is necessary to be able to feed them, take care of them, bars of happiness or well-being, creation of links with the player, differences between the character or ""personality"" of different animals, better AI of these same ones.-To improve the combat system, which at the moment is really bad.-The voice of the protagonist sometimes looks very feigned and is annoying the sound she makes every time you jump, could be every number of jumps, not always.- You can change the object in hand of the bar by means of the scroll of the mouse.-Interface improvements-Abilities-Menus to view animal statistics, such as states of health, mood, etc.- hire NPC to take care of the sanctuary or help you feed the animals, because I imagine that having many animals later it would be very complex to take care of everyone at all.If I can think of more suggestions I will put them here in time or if there are updates that change some of my analysis.To the developers I wish the best with this project and never end the spirits or enthusiasm (in addition to the funds, because you do not live only with enthusiasm hahaha) so that this game can arrive to good term and be remembered as THE GREAT Game of survival and care of animal sanctuaries.Thank you for allowing us to participate on this.____________________o________________________Español:No suelo realizar análisis de juegos, pero algo tiene Animallica que me lleva a escribir este análisis.Yo amo el concepto del juego, la idea de mezclar el mundo abierto en primera persona con una gestión de un santuario animal; es el juego que por muchos años busqué, incansablemente busqué mods para zoo tycoon 2 para transformarlo en algo asi, pero no hay.Luego años mas tarde me encuentro con esta sorpresa que llega a llenar ese vacío que dejó en mi el hecho que no salieran al mercado mas juegos de animales de buen nivel.Siento que este proyecto tiene un enorme potencial, me encanta que el juego no sea el “típico” shooter multiplayer survival de construcción clásico, como ArK, Rust, etc, etc, etc que no salen NUNCA del early access. Ese toque animalista y de preservar la fauna y flora, esa misión altruista que se nos encomienda es uno de los aspectos que me encantaron de Animallica.Otra cosa que para mi es excelente, es el hecho de que se enfoquen en la experiencia singleplayer, estoy harto y de verdad cansado de ver Early Access clones de ark, rust, donde lanzan un producto sin ningún objetivo claro, con un multiplayer que se cae a pedazos y sin argumento de fondo.Ahora hablaré un poco sobre los temores o angustias que me produce este juego, al igual que muchas personas aquí, he probado MUCHOS Early Access, he visto proyectos que deslumbran al inicio, que brillan mucho (no daré nombres, porque la lista sería eterna), pero que pasados unos meses, esta llama se comienza lentamente a apagar, el desarrollo se hace mas lento, las reviews pasan a variadas, y finalmente a mayormente negativas; luego algunos desarrolladores abandonan lentamente los proyectos y los dejan inacabados.Mi mayor temor con Animallica es haber descubierto un juego que en su esencia me encantó, que me encantaría poder jugarlo terminado algún día con todas sus mecánicas implementadas; pero que pasado el tiempo se abandone como pasa con muchos Early Access.Por favor desarrolladores, no dejen que esta llama se apague como muchas otras que he visto ascender a la gloria y luego sumirse en el olvido (DayZ), o incluso abandonar totalmente su desarrollo y cancelar el proyecto (Stomping Land).En el estado actual lo recomiendo SOLO si tienes presente que es un Early Access el cual contiene bugs, aspectos incompletos y está carente de objetivos concretos; pero si te gustan los animales, recorrer descampados, bosques y paisajes bonitos, entonces cómpralo.Sugerencias:-Mejorar las interacciones con los animales, hace falta poder alimentarlos, cuidar de ellos, barras de felicidad o bienestar, creación de vínculos con el jugador, diferencias entre el carácter o “personalidad” de los diferentes animales, mejores AI de estos mismos.-Mejorar el sistema de combate, que en estos momentos es realmente  malo.-La voz de la protagonista aveces parece muy fingida y es molesto el sonido que ella hace cada vez que saltas, podría ser cada cierto número de saltos, no siempre.-Poder cambiar el objeto en mano de la barra mediante el scroll del ratón.-Mejoras en la interfaz-Habilidades para el jugador-Menús para ver estadísticas de los animales, como los estados de salud, ánimo, etc.-Poder contratar NPC para que cuiden del santuario o que te ayuden a alimentar a los animales, porque imagino que al tener muchos animales mas adelante y si se implementa un sistema de cuidado de estos mismos, sería muy complejo cuidar uno solo de todos los animales.Si se me ocurren mas sugerencias las pondré aquí con el tiempo o si hay actualizaciones que cambian algo de mi análisis.A los desarrolladores les deseo lo mejor con este proyecto y que nunca se acaben los ánimos ni el entusiasmo (además de los fondos, porque no solo de entusiasmo se vive jajaja) para que este juego pueda llegar a buen termino y sea recordado como EL GRAN juego de supervivencia y cuidados de santuarios de animales.Gracias por permitirnos ayudar y participar en esto."

And the devs are responsive 'in communicado'.  Even with the odd glitch - have just spent several hours fully immersed.  If you like sandbox and survival - can wholeheartedly recommend - and it IS PRETTY.  Plenty of ranging and crafting; the different biomes yield characteristic  tyes of booty.  As well as  the essential toolkits!  I play Ark singleplayer obsessively - this has taken me away from it.
,Recommended,638850,33464957,Posted: 11 July,all,Ciabatta Roll,"Let me start by saying this game is great, original and has tonnes of potential. Developers are friendly and down to earth. They have been extremely active and game bugs have been patched hours after they were first reported.At the moment you can tranq animals, take them back to the medical centre in your very own sanctuary and cure them of the apocalyptic diseases that infect them. Then watch them roam freely within their enclosures. You can also take them into battle and command them to attack your foes.The world is broken down into various large maps (I was told the base map is 4km) to improve performance. I have played for 10 hours and I have many areas still left to explore.There is a vast amount of objects and tools to craft. Tools can also be enchanted to improve their use in combat.Textures are great and the game runs smoothly for me on ultra settings at 1440p resolution.This is an early access game so don't be disheartened if you come across a few minor bugs. Overall I think this game is a fantastic start with infinite possibilities for the developers to consider implementing."

The fighting is still clunky and the world needs to be filled up a lot more and of course more content. A lot of work needs to be done yet but... it is EA so this is to be expected.It is a very beautiful world, beautiful music and the level of Details are amazing. You can feel the love the Devs have for this game. They listen to and engage with the community and until now, a lot of problems were fixed in a matter of days, some even in several hours.This game has so much potential and i wish people would stop saying it is an open world survival game. Others expect it to be one and are dissapointed that it is not... It has elements of survival in it, thats it.""Animallica is a sandbox, first person, wildlife park/animal sanctuary builder game with all the elements of a survival game.""The world is huge but you travel from one biome to the next thru a boat / helicopter and thru a Ritual Fire and yes it's with loading screens. I don't mind them and it helps with the performance, so on lower end computers, it's still playable. Not everyone can afford a high end computer.I play with 8 gig Ram ( which is the minimum requirement and it uses all 8 gigs) and you do need it, especially if you want to play with better graphics. My graphic is set to medium and i still have stuttering / lags inbetween and looong loading screens but overal it's quite fluid to play.People were asking for a map, well it is not in the game but we have gotten a Radar and tamed animals will lead you to the boat / helicopter with pressing 'T'.They asked for an empty area where you can build from scratch... we've got a huge, beautiful area :)The devs respond really quick and try to keep the players happy.F1 gives you a little guide which needs to have a lot more in it...You can build you own world, scavenge thru a lot of Biomes (10 atm. ) and the crafting is another great thing in this game. So many items and different workshops already. It's going to be huge by the time this game is finished.People expect this game to work like every other game and get frustrated because they don't read the tooltips properly, which leads to negative reviews and thats a big shame.This is not a fast pace game... and it has a meaning to it ! Save the animals and there is a reason as why we can only cut down dead trees. This game lets you think more about what humans do to this world, how important animals are and our mother Earth is.No rush, just relaxed play and i love it. Such a difference from the real world :) I am so looking forward to the next update and wish the Devs good luck, you are all doing a fantastic job and never give up on this game please !!!Sorry that my review is so long... it's my very first review and once i start... wel thanks for reading my uhm book and i hope it helped a bit ;)greets cheeky2"

Lots of decorations too, and your own zoo to put them in, together with the animals.VERR NICE"

I have played with the mod since it first came out and dev is helpfull and friendly.The game has some of the animals but lots more to be added and more objects , the graphics are great and run smoothly even on a laptop , Although there is no tutorial there are plenty of videos showing how to play and anyone who plays this sort of game should not have much of a problem figuring it out . For an early access game there is a lot of content , plenty to build and destroy all the normal animals can be tamed . The noise from walking can get a bit annoying and if you turn volume down you lose all noise . I started looking for the parts to build workbench and ended up just exploring for hours there is so much to see and only about half of areas have been completed so still loads to come . The animals look great although movement could do with some work { it will be improved } . There are npc's although they only walk around at moment and if you attack they run away { at least the ones I have found so far do } . You can swim and collect items from under water no oxygen to worry about yet.The devs are active in the community and will try to answer most questions and are happy to help solve problems , from playing Mod I know they update regulary and know this will be a game that will keep developing and gettting more content.I Would describe the game as a mixture of ark, zoo tycoon , 7 days to die ,  I mean this as lots of animals , taming , building , explore , collecting wood and ores . If you like these sort of games then buy Animallica you won't be disappointed and if you don't like these games then still buy it you might be surprised ."

There's plenty to do, the gameplay is engaging and not tedius, and the mutants and infected humans are actually creepy enough to give me a little jolt here and there. The decision to split up the enviornments into different maps was a very smart move as it greatly reduces lag and gives much higher preformance. I've seen some people complain about it in negative reviews but honestly it still feels GREATLY like an open world.The story is really engaging, and part of why I bought a copy of Animalica so quickly after launch. The bare bones of the plot is there in-game, but I'm super excited for more of it to be added in and built upon. The graphics are good, the animal models aesthetically and realistically pleasing, and there's always something to do. I do recommend it in its current state if you're looking for a good time sinking romp and don't mind a few hiccups here and there."

Its been almost impossable for me to find a game that comes even close To this kind of freedom and detail. Iam truly impressed and very grateful to the developers for Animallica.

This is an EA title I recommend picking up.The game has a great concept, it's like you're creating your own jurassic park. It also has a slight 'island of dr moreau' vibe as well. Anyone who's a big fan of loot/hoarding stuff (like me) in survival games will enjoy the amount of stuff in the game so far and also having rarities on items/animals/plants etc makes it fun when you find a rare animal to capture/tame (almost has a pokemon feel to it).Another great feature is the crafting/building.. People that get right into base building/crafting/decorating will love this, the amount of things to craft so far is very impressive.Great job so far to the devs even though it is very early and I look forward to seeing the game grow!"

Animallica surprised me to be a early access game it gave me more than i expected it dont have to much content yet, but still it entertains me for hours i`m huge animal friend and when i found that sick dog i just wanted to cry i cured it,and it followed me and my horse around and we horde stuff while i`m dreaming about building my best plant and animal reserve.I dont recomend many early access games it need few finishing touches but i recomend this game."

Referring to their YouTube tutorials really helps but I wish that there was some form of in-game instruction, maybe a book to pick up and read or something in the starting room. Otherwise though, this game is really neat and I'll have to play more to get the full experience."

The only issues I have is that the game tends to be a resource hog, I can run it at 60fps on ultra with my 970, but it pushes it to near 100% usage, so I play on high for heats sake, lol.

Be the crazy dog lady, crazy elephant man, or any other animal you can think of to hoard. Plenty to play already.

But given time with these little things cleared this game hopefully will fill its pertential of being an incredible game.I say... Buy it.

There is no guide as yet so you won't have your hand held as you learn the game but there is an active community and any questions/problems you have are usually answered very quickly.If you love exploring, crafting, creating, saving animals and killing mutants then this could be the game for you, considering it is EA there is a huge world already in existance with much, much more promised. From the African Savannah to snow covered mountains and arid Deserts to lush forests there is so much to explore that even after playing for 200+ hours I am still finding new places I missed on earlier visits.The Devs are very active and responsive, serious bugs are fixed in extremely quickly (in a matter of hours sometimes) less serious bugs/player requests are incorporated into regular and frequent up-dates.Loading screens between the various areas can take a while and the game can be a bit choppy when you first arrive but it soon smoothes out, just make sure your PC meets the minimum requirements (8GB of RAM is a 'must have')Overall this game is awesome and only promises to get better."

You can travel on many islands, the music is adapted to the environment.To tame animals is really interesting. Some of your companions can attack, others not.Now I played this game about 2 weeks and  I'm bored. Collect and store, this is what I have done most of the time. Crafting is ok, the building is not matured, because of too much you can't build here. I have some animals, have all the workbenches and wonder what the meaning of the game is. The houses cannot be repaired and otherwise I just run around and beautify my base, but not really succeed.

I dont feel the game is bad at all. If you look at the release date into EA it is only out since early July. That really shows in the game and controls. There is much work to be done in my opinion but the game has a lot of potential.Graphics are nice and the game runs really smoothe. Had no issues with performance though I did not notice FPS as the number for the FPS is not important to me.Gameplay itself you can tell its a newer game early in the project. I refunded this game because of this. Sadly too many games this early on when they hit EA often dont get finished. This is just in my personal experience. I have no crystal ball so I can say this wont be finished.

I did get the game running one time and I like the idea behind this game.

I have 16 gb ddr4 memory and a z170 motherboard.  The game hogs resources so bad that where other games I can have things going on on my other screen, this one locks everything else up freezes everything bu the game and shoots my memory usage to 90%I know this is EA and an indie developer working on it so I have hopes that they will optimize this game and fix memory issues soon.*changing my rating to thumbs down for now.
