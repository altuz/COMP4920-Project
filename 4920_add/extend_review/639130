76561198017125492,Recommended,639130,33678723,Posted: 20 July,all,haykeye13,"Pretty fun game so far. Not too easy, not too hard. Lots of progression and missions to do. You earn money from doing the tasks and buy new planes and airports. If you get motion sickness there are comfort options. I turned all comfort options off and flew in simulation mode. I got a little disoriented flying like this, first time in a while this has happened to me in VR!!Very fun flight sim with unique controls, the Vive motion controls do everything from flipping switches in the cockpit to grabbing the stick and operating the aircraft.There are different things to do, I haven't tried all of them yet. You fly through objectives to start, later on trying to land in tight spots and take pictures of different landmarks. Holding the iPad while flying can be a little disorienting but I'm sure I'll get used to it.The flight mechanics seem realistic enough and it does take a little learning to get a hang of flying the first ultralite aircraft. The music and sound effects are fun, although sometimes its hard to push in the starter button long enough to start the engine.Would be nice to see a bit more life on the islands/ocean/air and some graphics options as well as a supersampling option in game. Not all audio prompts are for the Vive controller but controls are basic and can be found beside the laptop. If you want a flight sim/pilot wings style game this is it!Overall 8/10."

There are several more, but they both require all sorts of delirious input devices, but Ultrawings is the least expensive, and only needs the classic Vive controllers. 10/10 would recommend."

How fun , the controls are easy and the physics do not punnish you too much.Just finished my first job ,, 20 min of flying and just a lil wonkey.  I usually get sick as soon as things start to move. I get sick when in the passenger seat in a car,, I dont fly in real planes well.  Forget boats on the ocean ,, blarp. So just a little  tilty after 20 min is amazing for me!! I Think it is because it  moves like you expect it to ,, omg i want peddle rudders  ...I recomend this very much  to anyone who likes to fly prop aircraft ( it IS slow moving ultralights) This is the game that is gunna make me push for my vr legs.(will update after finishing the jobs just so happy with this i thought i would rave a bit while i took a break)"
,Recommended,639130,33681330,Posted: 20 July,all,ehood182,"I routinely play ""study"" sims and have flown many C172s -- this was enough to scratch that aviation itch. Great atmosphere, fairly intuitive controls, good visuals. One of the most rewarding and elements is the landing challenges. Coming up to the target and looking down to your wheels as you watch them contact with the ground is super satisfying. I feel like the landing challenge itself could be expanded with the use of a bush aircraft, like a Piper Cub with oversized wheels landing on tricky uneven terrain.PROS:-Flights dynamics feel realistic-Flipping switches on startup is fun-Progression with fun home-bases-Great sense of soaring-Easy to learn, challenging to masterCONS:-Rocket glider controls are confusing. I push the rocket button to take off, but never know when or why it's going to fire again despite trying to cut fuel and glide. Rocket also wont start after a ""retry mission"" selection.-Need to hold down trigger to maintain control of flight-stick. Needs to be able to toggle or trim.If you like flying you'll like this game, I promise."

As a fan of Aerofly FS 2 : Flight Simulator which I play with a flightstick it's impressive how well this works just grabbing onto and using the vitrual flight stick. Definitely on the sim side of handling, not arcade. The area seems a bit small but don't know if I've done enough yet to reveal anything further there might be. It feels right and that's key in something like this. I'm glad I bought it, maybe you will be too."

,Recommended,639130,34299757,Posted: 16 August,all,TheFloppyFish,"Solid Game. I have gotten in loads of gameplay which justifies the big price tag. Has a nice polished look despite being fairly simple. Also I can fly planes now!!!!! It does have a steep learning curve if you play in simulator mode but it is very worth it. I just unlocked the sport plane and am having fun trying to tame it. I flew between some buildings which felt super cool. Every plane has its charms though and I still fly the first one even though it is the ""beginner"" plane."

Easy to get into, with the missions becoming more challenging after a while, thus demanding more piloting skills.Graphics are simple and comicy, but very crisp and offering a solid framerate. This and the availalbe comfort mode options should enable players prone to motion sickness to ease into the game.Very enjoyable, I suggest you listen to some uplifting music while airborne."

You can play it standing too.
,Recommended,639130,33805004,Posted: 26 July,all,SKΛTΞºʳÐ¡Ξ☠  [222],"It's really good.  Flying with motion controllers is so much better than a controller.  (you have the option to use either.)  Maybe use a flight stick?  Not yet?  IDK haven't tried.Flying on here with motion controls reminds me of a little game called ""XCavalypse"" in VR.  And looks kinda like Final Approach: Pilot Edition.  But Ultrawings has more of a simulation feel.Photography missions can be tricky because you have to center shots perfectly.  Some are just way harder to get than others.I'm guessing this game is meant to be played on a chair with no arm rests because when you recenter.  I can't reach the throttle because the couch is in the way.  So I either have to sit on the couch sideways or slightly stand up and recenter.  The Rocket Glider doesn't have a throttle at all so it's not even an issue.It's great though.  Ultrawings has a lot of missions.  My son knows Aerofly FS 2 so as soon as he saw me playing this he pretty much forcibly removed me from the HMD and it's an automatic HIT for kids.  They learn to actually use throttle, rather than pressing buttons.I recommend this to all friends."
76561197994687590,Recommended,639130,33684989,Posted: 20 July,all,Cybrviper,I can't stress enough how amazing this game is.  Right out of the box it is fun and intuitive to play. things that arent known like how to start the plane are explained well but not detracting from gameplay. the first lessons are easy to master and most of all fun. missions earn a good amount of money and does not feel grindy to earn the next thing. free flight is available and landing at an airfield allows you the option to refuel and keep flying or return to base. Even in the beginning there is some options on missions so I did not feel like I was forced to do anything I did not want to do. will be playing this one a lot as I love flying and the vive controls add to the experience of this one instead of feeling clumsy or unresponsive. If you are even remotely interested in flying get this one.

The three aircraft operate and feel very different to fly.Motion sickness is a thing to take care of. I couldn't play for more than an hour at a time... motion sickness may be more intense with the third aircraft.I'd really love to see some more in the game. Larger areas with more ""barn stroming"" would have made this the perfect game...I think what I'm really asking for is for someone to make that old PS2 game Sky Oddesy into a full vr game."

Thought I'd hate using the Vive controller as a yolk but it worked out surprisingly well and so far it's been a pretty enjoyable experience. I played thought the training lessons and received my pilots license. The game seems to achieve a good balance of challenge vs fun. Not sure how deep the experience goes, but so far so good. If you enjoyed pilotwings back in the day, this will give you a similar feeling of an amature flight simulator that's both challenging and fun."

You start with an ultralight glider and do missions to earn money that let you buy better planes and access to new airports and islands. I've unlocked 3 aircraft so far, and there appear to be more. The missions include flying through rings, landing on targets, popping balloons, aerial photography, etc. I didn't realize until 3 hours in that you can adjust the sound effect and music volume with dials on the stereo in each office."
76561198170863395,Recommended,639130,33905782,Posted: 30 July,all,[FLI] Mercy,"Overall, I think this will be a good game.  A agree with others that more content will be welcome (i.e. More airplanes and the possibility of multiplayer.)  I would also like to see more complexity in the game, like clouds and more instruments.Two drawbacks:  I wish you could adjust the ""dead spot"" on the yoke.  It is WAY too dead as is now.  Very slow response to input.  The second is nausea.  Caution if you get any nausea with other ""motion"" games.  I will say, the comfort mode goes a long way, and I believe with time I will build up my tolerance too this.UPDATE!!WOW! After some more play time, now at 2 hours, I am really impressed.  The nausea has worn off, and this really is a fun and immersive game.  Got to the rocket glider.  I can ""feel"" the power.  Sound effects are unreal and the feeling of shooting straight up into the air is fantastic!  And yes, the controls do get tighter.  I see now the genious . . . .BTW, love the special touches, for example, the scrapes and texture of the glass conopy on the glider.  Can't wait to get to the next plane . . ."

The game is quite fun now that I have it working mostly right.  Missions are interseting and game looks nice.Still the game has some minor issues as far as I'm concerned:1) Sometimes the airplane rolls back on the runway prior to takeoff (especially if I have some throttle while hitting starter) and then it gets stuck and I have to reset the mission.2)  I find sometimes it's really hard to get the starter button pressed, you push too far, too fast, not enough..etc the game doesn't register you pressed it.3) The ipad/camera flickers in free flight (showing multiple textures at once, like gold medals etc)4) Have to stand up when resetting seated position, to make the stick high enough to be usable when seated."

The graphics are clean and bright, the tutorials and mission progression is intuitive, and the controls (Oculus Touch) feel pretty good for the current technology.The game takes me back to the first time I played Starfox on the NES. GREAT feeling of flight.I prefer to have more tactile feedback in ALL the games I play (especially in VR) but the touch controller implementation is good.I often find myself letting my hand drift away from the flight stick (and I won't lie, that's frustrating) but I am becomming more aware of hand positioning.Joystick support (not just gamepad, bleh) such as throttle, pedals and joystick would earn this game a 5/5 stars for me.Overall, the game so far (I am a completionist so I only just bought the rocket-glider) is crisp, well polished, fun for all skill levels and very much worth the asking price.I give it a 4.5 out of 5 until/unless they add real controller support.Also, for the folks who have trouble getting the view height to a comfortable position, I would suggest recalibrating your HMD. It is spot-on for me and minor head movement while re-centering the view put the stick EXACTLY where I want it.GREAT JOB devs! Keep good content like this coming."

76561197973777810,Recommended,639130,34170452,Posted: 11 August,all,markoragnos,"This is probably my favorite VR game so far, and it´s one of the few that I can see coming back to again and again.  Simply put, it´s an engaging, easy to learn but relatively deep flight sim (not as hardcore as a PlaneX or MS flight simulator, but more immersive due to VR).  The feeling of height, depth and speed is very well conveyed, and the controls feel intuitive quite quickly.  The visual style is perfect for these early days of VR- it's immersive and evocative while remaining cartoony and fun, making rendering easier and avoiding the stutters common to games to strive for photorealism.The game itself is a series of ""jobs"" and training mission, which start by teaching you how to fly, then get progressively more challenging.  It is reminiscent of the old SuperNES Pilotwings, and that's a good thing!  You can also just freefly, which is super fun and relaxing."
,Recommended,639130,33774729,Posted: 24 July,all,Peter Burling,"This game is wonderful.I think I got put onto this by the Vive subreddit but I sort of bought this game on a whim and hopped in after work with the intention to potter about and move onto some other things.I lost about 2 hours to this game.Manipulating the simplified (relative to flight sims) controls for controlling fuel rate, magneto and engine starter shifts makes you feel suitably 'pilotsy' in this beautiful cartoon world and the little missions are a real giggle. I've gotten as far as the 2nd unlockable plane (the jet glider). I'm warming up to the mechanics after completing the license challenges but it has its charm.The sound design is really good. The two voice actors are pleasant and inject a bit of playful charm into the mission briefings and I love the little buzz of the ultralight engine and the little bit of satisfaction you get when you ease back the throttle and settle in for a cruise. The rocket glider makes me feel like a kerbal when i hit the engine start button, i almost wish it had a flippy cover you had to lift over and rather than a push button it was a big thing you slammed your fist onto. At the moment, with the vive controllers i can find the button press a little... finnicky. Not fun killingly so though.I almost wish there was an in-between from the ultralight to the glider. I could have helped do some low swoops/crop dusting, or some showy fly-by/low passes on the boating people down below, that would have been a nice little interlude between the balloon popping and photo missions - that being said, the photo missions are a LOT of fun.A friend of mine is a flight sim fan and I can't wait to get his opinion.

They work well for the most part, with the one exception that sometime finding the engine start button, for me, has been difficult. My hand kind of goes through the button sometimes.But leaving that aside, this game is great fun. There's a nice progression that seems fairly long; I've been playing 2.2 hours and my save has 11% completion. It's a really fun game to pick up for a few missions. Very relaxing and mellow. Makes a nice counterpoint to any tense games in your rotation (for me right now that's DiRT Rally!).Definitely one of the best VR flying games right now."

,Recommended,639130,34925906,Posted: 13 September,all,Xoltri,"Having a lot of fun in this one, I was worried about the motion sickness that I'm prone to but I adjusted pretty quickly after the first playing session and it's not a problem any more.  As others have said it's Pilot Wings VR basically, and I loved that game so this is right up my alley.I feel the need to address some of the negative reviews.  One person complained about wanting to be able to use a HOTAS.  For those that have them I agree that would be a good feature to add.  But I don't feel limited by using the Vive controllers - it's actually pretty accurate and I feel it adds to the immersion.  Sometimes I have to recenter my location so the stick is not too far ahead, but once you do that you can rest your arm on your leg and it is comfortable.Another said it doesn't have enough content.  Keep in mind at time of writing that person has ~0.4 hours of playtime.  I'm at 3 hours and it says I have beat ~17%.  Trying to get gold on each challenge could take a while.  Plenty of content.Finally the last complaint I read was that the difficulty curve was too high.  I didn't seem to have a problem - the first Ultralight plane is pretty forgiving to fly and the tutorial levels step you through the flight characteristics pretty well.  My 8 year old was able to figure it out.Overall this game is definitely a buy."

Being able to use the tracked controllers makes it feel soooo real. Worth the price. I've had my Vive for a year now and I have the most time in this game.Just hope it gets some funding and adds some more planes/ a better envirnment. Also a more realistic flight physics mode.

If you liked Pilotwings on the SNES back than you will probably enjoy this one. The progression system and the missions are fun. It takes a little while to get used to the controlls. They are very sensitive. Tip: Don´t oversteer and  get used to the Rudders. I wish the islands were more detailed. Instead of all islands on the map i would have prefered to get different maps with one island each but more detailed ones.But it is how it is and i can finally enjoy a made for VR flight game.

It's a ♥♥♥♥ing cliff."

,Recommended,639130,33918952,Posted: 30 July,all,eXntrc,"This is a great little title. I appreciated that they have different comfort modes, but I turned mine off almost immediately because I felt cramped in the cockpit. I really enjoyed the tutorial and it really felt like a good progression. My only complaint was that I got to the point where I could buy into the next airport, I did, then I buzzed the lighthouse too closely and I accidentally crashed. When I ""came to"" at the original airport I saw the money drained from my account (presumably for the aircraft I just trashed) and it looked like I had to do the whole flight to buy the new airport again. I feel that should have been saved the moment I bought it. Otherwise, this is a great demo. I hope ""Arcade"" mode allows the plane to be crashed without costing money, otherwise I won't share this one with friends and family. I will test that out next time I play."

TAKES A LOT OF THE FUN OUT OF THE GAME AND IS TRULY FRUSTRATING. ALONG THE SAME LINES, JET SAILPLANE SOMETIMES FIRES THE NEXT ROCKET AND SOMETIMES DOESN'T. IDK IF THIS IS A QUIRK DESIGNED TO MAKE US WORK HARDER OR AN OVERSIGHT; IN ANY CASE IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH DUE TO THE TEENY, TINY START BUTTON FUNCTION AREA. Also, on the instructional controls plaque brake is spelled wrong. Wheel brakes, not wheel ""breaks.""I grew up playing Pilot Wings N64, am a pilot, and an avid flight simmer, so when I saw this pop up with quite a few positive reviews I was ecstatic. I'm about 4hrs in and just unlocked the 3rd aircraft. There will be many many more hours of flying for me.Pros:Nice stick and rudder characteristics - arcade-like in lots of ways, but flies nicelyCharming visual style and quirksNo motion sickness (for me) even with the cockpit set to minimal obstructionsFun/challenging missionsVariety squeezed out of just 3 aircraftCons:Noted above - starter button is outrageously difficult to press for Vive users, very small functionality area. Lots of flailing.Would love to see more aircraft (not so much a con, just a hope)All and all, well worth the $25 to me. Can be mellow or a challenge depending on your mood, both very satisfying. A little polishing needed, but plenty of content for the money."
,Recommended,639130,33773843,Posted: 24 July,all,MANTRONIX,"played it on the vive. it's outstanding. i finally got the sportsplane, the 3rd and last plane as buyable achievment. the game is lots of fun, even for just flying around with the first plane and not caring about completing missions. but if flight simming is your game and if you buy this game because you wanna knife edge this lil extra 300 through tiny gaps between skyscrapers in manhatten and if you have the drive and skills to progress fast in games like this then you just might want to rush through all those challenging missions. because once you got the sports plane, the fun REALLY begins! well worth the money, 10/10, would bug report again!"

It's really fun, and I was expecting a complete arcade flight model (I'm a real life PPL) so I held off. The FM is just realistic enough to make it enjoyable. Have never seen an ultralight with flaps though lol As a kid I dreamt of owning a ""Quicksilver MX"" ultralight and this kind of fulfills that for me. I fly bigger planes now, but I still love the idea of ultralights."

,Recommended,639130,34851454,Posted: 9 September,all,Tharock1,If you feel like getting put down by VR Voices in your head. This is the game for you. Tho it is a great game -the joystick breaking every now and then. I just don't like geting talked down to. Also the gunplay needs some work.
,Recommended,639130,35040916,Posted: 18 September,all,G-Dub,"I just really love this game! I keep finding myself coming back to it! There are lots of different types of missions and locations to unlock as well different planes.I didn't pick this one up right away due to the price, but it really is worth it, even at full price. This is one of the few polished and content-rich games in out there and one of the only good flying games IMO.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMHwAkl8BdgAlso love the voice acting, the guy sounds a little like Tom Hanks!http://store.steampowered.com/app/639130/Ultrawings/"

Glad it finally made the jump to Vive.Agree with other reviews that the option for joystick controls would be good to include; that said the current contol scheme with the Vive controllers works well and really engages you with the game.Also completely agree that it brings up a Pilotwings vibe which is a really good thing (especially for any crusty 'back-in-the-day' SNES/N64 veterans, like me). Any chance Bit Planet could throw in a hang glider, a jet pack (think Omega agent clone) and a skydive?Highly recommended if you want a fun VR flight sim experience which is easy to jump into."
