,Recommended,639170,33592476,Posted: 16 July,all,Jon,"I want season 2 of Telltale's TFTB, TWAU, GoT, and Batman as much as everyone else but this is not the place to get pissy about that.If you enjoyed season 1 of Minecraft: Story Mode (like I did) then you already know what you're gonna get with this; a fun, lighthearted adventure with old as well as new cast and challenges. Though there are some new interesting gameplay improvements (some slightly more in-depth building and combat) that fit the Telltale format nicely.Also: ""Just because it appeals to children doesn't exclude me from enjoying it."" - Jordan Schlansky"
,Recommended,639170,33479210,Posted: 12 July,all,ส็็็A wrenchin' Nep,"I recommend Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two to anyone who enjoys serious fantasy stories that feature funny, memorable characters.Excuse me for having an opinion, but I really enjoyed Season Two so far.I realize there are many people who would rather play a different Season Two, but this is the sequel Telltale chose and it deserves proper criticism.I assume anyone interested in buying this game already knows what Season One was like, so I base my review on improvements upon the original game and how enjoyable I feel it is.TL;DR huge improvements.Improved visualsImproved audioImproved battle systemBetter balance between comedy and plotThe general quality of animations has been improved greatly, haven't noticed anything as stiff as Axel from Season 1.The camera work and scene transitions are better now, didn't notice any sound being cut off unless I hurried up the scene.Better voice actors have been hired for a few (main) characters.I don't know if choices make a big difference in future episodes, but there are definitely still alternate routes within the same episode.One thing I really liked in Season 1 was the addition ofproper dynamic battle controls. Unfortunately they were pretty basic and barely ever used. They have been improved in Season 2 however:They are used more frequently. You must predict what your opponent's next move is going to be and time your defense right. Evade the attack by either backing away or dodging to the side, depending on what's required of you to do. There's even a fun boss fight at the end of episode 1 where you need to get a bit creative.I definitely want to see more of this.Another thing I appreciate is thebalance between comedy and plot. Season 1's emotional balance had some problems,Reuben's deathbeing the most infamous example. This changed in Season 2.While there are of course still hilarious scenes (like fighting your way through Stella's) and I love the humor, the mood can turn serious in a heart beat, and in a good way.I'm talking about your relationship with Petra and Jack Morrison here.Jesse and their friends don't have petty arguments anymore, either. If they do argue, it's either lighthearted or serious, but never annoying.Excuse me for having an opinion, but I really enjoyed Season Two so far. I hope Telltale keeps up the quality in future episodes."
,Recommended,639170,33982012,Posted: 2 August,all,Gen. Brony,"Great improvements on the first game with a slightly altered UI during selection, fighting requires more strategy now that you have limited stamina, and can roll and such.Overall an amazing sequel to the first, but the only con I find with this is the fact that it takes a while for episodes to release."
,Recommended,639170,34569458,Posted: 28 August,all,pixels/that/breathe,"UPDATE FOR EPISODE 3 RELEASE:Okay, yeah. This is the first time I've encountered a choice in a Telltale game and had to sit there for a few minutes and really think about it. The intensity just keeps ramping up here! I really enjoy the writing in this season a lot more compared to the first.The first season was a good character building chapter to enjoy, but now that all the characters are fleshed out, they can be thrown around into all sorts of scenarios. It's only getting better! Love it.---Original review below---Only played the first two episodes so far and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. Love the new combat system and the cinematic choice mechanics that have been added. Crowd Play is also pretty fun!Only problems I can say is that I miss the original voice actor for Olivia, it's almost as if they didn't even try to get someone that sounded similar at all. And the voice animations seems kinda janky at times.But back to the good stuff, the new characters are awesome and I have to say, the antagonist of this is the best one yet! Really excited to ride this story out. If you're a fan of the first one, be willing to accept a little change."

,Recommended,639170,34285262,Posted: 16 August,all,disleksik toestur,"Pretty awesome!!!The changes you make now affect the game very greatly.I also like how you can literally build your own things with blocks.It takes the concepts of gaming (like administrators) and puts it in the game.Episode 1 took me atleast an hour and a half to finish i think, so gameplay time is pretty good!Can't wait to start episode 2!ps: Episode 2 was released right after I finished Episode 1 xd"

,Recommended,639170,34022490,Posted: 4 August,all,DreamMaster17,"Comparing this to season 1 it seems to play a bit more like it, but with some slight upgrades to their game engine. Voice acting is still kinda neautral but tolerable even though some grunts/screams were taken from season 1.But still I am quite happy with the improvements. Season 2 seems to be a better improvement from the first as when you control Jessie in the game and turn him/her around during gameplay, they don't look so stiff when they turn a direction. Lip syncing seems to be a bit more in tune although it almost looks off with dialouge during certain parts of the story much like season 1.One thing that drove me to keep playing alongside the story (Which still has likeable characters and tough choices) is the combat. No longer is it clunky and you only can attack with just one swing at a time. You can actually fight mobs/monsters with combo attacks! But don't think you can wale on them mindlessly. There will be times when you have to dodge their attacks and watch their patterns. Bottom line, combat requires stradegy but feels more fluid and action-packed then season 1.Those are just my small thoughts on the matter. Still, I've enjoyed episode 1 so far. Hope to see more soon."

76561198092238267,Recommended,639170,34117645,Posted: 8 August,all,Cole Winters,"This is Minecraft story mode 2.0! They turned all the core mechanics and improved to make them more fluid, along with a new and interesting twist on the game play. You can tell just from the first build they want to take a more creative side to the building, although this only occurs once and I hope to see it more throughout the season. The combat is so much better! With real dodging now, and much more fluid combat it’s refreshing and amazing! The story is a little hectic. Without any spoilers here’s what I thought of it. Jumbled. They had to work in a few different elements and with almost a whole new set of characters (not a spoiler they are literally on the cover) you feel like time moved on and that’s too existential for me. BUT that is the point. Time has moved on for some of these characters and it’s a theme that plays out through the whole episode and I think that part was very well done. But like I said before, they tried to throw so much at you it seems cramped. BUT by the end (again no spoilers) of it everything seems to be sets in place, and they really just wanted to sets up characters, places, and themes in this episode; so they can focus on the plot in the next ones. I encountered two bugs, but nothing game breaking. The game is solid. Never crashed. Although I did notice that lip sync was not amazing at times. Yes yes they are blocks and so lip sync isn’t spot on but for the art style last season it looked fine. In this episode you could definitely tell things were off. Screams on blank faces, grunts on blank faces, full words when a person’s mouth is just in the “O” position. The game and world is beautiful, love the city (my city). Voice acting is amazing (Cat Taber, and Pat Oswalt amazing as ever), although I will miss some characters and their amazing voice actors *cough* Paul Reubens *cough* #ivoristhebest AND they changed Olivias voice actress witch kinda upsets me, because now she sounds like an pompus nerd, when old Olivia had a scratchy friendly voice to her. I have NOTHING against Natasha Loring’s skills I just liked Martha Plimpton better as she was the voice for five or six episodes. The new characters in this game are average. Below I can give you what I think of the characters but those will be blacked out:Radar:Hate him. He’s annoying, I would never leave him in charge of my town. I don’t like him and if I have the chance somewhere in the future to let him fall to his doom trust I will.Stella:Hated her, then I saw what she was doing in the trophy room, started to feel bad for her. I’m actually excited to see what happens with her.Nurm:LOVE NURM SO ADORABLE!!!! I LOVE THAT HE TALKS LIKE A VILLAGER!!!! MORE NURM!!!Vos:Vos is sus as hell. Literally nothing special about him. Nothing. Filler character. I would rather Ivor. BRING BACK IVOR!!!Jack:Cool? Maybe? He is a lil ♥♥♥♥♥, but yeah I guess that’s cause his friend died, but still. He is taking Petra away from me, and in all honesty he can have her. I like Petra but I was the person in season one who always saved Lucas. So I’m happy for Petra because she found a friend.Overall I loved the game, I love this series, and I can’t wait for the rest of it! Keep it up Telltale <3"

Telltale hasn't failed to disappoint me with this second season either! The thing I love about Telltale's minecraft games, is that they have full creative freedom to make their own unique stories! They don't have to follow any source material or cater to anyone's favorties, it's all with them, and they're doing a fantastic job with it so far. Me and my little bro are enjoying this game to bits and we can't wait to dive into the second episode."

Its a telltame game,  for those just wanting some choices in adventure, giving a good feeling, rather then other choice choosing games that are depressing.... such as the walking dead series. (rest in spagetti never forgetti, pupper on a lawn).Is a bit expensive if you want total playablity, from season 1 to season 2, but i say its way better to play the first before hand.

First thing is when we are going to build a Statue for our friend, just RANDOM! build whatever you want! Not like the first series. Second, choices at critical moment are more harder to pick! Last thing is the end of the first episode of this series called 'ATTACK ON ADMIN!' LULUpdate review (ep 2):Episode 2 is out! We beat the Admin in Colossal Prismarine Giant form. Then we are going to   rebuild a new monument for Rueben! And the Admin were with us ALL ALONG(in disguise)! I noticed that when Vos says 'Not everyone can do this challenge' at the beginning of the challenge!Still wondering, will TELLTALE GAMES put some extra episode as a DLC just like the first series or not...but this game is worth to buy!

,Recommended,639170,33488101,Posted: 12 July,all,Niccy Evermore,"I found the various little tweaks made to some of the systems welcome improvements to the systems of the first season. I greatly enjoyed the voice acting of the new actors, and even the old ones seemed more comfortable in their roles this time around. I do hope the next few episodes after the first focus on a larger arc like season one did, as I'm greatly enjoying the world that has been, pardon the pun, built up to give the world a more filled out feeling.I am, however, somewhat dissapointed that I seem to be having similar issues with the new season as I did the old one, where voice lines occasionally don't play, greatly detracting from the impact of various scenes. It's not a common issue, but it tends to greatly break immersion when it shows up.All in all, as a minecraft fan, of course I'm going to enjoy this new season, and what it offers. So I would, roughly, rate it a 8/10 for minecraft fans and fans of Tell Tale's games, and a 6/10 for those less inclined towards these series. It's a good game, but it's most definitely more niche than other games here on steam."

I loved the first season and from the looks of the first episode, it seems like this one is going to be even better! Still the same 'ol characters and there was an upgrade to the interface and everything which makes it look a lot nicer and more reminiscent to other Telltale games.The voice acting is still good and the play is easy and fun (although I got killed right near the end of the episode, but that's what I get for trying to take screenshots every 5 minutes, I guess). The attack/stamina bar when fighting is a bit annoying, but it makes sense and makes fights a little more challenging.I totally recommend this to people who have played the whole first season or who have just recently discovered the Story Mode series."

,Recommended,639170,33463656,Posted: 11 July,all,ClassicRampage,"Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two builds upon what made the first season so great. Everything seems to have improved! The lightning and effects are more detailed, the overall presentation is more appealing to look at. There are more segments where you actually get to ""play"" with fighting, quick times events, and speaking. The pacing seems to be a bit slow but it's fun to watch the world being built up and understanding the characters.Because the game is a lot more detailed, low-end computers are gonna have a hard time running it- at least without turning all the settings down very low.I give Season Two so far, a 8/10!"

I like games with a lot of action like ""what is happening?!"", the only games that got me like from telltale was Batman. Episode 1 in this it was like ""I found a gauntlet that has a curse and stays on me forever, now a werid hole came out of no where and we have to go to a anciet sea palace for nothing cause a giant statue that claims to be admin follows you back and beacon town is dead"". If i had to recommend this game or not, i wouldn't. Yes yes be mad at me i don't care what you say. I know at the end of every telltale game there's always a lot of action and stuff but episode 1 was meh, this is what i had to say for episode 1, more hater comment soon to come.Episode 2: I know i'm a bit late for this but i had other things to do. This episode was a tiny bit (0.1%) better than episode 1 but it had some more downsides. In episode 1 there was a arrogant ruler who of course is arrogant to this day and the music in this episode , meh. There was also not alot of moving just dialogue and choices and action, there were like 2 maybe 3 times you move and thats it. The story of this episode is that ""the admin came to beacon town and destroyed most of it and the king (jesse) only cared about the admin and not his town (he does help his people tho) then the admin turns into a snowman and then we have to do his challenges to get a magic clock back, turns out the admin was our friend and now jesse is in a asylum and his friends are missing.""  Telltale will do they're job and make each episode better by the month and episode 5 is usally the best. Telltale is awsome and they're best game ever is the walking dead series."

,Recommended,639170,33464227,Posted: 11 July,all,Ahri,"So, let me start from the Beginning. Probably 1 Year ago.I wasnt really into any Telltale Game, but then at some point, i thought i'd give MCSM a Try.The moment i finished Episode 1 of Season 1. I was directly Hooked.Bought the DLC's and Everything, enjoyed every last thing out of the Game,And now Season 2 Appears, like Telltale made this JUST to make me super Happy again.Needless to say, its Great.The Engine update really shines, DoF, Ambient Occ. Nicer Shadows, all that.This time around, Jesse is just having his typical Day, getting greeted by everybody, then meets up with Petra, while everybody else is doing things, Lucas relaxing, Axel and Olivia were working,and Ivor is doing stuff with Harper.So Jesse and Petra are together, then meet a Llama, then found the Prissmarine Fist,Then they meet new 2 Characters, Nerm and Jack. I am kinda sad that Ivor and so is gone,But these both (expect that Nerm isnt actually talking Human Language) are Really Interestingand give the Game a new taste.And as we all know, it goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥after that, but im not going to Spoiler.The Game is alot more Polished now,Theres a new Fighting System which feels REALLY well compared to the first Season.Better Animations,Better Menu, (The Game IS locked to 60 FPS and has VSync on, but that didnt bother me at all)Afterall, the game got me hooked throughout the EndAnd im going to be waiting for new Content!Really well done work here, Telltale. Despite all the Hate they're getting because they wanted other Games to release...I am really thankful that they made the decision to go for a Season 2, because after allMinecraft: Story Mode may seem like a Meme to some People, This game has a Special Place in my Heart. <3"
,Not Recommended,639170,33638096,Posted: 18 July,all,Monsen,"Based on Episode 1, the only one available at this time:Much the same as season 1. The game is bland and unimaginative, and the characters boring and forgettable for the most part, and with the exception of a few funny jokes, the dialog is far from impressive.Gameplay is almost non-existent, limited to a few quicktime events, holding W to go forward, and occasionally clicking a hotspot on the screen. Don't worry about having to think to figure out how to proceed either, the ""puzzles"" in the game almost solves themselves for the most part.I love adventure games, but IMHO this doesn't really qualify as one. Telltale have made some good games and some uninspiring ones, this is definitely one of the latter. If you are looking for just some way to spend time with minimal game feeling to it, I guess this is OK, just don't expect to have a whole lot of fun.Still wondering why I bought this at all, perhaps I just hoped Telltale would see the error of their ways and make this a better game than the first season.Added for Episode 2: Episode 2 is much as episode 1, just the characters are a bit more annoying, and the story is quite a bit lamer."

,Recommended,639170,33546923,Posted: 14 July,all,Bokor,"Minecraft never really needed a “story mode.” In fact, there is little in this that makes Minecraft so popular. There isn’t a large world to explore, and very little mining and crafting. As an adventure game, there really isn’t anything in the way of puzzles – no real head scratchers, at least.But the story so far is leaps and bounds ahead of where season 1 started – and sets solid bedrock for the rest of the season. The voice acting is good, and the story is interesting. The first episode of the previous season did not leave a good first impression, and when the first episode of this one goes free you can see the improvements they made.I recommend this because it’s more of the same from season 1 – but with all of the improvements in story and characterization that was apparent into the latter episodes of the first season.  Episode 1, so far, feels like a HUGE step in the right direction: an epic, self-contained single story that opens up a larger arc.I’ll be looking forward to checking out the rest of the season!Check out my coverage on Third Coast Review:https://thirdcoastreview.com/2017/07/14/game-review-minecraft-story-mode/"

,Recommended,639170,33472212,Posted: 11 July,all,EJGAMING,"This game is actually already better than the first one. The combat is much more exciting, interactive and difficult than the first. The story has improved a lot in its unique way that makes me just want to play more. The new characters are fantastic and I like them a lot and looking forward to the ""rivalry"" as it continues. I love the Crowd Play feature and it works very well. Many people judge this game because it is in the Minecraft universe, but honestly, its a good game on its own and would recommend checking this game out.Edit: Clearly I didnt explain myself. The combat IS NOT THE QTES. It is when you battle the mobs but pressing w, s and a and d to dodge and clicking to attack. The game has now put in stamina,dodging and now you have to spend your moves wisely to prevent yourself from running out of stamina. Maybe not a lot of other people will agree wth me, but I feel the combat has changed in a good way that makes the game more exciting and challenging."

76561198067668463,Recommended,639170,33467788,Posted: 11 July,all,Firedune,"Season 2 continues with the same great feel of adventure. Story mode isn't really.... a minecraft /story/. It's a Minecraft-themed rather campy adventure following jessie (you) and your close friends adventuring it up in a world built in minecraft, or rather using it's items as a framework. Story mode injects the life that the game is lacking and fills it using interesting characters in an interactive movie/story. If you like the first season, the second season (as far as episode 1 goes) cranks the world-building up to 11 and features, in my opinion, a fairly stacy antagonist who suprisingly doesn't seem to mess around.All-in-all, Season 2 is a reccomended buy if you liked the first season, it's simply more of the same intersting adventures,"

THERE WAS NO BOX FOR ALONE AND CONFUSED.I Have A Late 2012 Mac. Specs Are Here: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5, 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M 512 MB. And I Bought this game assuming that it would run smoothly because regular minecraft can run just fine on my mac and season one of story mode was no issue. And I don't know if it was just my computer, which I know is horrible for gaming but i do some light gaming on it, but literally every 6-7 seconds i would get a huge hiccup in the game and it would last for 1-2 seconds and then i would be 1-2 seconds farther ahead ion the game whioch was annoying but i put up with it. And as the story went on and there was more action the hiccups got worse until my computer just crashed and i had to restart it. Unless your mac is equipped with an i7 and 16gb or ram minimum then dont bother. i cant even play it. But those were technical issues. But lets talk about the actual game (of what i actually could play of it). The Game Is alright. At the tiume im writing this only episodes 1 and 2 are out and i bought the season pass. sorry for bad grammar and spelling by the way i have cherry mx speeds which suck for typing. Compared to last season it felt a lot more polished, a lot more complete and especially the fighting mechanisms were much improved. Still has the same cheap comedy which you laugh at even though its bad and you cant help it. Dialogue and choices are reasonable but i dont feel like the dialoguew was realistic in the sense that someone, besides a voice actor, would actually say. BUt altogether i had an okay experience but thought the game was nothing to blow portal out of the water in terms of story. i dont think telltale should have made this new game as it just wasnt need it but alas the search for money must continue. 7/10"
