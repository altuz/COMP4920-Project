This is what should be coming out for VR, thank you just when I was getting a little jaded with some of the VR titles I have played recently something this fun comes along.Will be my show people VR game from now on as most can relate to the old arcade games but this new take will blow them away. Talk about making someone feel like Rambo, I can't highly recommend this game enough to anyone who has VR and has been a long time gamer."

You feel like you did as a kid playing Operation Wolf.It's crashed a couple of times, but seeing as it's short levels, it's not a deal breaker. I recommend this highly, I think most people will love it.EDIT: I now have 3 stars in every level. The crashing seems lots less frequent since todays patch. Can't wait for more content. This really is one of my favourite VR games ever!!! Keep up the great work."

There are 2 arcade machines to enjoy...3D version to the right and Immersive version to the left...whoever thought of this concept is just brilliant...."

Don't let that put you off though ;)This game is by far the best VR experience I've had to date.  I'm old enough to remember the original Operation Wolf in the arcades. That machine got a lot of my 50p's I tell you.So what can I say about this game?1. Whether you have VR or not, buy it. It plays in 2D/3D on a regular screen as well.2. I got it in the steam sale for £8.99 but it's easily worth the full asking price.3. You build up a posse of NPC fans behind you. Virtual pals are better than none I guess.4. If you feel the rage after losing go for a walkabout and punch/push some of them over.  It's very theraputic.5. In VR mode you can almost stick your head in the screen to look around.6. Immersion within immersion.  There are various immersion points in all the levels that give you a different POV in the game.  This is amazingly executed in VR. I luvs the explosive <3 bow & arrows <37. It surpasses the original arcade game in many many ways, suffice to say, the game is awesome.One niggling issue is the game crashes out on rare occasions.Another bug is the game glitches sometimes in VR, making the view jumpy/shaky, which is a little off-putting to say the least. Thankfully it doesn't happen very often and when it does just restart the game. Not a huge problem as I said but will keep submitting bug reports.Whether you're into playing classic arcade or want fresh, fun challenges, then this game deserves a bit your time.Quite simply, this is an excellent remake of an 80s all time classic. It comes with my ""RaNDoM(PReCiSioN) Highly Recommended"" badge."

It is what it looks like: you go into VR and then into an arcade. If you were a teen in the 90s, you probably sunk some quarters into this baby. Nostalgia aside, this was a lot of fun. There are two modes (2 stand up arcade machines in fact), one for a regular version of the game with optional 3d mode (just shoot at the toggle) and the fully VR immersive. The 3d was a strain on my eyes (felt like I was going cross eyed) so I stuck with the VR.You can play like normal except you can defy some laws of somethin' and stick your head in the game to scan (and shoot) the areas. It was more fun that it sounds. At regular intervals, an ""immersive"" mode pops up - you shoot it - and bam! You are inside the game and in some kind of fight for your life. These immersive experiences vary from throwing knives, double uzi's, to (poorly) flying a jet fighter. And that's all I got to before logging out and writing this. This game is a keeper for me. Love the idea wouldn't mind seeing more old classics come back to life."

Classic arcade games are perfect for VR and Operation Warcade does an excellent job of recreating a classic arcade game.  Just buy this game, you will not regret it and if you get frustrated, you can always walk around the arcade punching people in the face.  :)Seriously, you just walk around and lay them all out.  They'll hop right back up and you can put them down again.  It's rather theraputic."
76561198003591090,Recommended,639270,33090135,Posted: 1 July,all,Blue Agave,The game is like a shooter at your local arcade but 10 times better.  A lot of mindless fun.  It has objectives that you need complete to progress in the game.  Looking forward to playing the newer levels.  The developers are actively improving and adding to the game.  This is my sleeper hit for VR gaming.
76561198130785717,Recommended,639270,32258380,Posted: 7 June,all,No Faux,"This is one of those games you show off to friends to try and get them into VR. It's incredible and most every mans fantasy as a child. However, I think people newer to VR will find this more fun, for us veteran players it may get a little boring after a little bit. I'll tell you this much, I have every intentions on finishing the game. It gives you a reason to play and that's what a lot of these VR games don't give. Purpose. At this price you can't beat it, so clever, so innovative."
,Recommended,639270,32339956,Posted: 11 June,all,Ayo Jube,"What a pleasent surprise! This game took me back to the days of dropping quarter after quarter on Virtua Cop and Time Crisis back in the arcades, love the immersive cabinet. Really creative take on an arcade shooter. If you're a fan of Arcade Light gun shooters this is definitely worth checking out. Rreally like how a crowd starts to form behind you the more you play."

Works great in normal 2 D mode. I also have a I5 4690K CPU, so it is not my machine. Please fix the obvious slowdowns. No other VR game gives me issues as this, and I own over 100.

There seems to be alot of content.It does have a couple bugs, it crashed a couple times.  But Im sure that will be fixed sometime...Here is some gameplay from the first couple levels...https://youtu.be/zMYTB_IZaPg"

The immersion arcade game is a really cool VR effect.  I don't even mind replaying levels trying to collect the stars as the game is a blast.  I've had the Vive for nine months now but playing this game made me step back and realize again just how amazing VR can be."

For anyone who has played an arcade game and now has a VR headset, this one is a must buy. How can it only have 10 reviews? I don't get it!Although this basically is a side-scrolling shooter, the take on the genre is unique and works well!Will definitely play more levels as soon as I have some more time :)"

A game maker in a game like this.As a rail shooter it works, a little pricey at just that maybe. But for those wanting to go back, the guys have nailed it here with the initial offering, and are taking good feedback from old heads on how to improve.Recommended to those that value the oldschool, and were allways wondering just how cool it could be 30 years later."

,Recommended,639270,34079824,Posted: 7 August,all,Sabanakle,Awesome Sauce!! Very well done. Little bit buggy in parts but i'm sure Devs will get it sorted. Very clever concept.
,Recommended,639270,34091457,Posted: 7 August,all,smartbombradio,"tl;dr if you played Operation Wolf buy this, and even if not if it's on sale and in your price range you should give it a try.This is a really fun game. It's hard to explain why it's good unless you played Operation Wolf, but if you did, it's that but the game sucks you inside for really exciting bits. You get 1/2 uzis for a rails shooting experience ala Time Crisis/etc based on a classic arcade shooter, but the game (If you choose) sucks you inside for parts of it and allows a 3d experience that makes it play a little different to the classic.Great, busy devs, a lot of updates and underplayed/underrated title. Worth a buy if you like arcade rail shooters even a little, and if you have any soft spot in your heart for Operation Wolf don't even think about it, bro.(Low play time is due to playing at a friends, bought a copy right away.)"
76561198036083973,Recommended,639270,34065745,Posted: 6 August,all,UberSwarbie,"Being of the generation that actually went to the arcades to play games, and remembering vividly the game this was based on, I was looking forward to seeing how this one translated in to VR.I have not been disapointed, with what I've found to be a very engaging game, easy to pick up and a bit trickier to master, with great fun immersive sections, where you really go VR into the game, driving the APCs, flying the jets and fighting infantry style, on the ground - brilliant.I love the fact you can just hang around in the video arcade between games, but it would be nice if the other arcade machines were operational as well, even if just simple 2d blasters, and more interaction with the other occupants of the arcade, but thats not really the core of the game, just window dressing so not something to knock points off for.Great game, worth the money, especially at 30% off which it was when I bought it.If you played this type of game 20 years ago in the arcades, this is IMO a no brainer purchase.Now please do a version of Time Crisis that looks/plays/feels like the original to keep the good old days posse playing and buying!"

Great concept (arcade/rail shooter) with very well done execution. Hard to explain it exactly, but it's simple but still very addictive gunplay. Excellent use of VR.If you like VR and rail shooters in the least, you'll absolutely love this. ;)"

These Devs. pushed out big updates weekly to bring this game out of early access in about 2 months, also multiplayer update coming soon!"

I mean, it needs polish for sure, but I was blown away unlike other VR experiences. Maybe it's because I actually dropped hundreds of nickles into Operation Wolf. Who knows?What I do know is that I'd highly recommend this game."

Got it in a sale so - value wise it was pretty good. Not sure about a full price game given the number of crashes I have had...Graphics are good enough for what the game is, accuracy is decent and some nice weapons to play around with (I like the sniper rifle)."

I have palyed simial games in arcades and this mimicks them really well with the added twist of being sucked into the game 1st person.Really funny to turn around and see all the babes cheering me on, bit odd though that they fall over the moment you touch them? Still funny though think the one in white has forgot her panties lol.A fun game - really enjoyed it for what it is - my growing audience is just a bonus."

Operation Warcade took every aspect of the old arcade game and improved on it with new and innovative ways to implement vr. Worth the 20 dollars.
