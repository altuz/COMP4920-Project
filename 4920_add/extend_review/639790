I guess as I age, I lose the quick reflexes that allowed me to triumph in so many games in my youth. But this game, this game with the incentive of shooting off a girl's clothing....this game has brought back my competitive edge. I find myself totally focused, totally in the zone, using every ounce of my attention span and relexes to beat each level at 100% so that I can witness each girl bereft of clothing.But what's more, by incentivising my play with the prospect of seeing anime girls naked, I've noticed that my reflexes and hand-eye coodination have evolved. My lizard brain, in an effort to obtain sexual gratification, has heightened my abilities to near god-like perfection. I see everything. I'm one with the game. My brain knows what to do before it even happens.I never knew the desire to see naked anime girls could push me so far. I'm a better, stronger man for it.Thank you, game. Thank you for making me better."

,Recommended,639790,34221626,Posted: 13 August,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"DEEP SPACE WAIFUis an outstanding addition to the adult game genre.Sure, there isn't a ton of content, but what is there is very high quality and certainly worth more than the small asking price. The most important aspect of adult-themed games is thatthe game is fun, and it is not just a collection of smutty artwork. Well,DEEP SPACE WAIFUis fun.Essentially, this is an arena shooter where the goal is to shoot all the clothes off the girl in the background.Is this the most solid shooter out there? Not by a long shot, but it definitely checks enough of the right boxes to keep me entertained for a couple of hours. It plays really well with either a controller or a mouse. There is a very good selection of options and difficulty and challenges. One minor flaw I found is that sometimes the bullets are hard to see due to blending into the background. Oh well, who cares.I think the best aspect of this game is that the whole thing has charm. There is a ton of little details that I'm quite impressed with. Things like the animations on the loading screen, and the 'intimacy warning' before the boss battle, and that pixel art city it shows. That's some really nice artwork. Plus lets not forget that the devs have added content since release, and are planning DLC, which I will most assuredly pick up day one.Pros:+The patch couldn't have been easier to implement; you don't even need to download anything+The game mechanic idea is fresh+The artwork is great and the girls look fantastic+Definitely a fun shooter which is super important with an adult-themed game+Nice game to 100% the achievements+Price is too cheap; this could have been ten bucks and I'd be fine with itCons:-Bullets can blend into the background; along that same thought - the bullet patterns could use a bit of work, but this is nothing deal-breaking-It is short, but hey, the price point reflects thatA must buy if you like adult-themed games."

,Recommended,639790,32189572,Posted: 4 June,all,Nai,The best $1.39 I’ve ever spent.When I play this masterpiece sometimes I feel like crying maybe due to the wonderful music or maybe because this is probably the reason I don’t have a girlfriend.But at least my space waifus are there for me *sobs*Edit:Okay for real I’ve had a lot of fun playing this and I’ve found it a bit challenging since bullet hell games are the genre I probably suck the most at (Bless you dev for adding an easy mode). So maybe if you’re experienced with these types of game you’ll find it quite simple? I don’t know.The art style may not be the best but it fits with the game and it’s cute. I really like the retro vibe it has going on.What I’ve enjoyed the most is the music. Even its repetitive I don’t get tired of hearing it and I'm glad they've released the soundtrack.Obviously if you’re not into the anime art style or don’t like the nude aspect of the game you may not find it enjoyable.But for the price I think it’s a fun little gem that I'll continue to play in my spare time.
,Recommended,639790,32095950,Posted: 31 May,all,ThreeSon,"Casual shmup meets waifu fantasy, in a Hotline Miami-style universe. Not enough gameplay varietyand several minor bugs, but nice presentation and low price.(Edit: The dev has been great about fixing reported issues.)Heavily inspired by While's 2001 PC gameSentimental Shooting. There are two objectives in each stage - shoot down ships to gain score and unlock more stages, and break apart the girls' clothing piece by piece.The artwork is censored by default, but there is aquick fixavailable, which worked for me.The best part about the game is the overall art style and presentation. Although it's derivative of Hotline Miami, it works well here and creates a pleasant, dreamy atmosphere which fits the mood of the game nicely. There are also some cool animation details - I liked the way the girls' hair flutters when shot by the player's ship, for example. I wish there were more of that.There are English and Japanese language options, but the voice samples are all in English. The voices are not unique for each girl (just one for all of them) which is disappointing, but since they don't say much it wasn't a big deal for me.On the plus side, the English translation is pretty good. This is seen in the Tinder-like profiles for each girl in the menu. They are brief but well-written and funny.There's not much music - only 3 or 4 tracks total I think - but it's high-quality stuff. It would be a nice bonus to have these songs available outside the game, if possible.The actual gameplay is mediocre at best. Shmup veterans will not be satisfied - it's too easy and the mechanics are too simplistic. There's almost no variety and only about 10 enemies total through the whole game, including bosses.There are also a lot of little graphical bugs that I encountered - corrupted stage backgrounds and misaligned sprites and such. The game will need a patch or two.(Edit: Not anymore.)Controller support is okay, although you can't pause the game with the controller - you have to hit ESC on the keyboard. I'm using a Dual Shock 4 so maybe XBox gamepad owners won't have this problem.In any case, the keyboard and mouse controls work fine (the mouse can only be used for firing, not ship movement).There are Steam achievements but no leaderboards. Normally leaderboards should be a requirement for any shmup on Steam, but in this case it wouldn't do much good because the scoring is too basic for it to matter.It will not take long to get 100% of the achievements if that matters to you. It took me just shy of 3 hours to unlock all of them, and that included a profile reset about half way through. For most players it should take a little over 2 hours.So then, weak gameplay but I still liked it overall. There aren't many other sexy shmups like this available, at least not on Steam. The only other one I know of isHeartomicswhich I haven't played yet.The uniqueness and the $2 price are ultimately why I think this is worth picking up. I hope it sells well enough that the devs consider a more ambitious sequel, with greater complexity and an expanded story."

Sometimes, you find games which are REALLY different on steam.Take this ""qix/gal panic/shoot'em up"" crossover for example. On the aesthetic level, it's a mess. The enemies' design is...ahem... bad  and the girls on the background would probably have been cast out of any respectable anime show.On top of that, there are very few enemy units, bosses are repeating themselves and the bullets patterns are obvious.So why am I keep playing this ?Maybe it's the low price tag, maybe it's the nsfw content ?I think it's simpler than out. Surprisingly, there's a good concept buried under all this junk.I hope someone will choose to refine it."

I got it during the Steam Summer Sales so naturally, I have the best version. I feel this game is well designed, even if the enemy patterns are virtually the same between each and every level, with each level just adding more and more enemies as it goes on. Using the mouse is surprisingly easy to do too. However, I have a bit of an issue with the graphics, which I expect will be fixed with the HD patch. Overall, I can describe this game as cheap, well sounding, surprisingly fun, and a bit off looking.Recommended."

,Recommended,639790,33256300,Posted: 4 July,all,Memox,"This is a very well thought troll game, but the problem is: it has potential. Even if it's clearly born to draw off your money, it's also true that with sales this game doesn't really cost you too much, so don't bother about it and buy it if you're interested. Speaking about sales, one of the women you'll undress is called Sumeru Sayru, you should seriously fight with her to understand what i said first, but it's also true that nevertheless that fight gave me a good LOL, literally.It's simply because this game doesn't take himself too seriously, nor for the bullet hell aspect and neither for the ""senran kagura"" feel of fighting2undress. Is not perfectly well drawn, the soundboard even if are indeed arcadesque are not so memorable, the bullet-hell it's not obviously at the level of the pillars of the genre but sincerely is not entirely bad either. In conclusion, do i suggest this game? Yes. If you're looking for something funny, without pretenses and you like the hybrid even a little, go for it. Sure, don't compare it with Touhou et similia, and you should enjoy it like the thing it is: a big little goldie of the indie ocean of videogames. These are times where no one dares to make something original, and this is the perfect case of an exception: an original game, maybe it's not perfect, but however we should seriously reward it, no matter what.

Fly a spaceship (kinda) whilst avoiding a ton of enemy fire whilst both shooting the enemies down for score and more importantly, also shooting the clothes off of a giant anime girl in the background... for science.Whilst I can't pretend the art is the best ever, its certainly not bad, and has a simplistic neo80's tint to it all, along with a very basic but pleasant and rather chill synthwave soundtrack.Content wise there are 10 ""stages"" to shoot the clothing off of, so if you are competent you can blitz through this game extremely quickly, but the game is also super cheap, and as such I'd consider it well worth the money.The default controls for the 360 pad don't match the onscreen prompts so you may want to rebind in the launcher (its Unity) if this proves to be an issue, and I've found the deadzone for the stick to perhaps be a bit small, leading to undesired movements on occasion though this is infrequent in my experience. And the main ""stage"" select screen is a bit awkward with a controller as it also looking at your mouse movement, so unless you center the mouse things can look a bit weird.All said and done, for the price I'd consider this well worth recommending to anyone with an interest in shmups, bullethell and lewds....oh and theres a ""patch"" to make everyone really nakeds and not fake steam nakeds."

The soundtrack is awesome and actually good for the mood and theme set by the game, the character designs are fantastic, not only the girls, but also the main character and enemies have an awesome design. It combines the trendy retro feel with more modern styles and sexy content.Do not expect to take this game too seriously, it is meant to be fun and enjoyable, if you are looking for one of those boring 2deep4you artsy games, you might not be interested in this gem.With that said, so far this has been one of my best purchases on Steam, in fact I added it to my favorites list."

It's a silly and dumb shoot 'em up, very well made and good to just zone out and have fun for a few hours.No big complicated story. You're just a guy on a flying motorcycle blasting enemies, while at the same time blasting clothing off of a selection of 10 anime girls, fitting all stereotypes, from J-Pop rocker to nerdy chick, all the way up to a cat girl and a princess. No upgrades, no experience, just shooting and using one of two power ups, a smart bomb or slowing time.There's two things to be worried about as you're playing. As you defeat enemies you rack up your score and get anything from a 1-5 star ranking. You need a total of 40 stars to have all the girls unlocked. At the same time, you need to destroy all the clothing to unlock ""One Handed"" mode for each girl, which is auto-fire and allows you to do whatever with your free hand.The achievements in the game are ridiculously simple. You get an achievement for unlocking each girl, for getting certain percentages of clothing removed up to 100% on each girl, and playing one handed mode and clearing one handed mode with each girl. As well the individual bosses giving an achievement upon defeat. Honestly I played the game for about 4 hours in a single evening and did everything there is to do. Considering the price, I'd say I got my money's worth.If you're bored and have a few bucks, fire it up and play it."

Both the visuals and the music stand out, and the soundtrack in itself is worth playing the game for especially with the low price tag.Actual gameplay: It's your typical heavy bullets game, except while dodging fire from the enemies you also have to focus on 'shooting' clothes off. Pretty cool, right?There's several difficulty levels and customization options so that you can play at a level you're comfortable with, making it ideal for veterans to the genre and noobies alike.TL;DR:- Tight, refined controls and gameplay- Naked anime chicks- Soundtrack you want to listen to even when you're not playing the game- Great art and visuals- Adjustable GameplayOverall a very great value for the price. 10/10, would waifu again."

The soundtrack is really catchy, the waifus are very hot, and overall, I like the fact that the game is like the populr arcade game ''Galaga'', only bad thing about this game is that you feel ashamed or embarassed while playing it, but a sad person like me is already used to such games, so uh. Also, the developers update the game on a monthly basis as far as I know, so that means, more waifus, more fun. There's an HD mode where you can see all your waifus in HD, but there's also a Retro mode if you really want to feel those Galaga vibes. You can choose if you want to play only with your mouse, your keyboard, or your controller, which I also really like. Once you get really good at the game, try doing the ''gentleman's mode''. Trust me, it's really challenging, but once you succeed, you get to marry your waifu.9/10, I absolutely enjoy the game.(Also, there's a special patch that makes the game even better, you only have to scroll down to see other reviews...

LOL A couple graphical errors(bike disappearing during skip scene), and some serious color match up issues. Like trying to dodge a yellow bullet thats on a yellow background(Invisible Bullets). I have avoided bullets that I could not see and I was like ""phew that was close"".I think the hardest thing to do in the game is actually try to ""explode"" the girls clothes on the first pass, your a sitting duck trying to hammer out damage to the clothes. Or you have 2-3 lazer powerups, and you dont want to kill the boss yet LOL. since theres clothes to destroy.Great game for the Price, to busy looking at the clothes trying to find the breakable parts, Which gets you killed ALOT lol. Only had one girl where I had to do a double take and look at the picture, Which made me lose completly where my bike was, I only realized that I died do to the sound effect. oops LOLI catch myself multiple times saying ""no, not really"" when the game asks me if im ready.Theres not much to the game, Two powerups, one dumb fire missile, the other a lazer that auto targets. three super powers....*Cough* Four since there is the BEST super power. LOL one power is the clasic bomb from all bullet hells, one thats a Slow, which you have to hold the button, and a Speed up, also a hold to use. One thing I noticed with the Slow power is that sometimes the enemies are unable to shoot their bullets, this also applies to some bosses. it was really noticable and easy for the last boss, since the only thing I had to do was dodge its beam weapon.All in all great short game. I can see some things being added. Like alternate powers, Multiplayer Coop, head to head score/100% disrobe clear kinda thing.Btw... I guess your some ""Bear"" riding a bike? to me it looked like a mouse, you know from biker mice from Mars kinda thing. so some of the dialogue threw me for a loop, when they were talking about some bear. I thought the bear was some evil villain or something.Enjoy :)"

The devs are also working on more content as I type this, besides the two new levels they added to celebrate the steam summer sale. It's a very much alive and cared for game, with a soundtrack to let you just relax the whole time you're playing it. Oh btw, If any man out there can actually 5 star and 100% any of the levels in any difficulty in one hand mode while doing something with their other hand, major props. If you're not good at multitasking your attention it can be a bit much to take in. There's the multiple kinds of bullets and occasionally beams of light shooting at you, the drones you have to avoid it all to shoot if you want to get 5 stars for the level and of course the clothing markers you have to wear down to get 100% on the level. So there is a lot to take in at the same time there. That's how the game feels, which was time and money well spent for me, can't wait for the next new content patches devs. Besides that though what you see in the trailers on this steam store page is what you get. So if what you see in the trailers doesn't look good to you I guess you should look for a game elsewhere.

Maybe that would expand the system of bullets disappearing once the clothes come off, so someone could weak every part of the clothes, to make the boss easy, if they know what their doing.The bosses could be rivals, with a bit of personality too.Maybe points could be converted into money to buy presents for the ladies, heck, a difficult system could be linked to clothes, the sexier and fancy the clothes are, the more layered it is, the more enemies there is, and said clothes are expensive so you gotta grind money up!And well, i mean, those are ideas, i'm not a programmer, but as it is, its a fun little game, and despite some glitches (this one time the game over screen wouldnt disappear even tho' i had reseted the stage, or enemies didnt appear, or bosses didnt have healthbars) it's pretty fun.Ps. Hey kiddos with jokes of ''man this is embarassing if someone sees me playing it'', so what? just own it, it's your life, i like anime girls, i find them cute, tbh their cuter with some clothes on, but f it. Tbh i'd be worried if my GF saw me playing it, but hey...♥♥♥♥."

Come on, that sentence is the sole reason you are even interested in this page, admit it.GAMEPLAYYou are the Bear King, riding on a space motorcycle, going on dates with all kinds of intergalactic women of all kinds. These dates are the game's definition of stages, with one girl acting as the backround for the stages. Enemies fly into the screen, which you must destroy. Actually, the enemies are secondary targets; the main targets are the parts of the girl's clothing, which would be torn apart piece-by-piece as you empty each part's HP. The more risque parts of the clothing, i.e. the underwear, can only be destroyed during boss battles. The battles themselves are not really difficult, especially if you are used to shooter games.Tip: a certain patch must be manually installed by the user to fully enjoy the experience.GRAPHICSThe illustrations are nice, although some illustrations are higher quality than the others. The game has a retro vibe to the interface.SOUNDThe soundtrack is quite relaxing, although after hearing the same tune over and over it gets somewhat annoying.Get this game if you enjoy casual shooting, or if you're a perv otaku like me.

Good ol' earning your nudity, with lots of pizazz and a good selection of lovely waifus.I only have a couple niggling complaints. The game bugged out a little when I was using a controller, freezing a bit when it was supposed to go back to the menu. Unplugging it and using the mouse fixed that.Also one of the girls is pretty much a swapped palette of an earlier one, but since they seem to acknowledge this by giving you the same level of intimacy with her, that's not much of an issue.Neither of these are game breakers, though, and this game is well worth the less than $2 I paid for it."

This has to be by far the most laid back shooter I had ever played, fantastic if you just want to blow stuff up and lose some stress.It looks great (the HD update helped) sounds great but it's not without it's problems.

Then look no further, Deep Space Waifu covers all that.0) Choose a Girl (stage)1) Select optional Ship Upgrades2) Fly around in a little ship3) Fire at enemies4) Shoot clothes of big-boobed Manga chicks.5) Destroy the boss at the endNude Manga Fanart imagery aside the soft retro graphics coupled with the fitting sounds of a typical 80s action movie sequence doesn't leave much to ask for.Personally I have completed 100 % including achievements in the above time spent on this game and let that be an indicator on how long it takes to complete all stages with 5/5 Stars. The gameplay is straight-forward and provides an intuitive flow which makes Deep Space Waifu almost-toddler-level-friendly (figure-of-speech, don't actually let your baby play) however even competitive-minded people will be able to satisfy their masochistic urges through being able to set new standards, reach better scores and improve over time.More than that gamers will be able to brag to their friends about having played a game that doesn't officially ""exist"" on gamer melting pots like Twitch.Out-of-the-box once a target's clothes have been shot down, models in this game wear underwear but a nude-patch is 'built-in' and as all one has to do is put a .txt file in one of the directories I feel like this is proof that the developer has a sense of humor which I find fantastic however some pervs may also benefit even more from 'One-handed-mode' this way albeit for me, One-Handed has become standard practice as my accuracy and response time is greatly increased when using just the mouse .... :^)All of these aspects combined make for an outstanding, tilt-free indie-title that will kill at least an hour or two of your time if you let it, provide you with conversational topics and considering the low price and unique gameplay Deep Space Waifu is absolutely worth the purchase."

The gameplay is rewarding in the sense that you get naked ladies if you do good. The game also has a one handed mode for thoseSWEET, SWEET LETTER ACHIEVEMENTS.

Just slap a .txt file in the files, name it ""nude.patch"" and you're good to go! That being said half of the'ginaswere great.Thats where the pros end and the cons begin, boy did I get plenty to type about here.1. The game is extremely glitchy. Thecharacterwaifu select screen is barely functional when using controller. The game once glitched and the game set the second to last waifu, the catgirl, at 100%'d even though I had yet to even attempt the level. When I was fighting the final boss I seemingly got killed by nothing, and a few times that stupid rainbow line seemingly teleported onto me. I've never spammed bombs so much in any bullet hell in my life. Then once I beat the final boss I was stuck on the ""Press B to go back"" screen forever. Pressing B did nothing so I alt F4'd. Remember when I said half of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s were great? Suprise the other half were an arbys sandwich. Another issue I got with the game is its so damn flashy call me a kotaku tier casual if you want, half of the time I could barely tell what is a bullet and what isn't.Overall, this game ispretty goodThingScoreGameplay6/10Art DesignLenny face/10Soundtrack7/10Overall; 6/10 Would reccomend."

Yes is a very sexual game but it a good one with great gameplay and great controls it hard yet rewarding if you play at the more harder difficulties. The only thing i don't like about the game sometime it soft locks and you have to restart the game or if you quit a mission you will have to see the whole intro again which it annoying but i can live with it. I recommend this game because is one amazing game and if you don't like the shoot em up kind of games just do it for the amazing vaporwave style soundtrack.

Is it just butthurt western artists jealous that an entire form of expression is locked away from them? Hentai is not just art; it is artistic expression in its most unadulterated form. Go to the Louvre and look at the Mona Lisa, tell me what you feel; angry? Sad? No, you won’t feel any of those, you might appreciate the talent of Da Vinci, and the line work or colours, but what does it make you feel? The best pieces of art carry real emotion, really making you feel with just strokes on paper. Hentai taps into the most primal of human feelings: lust. The very desire for all living creatures, the very meaning of life, represented in the succinct form of art. Some of the greatest moments of my life have been inspired from this art, and you have the nerve to doubt it because you’re some butthurt American mad you can only draw nonsense and call it “abstract”? Need more proof? Waifus. People are so infatuated with this art they go as far as to literally fall in love with it. Did people in renaissance Italy fall in love with the Mona Lisa and sleep with body pillows of her, desperate for the intimacy with their lover? NO! Because it lacks the true, raw emotion that Hentai has. Next time you think about saying Hentai “isn’t real art” remember the happiness it has brought people, and the raw emotions it inspires deep within. Don’t try and tear down another art form down just because you’re a Butthurt westerner who can’t draw for♥♥♥♥♥♥"

Stuff like the menu screens and such are kinda better than even the ones in Hotline Miami somehow(again not including the waifu art, which is just fine). However there isn't exactly much of it, what you see is the trailer is basically all of what you get so it doesn´t really compare. Yeah the 6-7 screens/transitions look kinda fantastic, but that´s still a very limited amount of stuff.Past that the gameplay is competent but lacking in enemy variety. The soundtrack is picked out very well and fits the look.For the price though I had a blast for a few hours and as said I´m not sure why but I massively dig the visuals so it was plenty worth the time/money."

I have to admit I bought it solely because of synthwave (and boobs) and the game was much more fun that I expected it to be.The sense of humor is great, the game actually looks much better when you play it than how it looks on the screenshots too. The mechanics are fun and have lots of potential imo.I loved the OST, it's one of the absolutely best indie game soundtracks I've ever heard until now. It took me 2 hours to complete every achievement, but the developer(s?) is working on the game constantly and adding new girls and updates which is pretty sweet.Although you can't really mod the game officially and create your own girls, which would be great.I really love this game and I hope the developer keeps going in this direction and brings us more stuff like this. Might be that it hit certainly in my taste, but I haven't had so much fun with a game in months or years."

I'm the 20 or so mins I played I already finished three of the girls... so if there's only 10 then this will be a really short game. (It's a shmup tho, so what were you expecting?)A few cons I've found thus far... I enemy layouts seem to be very VERY similar level to level, so much so it seems like you're repeating the some ""level"" over and over only with a different picture and stage boss that's changed. The second and third girls' pictures seemed almost reused. Same pose, just different face and clothes on top. **after playing longer, a lot of the pictures seemed like reskins. Same poses, just a different face or clothes**Even with the cons I've found so far I do recommend this game. Just seems like it coulda used ""another pass on level three""(i.e. a little more polish).Like I said before... In the end it's quick, it's good fun, and I'm loving the soundtrack. While it could use a little more polish, if you go in knowing that you're going to ""get what you pay for"" then you'll be fine. That's not meant to disparage the game, by the way.

The store page states, ""It's up to you save those poor girls from the alien clothing threat!"" From that description I expected it to be some wierd game where you fight diabolical aliens that are made of clothing, and you must liberate some girls from their grasp! With a cheap price below 2 dollars, it sounded like idioticly cheap fun.After I booted the game up however, I'm greeted to a title screen that simply says,""Deep space wife!""That's right, not ""waifu"", just ""wife""! With a name that has waifu in the title, I was expecting them to go all out weeb with the pronounciation but they didn't and now it's not as funny >:(Continuing on, I pressed start to play expecting a small introduction with the crazy backstory of some sort of alien clothing invasion enslaving the deep space waifus or some jig like that. There was just a level selector and choosing a girl and your settings just brings you directly into the stage with no introduction. Now it's even lless funny >:(But than I beat a stage and unlocked one hand mode. From what it implies and the achivement picture being of a hand, now the game finally became funny >:DAnd with that, I must now give a fair warning that playing this game can inflict a serious case of Wanchor's Cramp, the most deadly of British diseases!

Even if you're not an anime fan, you should try this out, especially if you're into retro games.For the 2.99 price tag, this game is a steal. I'd happily pay 5 for this.TL;DR Just ♥♥♥♥ing buy it."
,Recommended,639790,33332519,Posted: 6 July,all,devlkore,"When I was browsing Steam and saw the title 'Deep Space Waifu', I chuckled inside and assumed it was going to be a visual novel (which I have no interest in), but to my surprise, upon hovering on the icon it was tagged as a shooter. I clicked the link. I thought the music was kinda catchy and the graphics were bright and shiny, but nothing really gripped me. In the Summer Sale it was super cheap with the soundtrack and I was more than willing to pay less than 2 dollars for a few nice tunes and a game to provide ""teh lulz"".Cut to, my first play of the game. I wgenuinely did not expect to find more than 5 minutes worth of play time here, but the game mechanics, though simple are unique and interesting enough for me to actually want to play it. I also didn't expect more than generic fan service, so was glad to find some funny humour, both in the overall presentation and also the Waifu profiles.The basic gameplay consists of shooting specific zone of the prospective Waifu's clothing to tear/damage/remove them, while avoiding enemies and their bullet fire. Eventually a mid boss will apear and then after a ""Too much intimacy warning"" an end of level boss will challenge you.The game play is pretty smooth and the scoring mechanics are interesting enough. My one major grip with the game is the visual noise in 2 areas. The end of level bosses can shoot a laser and the while it's charging it shoots out a hail of bullets. The charging effect blends in with the bullet hail, so you really need to listen for the sound to have any chance of dodging said laser. The bigger issue is to do with the player hitbox. I'm pretty sure it's only the helmet of yourcharacter that can be hurt, but the light area on the handlebars kind of blends in when in your (my) peripheral vision.So, obviously this game has naked (though nippleless) anime chicks in it. If you like to fap it hentai, you will like this game.

Responsive controls and enjoyable stage designs, it just encourages you to keep playing until you run out of objectives - but the different game modes give you new challenges and that's quite nice as well. The ""eye candy"" isn't just a bonus, it's perfectly integrated into the gameplay itself.I can see myself playing this game on arcade centers of the 90's.Also, after you come around the fact that the even the own game doesn't take itself seriously, you can actually enjoy the jokes and puns.10/10, would shoot clothes off again."

I also like girls and good deals.Deep Space Waifu is more than worth the $2 I spent on it.Yes, it does have that stigma of being an ""Anime Tiddie"" game, but at its core, DSW is a lot more fun than I ever though I would have with it.There are a few snags. It can be a bit repetitive, the girls may resemble something out of an SNES Rom, and in the the later stages the Slow-Mo power is a must have, but there's a lot to love here.At it's core, this is a fun, fast paced, frenetic shooter with a great retro asthetic that I think deserves a look. Even if you don't want to shoot clothes off an immortal cat-girl from space, this is a great stylish shooter."

If it wasn't for the retro music and boobies, there wouldn't be much to recommend here. Your weapons never upgrade, you just gain new sidearms in the form of lasers or rockets. The game forces you to loiter at the bottom of the screen which becomes a problem when you inevitably succumb to one of the bullet barrages: Your sidearms detach ready to be picked up again but are off-screen before you regain control of your craft.Once you've got past the novelty of the nudity in this type of game, there's nothing to keep you coming back. The game is equal parts amusing and annoying.Also, one of the levels is broken and features random deaths for no reason, and it's impossible to get 100% on it.It's a pity there's no ""Meh"" rating on Steam as this game would undoubtedly deserve one.

It's a very basic space shoorter and as someone who's played a lot of them in the past I beat the game in around 65 minutes. My friend who was less experienced finished it in about 2 hours (both of us going for 100%).

It is however an adult anime game that can't be explained away to friends without basically saying ""yeah it's a perverted game but... 49 cents... actually fun... and gfy.""One concern would be the level with the two characters on it.   I was expecting a Chris Hansen super boss to jump out after the level ended saying ""why don't you take a seat over here"" and ask me what I'm doing here with a clothes destorying bear-cycle.

,Recommended,639790,34503855,Posted: 26 August,all,Rock Holiday,"The Huniepop of shmups it would seem.Simple, perverted, but addictively fun.  Not the usual low quality pervy stuff you find on Steam these days.  Pervy nonetheless though, and definitely shows more than you'd expect from a pervy Steam game, so be warned if you were hoping to get Youtube or Twitch viewers with this.I find it fairly challenging but I'm bad at games.  It feels easier than most shmups, so if you're good at them, you'll likely find this too easy to be enjoyable for long.For the price it's pretty great.  $1.99 as of this review.  $2.14 if you want it bundled with the soundtrack.There's a mode where you can make the game punish you for stripping the girls, so if you're anti-perv, it's got that."

But thing is, it has good retro music, good feel and some decent fun.Sitting a slow weekend or evening and looking for some fun in a game without having to think too much while having a laugh and some surprisingly good sound, this is hit the spot.Bite sized fun done right."
,Recommended,639790,34700881,Posted: 2 September,all,mithras,"I cannot believe that I am even saything this, but this is a really fun arcade shoot-em up!  It seemed like a ridiculous concept.  Seeing all of the positive reviews, I thought I would give it a chance.  As it turns out, the concept works really well game-wize.The object is to finish the level and shoot the background image girl's clothes off (or keep them on with Gentleman mode).  You finish the level by going through the different waves of aliens and beating the final boss (sometimes there is another boss earlier in the game).  If you beat the game, you get a snapshot of the girl.  How much clothes she is wearing in the end is determined by how many background clothes zones you were able to destroy.  You don't get a snapshot if you lose all of your lives but still destroy all of the background zones.  You don't get a completed snapshot if you beat the aliens but don't destroy all of the background zones.  The game moves all around the background girl giving you multiple opportunities to destroy zones.What makes this interesting, game-wize, is the balance involved.  You will reach background zones that require X damage to destroy and remove a chunk of clothing.  Sometimes you will get three or four zones at once.  However, you are being shot at by aliens.  These aliens are different types, different speeds, and different shot abilities.  Plus boss enemies.  There's a balance in figuring out when to shoot the background and when to shoot aliens.  Spend too much time shooting aliens, and you will not destroy all of the background zones.  Destroy all the background zones but die doing it, and you will not get a snapshot.  It's pretty satisfying when you can line up an alien with a zone to get a two-fer.Despite the fact that this is adult themed plus a patch that can make this even more adult, it's a very fun arcade game.  I love match three games, and Huniepop is actually a very good and very challenging match three game with an adult twist.  I would not have bothered with Huniepop if were not a good game.  Deep Space Waifu is actually a decent and challenging arcade game with an adult twist.  It doesn't have a story, but it's a very fun and rewarding game."

This game is cheap too, so why don't give it a try?I don't expect too much at first, maybe just another cheap & boring shoot 'em up that have trading cards. But then, wow!, this game is actually good. Have original concept: destroying your date's clothes instead of only shooting enemies.Replayability good to, after you defeat your girls you can unlock one hand mode (autofire) and you can play with them again and have other hand free to do something ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). And each level isn't take too long to complete, it's rather short actually, for me it's just at right length to not make me boring. They just release HD mode, so you have 2 pics of your girls: HD/3D-ish and Retro/Toon-ish graphic.The highest difficulties is really fun too, it's challenging. Try it yourself.The soundtrack is great, will buy it later because I almost feel bad for buying this game with discount, lol. I think if this game priced $5 (or a bit more) people will still buy, $2 is too cheap imo."

For some reason when I would hit the back button on my controller at the end of a level, it would throw the ""final snapshot"" to the top right of the screen and it wouldn't back out. This was easily remedied by switching to the mouse quick and clicking the button, but it was a minor annoyance. The other bug was at the beginning of the game where it asked what controller I had. When I went to choose it bugged out and I had to remedy things again by temporarily switching to the mouse until I got to the main menu. Again, easily remedied and not a game breaker, but a minor annoyance.For 2 bucks you really can't go wrong. The shooter aspect of it is fun and addictive and the cute anime ladies are like an icing on an already delicious cake. It's over the top, cheeky, corny as all hell, and just plain fun. :D"
