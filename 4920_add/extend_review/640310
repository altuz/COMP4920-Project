,Not Recommended,640310,32587733,Posted: 20 June,all,Brad,"Dear Developer,I've tried my best to appreciate your game, however it feels like something someone would make whilst watching a youtube tutorial video and then released it, for whatever reason. I can't help but feel sorry for all of the poor souls that have bought this 'game'(It's definitely not a game). The developers of this game should feel ashamed for releasing this for money. This is something a child could've made in about half an hour in unity. I'm going to report this game and highly suggest you never post another piece of trash like this, or perhaps if you're going to release another game like this, make it free. Now to all of the glaring problems;1.) The enemies AI is atrocious, all they do is run forward at you, from what I could see, if there are any other advanced AI beyond that, I really couldn't care to progress any further.2.) The 'guns' feel like pea shooters and definitely do not stand up to being able to fight the endlessly enlarging hoards of horrible zombie AI.3.) A blank white texture isn't snow. A normal map does not fix this.4.) Why are you making an on-rails shooter.5.) The voice acting at the start is really really poor, I'm positive they've transition through a fake Russian accent, to american to Chinese and back again. Why? Was there any screening?6.) This is just a nitpick, but maybe you should have not used base unity assets?7.) Why did my pistol turn into an M16?8.) Why does there need to be 5000+ achievements, is that even a feature? They're all the exact same achievement.9.) There is no game-play. I could have made a better game myself in assembly.10.) Zombies colliding with the tank does not always degrade your health, why? (Why do zombies getting run over by a tank hurt the guy standing in the top of it?)This game is literally the E.T. (1982) of the modern era of games. Games like this ruin people's opinions on the games industry. Once again, please feel extreme shame for releasing this.Sincerely,Your local sandwich stealing seagull"

Repetitive and boring are just a touch of the thing are in this game. The aiming is awkward the zombies look terrible and the game just feels like a quick cash grab by a greedy developer."
,Not Recommended,640310,32618034,Posted: 21 June,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"From Idea Cabin, the same publisher/developer masterminds that brought the Steam world the achievement-filled Employee Recycling Center, comes another cash grab attempt of a game; this time in the guise of an ""early access"" title. Drive-By Hero is a zombie themed on-rails shooter, meaning that any movement not pertaining to the gun is automatically done for you.Right now there are three short, but ridiculously difficult, levels that all look the same. Your military jeep, or tank, or whatever you're in, drives down a tree-lined street as the same three zombie models spawn in hordes and you pick them off one by one with your gun; at first you'll have a pistol, then it upgrades into a machine gun. There's also no sound except for some generic zombie growls and really bad shooting sound effects.The first level is easy enough, but the end of the second level and the entirety of the third is far to difficult, to the point of becoming infuriating. You can only take four hits before you're forced to restart the entire stage, and on the aforementioned levels at some points zombies spawn in such big and frequent packs that it's impossible to kill them before needing to reload your weapon. It's only by sheer luck that you end up pulling through.Even for an early access game, Drive-By Hero is pretty awful. There's not even a start menu, the game just throws you directly into the ""action"" before you can even grasp what's going on. There's also no save feature, so if you do manage to get past a certain difficult area and need to leave or close the game, too bad for you. This title is just more achievement spam fodder to line the developer's pockets, it's doubtful if they have any true intention of improving this mess.Rating:0.5/5.0- Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

I don't know exactly what part of me is sadistically thinking i'm gonna buy this or that or, it can't be that bad, not for a few bucks anyway, however this ""Early-Access"" game is most likely never going to be developed to the stage that it's going to get out of Early access and part of me doubts it was never the plan anyway.Don't know why i even bother beating a dead horse at this point, or where to start. Maybe to warn others of not wasting your hard earned money on utter crap like this, and trust me, it is absolutely just that. It looks like storebought assets from start to finish, lazily glued together which might be the case, there's little to no gameplay or anything else for that matter. How this got what-should-be-a-F2P-title got into steam in first place, baffles me, or actually doesn't. It's on the marketplace to get a share of your money with a product where there is no effort put into place at all.But do yourself and others a favor and avoid this at all cost."

,Not Recommended,640310,33419401,Posted: 9 July,all,Blade,"This is easily one of the worst games on Steam. A high school computer science project using pseudocode and free assets circa 2005 is not something you should pay money for, even though it's obviously a cheap achievement grab game. You don't even get a menu, you just restart the game automatically and attempt to shoot terrible looking zombies in an almost bare environment. BUT THEY PUT IN A BOSS, AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY A FEW TURNS (SPOILERS I KNOW)!Many of these are the same achievement x 100. I honestly didn't realize I was on another level until the ""boss"" and achievement for beating the first level appeared. It's atrocious, like ""I miss the Digital Homicide library"" atrocious. We never knew how good we had it with terrible games, until now."
,Not Recommended,640310,35089369,Posted: 20 September,all,Intelligence,"Awful game. It's just a basic Unity On-Rails Shooter with tons of achievements simply for shooting bullets, killing 10 enemies without missing and killing ""The Boss"". All of which is relatively easy."
,Not Recommended,640310,32614845,Posted: 21 June,all,Redbeard,"I almost recommended Drive-By Hero, as I enjoy games where you have to shoot down the zombie hordes, but the gameplay got repetitive really fast.If it was being sold for 50 cents, I probably would have recommended it, in terms of value for money - but currrently the game costs $1.99 (I bought it on sale for $1.39), and it's way too overpriced for what it is.The game would be reasonably priced if it cost somewhere between 20 to 50 cents.The enjoyability of this game is very low, but that could be forgiven if it was correspondingly cheap. It's just not a very good game.You drive along a street in an armoured vehicle, shooting an M16 at groups of approaching zombies.There is not very much detail to the zombies, and the streets themselves are very sparse.And you can't control the vehicle at all; all you can do is turn around and shoot from the one position - all the time, over and over again, ad nauseam. Boring.The zombies come thick and fast, and it doesn't take long for them to reach your vehicle, because of the time spent reloading your weapon (even though it is quite quick to reload).If five zombies touch your vehicle, then you have to restart the level - because apparently five people (dead or undead) touching an armoured vehicle will destroy it.Who would have thought it?And there was me expecting that my military-style vehicle could've just run the zombies over - shows how little I know.This is yet another one of those achievement-crazy games (we seem to have had a fair few of them appear on Steam this year) which give players hundreds of achievements for doing almost nothing.You get lots of achievements in this game just for shooting bullets, irrespective of whether you kill zombies or not.Also, many (if not all) of the achievements are duplicates; for example ""A Protector Awakens (Begin the game)"" is actually 89 achievements.That sort of thing is great for achievement hunters, but it doesn't impress me much - and, to me, it certainly says a lot about the games' developers (I won't say what it says about them, but I'm sure that people can make up their own minds).Funnily enough, even though getting hundreds of achievements in this game was very easy, I found that getting up to the next level wasn't that easy at all.I beat level 1, with some difficulty, but I haven't beaten level 2 at all yet - too many zombies and too much time spent reloading (or maybe I'm just a poor shot).Getting up to level 3 seemed a bit too hard to me, so that was just another annoyance I got from the game (maybe some people might think that I am giving this game a bad review because I have a case of sour grapes, but no; it's the game itself that is sour).All up, I just didn't find the game to be fun.It was repetitive, boring, and annoying.Whilst I will probably revisit this game at some later stage to try for level 3 again, and/or finish off some more achievements (because that's what I try to do with games), I feel compelled to warn others that the game is a load of rubbish.If I was aware of how bad this game is, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place.Perhaps this game was made by zombies for zombies; because you would have to be brain-dead to enjoy it.If you are a real live breathing human, I recommend that you don't buy this zombie game.Spend your money on something more worthwhile - maybe go to your local butcher shop and buy some brains to eat; no, wait, don't do that, you might turn into a zombie and make a game like this.Oh, well, whatever you decide to do with your money, just don't use it to buy this steaming pile of rotting flesh."

Pricetag for the value is absolute crap.Where to begin? Unity of course, so we can pretend the game will look and feel like garbage. The go-to of the poor indie darling developer ""teams"" yet again with another shovelware title and this was a doozie. No start screen, no options, no true story besides (you are a soldier with best aim, kill zombies).The gameplay is rather weak, it is a typical on-rails shooter where you the player play ride-along with a poorly crafted rifle which is missing chunks of pixels on the weapon itself, hitting a zombie in your armored vehicle causes harm to the player for reasons. This low grade rip-off comes with 3, just 3 levels, all which can be completed in about 2 minutes. It has a single ""boss"" if you can even call it that. It throws a rock and summons zombies. After the boss kill the game gives you props for doing the shooting and forces itself closed. The game kills itself off instead of looping or taking you back to the beginning, thus to farm the 6000 achievements requires multiple loads of the title.What the ♥♥♥♥.Besides that it comes with cards, requires no skill or cognitive thinking so....the kids will love it."
,Not Recommended,640310,32690577,Posted: 23 June,all,FatalThornz⛄,"On-rail shooter with generic zombies. However the hordes of zombies happen to be spammed at random spots without care for balance, making some segments almost impossible, especially without options  to move the gun faster with mouse sensitivity than whats allowed (slow.)  let alone any options other than close the game, and restart.The zombies and the entire game almost looks like an asset flip. Doesn't help that there's achivement spam as well. At most effort was making the achivements need more than just RUNNING THE GAME in the background, but even then its obnoxious to do so as the amount of shots needed to get all the achivements are almost a huge waste of your precious time on this earth. At least those games had respect for you're valuable time, as horrible a compliment that is."

,Not Recommended,640310,32887375,Posted: 27 June,all,Larry Chupacabra,"Not much to say about this title. Its cheap and it plays like its pretty cheap or very very early raw stage of development. You play as a character in what looks like an old reused WW2 jeep (on railes shooter style) and you mow down Zombies with your machinegun. That's about it. The only meaningful challenge is having large numbers of Zombies thrown at you that overwhelms your ability to shoot them. You'd think that would be a good opportunity for the developer to give you a Grenade or something similar, but not really, just hose the zombies down faster.https://youtu.be/-BcFFkVuuTAThe game itself has a suspicious set of graphics that leads me to wonder if this is one of those Asset flip games. Which a number of Youtubers constantly complain about. Where a developer snags some premade graphics either on the Unity store or from somewhere else and slaps them together and puts it up for sale in a semi playable state. Im not 100% sure on this but it does look suspicious. This is compounded by the fact they just toss a slew of acheivements at you every time you shoot X number of zombies.At this point I can't really recommend this title. The gameplay gets stale almost immediately and lacks any real depth. It is possible however that this is just e very early build of the game and that Idea Cabin might add more later. So maybe stop back and see if anything has changed."
