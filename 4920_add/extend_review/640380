The gameplay is INSANELY fast-paced, and surviving for more then 10 seconds takes some serious hand-eye coordination. The soundtrack is awesome, and fits perfectly with the game's pace. The retro style is a really nice touch, too.This game is honestly a must-have, especially if you've been searching for a proper adrenaline rush.Just go and buy it already. It's worth it."

That'd give me a reason to set the ability on something other than circular. Maybe an audio cue for when the ability is about to fire? It's pretty hard to time and aim as it is...Difficulty is fine for me. Just about the same as before, only I've gotten better with the game. Could also have used new sounds and OST, as well as visuals, but for the price, the game is a steal.Recommended. Grab the collection, Ubermosh has earned it in my book."
76561198194448218,Recommended,640380,31998258,Posted: 27 May,all,Walrustastic,"UBERMOSH (for those who don't know) is a 90 second arcade style arena with you playing as a blade saint on an alien planet, the 5th installment in the series (with the very original and imaginative name vol 5) is both the hardest and the most enjoyable. The graphics are what you expect from a game in this genre, and the OST is one of the best in video game history.This version has the most going on, with you being the most overpowered in any game, and the same being said for your enemies, this is an open field one. On top of the brainclap system from black, and the manastrike system from wraith, you now have another system, either ANOTHER death beam or a shield. The shield is a waste of time to me but you might find it useful. The death beam is slightly worse of a screen clearer than brainclap, but still helps in a sticky situation. The system of having that green arm thingy i haven't noticed in combat, but i'm sure it helps with the guns, the enemies are slightly harder but so is the protagonist to make up for itI have a few complaints though. There should be a way to turn the sound down, as it can be a bit loud at times. and i never know when a brainclap, manastrike, or whatever the new thing is called will activate, so countdowns would be nice. and i would also like the option to toggle between open field combat and the thing from the first 2 games.  Multiplayer would be a nice feature in future games as well as maybe a campaign story later on (because the whole idea of the blade saint and the desert of ulta-kaan is a brilliant idea).In closing, get this game, its not perfect, but its the most fun and the most chaotic, which is the spirit of ubermosh. also i feel bad because i bought the ulta-kaan collection when it was on sale for £0.95."

,Recommended,640380,33203348,Posted: 3 July,all,[ Maxie ],"What can I say about this entry of UBERMOSH that I haven't already said in a previous review? Let's just say that this series got me into fast-paced bullet hell shooters. And Vol.5 certainly adds more to not just the fast-paced action, but more to our heroine, the Blade Saint.Difficulty-wise, it's slightly easier than Wraith with the addition of the Shield and Melter abilities, but only very slightly. It still takes skill to last 90 seconds in this arena of madness. Underneath it's still that UBERMOSH gameplay that we all know and love, with more being built on with each instalment.One thing I do want to see though: I want to see more established lore! I want to know more about the Blade Saint's journey and a timeline has already been established (with SWARMRIDERS, then the original UBERMOSH, then BLACK) so I'd want to see some more on her story and how she's developed.Still, yet another solid entry and hats off to Walter Machado!"

,Recommended,640380,34362691,Posted: 19 August,all,ARC Tesseractium,"UBERMOSH Vol.5 is a fantastic indie game. It combines unique gun and swordplay with fast paced movement and an equally fast soundtrack which ties the game together and brings it from good to great. One can use keyboard and mouse controls or a controller. I cannot speak for controllers (I don't own one), but the controls on keyboard are tight and responsive, as are the mouse controls. While the game is difficult to learn at first, you soon will find the combination that works for you, and discover how the AI opponents move. I would personally recommend purchasing the UBERMOSH collection, as the storyline to the UBERMOSH series is spread among all of them.and the dev is awesome.I will edit this to include controller support as soon as I can access one."

(after getting one of course)The game in itself is a great, high-speed, rampage top-down shooter which needs full concentration, but is overall much more fair and fun than the previous installments, because compared to those it's far less random. Overall it is a nice little game for a great price, for the moments when you feel wide awake and concentrated."

I would recommend it, first of all, to ones who didn't play older, harder versions. I read and re-read Walter's notes about ""cloned attack"", but for me it was perceived just as Green shoots and slices at 2x speed (except the Gunner class which shoots at instane rate). The game is still fun, but it took me only 78 minutes to get all achievements, - on hardcore mode! - and this is first Ubermosh where I dared to peek at pop-up notifications from IM and didn't got punished for that. Rate of semi-automatic fire is such that with better or best gun you can successfully maintain ""Inbox 0"" strategy by keeping your screen clear of enemies.  So after completing Volume 5, I felt strong urge to download and play Ubermosh 1. Another small notice: the only way to hear great intro soundtrack is to play Tutorial. Why it isn't included in regular games? Anyway, big thanks to the author, and, as always, looking forward for the next release!"

Get it if you really liked the earlier games, but there's not too much new.Suggestions:1) Make/add enemies with more health, currently there's a binary between shielded (run away) and unshielded (run towards). It would make for a little bit more stimulating gameplay.2) Remove some obsolete guns, I guess it could be a skill thing if you need dodge bodies to avoid picking up a worse gun, but some that are apparently interchangeable on the gun 'tier' list are definitely worse.3) Remove class distinctions entirely (!), maybe make a set of sliders for powers you can exchange for a certain amount of lives. (3 lives for gunner auto, 1 for increasingly powerful map clear).I would still recommend this, but if there are future volumes I'd love some of the above incorporated."
