Having said that, the levels did get dificult enough to give a good sense of sattisfaction when completed and one or two managed to really get me thinking for a few minutes. To be fair the developer does give an honest time in his description but take your time and enjoy the graphics and the marvelous physics and it will give you at least a couple hours of real enjoyment.Overall a great little game, very sattisfying to play and well worth the price!!"
,Recommended,642560,33072899,Posted: 1 July,all,power8888power,"This game is a little puzzle game that based on physics, somewhat alike to Zup series, but with more brain. Just like previous games from the same devs, it's balanced and well designed. Gameplay about 2 hours, difficulty from easy to challenge, introducing new mechanism step by step, smooth learning curve. I'm quite surprised this game is so unnoticed because this devs' previous games all have thousands of reviews which are overwhelmingly positive. It's totally worth 1 dollar if you like simplism puzzle game."

,Recommended,642560,32417041,Posted: 14 June,all,DELTA,"Got this game for 10% off, few recommendations and an interesting idea. Got it, played it and was both thrilled and very satisfied by the puzzles and the physics of the game.No instructions are given, yet none are needed. Everything explains itself perfectly, provided you are prepared to experiment. So I would say that this is a game for relaxation, more than anything else, as everything is perfectly crafted and presented. It is not hard, it is fun, and that is what I enjoy about it.PS: level editor would be a lot of fun9/10"
,Recommended,642560,33216270,Posted: 3 July,all,Fang11803,"ka-BOOM!This is a pretty nice puzzle game. I really enjoyed the breaking noises that the blocks make when destroyed. I think my one nitpick would be that there should be a more simple method of selecting levels that you want to redo, instead of scrolling through each one (if there is such a level selection menu, I haven't found it). Simple puzzles, but it's satisfying to solve each one."

,Recommended,642560,32419912,Posted: 14 June,all,ChocolatierGames,"I am up to my ears in complexity when it comes to covering games, and it is nice to take a break from those games to a simple puzzle game. The game isn't super difficult, and I never found myself taking more than 5 tries on each level. The levels are designed to be easy to complete and make you feel smart after you beat them.The graphics are also simple, not making use of flashy or particularly great art, but the ambient sounds and associated music are fairly chill and fun to listen to while you solve simple puzzles.The physics in Art of Gravity isn't anything new, and we have no shortage of physics games, that being said, these physics are pleasant to watch. I'm not sure if it's the slow motion, or the pretty patterns the voxels create; but either way, it is incredibly fun to watch. This alone helps the game be fun, as it helps you gain a sense of completion after you beat each stage.Overall, Art of Gravity is exactly what it says, it's all about gravity. It is an entertaining game that gives you a solid stream of content throughout its levels. The art is basic, but the music and sound effects are good, and the levels are all unique, and I can see myself coming back to this game. With this in mind, Art of Gravity earns itself a 7 out of 10 with a label of ""Satisfying""."

Feels more like it should be an iPhone game or something else portable. But for the price ofc its worth it. Maybe it could come in handy for queueing in other games or on the bus.

,Recommended,642560,33293998,Posted: 5 July,all,Lusty Argonian,"It's great fun smashing up a puzzle like this, leaving only what still needs solving standing.One MAJOR downside though is that, because the game is physics based, solutions occasionally  fail. This means you'll start looking for a solution while you already had it. Certain levels (Especially the more complex at the end) even had orbs deflecting of cubes in different directions depending on the camera angle.If it weren't for the randomness, it'd be perfect."

,Recommended,642560,33302253,Posted: 5 July,all,Baroque,"75 levels, but only the penultimate 10-15 will make you think. Fun and rewarding physics when completing a level. Overall the game was very enjoyable but too short, less than 2 hours. Still for a buck it's worth your time. Hopefully a sequel or expansion will be made at a later time."

For 1€ you are getting a statisfying, well designed physics puzzle game which lets you wanting more after completion. It could be a little bit longer imo, but for the price it is a nice, short puzzle experience."

You have to play through the easy stuff at the beginning to get the hang of it. It gets better as you go. Worth more than the price I paid. If you want to use your brain instead of your trigger finger get this you well love it."

For a few dollars your getting a lot of polish though, and I cant not recomend it.  This is better than the majority of puzzle games out there."

,Recommended,642560,34863744,Posted: 10 September,all,"RebelD, Empress of Death","A fun little puzzler that feels way to short! The concept is simple and beautifully executed. You launch different balls at a variety of different boxes, bombs, and launchers and try to remove all pieces from play. There's a limited amount of balls at your disposal, but each level is easy to complete, including earning all achievements (they all require you to complete a particular level with at least one ball left in store). At first, there is a little bit of a learning curve as you learn what each type of ball does and how it interacts with the other puzzle components, but its not terribly difficult and if you mess around a bit, you'll quickly learn. There's an undo button in the event you launch in the wrong direction and each puzzle presents a unique challenge. Overall, I found it quite enjoyable though I wish it was longer and had more puzzles.Pros:+Pleasant Atmosphere+Ambient Music+Attractive Graphics + Satisfying Demolition+Easy Achievements+Quick+ImmersiveCons:-Short (Only 75 puzzles; Wish there was more, a sequel, or expansion)Mehs:-No tutorial (though a little messing around and you'll figure everything out.Overall, I'd give it a 9.8 out of 10 and fingers crossed for a sequel!"

76561198314759977,Recommended,642560,35461296,Posted: 3 October,all,Psychosomatic,"In short, this game was a wonderful experience. It is definitely a game for someone who likes a bit of a challenge, and what better way to excercise one´s mind than by playing a puzzle game. I will just cut to the chase and mention  its pros and cons as briefly as I can.Pros:-Beautiful, yet simple design-It challenges your mind-It's cheap-It actually delivers a sense of accomplishment- Enjoyable destruction-Its difficulty is on point-Very addictive indeed-It is a good way to distract and de-stress one´s mind-Very well programmed (No glitches or anything of that sort)-Immersive music-Sharp graphics-A very good level design, and some interesting interactive levelsCons:- More achievements? Although I know its hard, given the nature of the game.-I will definitely have to concur with some of the other reviewers. More levels! The experience was awesome and left me wanting for more.Overall: 9/10 Because I thought it needs more levels. It would be great if they actually added more to it.If you like the puzzle genre this game is a must, and if you don´t like it then you sure as hell should give it a try!"
