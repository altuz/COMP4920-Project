Cheap, ugly and simple unity assets fused and packaged in 339mbI started in a small piece of sh ... space, messing around and unlocking a few achievements, shooting some asteroids and some kind of enemy spaceships ... i guess?, getting tired about this when i realized that somehow i've unlocked every single achievement (1544 in total but i only saw less than 10 pop up ftw), then i searched on forums thinking that was a bug but, yup, it wasn'tSteam is a gaming plattform where you can play games, am i right?, or at least it used to be, so i don't know how can a thing like this can be released and called itself an action gameNot for gaming purposes nor positive points to get it, except to get 1.5k achievements in less than 10 minsFinal Rating:🌟☆☆☆☆"

,Not Recommended,643600,32054735,Posted: 29 May,all,Chaken,This game sucks. Game manages to lag even though it looks crappy and the gameplay is awful. It takes over a minute of shooting an enemy to kill them and obsticals just randomly appear in front of you. Game is obvious achievement bait. Takes about 10 mins for 1400 achieves

,Not Recommended,643600,32044989,Posted: 29 May,all,twidget,"WTF is this POS doing on Steam?In less than 20 minutes I got all 1544 achievements.All without killing a single enemy or knowingly upgrading any weapons (I'm still not sure if I did or didn't upgrade anything).LMB fires and RMB changes weapon.It's assumed you'll figure out the WASD controls.I tried a wired 360 controller just for the hell of it and no joy.If you're looking for any easy and cheap (currently $.69 USD 30% off) 1500 plus achievements, this is the game for you.Requesting refund."
,Not Recommended,643600,32051253,Posted: 29 May,all,KyleKidd,"First Impression Gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_HOBt0oXxoCheap price with extremely cheap gameplay.  Unless you want a ton of achievements without actually achieving something, then I'd recommend a hard pass.You basically fly around in space with a top down camera, avoid randomly spawning asteroids, and occasionally fight a bunch of enemies or a space station.  There are a handful of weapons that may or may not do different amounts of damage.  Doesn't seem to matter much, as you can shoot an enemy for over a minute before they finally explode.Graphics are very simple, with lighting on the asteroids being the only real redeeming quality.  There is music sometimes, but it gets drowned out by the loud pew pew lasers.  If you manage to accidentally touch another ship or wander out of bounds you instantly die.  Micro stutters are present and can be a bit jarring.For some reason there is a huge delay when navigating menus.  Also the game freezes when trying to exit.Distinct lack of fun.This is a hard pass for me.  Only grab if you want to get 1544 achievements in about 3 minutes."
,Not Recommended,643600,32130941,Posted: 2 June,all,Redbeard,"As far as achievements go, Quadrant M4 is one of the weirdest games I've played.There are 1544 achievements.You can get the whole lot of them in a few minutes, even if you don't move from the starting point.It took me 4 minutes to get achievements 1 to 22.At first I was shooting at passing asteroids, testing the different weapons, and trying to figure out how the game works, and then I noticed that the achievements were racking up even when I wasn't doing anything. What the?That's right, you get achievements in this game just by doing nothing.Perhaps they're special achievements for idling?After all, doing nothing is a highly specialised technique - I've been working on that ability for years now, devoting at least 6-8 hours every night to that particular skill-set.By the way, there is no achievement 21 or 23, as it looks like the developer couldn't even be bothered to number the achievements properly; in fact, after achievement 25 the rest aren't even numbered at all.So, the first few achievements were dead easy.Then I read a post which said you just need to restart the game to get the rest - so I restarted the game and almost instantly got every other achievement in the same minute (possibly in the same second, as it all seemed to happen at once).That's just ridiculous, getting 1544 achievements for doing nothing; even worse, getting 1523 of them simultaneously.Maybe it's all very nice if you are purely an achievement hunter; but, seriously, that's not what games are about - or, at least, it shouldn't be.Crazy, man, crazy.#AchievementCrazy"

Paid 10 cents for something equivalent to a mobile app quality game that throws every achievement at your face.  If you want to kill about 10 - 15 minutes then this is entertaining.  Anything you're hoping for beyond that doesn't exist.

TRASH.Cons:>Windowed mode is horribly scaled.>It's even an ordeal to get into the game, you have to click the ""Play"" button in just the right spot or nothing happens.>Unfinished/unused info panels are visible if you click the icons around the minimap.>Controls are floaty at best, even for a space-based game.>No explaination on what to do unless you somehow hit the ""E"" key to bring up a bland, lifeless info panel.>Too much else to list, you get the picture by now.Pros(?):>You get all the achievements in about 5 minutes so you can uninstall this atrocity.Conclusion:This is shovelware, plain and simple. It's only reedeming (if you want to call it that) quality is a LOT of achievements you get for doing nothing. It looks and plays like baby's first Unity project. G.Malta and VRS should be absolutly ashamed of this mess of files, I won't even call it a game. Avoid this....thing....like the plague. I got it for 25 cents with a coupon and that feels extremely expensive now."
