,Recommended,643810,34955141,Posted: 14 September,all,TheHamster,"I have been eyeing fugl for a long time, and today I finally got to play it. Here is my experience so far. I played the game with an XBOX ONE controller via USB cable.REALLY GOOD!- Really beautiful music when it plays.- Really relaxing sounds, especially the sound of waves and the wind blowing.- Vibrant colors painting a beautiful world.- Lots of fish and creatues that are fun to spot.- Interesting highlights making you want to see what might be there.- Performance. I have an an i5-2500K CPU (3.3 ghz) and a gtx 970 GPU. Everything was butter smooth all the time.- A joy to find new biomes.- Playing as different creatures are fun. Ducks are fast, but hard to control when flying slow, butterflies pretty much the opposite.COULD BE BETTER...- You do not play 1st or 3rd person, but in ""bird♥♥♥♥♥quot; perspective. Simply said, I feel the camera is way too close to the bird. I'd prefer the camera a bit further away. And I would absolutely ADORE first person perspective.- It's currently a bit hard to land and take off. I'd prefer it to be easier. Also the bird flaps lake crazy when taking off. Would prefer a more slow, but powerfull flapping.- You ""become"" the birds and creatures you get close to for a short time, before turning back into your start bird. It is kind of cool sometimes, other times kind of irritating. I do not find it serene to become a flying monkey all the time. A skill to target and transform into the creates you see when YOU want to would be better (my opinion).- No reward for exploration. I don't expect much, but certain areas/spots should give a reward when you reach them. It could some interesting creatures to observe, a special view, some music you don't otherwise get to hear, a new ability, a piece of lore, , a nice little animation or scene, a mini game, or whatever.- More variation in the terrain generation. When you fly fast, things seem very similar. Points of interest, like an extra special create, a castle, and such would be nice.- Bird walking and sound animation. Right now you just hover in silence when you move on ground.IN SORE NEED OF IMPROVEMENT- Bugs. I often experienced the immidate surroundings around me disappearing. I could see things in the distance, but they would disaapear when I get close.- Crashes. I experienced it twice now.- A jump button. Srsly, I really missed that while on ground.- An introduction to the controls. You get a 5 second overview of the controls before the screen disappears. I'd like that to stay for a bit longer. Also, there was no mention that you can control the power of flaps by the amount of pressure you apply on the shoulder buttons.- The camera got stuck a couple of times.All in all, I would recommend getting this game, especially it costing next to nothing. Gameplay wise it has some way to go, and control/camera wise it could use a lot of improvement in my opinion. But seeing this is an early access game , I am in no doubt that this will all improve over time.I hope you and the developer(s) will find this review helpful. I can't wait to make this my go-to chill game after a long day of work, when it becomes a bit less frustrating to control your bird  ;)Best regards from Denmark.P.S. Please please PLEEEEEASE add first person perspective! :D"

I was fascinated every time i walked by. I had to play it and thank god i did :D Yesterday i bought the game, invited a few friends and together we were so stunned by the game - how it looks - how it feels like - how every bird is totally different from the other but still a unique and interesting experience. When you want your friend to try out that ultra heavy bird before it is changing to another one it is quite helpful that 2 or more Controllers can control the bird at the same time. Furthermore one can master the handling and control in about an hour i think, which makes exploring the world even more fun, and btw i can recommend listening to Bonobo(no ad xD) if you want more background-music.On my machine (i5-3570k@4,5 - gtx970) the game runs pretty smooth except some minor hickups you might not even notice if you aren't looking for it, although i already had it crashing when i tabbed out while flying^^So is that game for you?I don't know xD. You just fly around in a sort of random generated world which looks amazing in my opinion. The sound scenery is a big part in the game giving you such a great and immersive feel. In every wing slap, every bird, goat, color in the sky, or the lighting in a cave you fly bye i just notice how much love, art and hard work went into this experience. You don't always need goals or a task, because that's what this game won't give you and i like that. That's what i do in GTA all the time^^I just can tell youhow i felt- and i felt pretty happy and relaxed tonight <3Well it isEarly Accessso there obviously are things that can be improved and I am sure the Feature-request-list is growing fast, but I still want to mention a few things that i think are important:Reaching the end of the world is not the greatest thing, nevertheless that ""Great Wall"" there is an experience. I hope it will be kind of infinite in the future or more like a barricade instead of then missing textures.Sometimes you get stuck in the wall but not a problem, you can respawn.There already is a Bird and Map Editor - I totally did not get them yet, but i also haven't looked much into them sooo... good that they are there :)I really want that Splitscreen  we talked about, or some sort of multiplayer possibility in the future <3I would like to see more options. For example independent sliders for wing sound, environment sound and music would be sick, as well as (if its possible) more concrete settings for resolution and borderless window.And a free camera on the right stick to be able to see your bird from every perspective would be nice too :)Well i love that game and I am sure a lot of people are going to, too. With being able to make your own maps and animals, I am also really looking forward to see the community creating insane content.I believe in that game and the wonderful developers! <3 <3 <3Thank you!"

76561197987816691,Recommended,643810,35240984,Posted: 27 September,all,NoPantsMan,"Fugl is the true beauty of gamingIt's kind of hard to accurately express the feeling of Fugl, it is exactly as it describes itself. You play as a bird like creature that morphs fluidly between colours and shapes and you explore an ever morphing world of colour and shapes. The majesty is that it doesn't try to be more than that but it so perfectly captures the feeling of instinctive flight that you just want to go forever. If you've ever played something like Minecraft and rather than engage in building you set out and just explored what the engine would generate, Fugl is that but far more visually stimulating.*EARLY ACCESS NOTES*So here's the ugly bit, the game is still very much in early access - if your computer isn't at least a bit of beast there's no chance of the game running well. Temporarily there's a mode where the game pre-generates an environment to fly in if your computer isn't up to snuff but the developers are hoping to reduce the system requirements.*END EARLY ACCESS NOTES*There's also more content expected to be added so it's hard to say what the final form of the game will take precisely but put simply, if your computer can run it and you want an unforgettable game of pure experience, Fugl is here right now and you should buy it immediately."

,Recommended,643810,34959620,Posted: 14 September,all,greatlakes,"Simple, beautiful, inspiring fun game.I instantly took to the 3D pixel art style and fell in love.I'm currently dealing with a few crashing issues and some camera problems but I understand since the game is still in alpha. I've only played the game for about 30 minutes writing this reivew and can already give it a thumbs up. Biggest suggestion would be allowing players to dive. There were times when I went up and just wanted to nose dive! I can't wait to see what the devs have in store for this :)"
,Recommended,643810,34981250,Posted: 15 September,all,RandomDude93,"TL;DR: Visually stunning and a load of fun to fly. Intuitive once you have a grasp of the controls. If you have a problem with diamonds in the rough, don't buy this game just yet. Otherwise, it's definitely worth your $$, especially if you're into flying and like infinite worlds.More detail:Epic: The terrain generation works like a treat. Smooth and fast, even when you're rocketing along at max speed (which feels like podracing XD ). With the right settings, you get a lot of fun caves and passages to fly through, and with a few minutes of practice, you can even navigate them decently.Great: Good variety of 'bird' models and full shift/partial shift stages. Personally had some fun with the flying bear type.Needs work: -XBox 360 Controller input was super, super twitchy.-Mouse input lags pretty hard.-Most of the birds fly really fast and barely glide, which makes it difficult to be precise in tight spots. I'd prefer if flight were less hectic and visibility a little better as a trade off. It's supposed to be meditative, after all.-Flapping mechanics are primitive at the moment, and landing is weird.-Also, the unpredictable shift mechanic is irritating sometimes. Would be better if you only changed shape on command and when targeting a viable creature/plant/whatever.Summary: It's very much an early access game, but one that (glitches, bugs and crashes aside for now) could develop from an amazing concept to something truly spectacular. I will definitely keep coming back to this, because it's great if you just want to unplug for a bit and fly."

76561198072301168,Recommended,643810,35466563,Posted: 4 October,all,WinningHarp177,"This is a very relaxing and chilled experience-type game, not goal oriented or narrative driven. I tend to dip in before and after playing other games, almost as a palette cleanser - Fugle: Gaming Sorbet :)Runs well on my GTX970, Xbox controller works well (especially now orbit cam is in). The avatar controls excellently; seemingly impossible little gaps can be flown through with aplomb and make you feel like a really skillful flyer.Not sure about the shape-shifting into monkeys and fish stuff. It works great with other birds but non-flying creatures? Just makes no sense to me. I actually thought that changing into a fish would then allow me to go below the water in a kind of ABZU type way - that would be cool.Overall: Highly recommended. I look forward future updates."
76561198106259625,Recommended,643810,34957840,Posted: 14 September,all,Breogan Hackett,"Fugl is everything I wanted it to be, just not entirely polished.There's a wide variety of creatures available and they al control diferently in enjoyable ways. After 2 hours playing I am finally getting the hang of the controlls. I love to swoop through the landscape aiming for tunnels and caves but inevitably crashing at neck breaking speeds into the roof or the jutting edge of a voxel.Right now however tere are also issues. The blurry world border gets confusing, liftinng off out of air or tight corners can be frustrating, and worst of all it regularly crashes on my system.I look forward to following Fugl as it develops and recommend you try it if you are at all intrigued."
,Recommended,643810,34975743,Posted: 15 September,all,Quail,"Definitely in an alpha state- but already full of potential.Despite the many bugs, it's relaxing and fun to learn how to maneuver. It took me a while but I'm finally learning how to take off once I've crashed or landed, there's a learning curve. Once you figure it out it's pretty entertaining. Lots of little critters to change into, however they feel a little boring and repetitive right now.There are multiple biomes, it may not seem like it at first because you have to fly fast and far to get to them. If you press ""Y"" it returns you to a starting cliff. So far I've found a mountains/pines area and a barren deserty jungle area...there are probably more than that.Edit: avatar customization tool works for the most part! It's pretty fun, especially if you start hitting the ""random"" button lol. World editor still doesn't work. Devs seem to be fixing it up rapidly, though, so I expect it will owrk shortly!I recommend it if you want to support the development and watch it grow and because my pigeon (in my profile pic) was watching me play it and she was very interested! I hope they add pigeons :)"

It sounds like the developers plan to keep enhancing it for some time to come, but as it stands it's already in good shape for meditative bird flying.

The controls simulate a bird's flight, so it gets a lot of getting used to - one trigger makes you move your wings, another makes you break by flapping them in place. You get to fly around in four (?) procedurally-generated biomes, each with their respective roster of animal species which you can ""evolve"" into by flying near to them.This was a one-of-a-kind indie game at Gamescom, with no platforming, shooting, scores, HP, whatever - this is just a game where you're a birb and you fly - and it allows you to do that damn well.The game is still in early access, which is why I'm not mad about the perpetual crashes upon opening up the game. The devs seemed to be super willing to make this a great game experience and I trust they'll be able to. Support indie devs, guys, they're the passionate ones.EDIT : It got patched. Awesome quick support from the devs. Thanks guys !"

But the core gameplay of Fugl feels so good, that I'll recommend it even in this early stage.

Flying is very satisfying once you figure it out, you can choose from a large variety of avatars, from butterflies and birds to flying bears and goats, each one of them has its own unique speed and maneuverability. But before you get to choose, you need to find those and morph into them.Its not a survival game, but a mediative flying game, which means there is no health bars, no attacks, no hunger, no survival elements at all!
