Like so many of those out there, this has the standard fare including leveling up, skill points, tower upgrades, and challenge levels. The story is pretty forgettable and the there's this spin where you're the bad guy trying to keep away the good guys.What I like about this game is that it has it's own style which kinda grows on you. Each type of tower can only be constructed on certain terrain types. The towers are very unique and compliment each other well. There is also a massive variety of enemies that keep rounds interesting. The game is pretty well balanced so it's challenging but not unfair.Overall, this is a very good tower defense game that throws enough new ideas to keep things fresh. The price is not bad, either!"

On large displays sometimes you can loose it in the mess and to be unabled to act correctly according the situation.

The The game is very balanced and I never felt like the game was cheating me.  The tower skill system is well done, and you aren't ever left feeling like your skill points have gone to waste.  Even after beating the game I would go back and attempt to get 3 stars for day and night modes.  Buying this classic is a no brainer for the price tag."

76561198038659734,Not Recommended,643960,33963286,Posted: 1 August,all,Knight9910,"Cursed Treasure 2 is a tower defense game where you play as the dark lord - master of orcs, undead, and demons - who must defend your cursed gemstones from greedy humans who want to steal them. Developed by Iriy Soft, the game was originally published on Armor Games before recieving this updated rerelease. In fact, if you're at all interested in tower defense games you've probably already played this game before on Armor Games.Approaching this review, I found myself feeling like there are two big questions to answer.Is Cursed Treasure 2 any good?Obviously on some level this is going to depend on your opinion of tower defense games, which seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of genre. If you hate tower defense, this game isn't going to change your opinion.If you love tower defense? Well, the game is at least competently made. Abilities and upgrades are well thought out and the game controls pretty well.Compared to other tower defense games, the level of strategy here is... rather simplistic. Each type of tower can only go on a single type of terrain so there's no real decision making in choosing what to place where. (What should I put on this green tile? Duh, an orc tower, the only thing that CAN go there.) There are multiple upgrade paths; for example, orc towers can become either snipers or explosive ballista dens, but there's still not much to decide there. You want snipers in the front, mortars in the back. You want terror crypts in the back to scare enemies and make them run back through your gauntlet again, and frost crypts in the front to slow them down as they make their way through.The game isn't the best tower defense there is, but it isn't terrible. It's competent and fun. In fact...My Rating: [3/5] MEDIOCRESo, on to question number two...Is the rerelease worth the money, or should I just play the free version?That's a bit of a hard question. There are some thing that I like about this new version and some things I really don't.The graphics have improved, and now each region of the game has its own distinct theme. The starting region, Meadowshire, is fairly generic forest and dirt roads, the Holy Mountain is snowy, Tanglewood is green and swampy, and so on. It's a nice touch.Some of the gameplay mechanics have changed. There are now special spells that require skulls - a new resource and the only resource that carries over between missions - to cast, and which give strong effects like giving you 1,000 free gold or instantly returning all your gems to the caves.There's also three new missions set in ""The Deep"", the land of the dwarves.On the other hand, difficulty has also been increased, and I'm not sure if I'd say it's been done in a good way. For one, gold mines  have been removed from most of the missions and you'll be seriously money-starved. (And before you ask, villages and castles and the like no longer give gold income when captured; instead they just spit out coins that you can grab when you first hit them.)Also, some enemies have been made more difficult. Wizards now have a very powerful mass heal, and the Dendrologists will summon their little tree friends much faster, to the point of actual swarming.And this leads us to the biggest problem... those three new missions against the dwarves? They're just plain broken, to the point of being borderline impossible. This isn't just me talking, either. The official strategy for how to beat them is to save up your skulls over the course of the entire game and just cheese the @#%$ out of them. It's generally considered you'll need to spend 2,000 or so skulls (to put that in perspective, you might get 50 skulls in one mission and the spells themselves cost arund 100-350 skulls to cast) in order to have a real chance.In closing...The best I can say is, at least it's not just a completely ridiculous cash grab. I was actually surprised to find that the skull-based super spells weren't actually a cash shop and instead a legit in-game thing.PROS+ Nicely drawn, cute graphics.+ Did at least entertain me for several hours.CONS- Not a lot of deep, strategic decision making.- Can be kind of difficult.- The last three missions are laughably unbalanced and not really fun at all.SHOULD I BUY IT?In the end, I have to ask myself, would I really want to recommend this game to people? If one of my friends came up to me and said ""hey, man, what new game do you think I should play?"" would I name this one?No, not really.It's not terrible and if you want to spend five bucks on it, hey, go right ahead. But I'm afraid I just really don't feel like I can honestly recommend it."

,Recommended,643960,33801100,Posted: 25 July,all,Wuffell,"A nice tower defence game. There's no mazing, but there's friendly buildings that can be activated, and unfriendly buildings that send enemies or do nasty things unless you pay enough to make them stop.There's a bit of grinding involved if you want to do really well, but it's a good game in general.Limits are put on the game, as you can only build certain buildings in certain areas. This means you cannot have a single favourite tower and simply spam them all.Overall, I recommend this to anyone who enjoys TD games, unless you really need mazing."
76561198113121857,Recommended,643960,34342713,Posted: 18 August,all,bjust1006,"I have found this to be a solid tower defense game that is well balanced, imaginative, and fun. Getting to play as the ""villian"" is a neat touch. Some reviews complain of having to grind missions for exp, but I only find that to be partially true. They are correct, you will pretty much never 3 star a mission the first time around. Expect it, accept it, and move on. After doing two to three later missions (and leveling up after each), come back, and it will be much easier. Move on again, then come back a bit later and try the night missions. When progressing that way, I reached max level without having to replay any missions (unless, of course, I messed up, but that's on me, not the game).It's also true you can find the game free other places. That's how I first played it. However, again in contrast to other reviews, I have not had any crashing problems or lag with many monsters (and I have a very cheap laptop); it plays far better than online version I've tried. For a few bucks, I'm happy to support the developer, and getting Steam achievements is always fun.All in all, I would definitely try this game out. If you're unsure, go play it free, and if you like it, do the developers a favor and buy it. If you like tower defenses, this is definitely one of the better ones."

Well, you can play in higher resolution, which is nice. The rest not so much.I've played the browser version before, this runs worse. When a game, that's all about killing lots of enemies, slows down because it cannot handle having lot of enemies on screen, you've got problem.You could call this game challenging, but the challenge lies in forcing the player to grind XP by playing the same levels over and over again. I don't recall having such issue in the free version, but it's been a while since I've played it, so I might be wrong.I cannot recommend this, especially if there's a free version and the paid one is lackluster at best."

,Recommended,643960,33805452,Posted: 26 July,all,Spirit,"This game is as enjoyable as I remembered.It is a tower defense game with a very simple concept. you have 3 types of towers at your disposal, with their own unique charactistics and can only be build on a certain type of ground. These towers can be upgraded through gaining experience. Eventually allowing you to change them into 9 different versions, 3 versions for each type of tower.Outside of that, you can influence the battlefield yourself. You're able to get rid of trees to open up land for your towers, scaring your opponents to force them back or throwing a burning rock to straight out destroy them.There is also a progression system in form of a talent tree, completing missions grant you skill points you can spent to further empower yourself or your towers.The game received quite some polished. they've slighty changed some aspects of this game that I haven't experienced in a earlier version from the past. These changes were a improvement and didn't alter my enjoyment one bit.This was quite a blast to the past and I'm more than willing to lay down some money for this."

There's no hero, but there's operation buildings, eg. a tavern that throws beer to speed up the enemies, but if you pay them enough cash gradually, they'll throw empty bottles instead to stun/slow down the enemies!!  ^_^Very hard to get 3-stars on all maps.I'd say, play Kingdom Rush first, then play Cursed Treasure 2!(I paid for this game to support the devs, and to cut down on ads and cash-for-power-ups)"

You upgrade skills between levels due to XP gain per level. It plays smoothly and has enough options for a 2D PC game. If you are stuck, you can grind a bit for XP or skulls (needed for OP spells), that make your life easier. Beating it is a challenge, Beating it with 3 star ratings on the last 3 levels seems impossible without some heavy skull grinding. If you like tower defense games, you probably already know this one. But if you want to know, if you like it, play the free browser version.
