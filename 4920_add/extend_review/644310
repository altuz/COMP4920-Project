76561198284737282,Recommended,644310,33903180,Posted: 30 July,all,Medvez,"Great game to play with your friends.The core combat of the game is fun and simple. This is a battle between players. The player controls the Balloon. Aim and shoot with your mouse as many Balloons as possible before they can do the same to you.Good graphics, music and great gameplay, 320 achievements throughout the game for various feats of skill!The game has several hilarious moments and really funny characters.Overall BALLOONS Saga is a bit rough around the edges but, shows potential. A charming little arcade shooter that is multiplayer-centric. Simple enough to pick up on a lunch break but challenging enough to have that one more round feeling.All in all, a great game to play, especially if you are Third-Person Shooter games fan."

Then you wake up in an abandoned warehouse - the one dollar that you had with you is now gone and you have a vauge image of balloons floating around in your head.From the National Alchohol and Drug Center - never ever ever play this game please it is like heroine without the high - all of the side effects - and the opposite of the addictive effect."

You will quickly decide if it's for you or notPros:+CheapCons:-No Volume Controls-Extremely buggy (one of us couldn't die)-Everybody looks the same (unless you are close enough to see their face, which is never)-It simply isn't funConclusion:The game is nothing more than a buggy multiplayer shooter that means absolutely nothing. It doesn't feel competitive, it's not funny, and it really isn't fun.Maybe consider getting it for a very small child to play?"

We went on to play the game and it crashed on both of our PC's the #1 try. After the #1 attempt his game was running perfectly whilst mine keeps on crashing.. I tried most of the resolutions.

I cannot express in mere words how fun Balloons truly is... it knows what it is and It isn't afraid to show that. It's an arcade game, funny and simple. No realisitc balistics, no screwing around with the trim and fuel levels. Run, hit and destroy!"

Yet, the more sparse maps give you much more room to fight head on. Along with player vs. player combat there are also objectives that consist of avoiding traps and obstacles."

There is AI to play against, so if you start your own battle , you'll have a flight simulator experience. I dThere is built in chat that works very well. idn't experience multiplayer issues (like lags that would make it difficult to play). Large and small Ballons have the compatible inertia and sound effects. Overall great game. If you like combat games, you'll probably like this game."

,Recommended,644310,33868171,Posted: 28 July,all,mr.WiK,"Also, for you flight enthusiats, this game is very much arcade-y in feel, not sim level. You can get away with flying like a pro with a mouse+keyboard. And that's okay. I'm happy with a fun game, not a flight sim. If you like WoP type games, check Balloon saga out. You won't be disappointed."
,Recommended,644310,33877744,Posted: 29 July,all,nd,"funny fps shooter game i would compare to old good Quake 3 Arena. Weapon you have is similar to Quake's rocketgun,where you should keep in mind rockets movement, time needed for rocket to fly to the aim - but here you play not with a monster, but with funny balloon - i enjoyed playing it."

,Recommended,644310,33879765,Posted: 29 July,all,๖SpeedOFLight,I will have to agree with many other reviews that it is very difficult to find a balanced game. I have found on US server there is usually one game being played with 1-4 people.

Different models show how well the system work...you can feel the agility and flimsyness of an simple yelow ballon while you'll have to always keep in mind the slow controls and huge inertia of a red evil ballon"
,Recommended,644310,33881734,Posted: 29 July,all,ЗЛОЕБУЧИЙ EHOT,"As far as Balloon saga is concerned, there is a very limited playerbase at the moment. The issue does exist - but the game IS great and IS worth it. Hence, I give a strong thumbs up and I really advice anyone who likes this kind of game to immediately get it...then the ""few players"" problem will be no more, right? Don't let this title become abandoned. It's just underrated, that's all."

The game play is very smooth but the game is still in early stages. The game is very well balanced and its not just a  regular shooter flying game there is strategy planning involved. For a one bucks it's worth the purchase.
,Recommended,644310,33877106,Posted: 29 July,all,VL プラス,The playing is easy to get the hang of and perfect for keyboard mouse. I am very happy I got this. Another great thing about this game is it seems like most of the other people you play with are really having fun too. It's a great team game and simple enough that after one or two games most of your questions will be gone. I can't wait to see what comes next.
76561198048041746,Recommended,644310,34111663,Posted: 8 August,all,Vote Tory,"I would reccomend this game because - as it stands, I am the best player in the new meta. I have accumulated thousands of kills and have fully upgraded my character. None are as skilled as me. The reccomendations I would make are that the game include more achievments, as I have ran out of unlockables, and that the game feature more items to purchase. A new character, or more variables/ further upgrades to flight and fire rate would help to make me even more invicible, this being because I have over 40,000 coins saved up and refuse to spend them on special ammo when I can scavenge red power-ups for free, and do so when I am flying at the maximum speed allowed.Furthermore, the controller inputs are for whatever reason, not as precise and smooth as the standard keyboard and mouse, making prolonged, intense sessions with this game difficult. Overall I would regard this game as a must have, especially when considering the fact that I got a foil card drop which more than made back the money I spent on two copies of the game (for me and my brother).Final score - 10/10 ""Great investment of time and money"""
,Recommended,644310,33953036,Posted: 1 August,all,Absurder,Balloonsaga is incredibly fun. The developers ares involved in the community and run monthly events with the community. Player base is a bit shallow. But for a game thats costs less than a snack I think its a bargain!
