,Recommended,644390,34670572,Posted: 1 September,all,sadnhappy,"Finally Lords of Waterdeep is on Steam! I've been waiting for this for years as LoW is one of favourite boardgames of all time.In Lords of Waterdeep you take a hidden role of one Lord/Lady of Waterdeep trying to get the most victory points (VP for short) by the end of the game (8th round). Each Lord/Lady has their own hidden agenda that'll be revealed and scored at the end of the game, these range from gaining bonus points from completing certain kinds of quests, building buildings or even collecting corruption in the expansions!Aside from the end of the game Lord reveal scoring, you cain VP by completing quests, building buildings, gathering resources such as warriors, rogues, clerics and wizards that you ""hire"" to do your quests for you (no need to get your own hands dirty!), playing intrique cards (action cards which will give/take resources/quests, raze enemy buildings and that sort of thing) and so forth. Each game takes 8 rounds in which you place one worker at a time onto the board into any free action space. For example ""gain 2 warriors"", ""take 4 gold"", ""take a quest"", ""play intrique card"", ""build a building"" or even taking the 1st player token, which can be hotly contested especially in 4-6p games. This goes on until all players have placed all their workers for that round. At the end of the round each player takes their workers back and a new round begins.The base game is alright on it's own but the two expansions, Undermountain and Skullport add so much into the game that I couldn't ever play without them anymore and neither should you. New lords, quests, intrique cards and the corruption mechanic add so much to the game, making it a lot more deeper strategy game than just the base game.I know I'm repeating myself but it's a 10/10, one of my all time favourite boardgames, couldn't recommend it enough.This review is based on +12 games of the real boardgame + 1 game against NPC's just to get a feel of the game and it's UI and animations which were surprisingly good and clear, atleast for a veteran player like myself.EDIT: One addition: The online mode needs a filter of some sort and a game selection for people who want to play the game from start to finish in one sitting. I really dislike any kind of play-by-mail type of game where games take days to finish."

But, well, I have a mixed impressions from PC & new iOs versions.Pros- It's Lords in all it's glory! Great game mechanics, unpredictable matches, asynchronous and cross-platform multiplayer.- In-game chat. This is great because I couldnt say even a word to guys with whom I played for 4 years.Cons- New interface is awful: you can't zoom out field, insufficient contrast (its very hard to see City Guard agents in buildings), layot problems, blurry textures and even low-res windows icon. Playdeck, how it's possible - you already have 1024x1024 iOs icon?!- Same bugs, for example: with Shelter Zhentarim Agents you can draw intrigue card EVERY time when you gain corruption instead onece per turn; same trick works with Protect Converts to Eilistraee e t.c. Plus looks like there is a couple of new ones.I hope developers tweak the interface, fix bugs and keep supporting game!Despite serious cons I can recommend this game to all who loves tabletop version and other worker-placement games; D&D and Forgotten Realms fans."

I immediatly started playing and the problems started right away. Things flash on the screen so fast you don't have time to read anything. I saw there is an option for animation speed but it was already at the lowest setting; also, the speed only deals with the movement of the pieces and not view time. I noticed a very strange behavior when paning the screen as animation is occuring. As long as you keep moving the screen the animating object will NEVER get to where its going. While this is adjustable, its almost nausiating to me to see it happen as unintended movement is happening on the screen. It is very hard to know when its your turn. Basically I wait until I stop seeing things fly around on the screen. If i'm lucky, i'll see objects heading up to the player bar and can guess when my turn is coming up. The UI of this game is whats holding it back. Since you don't know whats going on its hard to stay vested in the game. Finally, when you make it to the end and you start scoring its hard to know why the scored their bonus points. I mean, if I memorized every characters face I could figure it out, but other than that you know nothing other than they scored a ton of points; you'll never know why. If I knew a bunch of friends that played this and could VOIP I could see some of the issues being eleviated but I don't."

I think it captures the table experience pretty well. There are enough other reviews complaining that this isn't a good game to train someone who has never played it before and so I can't really speak to that, but since I really like the game, I find it to be a great way to play 3-4 games in a row without having to deal with the logistics of getting 3-4 people together.The game itself is a strong worker placement board game with an engaging theme (but it's easy to imagine the game being reskinned and becoming a game about a reality television cooking show or a bunch of trappist monks making wine for the abbot in the 12th century in Belgium) and while the AI does some boneheaded stuff from time to time (for example, it gained a corruption piece in order to play an intrigue card that allowed it to shed a corruption piece), my record is somewhere around 60/40 (at this point) so it's not like the AI only gives cakewalks unless everything goes wrong for you.I immediately got the expansions and love playing with them as well, and I've noticed that the AI is somewhat better playing with the base game (negative numbers, man... it's just like playing with real people, sometimes).Highly recommended. Even if it's not on sale."

,Not Recommended,644390,35156173,Posted: 23 September,all,Vecroct,"OK so I love love love this game.  The problem I have with it is my wife and I try to play games online and every game has people who start games and are not available.  The way the game is setup, there is a overall time limit for all of your turns.  So if you make a one hour game it's one hour per persons turn and then they are forced to forfeit.  So if you have a new game with 4 people, the first player can wait one hour and not do anything and then they get forced out and the game can progress.  This happens every game - people start and are not available to play.  This isnt setup right.  The game needs to have a per turn timer of like 7 minutes tops and an overall game timer.When the game boots players out, it replaces them with computer players - so why not let you choose computer players for those slots to begin with if you choose?The game as it stands now is very broken when it comes to online play and can be fixed rather easily by the developers.  They need to patch this so it's more enjoyable for online play.  By the way I'm writing this while waiting like 45 minutes now for some person to have their turn expire.  They could also just do a vote to kick option for online games and replace anyone kicked with the computer."

No way to turn it off."
76561198036823250,Recommended,644390,35003997,Posted: 16 September,all,markakeen,"I discovered this game on steam having never encountered the physical board game. Initially I was unsure whether it would offer enough strategic depth, and was worried that many of the positive reviews would be due to the D&D brand. However I can confirm that it's a really enjoyable, strategic, game.The interface is really well implemented. In fact, it's one of the best board game implementations I have ever seen, with options to review the whole game, and undo your most recent move, before you lock it in.The AI is a little on the weak side, even on the highest level. However with 4 or 5 hard AIs it still provides an interesting challenge.Multiplayer is mostly played with asynchronous games. Depending on the game speed, these can take many days (or even weeks) to play. The upside of that, is that you never feel rushed, and can take your time to plan your next moves.I can't recommend this enough."
,Recommended,644390,34864705,Posted: 10 September,all,PCGNeurotic,"As a life-long D&Der and a great fan of the Realms, I bought this the moment I saw it on sale. I had heard about the board game from a few years ago, but had never played it, so this was a great opportunity for me.Lords of Waterdeep succeeds on several levels. First of all, it's a terrific use of the D&D property. The game drips with atmosphere, and after a few minutes you really feel drawn into the world of scheming and back-stage manouvering that characterises Waterdeep in the many Forgotten Realms novels it appears in. The atmosphere, tone and pacing make it a brilliant game for quietly pondering with a cup of tea or glass of wine, in the slower moments of the day, or after everyone else has gone to bed.Second of all, it works very well as a digital board game. For me, the gold standard in this genre is Nomad Games' Talisman: Digital Edition (slightly less purely, Tin Man Games' interpretation of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain is also quite brilliant). The interface, its arrangement and colour scheme, and the implementation of the cards and the game board (all with beautiful, classical D&D art) all fully convey that awesome feeling of being clustered around a table with friends, having a good time with a good game.Thirdly, it simply works very, very well as a game. It's great fun, totally absorbing, and provides a rich emotional experience in the playing of it. It's the kind of game you find yourself smiling about much later, as you recall your victories and defeats. The game is very logically structured, and best of all (for busy people, parents, or those who can't always afford to sink hours of gaming into one session), it follows a strict schedule of 8 turns, which means that games rarely last longer than about 25-30 minutes. There is tons of replayability in the base game alone, as you can configure each game to your liking -- which opponents you'll be playing with, their individual intelligence, and so on. Plus, with the system of hidden 'patrons' -- the actual Lords and assorted other top-tier figures -- you never know exactly what the AI's or other players' motives will be. This is because the Quest cards come in several different categories, and the Patrons give bonus points for completing Quest types that they personally favour.In terms of value for money, I would say that Lords of Waterdeep is worth 5 or even 10 clams over the 15-clam asking price. I know there's a lot of negativity in the forums here, but whatever happened in the past, however much truth there is in the muck-raking, this game is a solid win."

76561198022775389,Recommended,644390,34781826,Posted: 6 September,all,Genyl,I had played the boardgame twice with 5 players and won both times. Never had such luck before!This is the digital version of a popular boardgame. The boardgame is good fun as it is a cross between a worker placement euro game and the a thematic game with the lore of Faerun. I love the Forgotten Worlds settings and always wanted to do something in Waterdeep as it is mentioned consistently across the books.My main complain about the boardgame gameplay is that if you are in the lead you will be targeted in the last rounds. Of course this is actually a good mechanic so the game is not decided until the very end. Smart players will complete their big quests at the very last minute and will leave themselves some rooms to try to put things back together if something goes wrong.You can play both offline and online. The AI is decent but it is not intelligent enough to attack you. Offline you will have the feeling you are playing alone (er you actually are...). I anticipate real opponents will consistently guess which masked lord are you playing and screw you with a mandatory quest at the worst time.The interface does its work well and has a handy option of undoing your turn. I could think of a couple of improvements but I have played many digital versions of boardgames and this port is one of the best I've seen.All in all if you like boardgames and/or D&D Forgotten Realms I would recommend this as a solid buy considering the low price
,Recommended,644390,34759441,Posted: 5 September,all,Thanos,This is a very fun game. The UI isn't great but it is more functional than a lot of digital board games. After learning it's quirks I haven't had any issues. The price point is pretty reasonable for what you get. Especially at the current 30% reduction. The Skullport and Undermountain expansions add interesting new mechanics to the game but the base game is enjoyable on it's own. I could actually see some people preferring the base game without the expansions. But I find playing both ways to be entertaining. The AI is decent and provides a challenge (at least for a new player like myself).I haven't had the opportunity to test the online mode yet. I'll update my review once I have. But for now this seems like an excellent game to me.

,Recommended,644390,34878692,Posted: 11 September,all,SlashDK,"Having played the board game a few times, I jumped at the opportunity to get the digital version along with the expansions.After a few playthroughs I must say that this is a really good port of the game, managing to capture the feeling of playing a boardgame while stille avoiding the problem of getting people gathered for playing.The only thing that annoys me is that the view of the whole board when you play with both expansions is tampered by the side bars when viewing your own cards.If you enjoy boardgames, this is a good one and not too complicated to learn even though you havent played it before.Still a steal for the price tag, even when not on sale."

Build on very solid mechanics, offering multiple strategies, very pretty (or should I say ""elegant"") and music is pleasant too.Each game is totally different due to randomised lords, buildings and quests.Port is almost flawless, great UI, well done tutorial. I've encountered only one bug during 8 games (some of the intrigue cards stuck in my inventory and I couldn't play them).AI opponents are competent at highest level so winning requires careful play (especially in one on one games), but it's never punishing or unfair.I would love to see more boardgames ports from this dev."
76561198073675560,Not Recommended,644390,35172499,Posted: 23 September,all,Darkmage2160,"I can't in good conscience recommend this game.  First of all, reading the other reviews readily demonstrate the lack of good online play, with players essentially making you wait for a day before they are forced to leave and you can play.  Second, the game itself is flawed.  Many times, you are stuck with a lord that gives inferior rewards (like 4 points for completing one of two quest types), and the AI gets a simple lord (Every building he buys gets him 6 reward points).  Now that may not seem like a big deal, except buying buildings is the easiest thing if you have first turn, and more often then not, those buildings give you more money or resources to get even more buildings and do more quests.  Quests themselves do rarely have their good rewards, but more often then not it is just a point reward, and no help completing more quests or buying more buildings.  Quests in and of themselves seem flawed as well.  You get to choose from a string of 4 quests, but getting a quest that has requirements you can meet, AND meet that of your lord so you can keep up with the AI, is a very rare thing.  The AI play somewhat dirty as well.  There are cards that do effects, sometimes giving you more resources, sometimes hindering another's track to finish quests, and sometimes giving you significant resources at the expense of having to give some to another player as well.  The AI will always hinder the Human player, and will always help out a fellow AI.  Meaning taking on 1 or 2 AI in an offline match is not extremely difficult if you don't end up with a cripple for a lord, but taking on 3 or 4, or even 2 higher level AI means most probable defeat.  I do like the setting, the UI, and even the art, but key elements seem to still need refining."

Most people have already outlined the pro's and con's regarding it, so I will not go through them.   I will tell you:-The game is worth $10 easily.  Even $15 is acceptable if you like computerized board games.-You must play the tutorial to understand what's going on.  I played it twice, and after that was a pro at playing.-Ignore all the naysaying about the animation speeds.  Once you know what is going on, you will appreciate the speed of the animations.   Could they be slower?  Sure.  However, a couple games through and you know exactly what the cards are doing.  There is also a review icon that you can click called the ""Discard Pile"" to read and look at the cards that have been played.   In addition, you can click on the individual players cards and review those that they have drawn which may have moved too fast to read initially.   IN FACT, it is a good strategy to review the other players cards to make decisions in the game.I do have to agree....the zoom and overall board layout does kinda suck.  It's definitely not intuitive; nor functional.  You just cant see the entire board period.   However, I find myself looking at cards more than the board...so it might not be that big of an issue.   I certain have ignored the disfuction of moving the board view around, just because I was enjoying the overgame."

I like boardgames and using intrigues and fulfilling quests is interesting for me, so I decided to buy the game, including the two DLCs.I've bought and played several boardgames over Steam, most of which I have never played physically, even if they (like Talisman) actually exist in real life, too. And, unlike the Witcher Boardgame, this game has a reasonable length to play, especially in multiplayer, even though I have not played MP so far. I hope to do so once a few of my friends have gotten the game as well.I found the UI well done, too, and the tutorials (important for someone who had never played the game before in any way) understandable and interesting enough to play."

The game itself takes a bit of getting used to, and the UI is perhaps a little unsophisticated, but after the tutorial and two AI games I was more than used to it and the UI was comfortable to use.You will easily be able to tell if you like the game within the two hour refund timeframe, and the initial outlay is fairly cheap as well.If you like boardgames then odds are you will enjoy this, so give it a try as it was highly related on IOS and looks the goods on PC too!"

,Recommended,644390,34678055,Posted: 1 September,all,William Shakesman,"Lords of Waterdeep is a strong port of an alright board game. While it still feels like a mobile port on the edges, the UI is quite well done and performance is strong. Asynchronus online MP is available, with various clocks ranging from a month long game to a game you'll knock out in half an hour, as well as a decent sort of AI to battle if you just want to throw down.As to the board game itself, it could not be a more standard worker placement game. Every turn, you place a worker on a space, getting you the bonus of that space and blocking anyone else from getting there. Each space nets you some cubes (technically adventurers, but they are really just cubes of various colors.). Collect quest cards, collect cubes, and cash in the cubes to complete the quests and get victory points. There is a corny mechanic where you don't know what each person's bonus score category is until the end, but you'll notice pretty quickly they only take two types of quests or do nothing but build buildings all game.Some quests almost build an engine, of sorts, giving bonus points for doing other quests of the same type, or rewarding more cubes than victory points allowing you to keep scoring quests without having to jockey for more cubes. But the quest deck is so random that you can't rely on that sort of nonsense at all.The only wrenches in the works are the intrigue cards. By placing a worker at the harbor space, you can play an intrigue card, usually a ""Take That!"" on another player, and then get to move that worker again LAST. In addition, you can build buildings, which get you a small sum of VP and add a space to the board that gives the user more cubes than normal actions, but you get a benefit if an opponent uses it.You move a lot of dudes around, shuffle some cubes, score some points, but the resulting game is pretty bloodless and straightforward. Grab quests that match your bonus, cubes that match your quests, score. The result is a fine introduction to worker placement board games but a game that does not really have a lot to keep you playing in the long run."

Not a bad price although i think the DLC is a little overpriced for whats it giving you but i guess if you have played the boardgame or absolutly love it your going for it"

I quite like this game because it's something I can jump into and play a full session in about 10 minutes. I've found that 1-on-1 games are terribly difficult against the AI, but going against 2 or 3 is a bit easier, though quite challenging. The game is about both managing your own resources as well as trying to keep other players from gathering, so you have to constantly watch what the other players have and decide accordingly. It's not an easy game, but the learning curve is pretty short."

Intuitive UI and good use of space.AI is good, but does seem to make some questionable decisions on occasion.Biggest downside is that I can't seem to reliably get a multiplayer game started yet.  I have a feeling this is because it has a small playerbase still, so not a lot of people online at the same time.  I could just be impatient and used to games like Ticket to Ride where a wait for a game is less than a few minutes on average.Im very happy with the purchase, and even happier that I can play one of my favorite boardgames more often now.  Just looking forward to a larger online community."

Great replayability, quick games once you get used to it and the expansions are a lot of fun too! This online version is a direct port and is overall pretty clean and simple. You can play up to 6 people (local and online) if you and the people playing have at least 1 expansion. They don't gouge on the price for the online version (DLC's are the full expansions you pay $30+ for physical copy and are only $5 when not on sale). Definitely worth to pickup"

After completing the tutorials (basically a guided game), I was able to start playing and winning immediately. The card art is great, and the atmosphere is superb. It's a simple game, but it is a lot of fun."
,Recommended,644390,35114757,Posted: 21 September,all,Glen Chico,This game deserves and award for the tutorial alone. It's perfect. It walks you about three-quarters of the way through a match explaining each concept step by step without throwing too much information at you at once. By the time it let me off the rails I felt perfectly comfortable finishing the match on my own.It's my guess that the majority of the people complaining about the interface either played the board game first or didn't complete the tutorial. Either way it's a complex and fun game that's easy to grasp thanks to a phenomenal tutorial.
76561198024490819,Recommended,644390,35232150,Posted: 26 September,all,Sheldon Cooper,'Lords of Waterdeep' is an award-winning boardgame and this is a faithful translation thereof... so what's not to like? The AI is competent enough to engage players for a while and then there's multiplayer (which can be slow but can also be utterly riveting with the right opponents and pace).Strongly recommended.

76561198051762294,Recommended,644390,34695488,Posted: 2 September,all,Baron Matticus Von Godslobber,"I've revised this review a bit after delving into the multiplayer component, which works but has one serious drawback, which I will describe below.Lords of Waterdeep is one of my favorite board games, so when I saw this on Steam I bought it and installed it literally within a minute.  After playing a few games, I'm definitely mostly happy with it and willing to give it a thumbs-up and conclude it is well worth the price despite some negative aspects that I hope will get worked out eventually, such as:-- The music and sound are generally displeasing enough that I turned them off.-- The interface moves too slowly in some cases and too quickly in others.  During AI turns, it is difficult to understand anything that is happening because cards and pieces are flying back and forth across the screen without giving any time to look at them or understand why they are there.  Personally, I'm ok with it, but without a good understanding of the board game itself, I could see this being bewildering.-- Multiplayer works wonderfully when you can manage to find a game with players who really want to play.  About half the games I've started or joined have ended up stalled by deadbeat players who join and then just sit there and let their time run out, which can take hours or even days.  The multiplayer component needs some way of kicking or bannning players who do this.   I half wonder if some of these ""players"" are doing this just to be trolls, or perhaps even attempting to undermine the game and its community because of some grudge against the developer, as I have seen a decent amount of negativity in the forums in that regard.Anyway, despite all that, I'm elated that this exists and will continue to play it even as is.  I definitely recommend you buy it, unless you're a deadbeat."

With Faerun to work with, and all of Volo's research, I just expected moreI recommend you save your money.<Edited to add specifics to my criticisms>"

,Not Recommended,644390,34785001,Posted: 6 September,all,Milk Shakespeare,"Haven't played the game much on here, but if you like Lords of Waterdeep I'd suggest getting this.However, it seems like the Steam version is just a port of the mobile version, judging by how the UI is, and how almost none of the buttons in-game are labeled at all. This wouldn't be as bad if it was more intuitive, but the only real way to learn what things to is to just click on things. Granted I didn't use the tutorial first, but from what I've read from others it won't help first time players much, if at all."
,Recommended,644390,34701890,Posted: 2 September,all,Narkulus,"Great worker placement game about gathering resources to complete quest cards for points. I love games that have those tense little moments when you're hoping against hope that your opponents not going to grab that resource you need, but they usually do, of course. AI is really good for single player games. My only gripe is the small text on the quest cards is not readable unless you click on them to zoom, even on a large display. Overall a great board game though.A solid 8/10."

The AI is truely a challenge and great. Oh I know I'll eventually figure out how to beat it constantly but, that doesn't look like it's coming anytime soon like most games.They say there are bugs galore but, I haven't found any so far. I haven't played any multiplayer though and that might be where they are experiencing these socalled bugs they are reporting. I've worked on repairing and fixing slow computers all my life (after graduating) and I see so much malware and viruses and corrupted files that the regular joe who THINKS he knows computers never even knows about or discovers. It takes a library of programs to find most all of them, not just McAfee or Malware Bytes. You really need a pro to really ""clean"" your computer or fdisk and reformat and reinstall from scratch and start collecting all that trash all over again.I know what I see here and I see a great game with a great AI that is fun to play. I might even try multiplayer sometime after I figure out how to beat the AI constantly. :)BUY this game; You'll be glad you did.EDIT: Oh and for those that want to know it works on VISTA64; I have 6gb of memory so I don't know if it works on lower than that. My graphics card is a mere 5770HD 1gb memory also. :)"
