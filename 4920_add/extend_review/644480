,Not Recommended,644480,32605761,Posted: 20 June,all,Dozenbeer,"Edit: Updated 04.07.17I highly praise this game for even attempting this genre, which almost got forgotten......but at the same time its not a game I would come back to. (at least not in Early Access)Pros:+ the developer is listening to the community+ controller support for Xbox and PS4 controller+ the fixed camera angles are really good for the most part+ a good horror atmosphere+ 4 characters+ online coop (I couldnt test it, since its launch day and nobody is online)+ offline singleplayer+ it captures the look of a RE game pretty nicely (menus, item screen, etc)+ zombies have ragdollCons:- if you expect to play a game, there is almost nothing here, its just on Steam to get more funding, which is a higher risk considering this game is developed by one single guy- there are 2 different modes which are basically the same exact thing, In horde mode you gotta kill waves of zombies but in Outbreak you gotta kill a lot of zombies from point A to point B.....there are no puzzles in the game right now.Thats the very first thing that immediately hit me.....Resident Evil was never just about killing zombies- the story is not worth following- items sparkle comedically to be noticed- zombies dead bodies disappear almost immediately- no tank controls, I seriously would have liked that here, but thats just opinion, instead its a direct control with kinda awkward feel to it, but it works okay(Update: tank controls are an option now, with quick turn mechanic)- the map is very dull, there is almost no point in exploring or looking at stuff, as the items almost always are placed in plain view, no need to search cupboards and such- its nowhere near like RE Outbreak, remember characters holding doors for others or putting something infront of a door (like nailing boards or pushing a barrel) to block zombies, nothing of this is in the game- the biggest flaw in the game is.....there is absolutely no strategy or survival. In RE you could escape from zombies because rooms were divided in segments with loading times inbetween, here it is one single map and you have to kill every single zombie you see or it will hunt you forever.....no conserving ammo, you just have to kill it and of course there is not enough ammo....also the zombies are pretty fast, you will definitely die, but not because of your skill, but because of the poorly designed balance- melee is useless (actually, that is exactly like in RE)- some things back in the day were good and some are really outdated nowadays and this game didnt even attempt to iron out the flaws the original RE had, like quick switching weapons, not having to equip a key for a door from the menu all the time, where are the things that were fixed in newer games?- the characters are not very well thought out, and some of them are bound to never be played- the tutorial explained the most obvious thing, like how to walk, but not how to shoot and reload (I mean its fairly easy but still, for people that might not know these games)- the walking animation is terrible (but I guess thats going to change sooner or later)Like I said, I love that someone is tackling this genre, but Im not excited for this game right here. And I honestly dont think this will be something cool in the future, even for this low price. If you wanna check it out, bring a friend directly with you, otherwise its too dull and boring right now."

This is one of the funnest hardcore titles I've played in a very long time. Note the early access is real with this game, although I didn't encounter a massive amount of bugs, there is less content than you'd expect from a finished game (because it's not finished) Theres only about 5 different enemy types, 6 or so guns, 2 or 3 different melee weapons (got to be crazy to use those anyways) and only one scenario at the moment not including the tutorial one. The game also has a game mode called onslaught mode which puts you in an alternative version of the main scenario where you and your friends fight off waves of enemies for as long as you can while scouring the map for respawning loot.The developer has assured me that their next big step is to add the 2nd scenario, that being the case I highly recommend this game if you're into hardcore survival games and even more so if you're into the old RE franchise as I am. Cheers and happy hunting!"

Yesterday I couldn't move the map, but today I can.What's currently in the game is really just the beginning."

However, it is in early access and not polished.  The only things I think are cons are the camera angles at times, and I'm not sure but it sounds like the same exact menu sound effects as the original RE? As well as the original menu when you check your vitals? Almost identical to a point where I question if that is legal.  Besides that I'll wait for next update and try this again.  I like the survival option mode."

,Recommended,644480,34448898,Posted: 23 August,all,Hellbent,"With a retro control scheme and survival horror roots. This is a game very similar to Resident Evil Outbreak on the Playstation 2. In this early stage it keeps to many of the fundimentals of multiplayer survival horror.Inventory managment is a key element to survival. Combining health items to create greater health items. Needing to open your inventory to equip a weapon, much like opening a bag to retrieve something in real life. With certain characters having larger inventories with certain restrictions. Making team work and item managment vital to survive.Your characters are not action heroes. They are quite frail and in the hands of a new player are unlikely to survive. An experienced player can avoid trading hits. But until you are used to the controls and how the enemies behave. You're likely to be forced to trade hits in melee. Making ranged weapons very valuable. Wasting a bullet can mean the difference between success and failure. Your chances are even lower if your friends don't communicate and share.As of 8/23/2017 the game is still in a very early state. Animation and graphics need polish. Some of the gameplay mechanics are a little rough. But overall it's a very good start. Online play works very well with a cloud based network that avoids NAT problems with Peer 2 Peer connectivity. Just make sure you're all on the same cloud server and it should work just fine.This is a great game for fans of survival horror who are willing to invest in an early access game. I would not buy this looking for a complete experience. But it has great promise and if you have a huge itch for survival horror. Even in this early state there is a lot of fun to be had. Looking forward to seeing how this game develops!"

,Recommended,644480,32819302,Posted: 26 June,all,Elyose,"Haven't played it for very long yet but i see a lot of potential with this game. It seems to take a lot of influence from the older Resident Evil games in terms of the combat mechanics and fixed camera positions which for the most part seem pretty spot on in my opinion with maybe a few awkward angles at times but nothing i found annoying.It terms of content, its limited at the moment hence the Early Access but what is there at the moment will give you a decent amount of gameplay and with four characters to play as, each with their own little perks and drawbacks which i thought was a nice touchGraphically it isn't bad, nothing special either but i like the look of it nonetheless.There are some things that i hope will be improved upon such as the way the characters movement animations carry out. I don't know what it is really but to me it just seems a bit unnatural the way they carry themselves.Overall i like the look and feel of the game and it looks to have potential to be a pretty cool game.Hopefully it gets new content progessively over the next while and doesn't end up abandoned like some other Early Access i've tried out.Also the developer is very active on forums and has addressed some of the comments made by players such as being able to pan the map and zoom in and out and some bug fixes so good signs with that lets hope it stays that way."

(hopefully)They do an akward run and walk and doesnt look natural at all, also the aiming looks awful aswell.It's not a real scary feeling you, but more of an overwhelmingly difficulty, do to the amount of enemies and supplies given to you.In the end I'd reccomend this to die hard fans of the old Resident Evil games or people who want to experience what it's like to play the old games without an emulator.SCORING07/25/17╔══════════════════════╗⦿ Feel of Game: 8/10⦿ Controls 4/10⦿ Skills & Settings 7/10⦿ Graphics & Models 5/10⦿ Smoothness & Animations 3/10⦿ ALL THE HORROR? 1/10╚══════════════════════╝"

,Not Recommended,644480,32622808,Posted: 21 June,all,Vash(88),"Uhg. The community for this game is clearly going to be divided. You can already see that the hardcore ""old school RE"" fans are going to rave over this game just because it kind of looks and feels like it and aggressively rate down any review that gives it anything but praise. Don't get me wrong, I liked the old RE titles, but they were good for their time because the systems couldn't handle much more than that, and there were good stories, characters and mind bending puzzles. I know this is ea and that there is, at least I think, one person working on it, but this is not fun, nor is it a return to the good'ol days of survival horror.First off, there was one player playing the game when I went to the multiplayer screen... I'm guessing that was me. When I did play with a friend, there was basically zero co-op aspects to the game apart from both of you being on the screen. No co-op animations, actions, or teamwork of any kind was needed.The combat was just as clunky as the original RE games, which is good in one hand and just reinforces how dated those games are in the other. There is no juking the zeds or solving puzzles like the originals either due to a few problems that weren't in the original REs: a single static map with no ""load screen doors"" that zeds could not pass, zeds that never forget about you, and zeds that run almost as fast as the players. You just pick up the items that are laying on the ground in front of you and use them to get to the end...unless you run out off ammo, and not because you weren't managing your items right, but just because they didn't give you enough to kill the endless horde. That's it. Run a little bit, turn and shoot. Run a little bit, turn and shoot. Run a little bit, turn and shoot... Not fun.The characters' attributes and starting items are questionable. I can see that there is one, maybe two of them that will always be picked last.All of the animations and environments are dull and stiff, but it's ea, so what'evs.The last problem, and the one I can't quite wrap my head around, is the wild fps swings. I own a VR and play it with no problems. I run high end games like FC4, Rise of the TR, and Wolfenstein: the old blood on high to max setting with no problems, yet a game that looks like it came straight from 2002 drops to 15 fps when I am looking at a wall?!?! lolI own a lot of ea games. Some I love, some I hate, and some are titles you can't even buy anymore because the devs gave up. It's a risk that is taken, but the good ones have one thing in common: they feel like a game despite being in alpha, this does not. This feels as though it's just playing on old school gamers' nostalgia to get some easy steam sales.  People using words like ""Awesome!""  ""Amazing!""  ""Great!""  Are insulting games like HL2, Fallout, The Last of Us, One Finger Death Punch, ALL OF THE REs, and so on.  If you try this game, use your brain to judge it, not your childhood nostalgia.  There are plenty of good titles for half the cost of the sale price.If you don't believe me, just watch the trailer, and ask yourself what you see.  A guy walking.  A girl walking around fire.  A guy running a little bit turning and shooting.  A girl running a bit turning and shooting.  What you don't see: co-op gameplay, puzzle solving, not laughable animations, scavenging, or boss mobs."

,Recommended,644480,32757985,Posted: 24 June,all,DemRupees,"Basically at this current time, the game serves as a potential template for a great survival horror experience. However, don't expect to go into the game right now with enough content to get your money's worth. There is one ""scenario"" right now which takes a good 1-1.5 hours to play through. I look forward to more scenarios releasing, however I'd first like to see improvements to the melee mechanics, contents of the found notes/ overall story, and map viewing options."

,Recommended,644480,34539777,Posted: 27 August,all,Mike Rioter,"Good game overall, and this game is better played with a controller and highly not recommended for keyboard before you make your purchase. The few things that really need tweaking are the camera angles, and the character movement after transition of camera angles. The reason I say this is because the camera angles seem so out of place and seriously limit your vision. Not only that but I believe that the camera angles need to be more fix than move because this some times makes the character move differently than the movement input. A possible way to fix that is to place more fixed camera angles at better locations in the hall and room, and have none on the floor. Also, when the camera angle switches to a different possition, the character movement tends to conflict with the sudden change and movement becomes more difficult. I've had trouble with this and my character kept switching between the angles back and forth and it's really irritating when you become overwhelmed by the zombies, especially with the boss at the end of the level when it's constanly riding on your a-s-s. Otherwise, it's very reminiscent to older franchises, such as resident evil and silent hill. The only thing that's missing is better bgm to help set the atmosphere for each level. Good thing this only early access and not the final product. Keep up the good work devs, you guys are almost there. Anyways, I only recommend this to people who would want to return to the old style horror-survival games we all know and love."

,Recommended,644480,32608698,Posted: 20 June,all,ShanestaDeJones,"I love the idea of bringing back a classic from scratch with the community's feedback. Being an avid fan of the original RE: Outbreak titles and still playing them to this very day, I see much potential to be had if this project moves forward in the right direction.(And if people give it a chance to grow in the first place... the demand for this could be huge.)But all nostalgia aside let's assess the current state of the project. First and foremost this game could definitely use a tank control movement option, escaping is a ♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes with just the current set. An animation update to replace the cheery looking walking and also to hold the shotgun and other two-handed weapons with both hands while maneuvering around would be nice. (Personally I think it looks silly when the people walk around with big guns one-handed.) Plus a zombie grapple/bite attack would be cool too.(Though I'm sure changes like that are already on the horizon, and zombie dogs, pleeeease!)Now on the positive side it's dark, has great atmosphere and is very heavy on item management like the RE Classics that we all know and love. I had several tense/scary moments playing the scenario with the brightness all the way down and found it very thrilling. I cannot wait to see what new content this game has to offer for it's finalized version! Even if it takes a year or two I am a patient man and I will no doubt be playing this all throughout it's development and then some. This is a fantastic concept and I believe with the proper support, time, hard-work and dedication this can become a great survival horror title on par with the original Ps2 title that I still am sinking countless hours into.Recommending this to my friends for now and will be editing in my thoughts on future updates."

I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed classic resident evil titles (0-3, code Veronica, outbreak) or the  silent hill games. It's brings back the nostalgia and challenge of the old styled tank controlled horror game with limited ammo, low health , and puzzles. And playing through in coop is a blast especially when each player assumes a role in the group, the rpg style lvl ups are also a welcome touch that adds to the replayability and there are still more scenarios and content coming which is great and can't wait to see the game when it's finished!"

There are 4 characters (for now) and you can level each one up to unlock character specific skills like increased gun or melee damage. There are currently 2 maps and 3 game modes but I know the dev is going to add more maps and characters before full release.

Specifically, it tries to be like older Resident Evil titles and it gets mostly there. I'm eager to see where this game goes. It is in early access so you can expect bugs and the like. My biggest gripe so far are the animations. You thought Mass Effect: Andromeda's animations are bad? Wait until you see these. The animations are about as bad as Resident Evil 1's voice acting (The original on PS1). The walking is... slidey but reverse. In some games, characters that move faster than their footsteps makes it seem like they're skating. In this game, it seems like they're not moving enough with their footsteps. No recoil animations and weapon grip and stances are atrocious. Just some constructive criticism though. I am still very excited to see where this game goes. Only 4 days old at time of writing and it has enough to appeal to Resident Evil fans."
