,Recommended,644670,32040869,Posted: 29 May,all,Zenchess,"This is it.  VR melee combat.I've got 7 hours in and I can own some people, lose to others.  The game feels like I'm back in martial arts class.  You have to defend your weak points and take advantage of your opponent's mistakes.  You can block attacks, you can sidestep around enemies.  Every game I try to learn more and more about how to play so that I can improve.  Some people I can just totally negate their weapon with one of my weapons while I side stab them.  Some people run back and forth swinging wildly.  There's talk here and there of various weapons being OP, and that might be true, but when in history did people really know what was 'OP' until years and years of top level competition?Devs seem to be pretty active as the game just came out and there's already been patches.The community has only grown since launch, and while there might be 10-20 people on, I feel like it's going to keep growing, and it's usually not hard to find a match.  Unfortunately matchmaking is a little weird - you need to queue up at the same time as your friend if you want to just face him/her, otherwise it will choose an opponent based on all the people queued up.There's a variety of weapons so you can really pick a style that suits you.  I haven't run into a single jerk in-game, and I've met some pretty cool people.  There was this one old man who called me 'Sensei' when I beat him.  I taught him some stuff.I don't think there's another game like this in existence.  I don't want to play shooters - I want melee combat where I use my arms and positioning to outmaneuver my opponents, just like a martial art - and this is the only game I know of that (currently) fits the bill.It's not perfect, and I don't expect it to be at this stage.  I feel like more subtle physics are necessary for when swords collide and when they are in contact.Nevertheless, this game, even in its current state, is a must play for all honorable warriors.  As far as I know, this is just the beginning of what I hope is an amazing future."

,Not Recommended,644670,32115198,Posted: 1 June,all,Foxx ♠,"The only way I can explain the positive reviews for this game is that so far, VR is a young market and people are more lenient with the games.Just from the top off my head:-Shield doesn't always properly parry the damage. I kept getting killed by someone hitting my shield.-The weapon physics is AWFULL. I swear I cannot put into words how bad it is:----Your weapon goes really slow when you're in close combat???----Your weapon gets stopped by stuff you're not even remotely touching so you're constantly parried----Somehow stabbing someone pushes him away(???) so if he has a spear you're making his life easier: the game punishes you for managing to get at the right distance by... pushing your opponent away?-You can fall off the lobby.Now, it's early access and issues are to be expected... But the game has customs, multiple maps, and a lot of weapons... Wich begs the question: If the devs would rather add weapons and maps and beards, are they able to fix the issues or are they just avoiding it?"
,Recommended,644670,32021226,Posted: 28 May,all,Cheru,"I've always been a sucker for VR fighting games, so it goes without saying that as soon as I saw this pop up on Steam, I decided to pick it up.One of the first things that I look for in a VR fighting game and quite possibly the most important factor, at least in my opinion, is how the in-game movements scale with their real-life counterparts. Will I need to perform ridiculously exaggerated movements in order to actually hit my enemy, or will I be able to move in a similar fashion to how I would move in real life? A perfect example of how NOT to implement proper scaling can be seen in another VR fighting game by the name of Drunkn Bar Fight, which is a great game but has the worst movement scaling I've ever seen in a VR title to date. In Deus Vult, despite the warning/disclaimer it gives on its store page, I can play very comfortable in my 2.5 x 1.5 play space without worrying too much about bumping into anything or hitting my walls, which says a lot, given my size.One thing I'd like to see changed however, is the way that movement works. It uses a similar mechanic to Gorn, but rather than the touchpad, it requires the user to pull the trigger button on the bottom of the Vive controller. This isn't a big issue, but it feels a lot more natural to me to use my thumb on the pad, than my index finger on the underside of what is usually used to fire a gun or something of a similar sort. A small thing, but something I'd like to see change in future.The game provides you with three graphics settings, however I can't comment on the middle or the highest, as I chose the ""fastest"" option. With my 980 Ti, the game appeared to run fine without any issues at all, at least locally. The issues that you may run into however, are going to come from the latency based on your distance from the server and the people you're playing with. I'm sure that I would have had a much smoother and enjoyable experience if I hadn't been playing with 200-300 ping, however at this early stage in the game's development, I can't expect too much. I'm planning on trying a multiplayer game with another Australian mate some time this week, so hopefully there are less lag related issues then.One of the game's strongest features is the character customization. You can quite literally choose everything from your physical appearance to the clothes and armour you wear into battle, as well as a whole range of different weapons for you to play around with and experiment with. This is perhaps the thing that I like most about Deus Vult.As far as sound goes, it's decent, but there's nothing particularly special that you'd bother telling your mum about. Average BGM, average sound effects, but nothing bad.There's also an insanely hot bar-maid with an unbelievable backside that you could easily stare at for hours on end. She alone is worth the asking price lol.Hope this helps anyone that's currently sitting on the fence!Cheers :)p.s. - for anyone interested, here's a bit of gameplay -https://youtu.be/g-IwfUubt38"

It's Early Access and it shows, and could use some major improvements in some areas (sword physics or response time is a little goofy.) but it nonetheless is great fun.Landing those awesome moves on another player is great, the weapons that I've unlocked so far are unique and feel very different and are all very fun.Get this game if you have VR, and hey it doubles as a gym membership. I played for one hour and probably lost 6lbs in sweat alone.Oh and stay away from THE POON DESTROYER. Trust me"

It's too warm today ;)My Impressions so far:Graphics and Presentation are very nice.1 vs 1 Multiplayer is working good.The fights are a little bit chaotic. It needs some fine tuning.This game has big potential and I'm looking forward to have more content.PvE and Battles with more players would be fun.Update 1.5 hours played:I still enjoy the fighting. There are some funny guys around!BUT: The fights are often too chaotic. For me it seems that ""2-Hand weapon wild slashing"" is overpowered.Either cancel 2-Hand Weapon or decrease the damage when using 2 Weapons. Maybe a stamina-system might help to avoid wild slashing orgies. I enjoyed the strategic shield vs. shield battles more.In the Tavern you should include some mini-games. Otherwise people won't wait, if there is no other player available and the game might die quick, what would be sad.Anyway: Nice game! Keep up the good work!"

Gameplay feels a little rubbery at times but I feel for an EA title it has a very good foundation in which to grow. I fully recommend the game and also recommend putting mattresses and padding all around your playspace. Already put a dent in my computer case from a crazy sword fight hit the wall 3 times knocked over my vive stand and braised my TV...YOU NEED LOTS OF PLAY SPACE! If you are barely making the minimum requirements for room scale or if your room you are playing in is small or confined I do not recommend this game! YOU WILL BREAK S#!T!
,Recommended,644670,32010078,Posted: 27 May,all,chace,"Great game!!!! The only thing that i think needs to be fixed is that sometimes people move so fast that you cannot block their attacks because you will get bit before you even see them move, but other than that i think this game is fantastic and has a ton of potential. Well worth the buy!"
,Recommended,644670,32004792,Posted: 27 May,all,Anonymous,"Love this game, its a ton of fun.  I have had some really close battles and so far joining fights has been very fast.  This is a one on one pvp sword and shield fighting game.  The rounds go by pretty fast there are tons of intense and funny moments in the combat and in the social tavern.  For day one of EA, this game has an excellent foundation.  There are definately problems but for this early of a release the game is solid.  Highly reccomend.Edit:  Leaving the thumbs up, but this game is dead and it is very sad to see.  I had so much fun but the price barrier on this game has kept way to many people out of it.  If the developers would lower the price to around $5 this game could thrive, at the moment no one plays it.  Ghost town VR.  No matter how good the game is, only a thriving community can make a VR game a success."

Take it from someone who has been in SteamVR for more than a year now- this game is a lot of fun.Be warned! It is a MAJOR workout if you want to be tactical!

I have played for a little and have developed a strat to where I know I can win almost win every time. People will say the mechanics are clunky but its only because they don't know how to play. This is a very great game and I really hope it doesn't die because people pick it up and then suck and quit.

I'm going to try and be as objective as possible after having played a few rounds.Is it worth it now? YES! It's a ton of fun, very invigorating and a fantastic start, but of course has some glaring issues.PROS:- Great graphics- Honestly, it's a ton of fun, with a decent player base (as of right now).-  Decent physics over-all.CONS:- You move by swinging your arms which make moving and fighting very difficult if not outright silly. Needs more movement style ie) Onward.- The physics for the weapons are too rubbery right now. When you swing fast you can see it trail behind you, it makes it feel very weird and impossible to land a precise attack most of the time.- There needs to be some type of stamina penalty for people who just wildly swing in all directions.- The spear is 100% OP. All one must do is twirl it around and good luck getting close to you. I beat 3x people until I played someone with the spear and it was literally impossible."

,Recommended,644670,32032469,Posted: 28 May,all,Elderr ㅡ addicted to m&b,"Really fun so far, can't wait to play more of it. Tons of fun for a game that's this early, and the developer seems responsive.There are some physics problems I'm sure he knows about and is working on (sometimes the weapons lag behind a bit too much, or they start twisting/spinning) as well as balance which they have said they are working on actively.This is one of the first PVP VR games I've seen that has a worthwhile unlock system, so that's pretty neat.  It feels really cool to level up and get a new weapon that behaves differently, does different damage, has different weight.One thing that should be added immediately is a method of muting others and muting yourself. This really shouldn't be too hard to add, and would be greatly appreciated by me and plenty others. (especially with what's going on in the discussion forums, don't want to have to deal with that spilling over into the game if it does)Overall really fun and highly recommended to anyone who wanted a good melee fighting game, especially one where you can finally fight your friends. Good work dev, and please continue what you're doing!"

When you get close to someone, you simply cant swing and the animation doesn't really look like you're being blocked at all. Also, my sword floated away about 4 feet from me once. Multiplayer people were really rude and immature and it doesn't look like theres a way to mute them just yet.

,Not Recommended,644670,32037117,Posted: 29 May,all,TheNarwhal,"As an early access fighting game, it does avoid the problem that sword master VR had, in that the enemies come close enough to attack, but as of the most recent update, the enemies now come a little too close, as it seems they were told to just not stop moving towards the player. This leads to me, using a spear, to be unable to attack them whatsoever as it is a long pole weapon, close distance is not its forte. Even the axes and swords have a tough time hitting enemies when they're within freaking kissing range.On the matter of the single-handed axes, the weapons you get in level two, they're SEVERELY overpowered, compared to swords. My first match online, I fought someone with two axes whom just started moving them rapidly up and down. I had no possible way to attack him with how he just kept swinging, getting too close would mean I got hit by their high damage, low recoil swings. I've played against expert AI with two axes just swinging rapidly with no repercussions. Just a lot of victory."
,Not Recommended,644670,32006648,Posted: 27 May,all,bUbir,"I've gotten my sword bent at a 90 degree angle from my arm with it ever so slowly returning back to regular position, nowhere near fast enough for me to strike back at my enemy even after backing away to recover. I've been killed from guys running circles around me 360 and smacking me with an axe, even though it seems that slashing is really ineffective. Stabbing with my sword seemed to be the only effective type of attack, even after trying various speeds for swinging.The tutorial sucks and it simply teaches you how to walk and puts you against what I assume is an easy level bot without teaching you how to attack and defend yourself properly. (This may be improved in the future)There seem to be lag issues with blocking which may be more prominent if you are a proud European owner of a VR headset.It seems to me that people might just be buying the game for the meme name and if that's you then... I can't really tell you not to? But if you want good melee fighting gameplay in VR, this isn't it. You'll have to wait for either updates or for someone else to release a better game. For now, I'm refunding.Points, condensed:Matchmaking only for online gameplay. No private lobbies, can't play with my friends. Forced to play with strangers. Weapons are floppy and take long to ""re-straighten"" in your hand, unreliable connection overseas (which may not be a problem if you are a resident of the United States).Stick to GORN for satisfying melee combat, but if you want to play online in this game, I'd straight up advise against doing so."

I've played plenty now,  ranging from about 15-20vr games.

Both tied with 2 wins a final battle to decide the victory. One hit from either player would decide the game....I got in my stance as he did his, both breathing heavily from our previous battles and clashing of weapons...We rush at each other, I dodge and took advantage of the opening with a swing!!!The victory was mine and it felt well earned.P.s. great work out!  Get the game!"
,Recommended,644670,32095990,Posted: 31 May,all,Mattzap,"This is the first multiplayer VR swordfighting game and while not perfect, it gets a lot of things right.The combat strategy revolves around using your weapons/shields to balance defending your body, attacking, and moving (which involves using one of your hands and losing cover).There are basically unlimited ways to move (since you're tracking your body) and the,\ large weapon selection means you get a lot of freedom to create your own fighting style (similar to Chivalry). For example, mine consists of moving quickly with two swords and alternating between dashing to their heads, dropping down and slashing their feet, or running circles around them while backstabing.The biggest flaw is that there is no feedback when swords clash, so what happens when two player's sword hit is their body/sword will just not move. However, this starts to feel more natural the more you play. You start to move back quicker and the fighting feels much more fluid when two good players duel. There are also some glitches and crashes. Some weapons also feel overpowered versus others, and the low playerbase / lack of matchmaking means sometimes someone is much better than the other player.  But overall, the game is extremely fun (and a huge workout)."

,Recommended,644670,32152403,Posted: 3 June,all,MasonLegs,sure the animations look goofy but its genuinely a fun gamemy only real issue is that some people just swing randomly and still win. using no real tactics. its much worse than button mashing.
,Recommended,644670,32167909,Posted: 3 June,all,wickedzolzol,"Love, love, love this game.It can be a bit glitchy at times, but for the good 90-95% very smooth. I have enjoyed this game more than every other game that I have experienced on VR. This is what ive wanted from VR.I would suggest at least a 6x6 play area. mine is currently about 5x6 and i tend to bump into the shelfs on my wall and may or may not have broken a television, and a controller. {still won the match though ;-D}Overall Excellent experience. Tons of fun. And i have recomended this to all of my friends.Some things i would like to see, maybe some sort of statistics like wins/losses, weapons you have the most kills with. Just something of that sort. I have noticed alot of people tend to look like they are squatting, maybe some sort of calibration durring charecter editting to help sort that out. And i hope there can someday be some sort of huge free for all of like 6+ people, it would be awesome!"

,Not Recommended,644670,32035948,Posted: 28 May,all,Spoiler Alert,"One of the first things I thought when I started playing For Honor was ""Wow, this would be cool in VR"". Deus Vult does a fantastic job bringing swordplay and combat to VR. The locomotion works well once you get used to it. Combat is fun and mostly immersive (weapon physics needs a bit of work but so far so good). I am extremely impressed with this game in its alpha form and cannot wait to see it evolve. Great work! I play a PK in For Honor and it's great that I was able to ""become"" my character in virtual reality. Physically engaging with a game like Deus Vult can also be a great workout!//EDITED//After the latest update (with horrid voice acting I might add) and the price hike, this game is no longer fun. Looks like they really do want to be like For Honor. I used to enjoy it, now it sucks. The price is also 200% higher than when I originally got it. Wait for it to go on sale, or wait for the developer to fix it again. Had to switch my thumb on this one."
,Recommended,644670,33633344,Posted: 18 July,all,WhiteTailUSA,Action packed game with intense 1 vs 1 battles. Customizable character and multiple settings (maps) to fight other players. Unfortunately there are not many players on at any given time. The most I've seen is two. You are forced to fight AI or wait around and hope another players hops on. A shame given the PVP intensity is one of the most exciting action in VR I've played.Moving in this game takes time to get comfortable with.

Turns out its just a limb flailing simulator, attempting to get the game to register your weapon hitting them before they get their weapon to register a block. I'd maybe play this game once and a while if it was F2P but it's not worth having paid money for.. Refund Plox."
