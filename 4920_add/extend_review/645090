,Not Recommended,645090,32455553,Posted: 15 June,all,Zyzzyzus,There are too many zup games and they need to stop this. This game offers nothing much that the others don't offer. The new mechanics don't really change things and the levels can still just be done with trial & error.Don't buy this since the developers are clearly just doing it for money and not putting much thought into it. More reputable developers would condense it into 1 or 2 games and wouldn't add 1000s of easy achievements.

,Not Recommended,645090,32431662,Posted: 15 June,all,J4MESOX4D,"By far the easiest, most uninspired and least enjoyable of all the Zup! games. Despite being a fan of the nifty little series; this is the only one that I simply do not recommend because it feels extremely cheap, rushed and the achievements not only look awful but they are even easier to earn than if you were cheating them with some achievement manager program!Zup! 5 introduces a new mechanic of portals in this outing but the dreadfully simplistic level design throughout fails to maximise their potential leaving each of the 60+ levels feeling very underwhelming indeed. You will likely sail through to the final one in about 45 minutes without feeling challenged or impressed in the slightest.Overall; Zup! 5 is the worst one of the series to date with poor level design that is far too easy and fails to impress with any ingenuity whatsoever. Classic mechanics that were introduced previous have been neglected as this game focuses primarily on portals without providing challenging and entertaining puzzles that visually impress and offer a distinct feeling of reward."

I guess so, but it's not any different than the previous games in the series.BADExactly the same repeatable game levels that that are boring to play more than once. Lack of creativity, it's clear that this game series is focused only towards the achivements.

Though I understand that some people may be p*ssed that they keep having to spend money on achievement hunting (Yes, I know...2K+ achievements in less than an hour...)...it's gotten to the point that I simply enjoyZup!in general...it's very calm and feels welcoming.The developers were listening and have responded kindly by implementing more portal puzzles!!!  And yes, the goal is still the same, get the blue ball onto the green pad by any means.  Some puzzles this time around feel a bit confusing, but knowingZup!, the solution is usually simple and elegant when you calm your mind.  I feel the developers were on top of their A-Game in terms of creativity this time.The visuals are as you would expect from anyZup!game and the music choice is intoxicating...almost sad, yet inviting...kinda' makes me feel likeZup!is a dear friend.  Sadly, you can only expect to enjoy this game for about 30-60 minutes...that's probably my only complaint.  It's short.   ButZup!is like a firework.  Wonderful when you see it in the sky, but just as quickly as it appears...it's gone...Do I recommendZup! 5?  You betcha!!!  Asking price is $1 and sales price is $0.79.

The puzzles are relatively straightforward and well designed. Some may catch you out a little here and there but for the most part they're not very tasking and you can complete any of the games in under an hour.This game did exactly what I wanted (gave me lots of cool achievements to decorate with) and wasn't a chore to play so would recommned highly to gamers with similar intentions. If you're actually looking for a challenging puzzle game however then there are probably better ones on the market.

The goal is to land the blue ball on the green platform. To do this you must explode the red blocks which will launch the yellow blocks away from the blast allowing the blue ball to reach the platform. Most levels have multiple red explosive blocks, so your job is to figure out which ones to explode and when.+ Creatively designed levels which keeps the game feeling fresh and enjoyable from start to finish+ The game has the right balance of not being too difficult while still being a fair bit challenging. Some stages make the player think a fair bit in order to find the solution.- Sometimes the physics feels a bit ""random"" making a few stages reliant on luck which can be a bit irritating."

Nonetheless, the entire game can be completed in 30 minutes. While it is an achievement spam game, at least you get them after finishing a level unlike a few others that gives you hundreds of 'em for doing redundant things in a game.Only buy this if you're looking for a relatively easy puzzle game and if you're an achievement hunter. If not, it's better if you skipped the game (the series actually) entirely."

,Not Recommended,645090,34794463,Posted: 7 September,all,kayhmkay,"This would be a mixed review, but since the individual points that I can remember from the game are negative, I went for ""Not recommended"".Zup! 5 is a minimalistic puzzle with explosions. The idea is simple and the gameplay is just as simple. A great game for relaxation.If you have played the previous Zup! games, you know the deal. This time the new mechanic is the portals (which I feel were often underused: they were more as an extension of the course, not a part of the solution). However, it's oddly meditative to watch stuff go through them.The negatives I talked about?1. When you have to wait for achievement pop-ups to stop before you can solve a level, there are *WAY* too many achievements. Or bad level design.2. The game takes about 30 minute to complete: way too little content!3. The music seems to be really short and loops probably hundreds of times in the 30 minutes.4. Most puzzles are ridiculously easy -- so easy in fact that you *cannot* offer any other solution than the correct one.All in all, if you've played one Zup! you've seen it all. This installment is probably the weakest one, so I'd recommend you rather try 1 or Zero if you only want one. For those who find this kind of easy clicking addictive and relaxing, a must buy. The simple and clean look is still captivating."

If you want a nice little puzzle game to play that has a ton of achievements for cheap than this game is for you, but if you are looking for a hardcore puzzle game that makes you think alot than I suggest looking at another game.

Perfect for an achievement showcase on your profile.2. Its cheap as fuccEven without a sale its just 1 dollar. No reason to not get it.Anyway lets talk about the game itself.I really dont like this game. The aesthetics hurt my eyes after playing for the hour I did. Speaking of the hour I played, thats how long it took to get the achievements. Thats right. All 2130 achievements were gotten in an hour. Even shorter with more luck. This game isnt a puzzle. Its a lottery. Sometimes you can know exactly what to do in a ""puzzle"". But when you go to click a block it just flies in a random direction. I experienced this in 4 levels.If you want to spell out your name on your profile, and you dont want to get LYNE or another one of the letter achievement games, then you can get this game for dirt cheap and go right ahead.

It's a calming hour or so game for the price of a soda (cheaper depending on where you get it.), the developer of this game is very nice, and has listened to his customers, and each version of Zup! has a new feature. I love the importance of physics, and the calming nature of the game. Something a lot of people overlook about Zup! is the DLC. Each game has free DLC that adds additional levels, for free. And each iteration of Zup! contains a new feature, this one being portals! (Has taken the place for my favorite Zup!)For $1, this game is totally worth it.

Only negative to say is that the puzzles are WAY to easy an it took about 20 minutes to finish each game. Also there was only maybe 4-5 maps i had some trouble getting done within the first 6-7 times which makes it far less challenging then i hope for. Other then that these games are totally awesome. I can't wait for the next one in the series, and i hope they make Zup 6 with a lot more maps and i really hope they make them more challenging also.. Other that that! 10/10 from me!

,Not Recommended,645090,32734370,Posted: 24 June,all,NeZ,"Zup! is a tiny puzzle game series where you bomb a ball onto a green floor. Each level is short - some require a prayer to RNGesus, most don't. This is the sixth game in the series and one of the most boring ones so far. It doesn't really have a new mechanic either. Most levels are one-trick ponys, 2 levels are frustratingly dependent on RNG. Unfortunately the game is overall still too easy.So I can't really recommend Zup! 5 from a gameplay standpoint.But if you like the series or want to buy the game for the 2130 achievements - go for it. It's worth your money. But if you're new to the series just buy Zup! 3. It's much harder and has around the same number of achievements.For comparison, here are the 6 Zup! games so far and how long it took me to get 100%:Zup! 1: 118 achievements, 17 minutesZup! 2: 229 achievements, 26 minutesZup! 3: 1708 achievements, 48 minutesZup! 4: 555 achievements, 23 minutesZup Zero: 1043 achievements, 37 minutesZup! 5: 2130 achievements, 46 minutes"

Some puzzles have alternative solutions but generally each has a single ""prime"" method of achievement. This, as with the other titles in the series, has modest replay value, some decent puzzles (primarily reflected on proper timing) and a relaxing soundtrack.As ever, there are tons of achivements--holding true to one of the mainstays of Zup! (Good for hunters, customising one's steam profile and as a, now, long running ""joke"" of sorts).Game play is approx 40 minutes (if you are distracted) but enjoyable.Overall this is worth the price."

,Not Recommended,645090,32963973,Posted: 28 June,all,ChocolatierGames,"This game provides an interesting concept, but sadly falls shortZup! 5 is a 2D puzzle game in which you cause red colored blocks or balls to explode, to propel your ball to a patch of teal on the level. The game's puzzles are simple, and so is the gameplay, but I feel that there is something missing from the experience. Whether it is due to the content or difficulty not ramping up I cannot tell you, but my experience felt very samey after only a half an hour or so. This doesn't mean the game isn't fun, but more content or features would be appreciated. The puzzles also are not very difficult, and only a few gave me trouble, mostly due to a puzzle requiring trial and error to complete, but nothing feels quite like sitting back, thinking of a plan, and then executing on that and watching all the pieces come together.Some of the gameplay features seem to not make sense, the main thing that comes to mind is once the level is complete, a door just opens to the side and you click on it. It shows a strange disconnect from the gameplay, and I wish it was a different transition, and more tied into the gameplay.The art is solid, but nothing above average. The minimalistic art style serves the game well but isn't an outstanding feature. I do appreciate the variety of color, and it does give me something nice to look at during the levels. The sound effects are also passable if a bit basic, things like the explosion when you cause a block to explode seemed a bit like a stock sound effect. the music was quite good, but the lack of tracks made it a bit repetitive, and I found myself wishing there were more tracks, as they were all good.Overall this was a decent puzzle game, but I think it would be better suited on a browser a few years ago if you think it might be for you then surely check it out. however, the basic gameplay and mediocre art causes this game to fall right in the middle at a 5 out of 10 with a label of ""needs more""."

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.
