76561198031274244,Recommended,645790,32841865,Posted: 26 June,all,Wintro,Despite its simple graphics it betrays the level of depth the devs put into this fantastic game. The game is challenging as you will see your poor plastic soldiers get chew up by the insect horde but if you stick with it and try out new strategies you will find my top RTS for the year by none.9/10 Would watch my men die to ants again

Sometimes hit boxs mess up and you cant hit a certain bug that proceded to kill of all of your artillery. Other times jumping insects glitch into the floor or a couch.More often though, you kill 1000 bugs, lose almost no one, and yet fail because you have no explosives to take out the nest. The dev encourages different strategies except the way the games currently set up makes it nearly impossible to deviate from a specific one in the early game. Let me fill you in, choose to spend your starting XP on anything except the sapper, truck, and rifleman and you will lose because you either have no explosives, or your soldiers are inept. I'm just happy the dev finaly gave you enough starting XP to get all three of those.The only reason I recomend this game is because I would be lying if I said I haven't enjoyed it a lot, the dev is updating often, and also seems to be listening to the players input. So its going to get a lot better."

Too difficult.  Maybe it will get easier after I play it more and get better?Overall:I hope this game is eventually completed, what a fantastic idea! As of right now, I can’t recommend it, but I don’t mind spending $10 to help get this game done. It seems to be heading in the right direction, so hopefully it continues that way!"

We all used to imagine them in various situations, fighting off hordes and armies of foes. But how many of us envisioned them fighting off the lovely swarms of ants and spiders? This game brings that idea to life. Every year our home gets invaded by bugs, and its the duty of these lil green men to hold them off til Fall. Are you able to hold them off? Or will your house be overrun with puddles of green plastic all over the place? I love how this game is constructed, tho work still needs to be done, and thats great. Would love to have a greater control over my camera, but its a small gripe. Early campaign seems a bit unequal, but maybe thats a planned fault? In either case, love this game. 8/10 would recommend for any age."

Want revenge on that ant that bit you on the toe? Or that spider that fell into your hair? Well then consider this your game.Be warned, this game is not for those who want to beat the crap out of bugs and be happy the leave after 4 hours of gameplay.

Then watch as what humans consider puny, a swarm of 1000 ants RIP YOUR TINY PLASTIC MEN TO PIECES!

,Recommended,645790,32404560,Posted: 13 June,all,Drone,"TL;DR  Goofy Game that will keep you happy but also slap you in the face for thinking it is an easy game. Hard as hell and rewarding to win battles. Feels like a throw back to Older army man games like ""Army Men Sarge's Heroes""Good turn based unit movement.Good combat interactions. I feel it is a bit of just mob the enemy due to troops not being able to fire on the move.Resource management is well done. Research has tons of choice tho more XP for winning would be nice go from 10 to 30 or so.Bugs will murder you if you do not play aggressively and cut off food for them quick.I really feel that some weapons need bigger splash. Going Scout helos for rockets was a let down to see the high powered rockets did very little to huge swarms of ants.Tanks need a bit largre spash. It seemed that Light weapons are more effective so having cannons do more AOE would put them on par.Please add more time to round start for set up tho. No point of my sappers if I get attacked by grasshoppers before I am finished getting set up."

It's early access, and a bit more rough around the edges than one might expect.Gameplay itself is very difficult, but can be rewarding. There are two different screens that you will always be on. One of them is the management screen, where you will be managing your headquarters, deploying groups of soldiers to capture rooms of the house, and planning out expansion of your army. The other view is the battle screen, where you can requisition nearby soldiers in the room to fight bugs, cutting out a small area to do an RTS-style battle on a small map. Think of this system as a grand-strategy type game where you see everything on the world map (the entire house and all of its rooms, your troops, and groups of bugs if you have vision of them), and combat is handled separately in RTS-like battle maps.The learning curve is incredibly steep and you WILL lose horribly your first game. You can easily be outnumbered 15 to 1 as your puny Light Riflemen succumb to mosquitos and black ants. Also, without supply trucks and sappers unlocked and in your armies, you won't stand a chance. Trial and error is how Home Wars is played; you have to come up with your own strategies and make the most of them.Your units are somewhat hard to control for an RTS. The camera controls feel very wonky (edge scroll up and down angles camera up and down, edge scroll left and right rotates camera, rather than the traditional edge scroll = pan camera in that direction; WASD still pans camera in those directions). I often times find the camera clipping through walls and doors in the individual battle screen, blocking the view entirely. This can be partially avoided by adjusting the camera. Also, if you keep your cursor at the edge of the screen, the entire view will just start spinning endlessly until you take it away from the edge, which is a bit of a problem if you have multiple monitors side by side.When you're not moving your armies around and doing actual battle with bugs, you can go to your headquarters to manage your entire operation. Fielding armies, building base structures, and managing resources and ammunition, as well as unlocking new units and technology is all done here. You had better like the color green.The sentence structure with in-game text is not the best, but it shows more personality from the developers, which gives the game character. Overall the GUI is very colorful and informative. One bonus is that the ""Intel"" tab in your headquarters menu will actually show you relevant info regarding the bugs' evolution stage, including stats and the actual names of the species of bugs you'll encounter, among other things. Pretty neat, right?I would say that since this game is still in its infancy for the most part, I can't really give it a solid review. However, I will say that of what little I've played, there are no BUGS (Ha...) and I do enjoy the game quite a bit and I think it's definitely worth the current price of $10. I can't wait to see what the devs do next!---TL;DR: 7/10, very steep learning curve and less than desirable controls, but has lots of potential to be a very fun strategy game"
,Recommended,645790,33329284,Posted: 6 July,all,BlackRambo,"At first glance this does not look like a good game. Upon further inspection it is actually a surprisingly deep RTS with a lot of tactical depth and units to choose from. Your fight against the bugs is not an easy one, but it certainly is an enjoyable one. For the asking price of $10 this is a steal. I plan to put many more hours into this game and hope to see it grow in the future. Although not without its balance issues at the moment it is a true delight."
,Recommended,645790,33888140,Posted: 29 July,all,Warnstaff,"It's little green army men vs the monstrosities of the hive flee... err many backyard bugs!You have a sandbox style campaign mode which allows you to conquer the galax... house and push back swarms of bugs in a turn based meta-game that is surprisingly deep. Once you meet the bugs, you go into a light RTS battle (by no means Starcraft, but still very awesome) in which your trooops (limited to 200 at any one time depending on your settings, but can reinforce so not limited really) fight it out with the bugs that litterally swarm you. Here you can select nearly any unit and take direct 1st/3rd person control of them, from infantry to aircraft.The best part is that all of this is cusomizable. Want a super massive swarm is ultra weak bugs to fight? Sliders for that. Want super small ultra powerful bugs? That too! Ultra strong and ultra massive swarm? This too! And also ultra small and ultra weak. Totally cusomizable. Sadly though there is no modding, but nots of fun without that.It is by no means a AAA title, but it's strangley compelling. Just buy it already! It's not expensive but easily worth twice what it is."
76561198006558748,Recommended,645790,33252497,Posted: 4 July,all,Heart of Storm,"Home Wars is a suprisingly deep indie RTS, which pitches armies of plastic men against swarms of creepie crawlies.I've pumped a good 10 hours into the game, enough to learn its systems and complete a basic campaign.  There is an in game manual, accessible at all times which explains the games systems but if you're like me and just want to jump into the gameplay, expect to get facerolled a few times until you learn how the ammo/logistic system works, and which units are worth building (cough cough Sappers are decisive).The game has a strategic layer, where you buy armies, upgrade your base (and manufacturing abilities) and move units to defend and attack areas of the house, and a combat layer where your forces, who will always be horribly outnumbered, have to face the bug swarm.The game comes with 4 campaigns, and a custom battle maker, so theres some good replayability here.The game is a little buggy still, however the Devs are active in a way I've never seen in Steam, they're active on the steam forum and often deploy hotfixes within a day or two of a bug being reported.Minor criticisms would be the sound quality is poor, battles can be a little repetetive and grindy, the game's systems are not wholly intuitive which makes for tough going to a new player, but once you learn how to win it really falls down to the player to allow the AI space to generate enough resources to pose a challenge, however the activity of the Devs makes me hopeful that they'll finetune the balance enough to rectify this.All told though this is a fun little game that is well worth the asking price and offers far greater depth than it would initially appear."

So much depth and work put into this game, it deserves recognition. You will play as the iconic plastic army men that always made us happy during our childhood fighting against the bug hordes. The more rooms you take, the more supplies you obtain.The base building in this indie title is great, the more you upgrade, the better chance you have against your foes. Research is key in this game for technological advancements, just remember the bugs evolve as well, perhaps even faster than you in most cases. This game is extremely hard, you make one false move in the beginning, it could be the end of your campaign.You will get overrun, there isn't a question about that. Do I recommend buying this title? Absolutely, it's a 10 dollar game with a ton of content. I say buy this game right now if you're reading this, it's worth a try.CONS: Just a little side note, Home Wars has a lot of (bugs), no pun intended.

,Recommended,645790,32795251,Posted: 25 June,all,Emperor Palpatine,"I would greatly recommend this game. It is a great game for having pure fun, and it is more exciting due to the fact that its a new kind of RTS/Shooter. Home Wars may have quite a bit of bugs at the moment, but with daily updates and growing support those are likely to be eradicated, like all the puny insects and spiders that try to defeat the ULTIMATE ARMY! The game has many interesting features, for instance launching satellites, building your base up from the ground, and controlling any unit you would like. Also, for those of you who like big battles, you can fight with as many armies as you like![BEGINNER TIPS]when you start off, you want to get your metal and plastic production to a reasonable ammount.Making armies of 1 solder at the very start helps you get all the points you can, giving you more resources and vision.The first units you should research are the riflemen (not the light riflemen), and the supply truck. Both of those are crucial to victory."

The potential is on a legendary level. This game could be a game that lasts for years, but only if the devs complete it.Right now the game is very buggy, and many systems need to be completely redone, and the whole game needs to be rebalanced. There are also a ton of potential features that they really need to add for it to be good. It's simply an unfinished game.But, the developers are very active on the forum, and they are asking for suggestions and asking for feedback. So hopefully they will bring this game to its full potential.As it stands right now, $10 is not too unreasonable, but if you aren't sure if you like RTS and Strategy games that much, then I would wait. If you love RTS and Strategy games, then give it a try, and if you really hate it, get a refund. Don't expect it to be a well made game at the moment though.I have had a decent bit of fun, but I can only drool at what this game has the potential to be, so I'm keeping it in the hopes that the devs will finish it.UPDATE:Well, 15 updates later... and the game is not much better. There is still a lot of options lacking, including the ability to rebind the keys. There have been exactly ZERO new major changes. Basically all they have done is tweak some numbers and fix some minor bugs. They seem to be pretty happy with it... which is bad. This game is SOO lacking in content, and features, and polish. Don't buy this. If they decide to actually work on the game, then it'll be a great day, but don't expect this day to come any time soon."

I first discovered it through Baron's youtube channel and I thought it was one of the old classics that played on the Playstation 2, but I was suprised to find it had only recently come out. The game provides a great balance between the 2 forces, especially because I would see myself win battles and lose battles. The game is easy to learn as long as you put the time into it. The only complaint I would have is that some missions need a little work, like the destroying the mound mission is extremely difficult early game when you have only a small amount of artillery, and the capture the flag missions are annoying becuase they don't end despite slaughtering all the bugs. Some advice to make the game even more enjoyable would be to add a tan army into the mix that would make the campaign a 1v1v1 and maybe even add some sea units and outside battles Ex: (playground or a park instead of a house). Also a cool feature would be to add maybe a watchtower and pillbox to the sapper's abilities but make it so you have to manually put troops in them so it's not too easy. The camera should have a speed option aswell as I found the long hallways in the 2nd house very annoying to manuever my forces in.In its current state I rate this game 7.5/10"

That being said, once you win against several onslaughts of bugs you have a great sense of accomplishment. The combat forces you to try and counter your enemies with a variety of unit types from tanks, infantry, anti air weapons, artillary, and of course air force units(helicopters, bombers, and fighters). Each of the units have a pretty big role in your defenses or your assaults against the insect hives. I have just recently won my first campaign and it's a very rewarding experience to survive an entire season of the endless bug army.some key features are:- Manual control of units (plus a buff if you've researched it that makes you deal more damage)- Economy management and unit creation- Good strategic elements- Good variety of both enemies and units to use- Constant Developer feedback and content additions- The best use of virtual plastic army men I've seen in years.So without a doubt I have to recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy games, as well as anyone who prefers to destroy bugs with an army of plastic death.If I had to rate the game I'd say its a 8.5/10"

The manual also doesn't tell you how to rotate emplacements ( alt - scroll mouse wheel ) the controls do, which i found out after i had played a defensive match.camera - its just bad and hard to control. Also there is no alert for tab changing the camera which there should be.TL:DR -Games good but bad menus and overlay make it confusing to play. the matches are balanced except for ""stop the enemy convoy."

It is however a little clunky in it's movement wich isn't surprising as of now, but if you can look past it there isn't much wrong with the camera besides the actual method of movement, wich is by sliding your mouse to the side of the screen you would like to turn in. The UI is rather messy at first glance, but after you get yourself aquainted with it you can go in depth with your commands.The units are heavy in variety and are pretty impressive for an RTS game. The potential this game has is amazing, this type of game hasn't been done since Army Men RTS wich is yet another game I thoroughly enjoy, but if it can reach the game this could be it would take a while for sure.If you are new to the RTS genre I cannot reccomend this game for you because of it's difficultyIf you have already played some RTSs in the past, go on and try it out.

The units are fun to unlock, the stratagy can be interesting and the ability to climb atop of tables couches ect. is a nice touch even if I have yet to have it assist me in any situation. It really does feel like when you were a kid playing with army. Unfortunately I'll say that after awhile the repetive nature of the game can get boring. There isn't a lot to do in the campaign except hold a position long enough to overthrow the next position. I will give credit where credit is do, when it comes to epic clashes of army men vs bugs it does feel epic especially when you unlocked a new bunch of toys like tanks or planes. New units keep the game more interesting as you go along however from my stand point I have found that an auto resolution button would be a nice touch because a battle everyday is tedious when you have a force so big that even if the owners of the home were to try and take you down they might have trouble. To me the game was too easy and those who are saying its hard I see where they are coming from my first campaign was  very short as I did not understand the rules of gameplay. Soon after my demise though I restarted and taken over the entire house in a matter of only 10 days. I would reccomend this game to anyone as i think the developers could do wicked things with this. Including introducing I don't know... maybe a Tan army? That would make it very interesting."

,Recommended,645790,32520721,Posted: 17 June,all,Poison,"My first review about this game was negative, because I usually don't have good experiences with games like these, but after not even one hour the developer asked me what the bug (haha) related to the game was and tried to help. First of all this shows me how much they care about the game.Gameplay itself is fun, but kinda hard. The bugs overrun you pretty fast.Pros of the game are:- Tactical Gameplay- Ressource Management- Lots of variation in enemies and units- Reminds me a bit of Total War- You can control units yourself- Friendly developersCons are:- There are still some bugs in this game.- Game pauses when changing tab (not a huge problem, but I often play in windowed mode and want to change tabs in between)- In gamemodes like conquest the flags you have to wait when you finished all the enemies and your points are already over the enemies flagpoints. This is kinda boring but you can speed up time by up to 4x. Same goes for defending outposts, but there you have to wait the entire time (10 minutes). It mentions that oyu can also win by killing all enemies, but they are either stuck somewhere and you have to search for them or they hide.- My units (atleast the soldiers) can not shoot while moving. I don't know wether that is supposed to be or not, but you can't really advance when your units can not shoot while moving. Or atleast it's way harder.- Random hitmarkers. Sometimes when I hit enemies they get a hitmarker, sometimes they don't. I'm not even sure if I hit them or not, but they die anyways.- I encountered a bug where my units didn't shoot the enemy ants, neither did they have hitboxes to be killed. They were basically indestructible.I will update this review when I get more playtime, this is just the first look."

,Recommended,645790,33482338,Posted: 12 July,all,Rob,"I bought this game without looking too much into it for the simple reason it brought back fond memories of the 3DO Army Men series. I was expecting a run-of-the mill RTS that would be good enough to kill a few hours. Even in the short time I've had with it it has managed to exceed my expectations in every regard.It plays, to an extent, like a hybrid of a Total War game and the Army Men series of old. There is an enormous amount of variety and customization available for your army. You have unprecedented control over not just the compositoin of the army but the loadouts of the individual vehicles and soldiers in that army as well. The game also includes a comprehensive in-game tutorial/encyclopedia, so even players new to the genre can jump right in.As of the time of this review's writing, I haven't gotten enough experience with the tactical combat to offer much insight, but I can definitively say it feels like combat is much more dynamic and free than with most other games in the genre. I'll update this review if there's anything negative to add, but my experience so far has been quite good.If you're new to this kind of game, Home Wars has you covered with what may well be the best tutorial system I've seen in a game this deep. While most strategy games have a clunky stop-and-go feel to the learning process, Home Wars manages to throw you right into the action without leaving you feeling overwhelmed. Any help or info you might need is easy to find, and the structure of the actual gameplay lets you keep the game moving at your pace. Not only is this great for new players, but it also lets veterans jump right in without forcing them through an awful tutorial mission like nearly every other game in the genre does.Basically it's a fun action game with an impressive amount of depth and complexity. It's incredibly welcoming to beginners while also being quite capable of challenging veterans. I haven't gotten a ton of time with it yet, but from what I've seen so far there's a lot to love."

Amazing developers, delivering nearly daily updates couldn't ask for more!A very enjoyable game, cannot wait to see where this game goes.Pros:tons of bugs to kill, in depth strategy but simple enough to grasp quickly, tons of units to play around with and try, plenty of fun to be had already, plenty of bugs as to be expected but nothing game breaking that i've found yet.Cons:no real ending to the campaign yet (you conquer all the flags and you win, no fun ending battle), only one real starting strategy (playability is built on diversity)Recommendations for QOL:tracer rounds would add a ton of visual dramatics and would be a huge improvement, saved or preset formations not a fan of clicking 100+ times for each battle, add a medic/mechanic troop for repairing using supply trucks seems overpowered."

Even if I die 9 times out of 10, I still have fun.Bad graphics but amazing gameplay!ADDED:The devs here have made me put faith back into indie games. This is truely an original idea, with an extremely fun and addictive atmosphere. Not to mention the openess of the staff and their unflailing attention to the buyers of the game.Updates are constant, feedback is accepted and even asked for. These guys must be God gamers or have been hurt themselves with the unfairness of early access and other titles.Bravo, if 99% of early access games and indie developers followed your lead, Steam would be a trillion dollar market on its own in no time."

The antiaircraft troops target the same flyer and does not spread out.this game has NO TUTORIAL only a ingame wiki that doesnt explain everything.

Sappers and supply trucks are usually what I get at first.Sappers work great with barbed fences, glue , sandbags and the barbed cover for air, being able to place mines, tank traps, and other things like that to slow the enemy down is amazing, especially in the first few days when your only unit is a light Infintry.it's a good idea to place everything you want down by your sapper while the game is paused ""P"" is the hotkey, then when you have your setup ready, unpause and direct your sapper near unbuilt items, they will automaticaly build anything they come close to. Most modes give you only 20 seconds to build, some will give you 90, pausing the game first after you've deployed your units will give you time to plan your setup.Arguably, the game is not playable at 100% normal life and damage done by the enemy bugs. They are too numerous and you start with so little, that even an army of 60+ infinitry can not beat back the starting bugs when set to normal. I prefer to set mine at 75% which seems like a more normal setting, bugs drop a little easier, do a little less damage, but still pose a threat.Right now my biggest issue with this game, is how convuluted and uninformative the manuals are, they don't feel like they give a very clear idea of what your supposed to be doing, some are heavily worded, over explain, and complicate a part of the game, and others are short and give little to no information on what things do, and when and how you should use them.Taking control of a unit is rather pointless, the unit itself is going to be 100x more accurate then you ever will be, so best to let it do it's own shooting. The sheer number of units you have to face, with so very little of your own with very little reward for success makes progression near impossible, constantly needing to reinforce your army with more units and contruction costs put you at a huge disadvantage in comparison to the bugs.There is I am sure a formula to winning... but I feel like that formula has to be extremely precise and trying to change it at all, means you lose. Part of what makes games fun is the ability to be diverse in your game play, and something about this game, as fun of an idea and enjoyable as it can be... feels like it has a very specific formula, like the designer of the game saying ""You have to play the way I want you to play, or you can't play at all"" and that to me is a huge turn off.I think people could enjoy this game more, but it feels like it's missing quite a lot, and in its current state, I can't recommend the game."

,Not Recommended,645790,33463716,Posted: 11 July,all,DJ Walrino,The game is pretty enjoyable when you learn how to play... But I dont recommend this game because of all the flaws like its impossible to fly anything because the controlls are super janky.. It gives you extra missions on your flags that you can even complete when you first started because you dont have the stuff unlocked to beat the missions...So while all the aircraft are super hard to control and there are missions that you can not complete in the early stages of the game I dont think its worth $10.. But if it gets fixed I will fix the review.
,Not Recommended,645790,32962258,Posted: 28 June,all,Smurfosaurus-Rekt,"Great concept game that lets itself down with the repetitive gameplay, terrible controls and sheer boredom of the battles.Review broken down into 1.Pros 2.Cons 3.Summary 4.Price to payPros:- Really cool idea, its exciting to start up for the first time as its something I've never had before and I have no expections or idea of what kind of game this'll be- Fairly good base managment system- Lots of bug types, clearly a lot of thought has gone into what kind of bugs to throw against the player, their pretty well paced out and the big bugs make you a little intimidated due to the sheer size of them- Interesting first person mode, works with the infantry but very lacking in other departments- First person mode, they added a tiny detail which I LOVE, its weapon recoil on the riflemen... its such a tiny thing and so trivial considering they're toy soldiers ffs.. but its nice that they thought about it- Lots of friendly unit types tooCons:- Battles have 0 tactical element to them, its just ""get sappers, place down as many defences as you can before the enemy gets there"" then when it says they're too close you finally begin organising the actualy fighting troops- Graphics, I know you just read that and went ""hey! but this game isn't trying to have amazing graphics but instead have good gameplay!"" ... Point still stands. Whilst I even appreciate the art style would be minimalist, this is an impressivlyold engine.- Controls... where to start on this one..., they've added control groups, which is good. The camera control is so terrible that you'll often find yourself picking a high point on the map and just managing everything from afar as that way you don't have to move the camera. You can't double tap a control group to find out where they are either (essentially where the camera jumps to the group) so it makes the controls for the camera even more relevent.- Missions. Every single mission will be either ""Defend X"" or ""Defend X... then take Y once the enemy is dead"" making the gameplay boring and incredibly repetitive. There are special missions which are a random ""event"", so to speak, they are nearly always ""Defend X... BUT ONLY WITH AIRCRAFT!"" ... ¬_¬- The gameplay is entirely orrientated so that you HAVE to defend.. You = ranged, enemy = melee ... it comes down to ""shoot them before they get to eat you"", which only reinforces the turtle style gameplay. I know I mentioned it in the point before, but saying it again as its not something that can be fixed with a patch, but its a broken core game mechanic- The UI is abysmal.. Theres no 1 bad feature... its all garbage, and thats not me being cruel. Its genuinely infuriating to use.- Stats are almost irrelevent as the UI is so bad its impossible to understand whats going on, and 99/100 they wont matter anyway.. all comes down to how much resources you have to builds troops- NO TUTORIAL!!! its 2017 and instead of a tutorial they give you an encyclopedia on every single possible outcome. In which each topic is about the same length of this review, and about as interesting as well (boring)Summary:This game feels like an Early Access game, the devs are doing work to help out the games dire dilemas, but it should not be advertised as a finished product. Real shame I have to downvote this as the idea sounds really cool and what made me play the game, but its beyond recovery as most of the underwhelming features are core game mechanics which would require completely new codingPrice I'd Pay: If you still want to give a try (resist the urge, go have a cup of tea or watch paint dry instead) then don't pay any more than £2 for it"

The bug to soldier ratio is complete crap (1 soldier = approx 20 bugs) and the ""difficulty"" system barely works. If the game had a bit more to it, I'd rate better, but it feels so broken at the moment.

Each update brings new tweaks and more options and I've actually been able to play the way I want now. I still feel the units are a little underpowered compared to what you are fighting but at least I can fix it and have been able to unlock more units lately. One thing I would change would be the Ammo system, it feels a little too random and micromanaging for an RTS. I think maybe making it crates of ammo and giving us the ability to make ammo factory structures that cost a certain amount of plastic a turn while giving us a crate or two of each ammo type would help flesh it out a little.

76561198072988356,Recommended,645790,33851561,Posted: 28 July,all,Catnapper,"There's nothing like finding out that the bugs have such air superiority that they're blocking your artillery by using their air units as ablative shielding. Or like finding out that each bug units is 10-20 bugs, but each of your units is one guy. Or that you forgot to resupply ammo and all your ground troops are praying your defenses hold. But what is truly unique about this game is watching what you hate in life die en masse in a hail of cluster bombs and machine-gun fire.It's very rough around the edges, but it has the potential to be one of the best RTS games in recent history due to excellent balance on your side (very few troops actually become redundant because the tech tree has surprisingly few straight upgrades, and all units have a place in a maximally succesful strategy), excellent balance of enemies (they not only get stronger as the game goes on, but have pre-made battlegroups that move as far as they want per turn but can't defend territory to keep you on your toes), and even balance between the two factions (you have range and a much, much bigger variety of units, but they have tougher units and never don't have severe numerical superiority to make up for the fact that they all run/jump/fly directly at you and melee).So far my only real problem is that the bug's campaign strategies can be screwy. They have a habit of failing to understand the map, resulting in paths straight to their base having no defences, or rooms left unclaimed, and their general strategy is a terrible middle ground between defence and attack that leaves them with success in neither. If you survive the first week and a half in a campaign, you will almost certainly win. The bugs never mount strong offences and since they are not infinite, only very numerous, their defenders end up in battles of attrition when you push.The way you take over rooms is you defend a F.O.B, then win a game of territories, then destroy the hole they're coming from. In theory this is great, with you establishing a foothold and pushing them out as they fight every step of the way, but in practice the first phase wipes out the defenders since their attention is split but not so much that they don't still bunch up, the second phase is rough since the bug's numbers let them extend their forces much easier than you, and the third phase would be exciting if the bugs ever made a good push where they can wait out the time limit, but they don't so you kill the attackers and then blow up the hole at your leisure.Finally, I actually like having to purchase your troop's ammo. It really makes you invested in the battle even though you can always afford enough bullets since you personally oversaw each round getting there, and during times of economic stress it makes you ask whether you'll get more value from another tank or a nice pile of AIM's since you can only afford one this turn.8/10, unbalanced and extremely rough but very fun regardless."
