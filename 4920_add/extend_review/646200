This game is an actual full game and not a crappy escape the room or wave shooter that plages the VR landscape! To all the  devs out there, follow this games example! The reviews speak for themselves 👍 Definitely a much needed title to add to the library!! I hope more major/minor devs follow this example and take full games and port them to VR with intuitive controls and a VR friendly interface just as this game has! Devs take the hint! Stop the waves and escape the room BS titles! You're wasting your time, we want real games!!"
76561198058602281,Recommended,646200,35216679,Posted: 25 September,all,Controversy,"I really like this game and I have barely scratched the surface.I was told that aiming with the guns was bad, so I almost didn't buy it.  Its true the aiming is bad, because your character is an ULTRA NOOB.  Get a few levels, upgrade your weapons and get some accuracy implants, and the aiming is good.  Its bad at first intentionally :D.9/10 so far I will update my opinion once I've played it longer.ALSO, I giant thank you for allowing us to just move via the touch pad.  I don't mine teleport as an option, as sometimes it is fun to use in combat, but there are way too many games that wont let you move forward with the touchpad... bravo it works well in this game."
,Recommended,646200,32281911,Posted: 8 June,all,@Dicky Spanish,"A must buy for fans of Doom 3bfg in fact a must buy for those who want an FPS with a story, great graphics (VR wise), plenty of guns, touchpad movement, missions and a proper game in VR.So game runs great on a 1080gtx on high settings with bloom on low, looks great in VR. There are  plenty of  variety  of enemies and weapons with a upgrade RPG type inventory system. The missions vary and there are puzzles to work out to gst some missions finished.The NPCs are well done and I spend quite a while having firefights with soldiers so it's not all zombies you are against. Obviously the soldiers are  smarter and it  can be quite a battle.So after playing for a little while have to say it's been  one of the best experiences I have had so far in VR. It's just so much fun and I would say a must buy for all those who want FPS in VR.Nice work just what I have been waiting for.Edit: 10-6-17Now 4 hours in and it just get's better, for me it's a top 5 VR game and the most addictive one I have come across yet. If you're on the fence about this game, don't be it's well worth the price."

I was really sceptical on this one because it looks kind of generic but the level of motion control interaction in the game really takes this to the next level. I really wish more games would include options like dead effect 2 because one of my favorite things to do in vr is reload. They make it an option to manually reload or if you have a harder time with FPS, or just dont like the tedium you can turn on automatic reloading. It also allows you to slide and teleport without going into settings. It's the only time I've used the two styles of locomotion side by side and it felt so natural. This game probably isn't for everybody, but it has some great RPG elements and the VR implementation is amazing!"
,Recommended,646200,32304878,Posted: 9 June,all,SweViver,"Truly an impressive Action RPG Survival First Person Shooter, personally I think its even better than Doom 3 BFG Edition in VR thanks to the lovely graphics, the RPG elements and the huge variety of weapons - and of course the story line. I made a first gameplay video of the first 30 minutes into the game, that hopefully can help you make up your own mind:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYwm6FAAmfMGraphics and the environments are just amazing, detailed and the built-in SuperSampling (in game options) really makes the game sharp in VR as well. There are loads of graphics options/settings you can customize for your PC and your needs, and you can really crank it up to max. I could play it without any problems on Extreme quality on my GTX 1080 Ti, but while recording (the above video) some gameplay I had to lower some of the settings due to my capture software being quite demanding (OBS).The locomotion in the game is great, you can have both free movement with touchpad on your left Vive controller, and at the same time you can teleport with your right Vive controller touchpad - just perfect when you prefer free locomotion- but need to teleport away fast as possible in the middle of the intense action!Sound effects are stunning as well as the music in the background, really top notch and it gives me a triple AAA-feeling.The story mode is quite immersive and interesting, and fully narrative throughout every chapter. Good voice acting and the characters are very detailed graphic-wise.I really look forward to see multiplayer getting added into this VR release, and Im so happy that another great game has got native VR support. This game is a blast, and if you enjoyed Doom 3 BFG in VR, you will deinitely love Dead Effect 2 VR even more!Note: I bought the game by myself on june 9, right after watching the trailer and the screenshots, as it looked so promising. So I did not get it for free if you wonder. My feedback above is based on my personal first experience playing Dead Effect 2 VR on HTC Vive.CheersSweViver"
76561198008930348,Recommended,646200,34297517,Posted: 16 August,all,King Hrothgar,"Though it has a few minor issues, this is one of the best VR games I've played so far. It's a genuinely full length game, not a 2 hour tech demo or garbage indie game like so many others. The story is your standard FPS storyline, nothing terribly exciting there but it works. It is not a zombie shooter despite what the screenshots may suggest, it's a straight sci-fi shooter that just happens to contain some genetically engineered zombies in addition to more normal enemies.There are plenty of options for controls and all seem to work well. It has true free move, free move with fixed rotation, teleporting and some other optoins I didn't try. The gun/sword/bow play work well and are intuitive but grenades are a bit off I find with the Oculus touch controllers. Specifically, it's hard to actually throw one instead of simply dropping it at your feet. Fortunately the player is a super soldier so this isn't typically fatal.Overall, I think this is a must have VR shooter. It is a true full length game, plays well and looks good. There aren't too many options in VR that meet all three criteria. Oh, and it is definately not a wave shooter or a cover based shooter like some of the other reviews claim.Edit: I should point out the game is not complete. It halts at a decision made in chapter 2 and says to wait for an update. Doesn't change my thoughts on the game, just have to wait for them to finish the main story."
76561197983601689,Recommended,646200,33777368,Posted: 24 July,all,wraith,"I can't recommend this game highly enough. I have a rift CV1. One of the few VR games I've tried that I would probably enjoy almost as much even if it wasn't in VR (ie its a good GAME, not just 'experience'). The addition (in a recent patch) of full locomotion is key. I wouldn't be raving about this game nearly as much with teleport-only movement.This game reminds me of a cross between Doom 3 and classic Doom combined with a little Deus-Ex style augmentation and abilities. The duel-grip-aim assault rfles are awesome and it really makes you feel like you're in the action. Drawing and releasing the bow+arrows is slick and satisfying (though sadly there's no gravity drop as far as I can tell). Killing zombies and various other monsters is gruesome and satisfying as well. If you don't want a bloody game, don't get this one! On the other hand if you (like me) enjoy more mature games you'll definitely appreciate all the gory details.There's a lot of gameplay packed in this as well, unlike most VR games. I'm only a few missions into the campaign, but in addition to the story mode, there are wave modes, 'generic missions', and some other options. Theres plenty of loot upgrades and such that is pretty nice, IMO. The game also has coop and PvP modes in multiplayer.TLDR; Its a gory, action filled bargain at $20"
76561198064106555,Recommended,646200,32302993,Posted: 9 June,all,mrorange,"Excellent VR FPS in the style of Doom 3 BFG with story elements. It has a lot of content: missions, weapons, perks, skills, etc. So you really get something for your money.Locomotion with moving on the trackpad works fine too. Of course you can chose to teleport if you get motion sick.Game has very good graphics since it is a ""port"" from the normal Dead Effect 2 which already looks pretty nice. So brace yourself for some very hardware hungry graphics. I hope developers can still do something when it comes to performance since I do not get constant, stable framerates with even shadows off and other options on medium.Weapon handling overall is good. Might get improved a bit to give you more the feeling that you just shoot an assault rifle. I think about having a better force feedback of the controller. Also I would prefer that the weapon even reloads when the magazine is still not fully empty. I know it is not realistic, but I am so used to this since my FPS young ages. ;DNothing more to say. This game came as a big surprise. I own the normal version, but did actually not play it a lot. And since developers give you a 75% if you are owner of the normal version I only paid 4,5 EUR for this VR game. Much respect for this. This is really cheap, especially in comparison to so many other games.I would say for now after testing it for 1 hour that this game is within the top 15 VR games and absolut must-have for Vive or Oculus owners. Finally a real VR game!!! We deserved it!Thank you developers. Good job. Let's iron it out and give us multiplayer and this game will become one of the best VR games of this generation."

It's a cool length for the price, and probably slightly better than Arizona Sunshine (a lot of it is becuase its 3 players).  They should bring the first dead effect to VR also!

,Not Recommended,646200,34271866,Posted: 16 August,all,Yeti,"I personally don't get the praise Dead Effect 2 VR recieves. Is it horrible? No. Is it enjoyable? Maybe. Do I recommend it? Depends on your priorities and preferences but, short answer, No. It feels like what it is: A VR port of a Mobile port. Dead Effect 2 originally released for iOS/Android and then later was ported to Steam with various issues due to a somewhat shoddy port. Many reviews will back that bit up. I'm going to spend most of this review going over negatives because I believe they overpower the positives but I'll summarize the overall picture, positives included, in the last two paragraphs. I am, however, the minority in reviewers to think the way I do so I encourage you read other reviews, watch gameplay and weigh your priorities and other opinions. The game did recieve an update and I mentioned it at the bottom of the review.I was persuaded by the near overwhelming positive reviews despite having bad experiences with the original PC port hoping that the developers really polished the experience for VR. When I first loaded in it was promising, visually it looks pretty good in some areas though there is noticeable aliasing issues. As soon as I actually got into the game, though, I was instantly disappointed.I can't stand the gunplay. Recoil is overkill and unpolished, making shooting in general difficult. Sometimes your gun is even flying out of view. Not only that but the weapon sights are either near-impossible to see through and almost entirely useless either due to said recoil, the inaccuracy that seems to plague every weapon and poor alignment. Using two hands for rifles, which is required otherwise the weapon modelliterallybounces off the walls during a seizure fit, is buggy and awkward. After my disappointment with the firearm mechanics I tried out melee which turned out to be an even worse experience. The melee weapons I tried were underpowered, you'd end up just flailing your arm as fast as possible often taking upwards to 6-10 ""swings"" to kill one basic zombie though this may have been due to underpowered weapons. There's no visual feedback, either, which results in a pretty unsatisfying experience. Some enemies take a ridiculous amount of damange as well. Incredibly bullet sponge-y enemies don't feel satisfying to fight in VR, especially when combat and feedback as a whole is underwhelming. This is an RPG game, however, so some of the issues mentioned may be mitigated through progression though that doesn't fix poor mechanics or design.The UI isn't well designed for VR and is a bit of a pain to navigate and definitely not the best to look at. There's some tracking issues and pretty much all VR interaction and implimentation feels unpolished. The coop that I played was a bit laggy and the body tracking for the other player was glitchy. It is Early Access, though, so I'd love to see my review become null by release.-----------------------------------------------Conclusion/Tl;drSomething to actively keep in mind while considering this game is it is a mobile port. It runs like one, it feels like one, and it looks like one. Nearly everything I've said in this review may be subjective except the previous two statements. The animations aren't great, the combat is unpolished, it's buggy, UI could use work and is not well optimized for VR, tracking is a bit off and delayed, there are performance issues and VR just feels like an afterthought thrown in without proper optimization or utilization. The screenshots on the store page are not accurate to the game and the video does a good job of hiding the lack of polish with clever editing. The textures, lighting, effects, and models look nice and there's a lot of content, progression, cool abilities and coop but content and pretty effects alone doesn't make a good game. I personally think you should skip this game entirely but I'm clearly missing something since most people have had positive experiences.Now, despite everything negative I've said, it's clear that this game can be enjoyable and maybe even worth the price based on overall user feedback. It's $20, which as VR games go, isn't too bad and there's a lot to do and experience in the game including a campaign, loot, upgrades/progression, coop and PvP, though there wasn't anyone online when I played. Obviously it's up to you whether or not you want to drop $20 on it. If nothing else you'll be able to tell easily within the first two hours whether or not you'll want to keep it. Ihighlyrecommend at least watching unedited gameplay videos on YouTube if you have any interest at all in this game, though, as the media on the store page is, whether intentional or not, misleading.-----------------------------------------------Edit:Dead Effect 2 VR officially entered Beta which came with a fairly sizeable update that addressed some of the issues mentioned in this review as well as other changes. The patch notes will be posted below. The most notable fixes relevant to the review regard weapon recoil and general weapon usability. I can't personally review these changes as I refunded the game before the update released. I can say, though, that I can tell they aren't enough to change this review to Recommended but it is a good step towards it.http://steamcommunity.com/games/646200/announcements/detail/1435941268366262706"

,Recommended,646200,34216394,Posted: 13 August,all,Dufftruck,"Exactly what a VR game should be. Tons of content and tons of replayability. Silly but immersive interactions in the environment. Lots of fun things to blast zombies with! It completely owns being a dead space clone, and the atrocious yet goofy voice acting and dialogue had me laughing out loud at some points. There's also co-op, which is fun, and PvP, which I'm excited to try.(P.S: Due to the breaky nature of the Vive thumbpads right side, I recommend setting the movement to ""touch to walk, push to sprint"" to avoid losing the ability to strafe right)"
,Recommended,646200,32279315,Posted: 8 June,all,johngannon,"Played through the first 3 levels so far.  I had a lot of questions going into this purchase but figured why not.  This is a shooter first and foremost, it's dripping with that early '00 shooter look.  Industrial space ship hallways as the backdrop fighting all-too-familiar baddies.  After the introduction you end up with a hub world you continually come back to, taking individual missions from the (not entirely too bad) fully voice acted characters.  The game is all placed in one giant ship but you have load screens that send you the next mission.  The few missions I've done have had me searcing and rescuing team members that end up back at your hub giving you additional options.That brings me to the RPG elements.  Not much on the store page about them, nor in the video there.  You have an upgrade path for your character, selecting individual traits and choosing to dump additional points into them.  Think a defensive barrier you can upgrade either it's health or longevity.  You also have three main characters to choose from: a soldier, a ninja and a shotgun wielding lady.  Each looked to have their own abilities, the ninja had two swords which could be fun.There is also loot, new guns and armor drop from enemies and it seems you have multiple difficulty levels that change the rewards for the missions you do.  I couldn't really tell how deep the upgrade paths for the weapons are but overall it seemed like more than most VR games.  I could be crazy but it almost seems like you are supposed to play this like a Diablo and upgrade your character even after the main game is complete, taking harder and harder runs and getting bigger and badder loot.  Time will tell.The graphics are ok.  Better than Doom3 but not by a great deal more.  Lots of redundant looking rooms and props.  The gun play is actually quite good.  I was surprised by how much ""VR"" they packed into the game.  You hack computers by dragging switches around, you turn valves... they could have cheaped out and just had a single button interaction for things but it really uses the motion controls to a great degree.  Was pretty impressed by that.Overall, this is one of those games you watch the video and go ""so what"".  Looks like a mobile shooter.  And you know what?  If this was just on my TV I'd probably bore of it fairly quickly to be honest.  But in VR, with the things they've done to tailor the experience to the platform, it just sings.  It's a really, really fun game and I can't wait to get back into it now!"

,Recommended,646200,34687930,Posted: 2 September,all,UberJuice,"One of the best games for VR as it is now, hands down.It literally has everything you want from a shooter RPG with only few minor downsides.Good:- Graphics- Satisfying feedback from killing enemies- TONS of weapons, armors, skills and upgrades- Impressive amount of hours of gameplay (which is super rare for VR this days)- Multiplayer- Co-op- Side Missions- Good amount of maps- Weapon mechanics that don't suck and are very fun- A blonde girl with hard nipples at your base- Locomotion and teleportation that were done the way they should be (no crazy jumping all over the place, hate it)- Many usefull skills and abilities- It can't get boring experimenting with weapons, as there are SO MANY THAT IS CRAZY- Grind is actually fun- Many easter eggs all over the place, even Star Wars reference- One of a few games where you can shoot while running and dodging the projectiles and zeds. I wish there would be more space for that and more reasons for that, so far you do that only when you go Rambo. I'd be great if it could be more dynamic like Doom.- Pump action shotgun that you have to actually pump (yay!)What's bad (but not bad-bad, just minor bad)- While the amount of enemies is good, there is only very few that spice things up considerably. I wish there were more kinds of enemies, because with an exception of mini bosses and imps the tactics of taking down hordes are too straight forward and you can stay in one place the whole time and if you have a lot of ammo, you don't even need to move out. It would be amazing if there could be more types of enemies like imps, that make you move around the map, without being big and tanky. Maybe letting imps to mix with zombies would help a lot, so you wouldn't have to fight only zeds/imps as it's not very challenging.- Maps are made of corridors. Yes, there are few maps where you have a lot of space to shoot, but they are still pretty streamlined with almost no arenas. Zombies are moving in steams and sometimes it feels like a TD, I would love to see more open spaces like in latest Doom, where you can maneuver instead of just streamlining zombies into tunnels and shooting them in waves.- Inviroments are quite repetetive, but for an indie game they are actually amazingly made. Much better than many AAA titles in similiar settings - even some locations are recognizable, but I'd be cool to see more. Like white clean labs, living quarters, those sort of things to spice the things up.Not a bad thing, just something that'd be great to see in game:- More weapons like pump shotgun and bow, where you have to take some extra action to use it, without just pointing and shooting (it's very immersive). Something like a sniper rifle without a scope, crossbow, slingshot. Pump action mechanics are very exciting and executed amazingly, as well as the bow, just wish there would be more variety, some alien weapons could be cool too- A shield. Shield would be insane (main weapon could be a trade off).- Customizable weapons. Something like changing the scope would be great, maybe laser sight modules and such.- You only fight zombies and soldiers. It will last for quite some time, but I wish for the future there could be more robots and maybe some aliens/demons. That'd be amazing."

The gunplay requires aiming down sights and doesn't give you any laser sights or downrange indicators of any kind, which makes the combat much more tense and less arcadey despite the fact that you're painting this space station with more blood than the elevator from the Shining.Then there's the melee. <3 <3 <3 <3 <3  The fire axe and katanas are especially satisfying, as are the shuriken once you get a little practice aiming your throws.Right stick smooth turning on oculus touch was an option from the start and I use this game as my go-to for showing others what an ideal locomotion system looks like.co op is great, progression system is great, powers are a little meh (i don't know anyone who doesn't just spam bullet time / damage boost), but that may change when we get access to the lvl 20si do have some odd screen glitching from time to time in this game that I have not seen in any others but it usually only lasts until the end of the level; i have seen some posts that say this may be related to supersampling and I plan to test settings further to see if i can eliminate that issue entirely.also despite being unfinished it still feels way more replayable and longer than arizona sunshine, and is $10 cheaper.get it."

Controls are great. I anticipate wanting to play it through again on higher difficulty and going for 100%, should come in around 16 hours. (edit: after 7.7 hours I got to the end of the (still incomplete as of 8/29/17) story mode, didn't do side missions yet).Kudos to the devs for getting the dot on the holosight of the rifle to correctly indicate point of impact.

If you aren't tired of VR shooters, worth $20.To the developers, I would really focus on polishing up what you have. Small but persistent details that could improve the experience quite a bit, like heavier gun sfx, the elbows being half a foot too wide, animating a little more life into hallways, have the gun tilt with you when you lean holding a long gun with two hands,that lifeless turret sequence, and work out just how much the enemy soldiers need to yell about what they're doing while fighting you. Reading your aspirations for this game with fallout 4 and DOOM VFR on the horizon, you're getting there, but doubling down on polish would do quite a bit to improve on this hopeful jump forward in VR fps games available."

Reminds me of the Shadow Warrior 2 progression mechanics.  Nice to have a VR game with that much replay value.Update: Yikes, got to a mission with seemingly inifinte enemies and gas that keeps sapping my health.  I'm not a big fan of these sort of levels so I probably will not play the game anymore.  I'm leaving the thumbs up review because I think this is just my personal preference, not liking stressful levels, and I still think the devs are doing a good job with the VR support.Update 2: Decided to try it again, started new files as the other two characters.  Melee weapons are fun and it turned out anyone can use them, I just had not found them yet or noticed them in the store.  Those should make infinite zombie levels easier.Update 3: Yep, went back to that level with dual katanas, it was still hard but at least I could not run out of ammo and could more easily kill enemies while surrounded.

It's nothing special, but I find the VR verison oddly compelling. Gameplay has a Arizona Sunshine vibe, and I feel the the VR controls work pretty well. This is essential a VR port of the orginal, so some features like the surival mode are a bit too hard to play with VR controls.  Overall, I'm digging the game. I'll probably play through to the end and maybe try the other characters for additional playthroughs. It's not the killer app VR needs, but it's simple space zombie blasting goodness.

I either have to have a seriously awesome experience with a game, or a simply terrible one with something I spent money on. This one qualifies as the first; really, the first VR experience that made me play until the batteries died in my controllers. If you have a VIVE, buy this game.I went ahead and bought the game due to some odd combination of hype on reddit, good reviews on steam, and low hardware requirements. I have a gtx 770 gpu, so that last bit was kind of important. :PIt's been a really fun 5 or so hours, and I imagine the rest of the game is going to be fun, too. The characters are all voiced, there's a variety of enemies to figtht, lots of different weapons, and an actual story you're going to be participating in. This is one of the most ""complete game"" experience I've had with my VIVE since I bought the thing.Certain edges feel kinda rough. Voice acting feels off at times. Sometimes dialogue happens over combat (can't really hear much of the conversation when you're shooting a horde of zombies). Often, when reaching for an object on the ground, you can accidentally pull a weapon instead of picking up the item. It's one of those things you can get used to, though."

Great game play mechanics  and the movement option is great too in that you can either use one controller to teleport or one to actually move properly. The latter I can't do as it makes me ill so awesome to have the choice there.

,Recommended,646200,34552214,Posted: 28 August,all,fenrif,"I bought this game in the sale for 12 quid. I was initially a bit hesitant because I'd heard it was a phone port and those are gauranteed garbage. I figured a phone port to VR would be double garbage. And while this game does have a lot of finnicky little problems, overall I'm pleasantly surprised.It's a hub-based loot shooter. So after each mission you'll be heading back to your base to spend money, level up and get new gear. This means it has a decent sense of progression for a VR game, which is traditionally the mediums weakest part so far. The core gameplay loop is fun, and multiplayer is a blast. The single player is extremely linear, but there are plenty of side missions. They're all the same maps as the missions, but frantic enough to be fun anyway.What really lets the game down is the controls. Way too fiddly. I initially turned all the realism settings to max (full manual reloading for example) but after an hour had to dial them back down because the controls just aren't fluid enough to support this.All my deaths so far have come from the game not recognising what I'm trying to do (reload and it equips another weapon, trying to throw a nade and picking up ammo, etc) Even the movement is a slight bit more fiddly than it needs to be owing to the press to move as opposide to touch move controls...Despite this I still think it's a decent game, especially on sale prices. There's just so much content there, and while the controls are a big detractor you can get used to them and dial the realism down. I can see it being a big sticking point for some people, but everything else is just so much fun I feel like it covers its short comings."

The game is a mix of zombies & soliders that are on a space ship. Experiments broke out yada yada you get the jist of it.You the player get to pick three different type of characters. A heavey gunner, assault or light. Each character has their own names and specific start weapons. You later on can use any type of weapon that is in the game for your character as long your the right level.Missions- there 15 story mission & 5 Generic missions. You can gain weapons, money, gear & power ups during each mission. You have side quests you gain more money & better rewards.Other Missions - Biohazard mode, survival mode, lone wolf missions & Infestations offer more play time after you beat the story. The developer has also fixed the online requirement issue so now those who play solo can stay solo.Items- you can get items as rewards or buy them. You can buy medkits, ammo pack ect ect. I find it difficult in mid-game to go to inventroy during game to use these items. Hotkeys would have been nice.Equip & Unequip- Weapons you get you can equip them to specific slots on your character. Primary weapons ( assault, shot guns, bows ect ect) are on your back. Secondarys (pistols, mini shotguns melee) are on your left or right sides. Chest is smaller melee weapons. There is a small issue, you can't unequp an item unless you replace it by another item or sell it.Hacking- the hacking is very cool & fun to do but it sometimes don't work due to a bug.Respawning- you can respawn if you die but doing so requires credits (money). You will pick up money during that mission, so its not hurrting your saved money unless you didn't pick up the full amount.Griping- You can double grip your assault rifles but when using a power ability that is connected to the grip button will cause the player to let go of the gun.Weapon Upgrading- you can upgrade every weapon you aquire. You can upgrade the damage, recoil, clip & codex. All this requires money you obtain during the missions.Weapons- there are good weapons in the game but after a while its the same weapons just different colors and different stats.Moving- you have different options to movie in the. Teleport, free movment, free movment/teleport. It all depends on the players comfort. However I will get 25% stuck of the time during missions on walls or small ledges on the floor.Reloading- you also have different reloading options as well. You have an ammo belt & you can chose to put the weapon on the belt to auto-reload or grab the ammo from the belt. I would recommand the auto-reload due to manual reloading is a pain since you have to grab the ammo that is 1inch from the small melee.Zombies- there are different verity of zombies. Some easy & some hard to kill. Its seems headshots are still almost 1 hit kill unless a blood spiter, acid spitter & armor zombies. Although when killing a TNT, Hungry or Spacer zombie, they will still throw their ability at you even if you quickly kill them.Soliders are tough to kill but are fairly easy to eliminate. Soliders are more of a threat then the zombies.Trophies- the game does have trophies you can try to get. I think 165 of them, not to sure.For a $19.99 VR game you are getting more, its actually a steal at $19.99. The game does get a 8/10 from me.That's the Pony review."

Yes, if too many zombies are present re-projection may fail.- Good variety of enemies, from cannon fodder to boss characters.- A single player story that takes you through dark and gory environments.- Well developed game mechanics, e.g., flashlight toggle at helmet, different reload and movement options, interactive terminals.- Quick loading of levels.- Shigor. The nickname (I assume) of the developer that commnicates with the players.Cons:- There is so much to do with respect to character progression and stats that things can get a bit messy.- A tad too much blood, i.e., difficult to see the zombies when firing (confirmed that the devs are looking into this).- A female character model that reminds me of the 1980's (the woman who's helping the main character).- No firing range for trying out weapons in your inventory.In short, well done devs....well done indeed/ Stig"

Has kinks to work out with things like melee weapons not registering hits a few second after being drawn, pump shotguns rebelling and not wanting to pump, and primary weapons sometimes not drawing from the back no matter how many times you grip. Ammo boxes also never ever seem to work for me, I gave up on trying to get them, but there never seems to be an ammo shortage so it doesn't seem to matter too much.This is a real VR game instead of the usual ""my first unity demo"" or cash grab crap flooding the market right now and if you enjoy stuff like Serious Sam VR with elements of Borderlands OR if you happened to play the original Dead Effect and though that would be awesome in VR then you're going to love this."

The only thing that I might change is monster location when they attack, either move that distance back a little so you do not feel like you are holding your gun too high to shoot or include a nice melee weapon and add a little force to it to get those monsters back off of you. Overall, this is an excellent title and I am happy to support your work..."

It can be very scary, but does not come from jump scares, only overwhelming enemy advancement mixed with a creepy atmosphere.  Reminds me (as the name would suggest) of a mixture of Mass Effect guns/biotics with deadspace vibe.  This easily has more content than any other SP game available.  The pvp and coop will be in the game shortly with a ton more SP content. Highly recommend.   If I had to criticize anything, I would say the voice acting is a little cheesy, the weapon and NPC models have a strange scale to them, and the environment can feel repetitive.  Other than that it is a fantastic game with tons of weapons, upgrades, abilities, and occasionally terrifying/badass/action packed moments. 9/10 so far."

,Not Recommended,646200,32387725,Posted: 13 June,all,Groxic Tinch,"While I did want to like this game it was difficult, the pros really are good and it would be great but at the moment it is unplayable for me.The sword and bow mechanics were good, when they worked.The minigames for doors and such were interesting and fun, when it worked.Looks like a lot of different game mode and unlockables which would have been good to play.The reason I found it unplayable though is because interactions would just not work half the time, I thought it was just me but after a while of it constantly happening I realised it wasnt.Half the time no matter what I did I could not grab ammo from the floor, it was like it did not exist.Half the time I would go to put another mag into my rifle but I couldnt grab the ammo from my belt.Half the time I would pull an arrow back and release my trigger with the arrow not leaving my bow until I pressed the trigger again.MOST the time if I changed to my sword from my gun, I couldnt do any damage, the sword went through the zombies with no effect. I would have to change to the gun and then back for it to work.MOST the time when I went to press a button on the ""remove chips till value is 0"" system the button would not register and I would sit there poking it constantly until it actually registered.A few times my guy would start running off in the last direction I had pushed despite letting go off the trackpad.Now this could just be how the game runs on my computer considering I dont see much others bringing up the issues I had but it is just this game, not any other that do it.A slight annoyance was also that the rifle didnt feel any good to fire, unlike games like Onward and Raw Data where it is satisfying to shoot but this is probably just a preference.IMPORTANT NOTE!Even though I had these issues I would suggest trying this game, if it works for you and you can deal with the shooting system then thats good, but if you are unlucky like me then this game is just too frustrating to continue playing. I really am sorry devs for the negative review but it really was unplayable."

All 10 hours.So I started sitting down during dialogue and between fights, but that basically turned me into a midget.This is an extremely easy and quick fix... let me sit down in my comfy chair and give me A height offset in the game so that I appear as though I am standing. Boom. Done. 10 seconds of work for 10 times the comfort while playing.Please, to all VR developers, PLEASE treat VR as a forward facing seated experience. We have been gaming like this since DnD. Its uncomfortable to stand. I stand all day at work, I am tired, I want to relax and play a fun game before bed time... PLEASE take this into consideration.-The scenery is nice, but the models / texture / animations of your enemies and allies are appalling. Even at extreme settings they are laughably ugly. This is exacerbated by VR where you can see their hideousness in all three dimensions.-The dialogue... Dear god.I honestly felt embarrased playing a game with dialuge this bad. I wonder how stupid the voice actors felt having to enthusiastically read something that was written by a 5 year old.If I didnt live alone, I probably would not have played the game at all.-The guns feel very weak... The first assault rifle they give you is weaker than the first pistol. It doesnt make sense to even use it at all. You have to empty an entire magazine to kill a dog, or you could just use your wrist zapper thing on a 10 second cooldown and 1 shot it.I think that about wraps it up.On the plus side, I would say the developers did a good job with optimizing the game and dealing with motion sickness. I never fell below 90fps or had a stutter. Nor did I ever feel queasy."

You can clearly tell that this game was designed for the VIVE and the fact that they made this playable with a Oculus is just wow, I have no idea why they even bothered. The control is clunky and just flat awful. Let's talk about basic stuff 1st! ..Instead of just putting your hands in the game like pretty much most VR titles do, they tried to add your hands and ARMS into the game which is flat out WEIRD and funny looking while you're playing..I tried to make the game more in depth by messing around with some of the options so you can manually reload your gun and such, you should get an achivement if you can even pick of the mag off your vest to reload thanks to the cluncky control on the Oculus.. Now enough about the bad control optimization for the Oculus now on to the game itself, I didn't get to play much of it but, enough to give an opinion on the game itself, You know that other zombie game ARIZONA SUNSHINE? That game does a way better job of shooting zombies and such, This game is.. it's not fun.. Not to me at least..More of my time in the game was frustrating trying to get the control to work, everytime I reached for a mag on a crate or something it pushed me away from it like a force wall or something so I was forced to turn on the option to auto pick up items, Which I didn't want to do.. Not in a VR game anyways. The graphics are just Sh*t, but what more can I say? this game was originated on mobile devices, The fact they made this a normal PC game was funny.. The fact it's now a VR game is hilarious, now I am going to sum it up for you using this small list.1.) Poor Oculus Rift control optimization2.) Low Res graphics3.) Boring & repetitive gameplay4.) Funny Hands & arms animationsSorry guys, this is just my personal opinion and my experience playing the game, it's going to be a uninstall & refund for me."

The weapons are pretty satisfying to use, but the assault rifles could use a little bit of work with recoil and such. Also, I HATE that arrows are mounted on your chest and not your back, getting one and nocking it is a weird motion Still, its a pretty damn fun experience for the Vive/Rift, with a metric ton of comfort and locomotion options for people to get the feel they want in the game. Its 20 bucks and has a ton more content already than a lot of VR titles that are twice that, and I cannot wait to see how it gets better by the end of EA.Easy 7/10 right now as it stands, could be a solid 8 or 9 after some work has been done."

Full on high energy action in a pretty big game and thank goodness its not another wave shooter. It has 2 great movement options and has been ported over from an existing game. Although still in early access for VR, the game is a few years old and this means it feels finished, although there are a few VR gripes which I hope the developers take note of and improve during early access.One thing to note is the game which it was ported from received a luke warm reception. The reviews were just okay. But after being ported well to vr and it gives you a great example of why VR gaming is just so damn good. Would I play this game if it wasn't VR. Probably not... There are too many better options. But after playing just over an hour in VR last night, I genuinely cannot wait to get home from work today and get back inside that game. It is so much fun.I have been playing as the character with the bow and arrow. For me this is by far the best fun. It feels fantastic and its super satisfying when you clear an onslaught of machine gunning soldiers, or pop some zombies in the head.Pros- A big Game by VR standards- Locomotion or Teleport movement- A Huge arsenal of weapons all upgradeable- Its not a wave shooter- The bow and arrow is awesome- Great RPG style character upgrades- Decent graphics and its butter smooth on my i5 with 1080- It is raising the bar for VR games, although it is merely a par game in non VRCons- The enemies should respond better to where/how they are hit to improve immersion. This is especially true if you are using the sword.  Lets see some arms and legs coming off, or enemies moving in line with the direction of a hit.- Grabbing the weapons can feel a little awkward sometimes. Maybe a vibrate so you know you have successfully grasped it- The sight for the bow looks cool but doesn't work at all.- Yeah the voice acting is a bit wick which I know has irritated some.- I expect the environment to be quite samey as its all based on one ship as far as I can see.Over all if you like FPS games this is one of the best in VR. I think that Arizona sunshine is a better executed game, and Raw data makes you feel more badass, but this is like a mix up of the 2 but with more weapons and some RPG thrown into the mix. It's very very good and very much worth the asking price."

I stop and stare and look around in Doom3 and am amazed that I am ""IN"" doom3!! Not so much in this game.   Also,  Doom3 BFG gets pretty creepy in the hell levels and I literally had to stop playing it freaked me out so bad.   But this has a long way to go and a lot of work to be done before it can get that horror vibe going.  It just isn't there.  The zombies don't scare me.  It feels very ""arcade"" like with the animations and over the top blood splatter.  It barely had me pulled in but the low frames I was getting just had me wishing it ran smoother.   The ammo pickups and so on give the ""doom"" clone type of feel to it and the gun handling and character movement have an ""onward/Arizona sunshine"" feel to it (dpad to move - hold gun to your chest to reload - rifles need both controlers to control recoil (even though your hand switches back and forth to the controller avatar).I didn't play it long enough to notice if the RPG elements actually made difference.  Voice acting and so on is ok for an arcade type shooter.   It doesn't seem to take itself too seriously.It does have a solid world feel to it. However, it almost feels like the facade will fall off at any moment.  It does need a lot of polish yet as well as optimization.     I do see a bit of jittering when I look at my half arms at times.   Since this is an early access game I got what I was expecting however, could the devs add brightness / gamma control?   The game is too bright and colors too vivid in my headset.  For example, light behind smoke washes out the entire screen and the flashlight seems pointless.    Overall - it is a basic corridor shooter.   If it were a non VR game I would not continue playing it as I've played this type of game a hundred times over.    However, the VR elements make it a little more interesting to play.   I will update my review when the game is finished.   Right now - it is playable but glitchy, needs optimization and please stop comparing this to Doom3 BFG VR - not even close...."

Looking at videos it's sharing the same graphics. The regular Dead Effect 2 looks okayish to me, trying an impression of Doom 3. Personally I can't comment on how good a game that it. But in a VR it's awesome. Looks great and plays good. I woudn't say level design is mindblowing, it's looks spaceshipy, corridors connecting to rooms, it does the job.So far in my short playtime of completing 2 levels I've encountered 5 enemy types and I think their will be more as I progress.The locomotion spot on, you can use either teleport or smooth movement at the same time. Personally I use a bit of both to stave off motion sickness.I really like the RPG elements of Dead Effect 2, there's 3 starting characters with different loadouts and Deus Ex-ish augmentations to select and upgrade. Instant replay value, superb.The guns use the Arizona Sunshine style reloading, and overall gunplay is good but shot impacts lack the meatness of some VR games. For instance non-lethal shots on enemies don't stumble them. The pacing of enemy is also along the lines of Arizona Sunshine too, and suits me perfectly.What makes this worth picking up now is the price and quality of the content from day one of it's ea launch. The ea content and production values from the start are strong. This isn't one of those flawed ea titles that you give a break and see lots of comments stating it has good potential. Those games always fail to deliver in the end. Dead Effect VR is already delivering a tight game so updates will just add more goodness to if already proven baseline."

It's up there with like the watch menus in RecRoom in terms of usefulness.The gunplay mechanics, reloading, weapon orientation, close range firing and collision detection all still need some tweaking, but despite how bad that sounds it actually ""seems"" pretty apparent to me that BadFly is going to refine all those systems down to have truly good motion controller mechanics.

It had a good grasp of the fundamentals of a shooter game, while it didn't really do anything particularly innovative it didn't exactly do anything wrong.Well, the devs took the money from DE1 and made Dead Effect 2 for VR.This is a full length, mission based zombie game with a level up system, loot mechanics, gear ranked on a rarity scale, three player co-op, and a full campaign. Movement is either done with the trackpad or with teleporting with the other hand, and includes a stamina system for limiting teleporting and sprinting (Teleport counts as sprinting, basically.) You increase your abilities by upgrading weapons, adding modifications to weapons (One of the bullets in the magazine is superpowered, headshots explode, etc), adding mods to yourself (increased accuracy), different armor which boosts your HP, Stamina, and Energy, and can also have mods in the same manner as weapons, and by levelling up special abilities like slowing down time, locking enemies in place, mind control, etc.All in all for the price this is an excellent vr game. Campaign, variety of mission types (Biohazard, for instance, throws you in a map with a metric ton of zombies and one UGLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), and difficulties that scale up enemy level and loot drops."

( Reloading your guns should either be auto optioned or fixed to actually work when you need it to though)  With a bit of updates to fix things such as easier access to your arsenal, gripping your guns more accurately from their holsters, using abilities a bit easier and tightening up some of the 3d menu issues where icons and items overlap text here and there, this could be a very polished game. In my opinion, this game is worth the full price (19.99). This gives me hope for far more non VR games to get the VR treatment.

The characters are rather short which is odd for me, but I can't complain. The only gripe I have so far is with the machine-gun/automatic rifle you get early on. It can't aim for sh!t and it glitches all around me when I use it. It's horrible. I have to just switch back to the pistol which I know will eventually get me killed the deeper I go into the game.
