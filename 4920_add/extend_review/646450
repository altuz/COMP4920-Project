,Not Recommended,646450,33366813,Posted: 8 July,all,(♉ ) Tristetea,"Now. I don't expect too much from a game with a baseprice of 0.99e on steam, but this... I'm not sure if i should call it a videogame to begin with takes the cake on disappointing on a variety of ways. It's a total hack and incompetent mess or the developer just didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ and wanted to make a quick buck on the consumers.What the game lacks in gameplay has been replaced with a plethora of spamachievements, but don't you worry, just like the game itself, you don't have to do anything to earn these either, just stand around in the corner rolling your thumbs for a good 90 minutes and you're done. And that's really the only sellingpoint the game has going for it.I tried to play the game, but got laughable 4-7 FPS and that's just unforgivable for any game, it might've been a casual platformer but who knows, you... can't... play... this.Artstyle on it's own looks like it's just thrown together in the first five minutes or whatever came first to mind. Even if it would try to be looking retro that doesn't make the games aesthetics any better.Soundtrack would be somewhat alright, but what little i could play during my time, it sounds like it absolutely wouldn't fit the game and haven't given a single thought with the exception that you should get some tunes with your ""game"".That said and done. This is utter garbage, and i don't mean this as a personal insult to the developers, it's a brutal, honest fact. This should have never been released as a product which you have to pay for."
,Not Recommended,646450,32629800,Posted: 21 June,all,XJ9,"1st of all this is the same exact garbage that you can see here -http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/recommended/628490/- with a little difference: instead of 10k achievements you get 5k and you actually have to DO something to get them.The game consists of 25 levels, reaching some place in the middle of each level awards you with 200 achievements200x25=5000Some of the achievements are good looking, better than in the mentioned above game.Now before anything else said - IMPORTANT - HOW TO BEAT THIS GARBAGE GAME vhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=952165416You will face the most garbage controls, like ever - your character moves too fast to control it that way it won't die from spikes or saws, and the level design is non-existent, dev just spammed spikes and saws everywhere, so you spend some time dying. On top of that, your character jumps like it was hit by a baseball bat in a crotch - imagine that you got hit that way and imagine how high you will jump. Like 5 cm above the floor? This is exactly how high you jump. You can't jump over any obstacle basically unless you come 2 pixels close, and you will jump over landing 2 pixels after the obstacle.Now how to beat this game - the developer left exploit so he and his schoolmates could beat the game - if you press directional buttons and multiple jump buttons at the same time (For example A+W+SPACE) there is a chance that you will jump like 15 times higher, so you actually can jump over all the impassable places.And that's it.Upd: -https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=952480692Garbage level design + garbage controls + Unity + Put into the name of your piece of a horse pооp game *Rage* title pretending that this is an actual game + toss in some achievements so people would buy your half a dollar garbage = this trash.I wonder why there are no steam cards (ofc coming up in a minute.)Upvote this review so more people can beat the game."
,Not Recommended,646450,32613473,Posted: 21 June,all,Redbeard,"Adventure Rage is a very basic game, with the artwork looking rather dot matrix in style.It's like the poor man's version of a Lara Croft game, as it's about an archaeologist running and jumping to get past, or over, various traps. Or maybe it's more like a Mario game, as that's about the extent of the story depth.Probably the only feature of the game that stands out is the ridiculous number of achievements you get.* For the first level, I moved a few paces to the right, to the end of the level (insofar as you could call that a ""level""), and got 195 achievements for doing so. What the ???* For the second level, I moved a few paces to the right, and jumped over some holes, and my achievements then totalled 395.* Third level = jumped over some spikes = achievements now 595.* Fourth level = jumped over some circular saws = achievements went up to 795.I'm sure you get the general idea of where this is going.This is yet another game which has a massively disproportionate number of achievements.I don't know why Steam allows this flagrant devaluing of the Steam achievement system, as it clearly undermines the notion of Steam achievements meaning something (like being an indication of proper in-game accomplishments).It's not going to be the end of the world if players get a million achievements for doing nothing, but I don't think that it helps the Steam gaming community in terms of encouraging fair play and having balanced achievements.I must admit that the absurdity of this game's achievements system overshadowed the game, so as for the actual game itself:Well, as indicated beforehand, this game is basically a dot matrix style rehash of Mario and Tomb Raider, and a very poor one at that.If you want to get a ridiculous number of achievements to add to your Steam account, then this is the game for you.However, if you actually want a fun game to play, then buy something else with your money.#AchievementCrazy"

Gameplay..., please just don't ask. The controls and the gameplay are even so bad that you might not be able to finish your stupid levels in order to get tons of useless achievements.Background: we all know achievement hunter games are the new trend on Steam and since Valve is not doing anything to stop this new form of quick money and Steam system abuse I am sure we will get 100 more of those games in the next weeks and the first Steamers that will break through the 1.000.000 achievement record.There was a time where having achievements was a sign of your skill...As a game of course not recommended. This game is actually even abusive.As investing coins in achievements, sure go for it."

This is obviously an achievement cash-in game, meaning that you don't have to do ANYTHING to get all 5000. I started the game up and let it idle without moving for 2 hours and got them all.

The game has around ~25 levels but they are not needed to get achievements. Just let your PC in-game and achievements will start to pop out, stay in-game for around 5000 seconds or 1,38h to get all achievements.Gameplay:  just jump around, something similar to Mario, it's not even required to play this game to get all achievements.I only recommend You to buy this game if You are an achievement hunter or You want to expand your library.Rating: 1/10"

It pretends to be a platformer with no actual controlling. Floors made of ice might as well be,♥♥♥♥♥♥placement of traps and a non-existant PR team has left this to rot. But hey, 5k achieves and badges so....Steam has made me dislike the indie community, and AAA studios arent much better. Gaming in general has dropped so far down the condition track and at this point, if it isnt american I know it is garbage.(EDIT:6/22/2017)Again Refund PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS. After 2 patchnotes that did all of nothing and 1 bug fix, the level selector still does not show every available stage, the game cannot be completed as is, one of the cave levels will not let you leave. Door is broken. The developer has refused to speak to anyone, and is deleting threads as well. Refuses to work with the people who PAID hard money for a SERVICE.Its devs like this that give me the psychotic thinking processes. Not to mention the 5000 achievements called NEW_ACHIEVEMENT_DESC_82_5 etc, There was a time when a game had to be IDK, done completely before selling it. Im glad the people who create our stimuli are doing it for the betterment of gaming everywhere, surely not selfish."

You can ""cheat"" with pressing 'space' and 'w' for a superjump which makes it much easier to go through the levels.Developers are currently in fixing tons of bugs...This game is only interesting for achievment hunters (5k achievments). People who like playing hardcore games can find much better and longer games to play.+Price is OK+tons of achievments+graphic is OK for this price-very short (<1h to complete)-tons of bugs at the moment (but the developers are fixing them fast)"
,Not Recommended,646450,33988925,Posted: 3 August,all,Aurea,"Adventure Rage is a SPAM game, with 5000 achievements to pleasure us, achievement hunters and force us to spend money.The game for itself doesn't have any cool content, it's just a platform, with lots of bugs. A good example is that, if you press W and Space together, you do a double jump, and if you use an autoclick and autokeyboard to do both, you can even fly hahaha.Avoid this unless you want fast cheevos in less than an hour."
,Not Recommended,646450,34907216,Posted: 12 September,all,KrudlerTheHorse,"I bought this for a total of 11 cents because I got a 90% coupon.  Not worth it.I have to say that I legit tried to play.  Not good, but not appalling for the first 11 levels then on level 12 you can't beat it without exploiting physics glitches which I tried about 200 times until I gave up and went back to the main menu.  Permanently can't get back to level 12 to complete it... ever apparently.That and a billion achievements all called NEW_ACHIEVEMENT_NAME_11 pop up endlessly.  I don't know why this game exists but it is not because it is worth playing.  I will be reporting this game because it is one of those things that Valve would call a ""game-like object"" that is not here to provide a good experience for players."

,Not Recommended,646450,33730394,Posted: 22 July,all,ChocolatierGames,"I want to start off this video by talking about an epidemic plaguing the steam store... Achievement shovelware. These games that have thousands of achievements and use that as a selling point for their game. This is a new trend that is really the epitome of everything wrong with steam. Now that you probably have an idea of where this review is going let's hop into the game!Adventure Rage is a graphical, mechanical, and audible mess. It is what some would put under the ""rage game"" category. which really means ""we couldn't be bothered so here is a game that is just hard to be hard"". The gameplay itself is a 2d side scrolling platformer where you as some generic adventurer girl, must dodge spears and saw blades as you jitter from level to level. The game is extremely basic and can be glitched in about 30 seconds. The jump height/distance is incredibly short so jumping with any precision is always a crap shoot. Each level is not very well designed and often you can't tell if something is a design choice, or the dev just couldn't bother.The one bright spot in this bleak shadow of a game is the foreground art. it is by no means great, but it is better than the MSPaint art in the back that even I can make, and the incoherent music. The music is just a cacophony of random songs that have nothing to do with one another and a random one plays every time you respawn. It is such a jarring thing that I would actually die often while I am trying to play because of how weird the music is sometimes.But nothing is more distracting than the constant barrage of achievements that completely ruin the gameplay. In my first 20 minutes of playing, I got over 1,000 achievements, which is just disgusting. The game is a complete mess and I cannot steer you away hard enough.2/10 ""Borderline Unplayable"""

There is a good amount of levels, and the dififculty of the game is perfect.The music is rather loud, and interfered with my concentration many times throughout the game.The achievement system on the other hand, is done very poorly. There are five thousand achievements, and all you have to do to earn them is open the game. They cover part of the screen, and may interfere with concentration on the game.Overall, the game is pretty good.

The only annoying thing is that the music is pretty bad and there is a glitch where if you walk into stuff the character has a seizure.
