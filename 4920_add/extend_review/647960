,Recommended,647960,33547118,Posted: 14 July,all,Darth Tater,"I've had this game a while on my android, and often thought about how it would be great to play on a computer, because sometimes the screen was to small to enjoy the game fully. But now its on steam, so thats just great.Becaue of that, I'll also probably now be able to create a few hundred units without lagging the game.From the mobile version, the music seems to have gotten better, with more variety, and the menus have been reskinned, and the computer's keyboard allows for more shortcuts.On the actual game, it's probably one of the best RTS games I've ever played, with pleasing graphics, easy controls, and a variety of great units, ranging from your ordinary tank, to the spectacular experimental spider.The AI is pretty good, but I feel like it could be improved in the way of setting up defenses, and launching more effective attacks. They also seem to never use the experimental units. But I suppose that's what multiplayer is for.The sandbox mode is really fun to mess around in as well, additional features that could make that more fun might be if you could adjust game constants (build time multiplier, damage multiplier, etc)The level designs are pretty good, something that might be nice for some levels would be high mountains that no units can go through/over, or maybe caves that aircraft can't go in.10/10 best cross platform RTS"

76561197966526680,Recommended,647960,33708001,Posted: 21 July,all,Saracen26,"As an RTS (and I've played 90% of them) It's probably one of the most shallow base building games I've come across. Once you get down an extractor or 2 to give you an initial jump start, you can hammer out money fabricators to your hearts content without any penalty other than a high initial cost outlay. There's no power requirements to any building, because there is no power or resource management whatsoever.. so long as you can churn out enough cash generation, it's just a matter of hammering out as many units as you can.Cost is the main issue you have to manage and that's it. So long as you can protect, upgrade and go nuts building your fabricators, you're laughing all the way to victory. As I mentioned it's just about making sure you can afford high cost, higher tier units up-front. In my eyes this is one of the game's biggest flaws.Another flaw is map design.. other than water ways to go around, maps are extremely featureless. There are no rocks, trees, hills etc... everything is flat with different colours. There are a few maps here and there with additional terrain height. But there's not nearly enough, and their design is still woefully basic.The tech tree is a very limited as well. you build the prerequisite factory, and if you want more powerful units, you click the structure then press ""Upgrade"" for a small fee, after a short time period you have access to all tier 2 units. If you want experimental, you build the factory for that. You don't need higher tier builders to build higher tier buildings. The basic builder will also build your superweapon.. It once again falls down to high cash requirements.The only real choice really you get in upgrading are the turrets. Levelling those up allows you to choose a turret type.That said I don't wish to take away from the game any more than that. As an RTS, the combat is incredibly solid, and the usual Rock Paper Scissors mechanics are on point with any other RTS on the market. As you would expect from AAA when it comes to Air , Land, Sea warfare, you'll get the combination layers required to make the breakthroughs you need.As a single player game, there's plenty of content here. But milage will vary on that because of the shallowness of the building mechanics. To get the most out of the game with the AI, you do have to crank it up to higher difficulties, this will make the game interesting enough to give it legs as the AI will be smarter than your typical RTS. It'll still do it's cheaty thing by having additional bonuses. But it does have elements of actual intelligence here and there, that when you see them, you'll be quite surprised at it.. It doesn't just build to a certain quota of units and then chuck them at you, This is actually a big pro.The game does shine in the Multiplayer though as the shallow mechanics make more sense here. Facing off against human opposition is as good as any other game. It's your usual yet very solid arms race in creating the best Military Industrial Complex. I would say that if you want this game, this is what you play it for, with fighting higher difficulty AI 2nd...You get what you pay for really. So you can't expect much at this price point. But you will get your money's worth for a basic RTS that does the core elements of RTS right, has a decent AI at higher levels and provides a decent multiplayer experience. Fot those reasons I will give the game a thumbs up.But If you're looking for an RTS with depth, plenty of upgrade options and a deep tech tree with nuances to work around, you won't find it here, and you'll be better off sticking with the games that inspired it. Alternatively if you must go for an indie TA/Sup-Com Clone with the depth you desire there's Machines At War 3, which is also on Steam."

I play it mainly on the weekends with my regular gaming group and it has immediately entrenched itself as a staple in our rotation.  Ridiculously fun, easy to learn, varied, and with a responsive developer, Rusted Warfare is an absolute must for any fan of the genre.  Highly recommended for such a cheap price."
76561198139299207,Recommended,647960,33713342,Posted: 21 July,all,gluon,As I write this the game has only been out for about a week but its already clear there is a great game here.  This is in the vein of traditional RTS games that I played in my youth in fact I would say this feels very much like Total Annihilation at the moment.As it stands right now there is one 'resource' to farm which gives you funds to build ships/tanks/aircraft.  This means that the resource squares make for obvious pinch points which require defending and also are obvious areas to attack.  The game concentrates on the fun element of building the armies and have big all out battles which is great.  The AI seems pretty decent as well which is very important part of a single player game and personally I have only so far played the single player game which has been fun.  Its well balanced with the AI and thats an important part of a game like this as it makes for a fun mechanic.  This review therefore covers only the single player element and not the multiplayer game which I have not yet tried.Overall this is a very reasonable price for a fun old school RTS game and I can certainly recommend it.For those people who play on Linux I can state that this played as smooth as butter on my Debian based gaming machine.    Seems to have great support for the Linux kernel which is nice.
,Recommended,647960,33638724,Posted: 18 July,all,linuxpunk,"Totally hooked me up. Fun RTS with simple 8 bit graphics, akin to Supreme Commander or Total Annihilation.Game could still use some polish.A map maker and Steam workshop support (for maps) would be greatly appreciated.EDIT: After reading at the forums, I found out you can make maps with the third party app Tiled (avilable on Itch.io) and there's planed worshop support. :DAlso a second faction could spice the gameplay a little(would totally buy dlc with extra factions).I appreciate the Linux support"

,Recommended,647960,33672495,Posted: 20 July,all,Rafael M.,"Do you miss old school RTS? Do you like base building and prefer macromanagement over micromanagement? Then this game is for you!Rusted Warfareis an awesome RTS for everyone who enjoyed classics like Total Annihilation and Command & Conquer. It has 37 skirmish maps, sandbox mode, endless survival mode with three maps, seven challenges, eight missions and the possibility to create your own map for any game mode. You’ll get a lot bang for your buck for this price.What I like the most is the AI – it’s pretty good even in the easier settings. If you’re a single player like me, there’s a lot of fun to be had with six difficulties to choose, and if you enjoy multiplayer matches, it’s even better, since there’s cross platform play between Windows, Mac, Linux and Android.Also, it’s worth mentioning that the game is really well optimized and it has multi-core support, allowing for thousands of units on the screen without lagging. The dev is passionate about his game, always improving it and answering your questions.All in all,Rusted Warfareis a really great buy and it will become even better with time. If you have any interest in RTS game, this is a no-brainer."

This game is outstanding.I always wanted to play an RTS game but most I see look too fancy (3D, robots and space stuff) and have so much to learn, time I don't have to spend unfortunately. This game just makes it feel very easy to get into, nothing too complicated and has a lot of potential for modding!"
,Recommended,647960,34379558,Posted: 20 August,all,kbswizard,"I like the linear growth in the monetary system, and the simplicity as you don't need to manage 3 different resources simultaneously. However it would be nice if you can see the exact stat values of troops such as their range, hp, and attack rather then words such as heavy, and light to describe the stats. Another thing I noticed was that 'Laser Shields' can be used to stop the Command Post from defending your own base, allowing for a very easy early rush using that, a Repaid Station and just 1 cannon on a base! Overall though I really enjoy it and it was really worth the price, I would recommend this to ANYONE who enjoys RTS's or is looking to start getting into them."

,Recommended,647960,34031590,Posted: 4 August,all,=O.W.L.S=Nercon,"For a game with such price I'd say it is decent, the graphic and sound are acceptable to me personally and AI is performing well, units are distinctive to recognize(but there are issues with them which I'll bring up later). I was quite enjoyed playing with such large battle so smoothly after the failure of Supreme Commander 2 and the scam of Planetary Annihilation.However it has some serious balance issues(ie. submarine vs missile ship) while lack in some fundamental UI structure that any RTS should have, for example when selecting units the game selects everything including engineers and even all buildings, also there's no indication on what types and how many units are selected neither.For a game with such scale, there's no user-friendly unit marker visible on screen when zoom out to show what kind of unit is there, so I have to either select them all or zoom in again to see what is there, combine with the lack of selection indication, it really creates frustration during my brief playtime.There's no build queue for factories when fund is low, so I have to go back to factories(I know there are shortcuts, but hey, just trying to make a point:) ) and click to build again whenever I have enough funds to pump out more units. This might be nitpicky to others, but we are talking about TA/SPC/PA level of combat scale with hundreds of units being pumped out every minute, a queue system can greatly improve the combat flow and ease up the micro-managing part so players can focus more on the combat side and greatness of this game.Lastly the localization, it's good to have more languages for broader appeals, it's extremely business hurting to have languages translated poorly using google or some sort. I can't speak for other languages, but Chinese in game is full of BS and not much of it make any sense.Unfortunately despite how much I enjoyed this game I need to request a refund due to the reasons above, but I will thumb the game up in the review as it really achieved many that many other games failed to delivered. I'll keep eyes on this game and hope for its success in the near future and buy it back again."
