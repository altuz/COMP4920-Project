,Not Recommended,649600,34849144,Posted: 9 September,all,JIL,"I'm a big fan of the original flash game and actually beat the whole game without cheats (I probably have ungodly amounts of hours in that dumb game), so the 45 minutes I played of Maximus Edition was enough to get the picture.It's a cash grab. Simply put.It has multiple bugs, most not game breaking though some are, annoying sound bugs, a bad imitation of the old music, terrible voice acting and confusing new awful ""features"".It has its charm in that kind of way that something absolutely awful can be funny or intriguing, like when you can't look away at a car crash. So that i can give it but beyond that it's worse than the damn flash game!And also, dont buy this. It's awful, the nostalgia wears off trust me.2/10"

,Recommended,649600,33491060,Posted: 12 July,all,King Midas,"A version of sword and sandals very much true to the original. Somethings have become a little more streamlined. For example you no longer have to buy spell scrolls, and you earn a skill level up at each level next to the normal attributes. Enchanting has been changes as well, which in my opinion I have mixed feelings about. Its true that each enchantment in the original basicly did the samething, but it was cool to have a choice. Now all the enchantments do is give your weapon a new skin, and up the damage a bit. A bit lackluster.Also not a fan of weapons being locked by levels rather then your abbilities and the weight of your purse. All be it, that lvling up has become a lot easier in this version.I would say the major pros of the games are that if you played the original that you will most certainly enjoy it. The price is great, it's not very expensive. So for the price id say its a great nostalgia trip.Some of the things that could be improved however is that it feels very padded. There are too many fights leading up to the bosses in my opinion. It quickly becomes tedious to grind through all the trash gladiators to fight the boss. I love the addition of the dungeon fights, were your character can die against regular gladiators. And after defeating a boss you can go there to fight him again. And have a pick at his loot for a second time.Its one of those games almost everyone played when they were a kid, and had some fun with. I always wanted to see something similar come out at a later date which expanded on this idea, but no one ever really did.My main issues with the game are the previously mentioned padding. And the bosses aren't very threatening. And that a lot of skill paths arent viable, charisma characters have recieved a huge nerf. I hope to see a return of the bard in S&S 5.For my character I went for the, strength and vitality route. Wanting to make him as big as possible. And he towered over everyone which was nice to see. I would recommend this strategy for new players.TLDR: Worth a pick up for the price, for a couple hours of fun. And to revisit old memories."

,Recommended,649600,34633738,Posted: 31 August,all,Aschenberg,"I haven't played it through yet, obviously. But so far it's been just like old times with a splash of new features added. If you've played S&S 2 before you know what to expect and you won't be disappointed.UPDATED: I've played through normal and will be tackling ironman soon. However there are a few things I would like to say. The tournaments became super easy and boring to the point where I would just rushed through them with no tactics. The bosses weren't exactly difficult either. I beat all of the bosses without dying (except the ninja one).I didn't expect the ranged weapons to have infinite ammunition which made me die. Since in the original I would usually just wait for the ninja to run out of ammo and then rush at him when he was defenceless.Another difference is that you don't need to upgrade defence for better armour or strength for better axes and clubs. Now it's just your level that decides what weapons to use. I found that a strength, attack and defence build was good enough and then I would just go on adventures to get the other skills (an adventure gives or removes random skills. go on all of them since it's worth the risk)But I still stand by my statement that if you liked the original you will probably like this. It's got a few different difficulties, like 20 bosses (I didn't really count), a metric tonne of weapons, armours, skills, magics and potions.My only real complaint is that this is obviously a phone version ported to PC. I would like to see an update with a more PC-like interface and higher resolution textures."

So it's is definitly worth it's low pricetag.If you played the flash games and you enjoyed them than this is a must-buy.If you're just someone who's looking for a cheap game and came across this, you can try an old-school demo version of this on all sorts of flash game websites, just type in 'Swords and Sandals 2', and see if you like it beforing buying this.TLDRBummer that it doesn't have the original soundtrack.It has some bugs but not gamebreaking.It has more than enough content for it's pricetag.If you enjoyed the flash games this is a must-buyIf you never played one of the flash games do it before buying this."

76561198411874056,Recommended,649600,35274634,Posted: 28 September,all,That Mad Guy,"I played Swords and Sandals on the PC awhile back and loved it. The Steam version is a good game, though not quite on the same level as the other. One Notable difference is the lack of customablilty with this one. On the PC version there was many different armor and weapon combinations with the same level requirment to choose from. Each offered its own plus and minus when you use it. I wish this game has a higher diversity of gear to choose from. Other than that though this game lives up to my expectations."

Steam should stick to games platforms not old browser code that can't run half the content it tries to...)Pros -* Gladiator battles with a subtle comedic edge, what more can you ask for.*Runs smoothly*No waiting for splash screens, clickthrough speed up is always appreciated*Hilarious commentary*A fair system in where you can beat higher opponents by using strategy.*Tourney events*Original graphics that don't look characters were cut out of a template like so many 2D games these days.*Fitting musical score an appropriate cheers when you slay your opponent..* Price!!Cons -When there is some, I'll mention them but so far I think I will be hard pressed to find any."
