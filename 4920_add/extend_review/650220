76561198009807509,Not Recommended,650220,34093415,Posted: 7 August,all,Halcyon,"I'm voting no because the AI has access to information the player doesn't have, allowing it to pull off godlike trick shots when shooting unassisted weapons like railguns that have no tracking.The AI can loop a railgun round around the sun 4 times and around 3 planets to hit your planet. And amazingly it hits the planet exactly where your buildings are and rarely out in the wilderness.Even more amazing, is if you have built defense shields protecting your city and buildings, the trick shot will hit *just* outside the radius of the shield, so that the splash damage still damages or destroys your stuff. And these are supposed to be the basic railgun rounds that everyone starts the game with.The developer said the AI has less then 80% accuracy, but I call BS. I've played 5 games and every game is the same.If the devs decide to fix the AI accuracy and bring it to normal human levels, I'll change this review.As it is now, the game is unfun to play against the computer."
,Recommended,650220,34038819,Posted: 5 August,all,2PacShaCar,"Ok, after a few hours spent on the train vs mostly AI aswell as a few attempts at multiplayer, heres a purchase review on Interplanetary re-release edition.First let me just say that I (like everyone else who bought the original Interplanetary) found this in their Steam library a few days ago, so some bias might be heard here.The game in its fundamental form consists of up to eight players and AI battling each other from their own planets orbiting the same star, pretty simple. The twist is that their are no military units, or moveable units at all, each turn goes as follows:Everyone chooses what and where they build things from a resource/power pool (which has a nice bit of gameplay depth), they also choose what to research and deal with some other details such as city projects or building upgrades. Now heres the REALLY REALLY fun part, everyone uses the various offensive structures they have built to bombard the ever living s***t out of each other, and its glorious.everyone attempts to line up the trajectories of their missiles, railguns and GODDAMN METEORS, once everyone has ended their turn the game plays the glorious chaos of stray weapons just missing their targets flying off towards another planet just to be blocked by a gas giant redirecting their trajectory into the oblivion of space. These few moments of but clench never get old.As far as re-releases go, the Jolly Roger team handled it very well, and to be honest a re-release was likely their best option, heres why:Interplanetary on a fundamental level is a very good game for fans of strategy games, people who played those gravity shooter games or those who just love chaos on their screen. Sadly the original game received little attention, due to a what I believe is a mix of bad luck, minor quality of life issues and some weird acting AI (in my experiece), with the last two problems butchering replayability for me, Enhanced Edition fixed MOST of these issues, the AI feels a lot more fun to vs, idk how they worked before or how they work know but it no longer feels like the ai is just shooting into the sides of other planets.Pros:- Decent Graphics, fairly glorious explosion sounds and an acceptable UI (will get into that) gives a game that crutches on its gameplay, and the fact im still playing says a fair bit about that.- Gameplay has a LOT of replayability, different tech paths, different weapons and vastly different strategies leave a 'one more game mentality'- Multiplayer has worked flawlessly in my experience, and a hotseat option is always appreciated- AI are fun to verse- AI take over AFK players in multiplayer, which is niceCons (Warning: very nitpicky):- Turtling/defense strategies still feel pretty unimpactfull though-The upgrading ui buildings is annoying to close, you have to press the X, u cant just click out of it or press esc- You cant end turn from the tech screen  (as far as i cant tell)- Games can be a little painfull to wrap up, a plague amongst strategy games- THERE ARENT KEYBINGS TO DO MOST THINGS, sigh, not even a controls menu caus escape and WASD are about the only keys you can use, and escape can only take pause/menu screen.Reccomendation to devs:- Make defense buildings have a upgrade system, let there be a single defense building, that stops only railguns, the upgrades instead change the statistics on its defense, decrease some things and increase others, a huge buff to turtling and make it feel more interactive, maybe even add some things that feel impactfull/visible from space for defense builds, though thats up to you as to whether you even want to encourage that playstile-please let me close the upgrade buildings menu or any little menu for that matter by simply clicking outside of it, pressing esc or something like that- add more keybinds, add to buttons to scroll between the 5 different tabs, and make Enter end turn, some basic examples, atleast put the options in a menus somewhere would be real kind.- you managed to really avoid that tacky indie UI look, so gj with that- REALLY like how you view intel now, much more intuative- thankyou for not shoving down a political system or whatever down your games throat, feelsgoodman- hope to see some minigames/challenges, eg practice shots or survive for 5 turns or win in 5 turns type jazzTL:DRGood game, the $15 could be spent elsewhere but if you think you might like it you will probably like it. each round is filled a brief calm before the storm followed with chaos and butt clench. A lot of depth with little complexity (a good thing) leads to a larger then expected amount of replayability and strategy, a competant AI to vs is supplied aswell. Great fun multiplayer, although public games can be few and far between at times.Love the game, all of my problems are minor and hope to see it grow further.EDIT: Im an idiot who cant work out how to use a basic UI, to close the upgrade window right click outside of it"

76561198029306615,Recommended,650220,34040189,Posted: 5 August,all,RoosterByron,"It was nice of the devs to give this game for free to the purchasers of the original interplanetary game.This game has problems. There are glitches. Optimisation still needs work. Some UI features are confusing or clutered *cough* intel mode *cough* the tech screen.But the core gameplay is amazingly fun. To me it is a blend between old time artillery games, DEFCON, and CIV. You are incentivised not only to protect your pops, but to inflict damage on the enemies/allies when you can.The online play is fantastic. But the singleplayer is still good. The game also comes with Hotseat gameplay, so you can play with your friends on just one computer (does take longer though)While the problems are still there, it is still well worth a buy."
,Recommended,650220,34232183,Posted: 14 August,all,Shotagonist,"Very fun and engaging, utter chaos with high amounts of players and I recommend treating this as a party game outside of 1 vs 1. I've been testing this against Easy and Medium CPU and its really satisfying to play and win. First game I spammed Railguns and buried the AI under a barrage of shells, second game I went the other route and sniped all their cities with high-power lasers. There is tons of playstyles and great concepts in this game which allows for a good deal of replayability.About the AI accuracy, the issue is probably a perceptive one rather than a gameplay one. Evaluating the stats post-game, I can fairly consistently get higher hit-ratios than Easy and sometimes Medium AI. The AI misses a lot of their shots, but it doesn't aim the way a human would. Where a player would estimate and line up their shots fairly directly, the AI more or less seems to roll a dice on whether it hits or misses completely. If the (figurative) die roll says ""hit"", the AI will hit your planet, often even performing a ridiculous looking trick-shot. Overall the AI is fairly easy to beat (on Easy/Medium at least), you just need to not get salty about it landing some ridiculous hits and probably destroying a couple of your buildings too sometimes.All in all, it's a very fun game that's very satisfying to play and see the fireworks. Highly Recommended."

The original was good but but had its flaws. The enhanced edition removes these flaws and is a pretty good game. Best played with non AI friends, because the AI is a crack shot at everything."
76561198202011120,Recommended,650220,34641316,Posted: 31 August,all,Supreme Leader of the DPRK,Interplanetary is in my opinion a great game to play because it has:-A well rounded tech tree with enough options for every game you play-Good balancing of the weapons and superweapons although the laser is in my opinion a little bit to strong-In my opinion balanced AIs and difficultys which are appropriate to the degree of difficulty you choseThe only downside of the games AI is that it shoots players although the player died many rounds ago
,Recommended,650220,34684191,Posted: 2 September,all,NullDragon,"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BUYING: The AI will hit a specific percentage of shots depending on difficulty, about 65% on Easy. This is determined BEFORE it fires. If it decides it will hit a shot, it will keep simulating shots until it finds a shot that will hit. This means most AI shots will look like crazy ludicrous trick shots, but do not be alarmed, as it should still be hitting a 'fair' amount of shots.PROS:Saving for singleplayerLots of replayability with friends!Amazingly fun and satisfying to smack enemies with shots.CONS:No saving for multiplayerShots that hit a planet but did not hit any buildings are not visibleWill take several hours to learnEnhanced edition was given to everyone who bought the first game for free, and it really shows the devs care about this game. Balance was greatly improved from the original, as well as a ton of helper features. Do be aware that the shot prediction feature does not take into account planetary movement, which is good as it makes hitting certain shots still fun and difficult. Also, the AI can feel a bit unfair with the crazy shots it hits, but the hit chances ARE fair and comparable to that of an experienced player.Mid to late game gets crazy with the amount of shots arcing around on the screen. Defenses are powerful but can be overcome with AOE upgrades or with weapons that the defenses don't counter. There are also superweapons in the lategame which are massively powerful and cannot be blocked normally. There seems to be many different viable openers and strategies throughout the game, making two identical games next to impossible.Overall, I will definitely recommend this game if you're a fan of artillery games like Scorched Earth and/or turn-based strategy games."
,Recommended,650220,34901226,Posted: 12 September,all,Vegan Guy,"This is a great little game. It takes quite a bit of practice to land a shot on a distant planet with the simple weapons you begin with. ofcourse as the game progresses the player obtains weapons that hit their mark a little easier but so does the AI or your oppenents. My only complaint with the game is that the attack phase in the late game becomes very chunky, This is not because the game is complicated or taxing in itself but because it was designed in the Unity engine, a sub par engine that gets more attention than it deserves because it is simple to program with. Other than that it is a good game."

76561198176703314,Recommended,650220,34027894,Posted: 4 August,all,Ravenheart,"Yes, finally a updated version of Interplanetary. If you haven't play this game; this is basically civilization with planetary battles using railguns. The regular version will be on the store for probably a few days. Then it will be just the enhanced edition. Couple of improvements over the regular game is the the new GUI and loads of new features. It really spiced up the game and made it really engaging. It will be hard the first time when you play; I think to win the game against AI is to be aggressive. It a really niche game, so you can give it a pass or buy it."

There is no save or reconnect function so we have to restart the whole game. good mechanics are pointless if you can't play.
76561198000070521,Not Recommended,650220,34019030,Posted: 4 August,all,Mile,"+ Great Idea.+ Difficult and fun setting.+ Shooting costs energy.Targeting is horrible though - it defeats the entire purpose:- No Z-axis targeting.- No Aiming-Tutorial.- Preview-lines are useless: way too fat and ignore time elapse.- To do max-power shots you need to pull the mouse over the whole screen. (Or zoom out so far you cant see where you are shooting at.)- Shooting at lower power is not decreasing energy consumption.You should be able to actually aim on the surface of the planet. The Guns are not perfectly accurate anyway (which is good, as it is necessary for balancing), so why cant you just aim for the planet and then go into planet view to aim accurately on the area you want to target?And why the ♥♥♥♥ do i see, how many buildings i hurt, but not where they are standing? When the artillery shot automatically has intel-upgrades, then I should at least see, where those buildings where, right?Just disable this completely for both the player and the AI, until it was researched or smt..."

It doesn't cheat per se, but it is a computer and it can calculate trajectories so it can hit your buildings with railguns if it has the intel. Play with other people instead."

,Recommended,650220,35071749,Posted: 19 September,all,Text,"Just buy this game.And immediately to the point. Developers, take a look at my screenshots to see what your hole is. I very much doubted that I would win the most difficult bot ... It turned out that my friend survived with my tactic for 2 turns more with a timer per turn - 70 seconds. And with him I played only the fifth time.So. Add some kind of protection not only from the ballistic shell of the Railguns, but also from missiles!In the technological tree, this protection is too far away.Also a large jamb with anti-asteroid protection. It too is too far in the scientific tree, and asteroids themselves need balance.What balance? I just advise you to upgrade the anti-asteroids beforehand, or add a separate new technology against them-for example, a field or add an upgrade to the railguns to shoot into asteroids. Orbital defences.In the guidance of weapons, you can also add a separate control, add technology analysis of the calculated trajectory taking into account the time.Well, in general, if you add something like a space assault on the planet in special missiles, and the ability to colonize other planets - the game will have more and more potential. And what about create new cities, or military bases?Also add the ability to save the game for the host person in online, then to resume the game later.You can also add a variety of videos when you start the game, after winning and losing.Best of all"
