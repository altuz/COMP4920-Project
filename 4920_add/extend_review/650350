,Recommended,650350,33864390,Posted: 28 July,all,xtreme,"So far the game has been pretty fun. It definietly needs a lot of tweaking, which the developer is very clear about aswell.Pros:-Awesome developers-Immersive worlds that are created randomly every time you start a new game-Altough not perfect, the controller support is good-You can do whatever you want, and most importantly, build whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want.-Dirt displacement is pretty good, but not perfect.-A lot of machines to play with-Alotof buttons to press! This is awesome for someone like me that loves buttons. Having to press the right buttons in the right progression is just pure fun.Cons:-Walking/entering and exiting vehicles can look really odd. Sometimes it looks as if the character is pretending to be spider-man or something. This bug is not game breaking at all though, and is mostly just fun.-Driving vehicles feels a bit wonky to be honest, and it does not always respond as you want it to.-Especially the tracked vehicles are weird. The controls just feels overly complicated and turning the dozer around can be a challenging task. Having played numerous hours on Farming Simulator it feels like the game would be a lot more efficient, especially for keyboard users.-Digging is a bit weird, as it seems like the bucket does remove dirt from where it would seem natural it would. It seems as though it removes dirt with the bottom of the bucket, not the tip. It can also be a challenging task to make smooth roads.Closing WordsIt is very important to remember that this is a early access game, in the form a early access game should be. It is not finished, and will be tweaked and polished a lot throughout the early access period. The developers has always been very transparent about this.Anyways, even though this game is far from perfect, or finished, it's still a great bit of fun. Some more tweaking to the stuff that the community reports on, and the game will be a lot better.Thanks Daniel for an awesome game! Get some rest now :P"

76561198145194731,Recommended,650350,33912015,Posted: 30 July,all,cburns,"A superb everything simulator. Plenty of sims out there focus on just one aspect, but Machine World 2 has everthing packed into one superb game. From helicopters to boats, from trucks to excavators it has it all.From a start on a clean, blank slate of a mountainous island, the player is free to do anything. Digging and bulldozing all work incredibly well to create mounds or flat areas. There are plenty of blueprints included helping the player to build certain items, but from that players are also free to create whatever they like. There are parts for everything available to the player, from walls to windows, and even furniture to fully finish off your building! Building takes some practice, but after a bit of getting used to it allows anything to be created, be it building by hand or crane.Or if it's just a fun drive around in a truck or quad you're after, that's possible too. Or maybe even a spin in a helicopter, or a ride on the sea in a boat. Whatever you're after, it's here!"
,Recommended,650350,33983645,Posted: 2 August,all,FURHAVENBURGER,"Really neat game, but VERY early Alpha, It just lanched so keep that in mind. That said, this game is already in a better place for how digging dirt works than any other full release construction sim Ive played. So the raw potential is huge. Has quite a few bugs such as buttons stop working at random, and had some unable to start the game problems. But the dev support has been top notch, with several hot fixes issue within the last 3 days. As soon as they fix a bug, they push a patch, its been great.What it has currently of this time-small boattransport shiphuge shipQuadRazor style atvSemi truck with several trailerscranesmall helicoptercargo lift helicopterCargo/parts are adjustable sized segments for building structures, roads, bridges, ect.The building/connecting these parts is still a lil tough to use, but is functional.So the short and sweet of this game-Super fun building and digging sim in its very early stages. With some very nice people making the game. Just expect a few small bugs and minor issues.If you liked games like construction sim, big machines, and sim city, try it out.Ill try to keep this updated as patches roll out. <3"

76561197962772621,Recommended,650350,34137209,Posted: 9 August,all,jrwire,"This is the first review I've ever written. A few games almost moved me enough to do so but this one put me over the edge. I snap up every heavy machinery game/sim I can get my hands on.. Construction simulator, giant machines, demolition company, dig it, farm sim, even the underground mining sim. They all satisfied an itch to some extent and some of them did things better than the others and some didn't do anything good at all. My biggest gripe about all of them is that cartoony look. But I think this is gonna be the one. Yeah the physics are wonky and controls and other things need polish. Trino bit a lot off here but it's looking like they're going to pull it off. You'll drive your bulldozer and it'll get stuck on a 2 foot pile of dirt. You'll try to back your excavator up a hill and it'll struggle then suddenly surge so fast you'll ditch it over the side of a cliff into the ocean. If you try to fly a helicopter it'll roll upside down at the slightest touch of a control any you'll bury it in the ground. But somehow none of those annoying growing pains have stopped me from suddenly bailing out of playing another game and getting back into doing some more digging. I'm loving what Trino has accomplished so far. With some more massaging they're going to have something really special here. Well done, my friends. please stick with it!"

It is definitely early access and has its issues but it is a very interesting and very playable game.I am recommending it but be aware, if you can't cope with the odd issue like getting stuck trying to exit a vehicle or a build system that needs work then pop it on your watch list and wait a while.So far I have gotten stuck twice (there is a kind of reset yourself option) I also crashed a helicopter in the sea and couldn't see the menu clearly enough to get out of the situation. I was looking at the menu through the sea, it was odd.Issues aside we have an interesting game that has a lot of detail.There is a landing craft (a boat with a front ramp for vehicles).to start it you must find the generator and fuel pump turn them on and then start the engine before setting yourself up at the controls and piloting the ship. you can turn on the screens and much more too.the bulldozer has a 2 mode leveling assistThe helicopters need to be started and then the rotors engaged before you can think about taking off.you can dig soil build buildings bridges docks ramps helipads lights furnature fuel depots and much moreProsgood selection of vehicledeformable terrainreally open world do what you like feel to itVehicles have more than just an on off keyConsthe usual early access buggynessbuilding things tidily isn't that easyThere is probably more but although I am already 8.9 hours in I still have much to learn and discover, this will pause for a couple of weeks and then I will be back to see what else we can do."

Maybe cots.Thing I would like to see but would require too much from developers:RailroadsFarmingObject/vehicle damage or failure if the load exceeds structural integrity; cranes snapping, loads falling, tires popping and needing repair/replacement, component damage, mildew, rot, cracks,Reworking some of the vehicle's controls, like the tractor and starting atv, as they turn with difficulty.EDIT: Recent update fixed treaded vehicle movement entirely.More physics! :DVehicle suggestion:Air hammersconcrete trucksBuilding Suggestions:Power plant/ sewage facitity or pluming and electrical wireAs for the rest, it is evident to me at least that it is just Alpha stuff that needs ironing and probably will receive attention before release.

I spent 1hr direct messaging with Daniel (Lead Develope) and he fixed all of my issues which now has been patched.Gameplay is very fun!The game it self can be very hard but its a learning curve!Very customiseable controllsJoystick and controller support!CONS:Perfomance on the other hand still needs some work.

76561198083861746,Recommended,650350,33886191,Posted: 29 July,all,Jmoney1095,"Overall It's a good game, there are a few glitches here and there, but that is to be expected with something in early access.  The game does a good job of being realistic, but still catering to those that don't want to do things by the book, and want to just build something.  The game still needs to be optimized, as it can get a little laggy when there are a lot of vehicles, but they are working on this, as well as some of the vehicle physics.  It's a great concept, and the developers have done a good job so far, so I am excited to see what the future holds for MW2."
,Recommended,650350,34296093,Posted: 16 August,all,brothertim,"This game has really good potential. However, it needs a LOT of control polish.  It's clearly made for controllers, but it would be fine if there were on-screen keybind help depending on what you're doing.   Takes WAY too long to climb into a vehicle, which just feels weird.  The tutorial has some issues as well, for example, the bulldozer tutorial doesn't recognize when I press the ""set level"" button so I can't progress past that.  Lots of little problems like those, but they can all be ironed out.  I'm really looking forward to future patches, as there's a lot of potential.  I'm recommending it as it's a really good game idea, with beautiful scenery and awesome equipment, but beware, there are some problems here (it's still early access) but I don't mind supporting development."

Well i see potential in this game and hope it will get fixes and addons that will make this game an amazing sandbox game so i basically want to support further development even tho i have had bad experience with early access games in the past.So should you buy it? hmm depends if you want to have a great experience with a game right now and/or have a tight budget, then don't buy it now, or if you want to support the development of the game, then you should buy it now and help them to make the game better.Also think the game are a bit to expensive for what it's right now.I'm not sure if i would recommend this game to everyone and that's why i diden't recommend it below.Hope that Trino games will work on this game and not dissapoint/abandon the customers,."

,Recommended,650350,34370309,Posted: 20 August,all,8v92,"MW2 is an open sandbox type simulator in it`s infancy... very alpha IMHO and buggy, However i like it`s concept, i also like how it`s not limited to 1 element, you can drive, fly, or sail, chose your poison and it`s right there, there are obvious bugs, buttons sometimes will not work and missions get stuck when trying too complete, getting in and out of vehicles is wierd, it`s a 2 stage process, much better if you walk up and get in without messing with trigger points, and a third person camera view is needed, TrackIR support would be a nice touch in vehicles which would free up controllers for more functions.Some vehicles need refining and tweaking, i would like to see a full construction setup like Graders, Rollers and Scrapers to compliment the Dozer and Excavator, Excavators on Bardges for dredging, Also paving machines to build pavement like concrete and asphalt, and finally it needs the ability to landscape with topsoil and plant trees and grass after your projects are complete."
