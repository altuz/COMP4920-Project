76561198058875149,Recommended,650760,34271674,Posted: 16 August,all,ventilasi,"enjoyable experiencecompared to first game:PROs:-better art (the first game character art was a bit ""realistic"")-party system where you can manage your team member and their skills instead of just one character like in first game-free roaming-music keeps getting better (as good as first game)-no time systemCONs:-no custom character-it changed from roleplaying to more JRPG style where you train by winning battles.-a lot of bugs and i start to suspect they wont fix them... Loyalty decreased by 10..-no general description to skill manual you obtained. Gotta save before using them to see their attributes.still playing the game midway, but there is no ROMANCE probably.....Im starting to lean toward ""not recommended"""
76561198042928665,Not Recommended,650760,34269060,Posted: 15 August,all,Rotter,"I bought this game mainly because I both thoroughly enjoyed the first game (Tale of Wuxia the Not presequel) as well as a general interest in supporting the emerging Chinese game market. The translation is kinda shoddy and Im being generous here,but it's by no means incomprehensibleHowever,there are 2 major roadblocks that will thoroughly dampen any enjoyment of this game.1) Bugs.Literally everywhere.What is this,1995 ?I wouldnt say its unplayable as I haven't experienced any hardcrashes myself but the resolution couldnt be changed on the first day without a hotfix and the fact that everybody has the same description when you right click on them is hardly encouraging.I assume that there will be plenty more as I continue playing like an entomologist's wet dream.2) The devs have remained mum on support for the english ver of the first game which has stagnated at 1.0.2.6 while the Chinese version is at 1.0.3.1 despite promises to support the english ver.Then,suddenly this new game pops up and yaaaaaaay more Wuxia.This is just poor practice and shady as all heck,pardon my chinese poetry.In short,i heartily recommend to NOT get this game until the bugs have been patched out to a reasonable extent.However,i would recommend getting the first game if you are like me and enjoy the allure of Chinese waifus.TLDR: This game is unfinished and the devs are gonna release patches like hotcakes.Get it then if you want."

The gameplay is engrossing, the world-building & lore is interesting, there's tons to do, and the free-form exploration is very fun and addictive.   I've had a few bugs but nothing game-breaking.   For less than $20 this game more than worth it, with 40+ hours of content.   Give it a try!"

,Not Recommended,650760,34279898,Posted: 16 August,all,clea leshlick,"Great graphic, severely lacking audio, mainly SFX and cues. Menu is very clunky, I play with Xbox360 stick, the cursor is slippery, resulting in wrong choices. No feedback from sound make it worse. Had my first game over, happy to see an autosave! But you know what, I can't load my latest save, the cursor just skip to the one above it. A bug maybe?Translation is understandable but bad. Lots of typos, some untranslated text, no subtitle in intro movie. With 18$ pricetag, I'm expecting a professional translation. I love wuxia, the setting and story is interesting, but until you fix those issues, no.PS:-there is a gap in your water loop sound-with realistic 3d graphic like yours, people will expect detailed and matching audio layers as well-contact me if you need my services(i'm a composer/sound engineer specializing in games)"
,Recommended,650760,34341540,Posted: 18 August,all,Polarax,"Beautiful game infused with Wuxia culture, a type of eastern medieval fantasy setting (think Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). Good story with quirky humor reminiscent of the Divinity series, though some of it is lost in translation. Turn based hex combat with an emphasis on interactions between characters. Tons of side quests and interesting locations to explore.I'm surprised this game is so negatively rated. There are apparently some day 0 issues, but I've played 17 hours and ran into one bug, and developers have been actively engaged and are providing daily updates. Much of the negativity seems to come from China, with two main complaints: 1) this game has been released and stable in China for a year, and 2) it's apparently slightly more expensive on Steam. I'm simply glad the developers have brought this game on Steam for more to enjoy.Update: As of 8/20, may of the day 0 bugs have been fixed. It's very playable and more importantly, lots of fun."

,Recommended,650760,35037871,Posted: 17 September,all,Menthol,"Very intriguing storyline, made me want to read up more on the stories. Very simple yet fun combat mode, allowing you to strategize your moves and counter moves. The characters in the game is in depth and have their own personalities, which doesn't feel generic, even the bad guys or passers by.I played and completed the Chinese version because the original feel and bad English translations. Some small bugs around but doesn't matter much. Quests both mainline and side, are fulfilling and fun. Overall very good game if you understand Chinese. Endings are nice and different paths. Will play 2nd time soon."

76561198113338163,Recommended,650760,35222410,Posted: 26 September,all,Floating Elephants,"If you're a fan of RPG's you should play this, if you are a fan of real quests that makes sense within the world you should play this, if you are a fan of Wuxia you should play this. This game is everything that Tale of Wuxia wasn't, it removed the dating aspects and visual novel training aspects and went with a complete and proper rpg, which was clamored for when the original was released. Let's get the negative out of the way first.Positives & Negative: Some of these are negative/positive depending on the player1: Yes the translation is shoddy in many places, but easily readable, there is chinese text at times, usually only with poems, songs and qoutes from Chinese history.2: Often you are in a hurry, but you actually got all the time in the world as they completely got rid of time and day and night cycle, that said this is both POSITIVE and Slightly Negative, as you really need to power up sometimes.3: You can sell items that lead to quests or to advanced manuals, which makes them unobtainable, I love and hate this x'D!4: No handholding, I personally like this a lot, but I imagine that people who aren't used to using a lot of time on quests and or are new to RPG's might have difficulty with this.5: A lot of martial arts(great) but too many, and you have limited slots of learning, I for example learned one internal style early on that I realised I didn't want to have learnt, but at that point it was too late in the game. I understand why, but for new players be selective, the majority of arts you will never use, but you can teach them to the party members you won't be rotating regularly.6: Lady Taya learns Yi Jin Jing, Shaolin marrow cleansing and brain washing internal qigong, there is several issues here! First of from what little is left of the original manual(irl) it can only be practiced by men. Second off she is starting her martial arts practice too late yet masters many arts and have a high energy bar, now I wouldn't complain about that normally, but when she goes and learns one of the best internal arts that is supposed to be a secret by the way, told earlier that great grandmaster of Shaolin only taught it to a few of the students, which she is not. Personally and although it is to a great help, I'd recommed that she cannot learn it, maybe she finds it? but it shouldn't be learnable by any female.7: introduces some of the minigames from the previous game, but it doesn't make much sense as you'll be barely use it, except for creating armor or medicine, of which there is little options anyhow.8: Some quests don't pop up in the mission menu, but they are still active, so you have to try and figure it out yourself.9: Skill should show what they actually do in combat, as having to teach it and then enter combat, end combat and reload to avoid the skill is a pain.Positive:1: Looks great, the moves look great.2: Combat is a lot of fun3: Quests are great, I went away from the main quest did several intricate side quests, only to find out it was all connected anyway, which I loved, the world feels connected!4: depending on who you have in your party you can do different things, but most importantly start different quests.5: Party members have good motivations for joining you, almost all of them at least.6: music fits the mood in most instances7:  can be genuinely hard sometimes with some of the conditions required to advance.8: overworld is easy to navigate9: Rumours are fun, although I rarely see any direct effect from them.Rumour: The pervert has caught a strange disease at a ♥♥♥♥♥house! x'DOverall I'm having the more fun with this game than I have had with other RPG's in a long time, it is very unique, considering there isn't any real good wuxia mmo's, you have some xuanhuan, or some might say jade empire, but this is really the only wuxia rpg that I have ever played.Had the translation been per"
,Recommended,650760,35147742,Posted: 23 September,all,RaPriest,"A decent, solid RPG with classic approach in fresh and interesting setting.Pros:- Half-open world with free roaming and random encounters that can trigger quests.- Turn-based tactical fights on hexagonal fields.- Several interesting quests, items and styles that you can miss if you don’t pay attention.Cons:- Translation is far from being perfect.- If you don’t take a look at guide or thread with tips in ""Discussions"" from time to time - you may suck hard.- It’s possible to ruin your characters and realize it 30 hours after.- It's prequel, so you won’t see any serious development if you have played the original (until you finish the game).There are many negative reviews, that are crying about unbearable mess of bugs.During 80 hours of  playing the game I have encountered only one bug, which was quickly patched by hotfix."
,Recommended,650760,34777182,Posted: 6 September,all,yongkahfai,整体上是优质的游戏，希望留意一下这几点：1）秘籍为什么会被消耗掉？吃下去了吗？？应该可以同时修练一样的武功。想象一下大师兄和萧瑶同时打出醉拳互相支援，该是何其壮观。2）武功合击 - 例如胡家刀法和苗家剑法，应该开放合击效果“刀剑归真”，由两个队员同时发动。两个以上的队员学习天下无狗，发动“打狗棍阵”。仅供参考。3） 开放天赋书，让队员学习各式的天赋技能。4） 开放更多队员入队。。。不然每次剔除再招聘。。。意义何在？？？
