This game contains a blend of a lot of different genres including:* Final Fantasy Style Combat* XCom Ant Farm base building* Masters of Origian style space 4xSome Great Thigns about this game:* Diplomacy Dialog is Hilarious* The combat combos are great, once you get the hang of it.* Captivating (though simple) musicSome Not so Great things about this game* While much improved from the original, there is still a fair amount of grinding.* Would be nice to be able to assign skills slightly differently.* UI can be a little janky at times.* Not quite as much ground combat as I'd have liked.* Skill Tree could be streamlined a bit more.Over all, I played this game for ~20 hours and had a blast over two games.  Beyond replaying on a higher difficulty there doesn't seem to a lot of replay compared to your typical 4x game.  That said, this isn't really a 4x, and more of an RPG.  In that regargs a 15-20 hour RPG was just what I was looking for."

,Recommended,651660,34253252,Posted: 15 August,all,HAIL CTHULHU,"This is a reccomendation with a caveat- this is not going to be a universally loved game. There are a lot of aspects that can be frustrating, or even infuriating, to certain types of gamer personality. Let me explain.Halcyon 6 is several games at once. It's a resource management and base building game. And it's pretty good at that. But it's also a choice-and-consequence kind of game, with branching paths and options and events, sometimes random, sometimes not. It's... not so good at that, but it's good enough, I suppose. And it's also a turn-based space combat game. Personally, I enjoy the combat, but it's sometimes a bit lackluster.Halcyon 6 does all of these things well. It doesn't do any of them amazingly, but it does a solid job on each of them. And they're all tied together- your choices affect how much you can upgrade your base, which affects your armada of ships, which affects your resources, which affects the choices you can make, etc. This does serve to make the experience more cohesive, and I enjoy the overall result.But, well, look at some of the negative reviews. The game can feel a bit grindy, especially on the lower difficulty settings. On higher difficulty, there's less time to spend on being frustrated at the grind, because you're spending more time panicing about oncoming doom, but even then it can be frustrating. So, tl:dr, if you are easily frustrated by things that look like grinding, this game is not for you. Otherwise, if you like resource management, choice-and-consequence games,  and space combat, this game is pretty good."

It's not a 4X game and no longer gives the feel that it is a poor substitute for one.  There's no burgeoning sense of awe and wonder in exploring unknown space,  no sense of expansive satisfaction in the building of a mighty warfleet.  No euphoric rush of your scientists succeeding in their experiments to unlock a critical technology that will turn back an alien menace.What it is though is an engaging scenario of science fiction ""what if "" that combines light versions of 4X elements.I love 4X space games, but Halcyon 6  is not a 4X game and giving it the gameplay of one (as in the original version ) was killing it.  The new Lightspeed Edition shaves off the 4X bloat and helps the game become more itself.Events occur at a pace that keeps you engaged without being overwhelmed or bored. Resource acquistion is more balanced, making you consider where to apply resources instead of just amassing overwhelming amounts and having nothing to spend them on.Is the game perfect, no.  But it is engaging, and I am enjoying it.If you're looking for a 4X fix, look elsewhere.  But if you're looking for an engaging, space scenario with a sense of humor give Halcyon 6: Lightspeed Edition a try."

Lightspeed Edition keeps everything that's great about the first game and really mitigates the tedium, adding a few new features that take it from good to great. This time I went through the entire campaign without playing any others (about 15 hours) and had an absolute blast!Will I return? You bet! The combination of base-building, strategic combat, and exploration is well balanced and lots of fun. Sure I might like a bit more detail and depth but I think that might ruin the core of what makes Halcyon 6 easy to pick-up and play.Highly recommend the Lightspeed Edition!"

What I like most about this game is the measured, concise approach to design. Each element is well crafted, decisions are meaningful without being overwhelmed with choice.The music integration is fantastic, changing instruments as you zoom from base operations out into space. The sound in general is cohesive and rewarding. I also like the humour in the game, it reminds me of the old Space Quest games, and I think that's high praise.XCOM meets JRPG combat - this game, in it's Lightspeed iteration, is a triumph of concise, cohesive design with every element in harmony with the others. Absolutely recommend if you're after something not to heavy, but deep enough to keep you drawn in as you play."

The new edition adds a lot of new abilities and content to the game while smoothing out the pace of a run to be a little shorter but a lot less grindy.The new class specializations really give you more ways to develop your officers, including a skill tree that thankfully allows you to improve both space and ground combat powers at the same time."
76561198020594407,Recommended,651660,34267684,Posted: 15 August,all,Gungnir,"Halcyon 6 combines the best parts of XCOM with the best part of turn based RPGs.  Progress is a choice between building out your resource generating planet systems, or base exploration and training.  How easily you can upgrade your ships or crew depend on how well these seperate aspects are managed.Both ground and ship combat is a turn based JRPG style combat system, with the emphasis being on debuffs and status effects.  Each of the three classes have several debuffs they can afflict the enemies with, and their teammates have abilities to expend the debuff in exchange for heavily increased damage.  At higher difficulty levels, choosing the debuffs that correspond to enemy type and star system buffs makes a large difference.The game would benefit from more than three class types.  As it stands, I see very little benefit from not running with one of each, as there are no gaps between status affliction and spenders.  Providing more depth to the team building would allow for nuanced interactions between ship types.I may be missing this in the UI, but it appears possible to paint yourself into a corner when building your base.  There is no readily available option to upgrade the tiles to modern technology, or demolish the structure and build a new one.  This has not created an issue on my playthrough, but I will finish with only 2 spots to spare.Playtime is worthwhile for the price, and the midgame mechanic additions increase complexity."

I felt that before Lightspeed Edition Halcyon 6 was a nice concept with some poor execution making it hard to get into. Now it's  much easier to pick up and go, and the mechanics are greatly improved!The bulk of the game revolves around exploiting enemies weaknesses to the variety of debuffs available in combat [Both ground and space]. Weaknesses coupled with the mix of abilities available -some of which can be swapped out right before combat- means you'll be crafting a different toolbox for each encounter rather than exploiting one overpowered combo you work out at the start.Base management has similarities to X-Com, though perhaps less in-depth.It's enjoyable, not too mentally taxing but still offering plenty of opportunity for strategic and tactical thinking.I'm happy with the price, if anything it could probably be priced a bit higher and still be reasonable."

I have completed one new playthrough for my playtime, but have some experience with the game and the systems involved, so probably an extra couple of hours for your first ever playthrough. Once modding is up and running i will probably come back to create some stuff, I'd love to dive into tinkering with the combat systems a bunch.This is a large improvement over the original too, both in terms of presentation and in terms of the quality of the tutorial. Information is given to you much more clearly than before.The only slight downside is that the vast improvements in transparency and understanding provided do also reveal that there is not that much variety in building characters as-is. Theres maybe 3 ways to build each of the 6 classes, and by the end of the game you will have between 8 and 14 officers.All in all though, a great buy, and i feel that while i dont have that much playtime, all of it was quality playtime. and thats rare enough these days that i would give it a positive review on those grounds alone."
76561197997803590,Recommended,651660,34240593,Posted: 14 August,all,thEClaw,"The store-page mentions the inspirations taken from other games; the ones stemming from FTL and XCOM are immediately apparent to me, although they are iterated upon and put together in a fresh way that comprises a really, really great game. I have not played the original game, but the Lightspeed Edition feels well- and tightly-designed.For me this game scratches the FTL-itch, but it does so by giving you an interesting campaign where FTL gave you a lot of replayability (I do not yet know whether Halcyon is supposed to be played multiple times; but it appears quite long, since I haven't finished it even after 20 hours).The mechanics of the game could be considered a bit complex, but they are introduced slowly and the game starts out with a superbly done tutorial. I had been drawn in by the game pretty much immediately, learning the mechanics was incredibly fun.Bottomline: If you liked any of the games mentioned as inspirations (FTL, XCOM, Civilization, ...) and if you can appreciate pixel-art, don't hesitate a second and buy this game immediately. It is a joy to play!"

I suspect I am missing a much larger number of Star Trek and other such references than the few I did get. I shall have to acquire more knowledge in that area at some point.

That is not to say that H6LS is an abbreviated or Lite version of the of the original. The new edition moves along at a reasonable clip such that you can build up your fleet and things actually happen and not all of them bad.Among the more charming aspects of the game are the star trek-like away team missions and ground combats, complete with red shirted cadets served up as monster fodder. These now happen on a semi- regular basis, whereas before they occured only slightly more often than never.Another big improvement is the ability to chose your ship loadout at the beginning of each battle based on enemy strengths and weaknesses, adding a welcomed layer of strategy to ship combat.Overall H6LS is less stingy and more fun than its predessor with improvements that unlock the true potential of the game."

If you like science fiction and became interested after watching the trailers and reading up a bit, i think you will no doubt enjoy the game. Lightspeed Edition is definetely a worthy upgrade over the original version.There are still some minor tedious elements, but far less than in the CLASSIC edition. They made a lot of gameplay changes in the lightspeed edition, which were mainly good. The game isn't ""grindy"" anymore.I really disliked changing ship skills around before each battle, though. It is kind of a nice idea that you can pick the skills during every mission before each battle, but the implementation is super bad in my opinion and could have been done better. The process of doing that simply became incredibly boring near the end of the game, and this is the main reason I probably won't give this game another run, even though it does sport quite a bit of replay value in other areas."

As the sole surviving military Station of the New Terran Federation it is your job to fight the evil invading aliens off. While the story and dialogues are certainly nice they are not stellar and those alone would not make this game playing above others.What makes Halcyon captivating for hours is the tons of tactical options, especially in space combat. Ground combat has improved since the standard edition but is still rather lackluster compared to ship to ship battle. The turn based tactics and rock paper scissor principles nicely intervoven in the system makes planning your warfleet quite a challenge and fun as well.If you enjoy a deep tactical turnbased JRPG style combat and a solid Sci-Fi setting you should certainly give Halcyon a go."

Combat is all about applying a status effect with one unit, and the next unit using an attack that expliots(and removes) that status effect from the target for a +150% damage boost. SInce not all units can apply & exploit all ststus effects you MUST have one of each class in a fleet for maximum effect.Once you find a rotation of attacks you like, you stick with that and never change it.Because of this combat options feel extremely limited and always feels like a grind/chore.2 - Researching and building higher tier ships never really feels to give you an advantage. Specifically, random enemy fleets will ALWAYS have ships relatively equivalent to yours in tier. You just built a new fleet of all new Tier 3 ships? All random enemy fleets will now have all Tier 3 ships.This mechanic of enemies always advancing to be your equal always feels crappy to me.Specific story encounters are exempt from this rule. Enemy fleets in main story missions seem to be locked, so it is possible to be slightly over/underpowered for these encounters.3 - Base building is rather lacking. I'm close to the end of the game and I'm pretty sure I'll never use 1/3 of the rooms on the station. There's just nothing useful to build.-addition - Just finished the game and there are some unique useful items you get to build.  Still didn't use 20% of the rooms at the end.4 - Numerous attack animations are VERY bright. Some people may not even notice this, but I find it rather annoying. Many attack animations are extremely bright white for portions of them and take up a decent portion of the screen (15-20% or more). This difference between the game's base brightness level and when these animations happen is so drastic that you can easily tell even with your eyes closed.Combat animations can be turned off in options, but then combat just becomes a boring game of clicking icons and making numbers appear without any visual entertainment.-Edit - Just finished the game and it leaves me giving it a solid ""meh."" Not bad, but not exactly good or impressive."

As time went on, I warmed up to it. But after the full game's re-release, I can't say that I'm entirely satisfied, or that I feel the game is in any better of a state than it was before.First off, I like that things are sped up a bit. There's a lot of grind in the game, but speeding up the game also puts a lot of pressure on newer players. Why couldn't he have a simple toggle? Another problem is the 'customization' system. It's little more than picking a portrait. Only a small number of the custom officers have any sort of detail or backstory, and it can't be changed for fluff or flavor. On that note, not to sound like it's a major complaint, but a TINY fraction of those custom officers are female, which kind of stings because I always wanted a main officer that was female, but not Isolde.I've noticed that combat was significantly changed, as well. Critical State is no longer a 'do or die' situation for my ships, but that just feels a little cheap. It takes the urgency out of combat, and while I'm sure there are consequences (I noticed abilities gained cooldowns), I haven't noticed anything serious thusfar.The most painful change, to me, is the way the UI shifted. I don't like the new bulky, huge radial buttons. They interfere with clicking and targeting on other objects in the world, and it's just too distracting. A simple toggle would be all it takes, but I don't see one anywhere in the game.Honestly, I love Halcyon 6. I like my Trek-COM 4 game, and I like it's art, witty humor, and direction.What I can't say I like, is how this didn't come out as an update for the 'classic' game as a toggleable difficulty shift, such as FTL's major 'DLC' addition, with an option to use the new UI or the old one. Instead, I'm forced to play the old game, with none of these features, or the new game with all of the flaws. I can't say that I currently reccomend people to play Lightspeed Edition, even if I suggest they buy it. Go play Classic Edition first. Learn the game. Then come play Lightspeed. And maybe I'm nitpicking, maybe I pulled a Sterling and jumped the gun, but if anything changes... I'll be sure to come back and change my vote.Edit: Alright, I've now lost ships to the critical state. I can't say that I'm not still frustrated by it, however, as the new mechanic isn't really detailed anywhere and I'm forced to change my old playstyle just for the new one. I've also noticed that your 'prestige class' is locked in to what your sub-class is. A Tactician is always a Counselor, and I'm not really okay with that. Again, I don't mean to sound like I'm nitpicking, but I realy love this game and don't want to see it fall out of favor."

It's not very clever, it's frustrating when it doesn't need to be, and there's nothing here that's worth your time.*It's impossible to split fleets once they're made. Just sent a fleet to defend outpost, and now want one of your science officers to upgrade that outpost while the others return to base? Sorry, either all the officers and ships in the fleet need to sit there and twiddle their thumbs, waiting for it to be done, or you need to return EVERYONE to star base and then pay the fuel cost again to send the science officer back alone.*Different information on too many different screens. You got your ship construction screen, your ships stats and powers screen, your officer screen (which doesn't show the powers of the ship they're on), your ship equipment screen (you can't view the equipment from the map, though you can view the rest of the ship's stats)... Want to know how much power your stations uses and generates? Tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ kid, that isn't on the display. You need to start building something, and it'll tell you. Oh, there's no empty rooms by which you could enter the construction screen? I dunno, just guess. Or destroy a room so you can check.*Useless upgrades that serve no purpose. Morale is a thing! Except it isn't, it'll never drop below 70, so there's no reason to build a counselors office*Bugged as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Want to send a fleet to defend a world that already has a science officer sitting there, upgrading it? You'll win the battle with your defending fleet, and then have to fight the same enemy fleet AGAIN with the science officer, except this time the enemy will be at 0 health (and therefore invincible and invisible), and you'll have to retreat. Clicking notifications sometimes takes you to the relevant screen*Stupid quirks/traits system. They clearly liked the traits from Darkest Dungeon and the blue options from FTL, without actually understanding why any of those things were fun or cool. Occasionally one of your guys will be on a mission and be able to do something cool, due to the 2-3 traits they have, but these are all random and there's no scope for sending people selectively. There's no control over that, no way to get better traits. There's one mission you need to do that ends with a bad result, unless you happen to have recruited an officer with the ""MacGuyver"" trait, and they happened to be on that mission. There's no option to withdraw and send for that officer.*The space combat system has so many bells and whistles that you'll never use once you stumble onto a strat that works.*The ground combat is an afterthought. Again, so many bells and whistles, but usually you can just spam the grenade-like powers for a quick and easy win."

I've tried to find this game fun, but there isn't any time to relax at all. It feels like you need to play the game one way or lose. there isn't any deviation, and you can never over power your enemies because they just throw harder ships at you. It just Feels So rushed. you never get a chance to relax, because too much goes on. if it's not an alien attacking your colony, it's pirates attacking, or someone giving you a mission and you never get enough resources to build up a sufficient fleet to do it all which just leads to it being massively frustrating - and thats playing on the easiest difficulty.The premise is a good one, just the excecution is lacking and so is the fun."
,Not Recommended,651660,34472823,Posted: 24 August,all,Sparky,"Everything you loved about Halcyon 6: Classic Edition is here, but stripped back. In an extremely rare case, a game developer forgot that an update means 'same but more', and actually removed a bunch of stuff, added basically nothing, nerfed everything useful, and removed all pacing from the game. They also made it about 100 times easier so that it's no fun in the slightest. I'm going to stick to classic- which was 10/10 one of the best games I've ever played.Edit: I forgot to add the worst complaint: Forcing your ships to choose a loadout each battle rather than just letting them have all their abilities each battles is truly infuriating, and may have been the final nail in the coffin for me."

I didn't get to the end because of grinding through the tiers.It also seemed a little too straightforward and plain with the missions. There doesn't appear to be multiple directions to the strategy it's very straightforward - deploy 1 of each ship type, loadout to target weaknesses, repeat."
,Recommended,651660,34769369,Posted: 5 September,all,神秘,"Lightspeed Edition was added as a special for Buying when in early access.The game is relatively easy to play. While the start of the game is engaging and addictive, after reaching Tier 3 ships, it's a rinse and repeat experience.Now that I have finished the game for my first run, I have a complaint about the combat. While it is unique in the idea of constantly inflicting debuffs, then exploiting said debuffs for massive damage. In boss fights, damage is deliberately capped at 1000 damage. Which makes using the debuff/exploit system, pointless. It was a matter of ""keep enemy debuffed with -damage until my 30 turns of 1000 damage kills the boss."" = ""Win the game.""The only reason I really put as much time into Halcyon 6: Lightspeed Edition, is because it has a native linux application.BTW, I lost only 1 officer (because I tried to rely on luck for a final hit) on Captain difficulty. Finished with 35000 of each resource. Once you hit T5 ships, the game is too easy and grindy. Run the motions.Ground combat was not used enough. Make 1 OP T5 squad with damage reducing effects and the game is too easy.It's worth a play if you have nothing else to do."
