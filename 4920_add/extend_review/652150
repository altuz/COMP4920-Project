Not only will it support the creators in making future content, the video quality is far superior to just streaming online.  Very little to zero compression by comparison.Also, the 5.1 audio track is a nice addition to the bonus content, as well as the INCREDIBLE concept art book.  Hopefully the soundtrack gets added to the DLC in the future!Great job Oats Studios, I can't wait to see what else you've got in store for us."

,Recommended,652150,32967549,Posted: 28 June,all,allen,"Incredible short films. Ambitious, and visually and technologically impressive as well. The DLC comes with extra content as well as high resolution and high bit-rate versions of the films (and surround sound as well). The DLC is worth every penny for just the concept art alone really. Incredible stuff."
,Recommended,652150,32449849,Posted: 15 June,all,Spykles,"Great film, very excited to delve into the assets that made it. This is also a very interesting payment model and I really hope people show their support; not just for the Studio but to demonstrate that content/asset-driven monetization can work. Something like this isn't just great for the studio but also for any creators looking for affordable, high-quality assets to drive their own output. Very much looking forward to the next film and will continue to support Oats.Note: There is no software that 'runs' here as launching just opens the folder containing the assets; thus it's very difficult to rack up the 5 minute minimum required to leave a review. This is why you see barely any reviews on this product. In case anyone is wondering, I got around it by clicking launch many hundreds of times."

Please consider supporting him by purchasing ""Oats Studios - Volume 1 Assets"" on Steam or donating onhttp://www.oatsstudios.com/Ridley with his dumb bs Alien: Covenant and Prometheus should cry in the corner, Just to think that because of him we won't see Neill Blomkamp's Alien.P.S. 5 minutes, Valve, really?"
76561198027549669,Recommended,652150,32737811,Posted: 24 June,all,Alienmorph,"First of all... this is pretty much the equivalent of a pilot... a short made to show up an idea for a feature movie. So if you're looking for a complete story, you're not gonna get it.That said, it's still one of the best production samples and/or short movies I've seen. Takes a very interesting premise, which for some reason so far almost no proper movie or serie managed to got right, and rolls with it to the extreme. Lots of dark and bleak imagery, but also very well made and mesmerizing to watch. And the whole ""alien lizardmen covered in nanites"" design is something that I just love, both in concept and in execution.As for the content in the Assetts Pack... you get a very meaty digital artbook, a full quality downloadable version of the short itself, a digital copy of its script and a 3D-printable model of one of the aliens from the movie. All for less than the price of a movie ticket.If you like well made dark science-fiction, and want to support an indipendent studio that shows lots of promises when it comes to that, this is a purchase I very much recommend."
,Recommended,652150,32564179,Posted: 19 June,all,EXpMiNi,"I think the content is a little bit lite, I know they want to add more, they said they want give us raw stuff to play with and I'm waiting for it. I really wish to see props, aliens, textures, HDRi, etc. to train myself or create fan made content.Steam seems to not be really ready (technically) to have this type of stuff though. I mean, going to DLC to downloading stuff it's weird, no details of what you're downloading, it's very raw. I'm sure Steam could do a nice UI for this type of content.But overall, I really support the initiative and the format who give us more than just something to watch."
,Recommended,652150,33489946,Posted: 12 July,all,Jammy,"This product is basically to support OatsStudio and Neill Blomkamp to make more shorts and try a direct fan funding projects.Currently there are 3 DLC’s. Each bought individually and contain assets of each project.For me personally, i cared for the high quality video, script and concept art.3D models aren’t of use for me, not now at least, i would 3D print the models if there is a store near me. They look great tbh.For those who know and want to play around with those models, i believe the second and third DLC’s have models that support editing.I knew what’s in it before i bought it and i can’t complain because this is a mere support ticket… gun to my head ? i would really appreciate high quality posters. I would print those mothers in a heartbeat.Oh and hey Neill :D"
76561197970480501,Recommended,652150,32457859,Posted: 15 June,all,KreLokk,"ORIGINAL RAKKA REVIEW: Cool short. Some clear The Terminator influence which is fine by me! The movie is 30+ years old! I've always wanted to see more of the underground humanity horror from the original film. The filthy food, the radios and crying people in the sound design, general despair. I really support what Oats Studios is trying to achieve here. I hope that this new model of filmmaking can open avenues for both Blomkamp and the Oats team, as well as other filmmakers who may attempt to start similar companies in the future. Best of luck Oats!FIREBASE UPDATE: This was just awesome. Rakka was cool... but I enjoyed Firebase on another level. The mixture/merger of supernatural and science fiction in regards to Rivergods powers was really cool. While it had some clear influences (what doesn't? And I suppose anything set in a jungle with sci fi will have Predator'ish vibes) this felt original and fresh. The visual effects, body horror, and Rivergod himself as a villian were badass. This one felt like a homerun. I'd want to see this as a feature film.(It was hard to get a review written for this because of the 5 minute minimum playtime rule. I had to click the launch button like 2000 times to keep the launch window ‘running’ over and over before windows explorer launched. I have now developed carpal tunnel syndrome because of my desire to review this video. UPDATED: They have now created a launcher that will run for 6 minutes in order to prevent further injury to Steam reviewers)"

Neil is trying something new, a way of giving people who buy movies more bang for their buck. I think we can agree it would awesome to see all films do this kind of thing. On top of that, the short it's self is awesome and that alone is worth the support. I would love to see this world fully realized.If you support great innovative ideas in film, this is how you support it and make it as good a possible."

,Recommended,652150,32666703,Posted: 22 June,all,Bonsaipanda [FIN],"Blomkamp and the crew at Oats Studios are making motion picture history. This kind of evaluation of movie ideas and concepts is just pure brilliance and the engagement with the audience directly gives immensely valuable data for further development.But the most intriguing idea is to allow the fans to participate in the making by giving access to the assets and (later coming) dailies. I for one will definitely load all the dailies into the editor and cook up something goofy, like a Grindhouse version or something even more weird (I have some ideas in my backpocket).Having watched Rakka, I was just blown away with the quality and the whole concept. And will gladly pay the five bucks to see it in it's full glory. And I would gladly pay another five bucks to get the access to the dailies.Remixing and contribution is the thing today and I'm so excited to see it being applied the motion picture industry. Hats off to the folks at Oats Studios and especially to mr. Blomkamp! o/"

Can't wait to see what they do with the next one.You can watch this for free in stereo at 1080p, but if you buy the assets you get a downloadable version of the movie with 5.1 sound, plus various movie assets that may be expanded upon later. The main reason though is to throw a few bucks towards supporting great independent projects like this."

,Recommended,652150,33543324,Posted: 14 July,all,An Atheist Jew,"The videos produced by Oats are amazing, cinema-quality showpieces designed with the clear intention of drawing interest in the studio and its works. If you enjoyed Rakka, Zygote or Firebase, and want to see more of that awesomeness, the cold hard truth is that you *need* to support the studio by purchasing the asset packs and soundtrack. Without our support they simply cannot afford to make more of this stuff. Neill Blomkamp said in a recent interview that Oats is bleeding out with the production costs of these things. Only through our financial support can his team make more. Even if you're never going to do anything with these assets, it's worth your money to pay for them.That said, actually releasing the real, legitimate assets used in the films is kind of an amazing thing that no other film studio has ever done before to my knowledge, in the history of film-making. They're providing us the with the actual CGI models that were used in the production of their movies. That's huge. I mean, that's a BIG deal! So if you're interested in making games, film/television production, or whatever, having access to those assets is an incredible resource.WANT MORE OATS? BUY THE ASSET PACKS. Seriously. Do it.

I don't like DVD's, i think they're a little bit outdated. The closest thing is probably Netflix, but it's not available in my country.So it's really nice to see some good movie (even if it's very short) available for online purchases.
