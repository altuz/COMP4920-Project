As a writer, I feel like this could be an amazing medium for a comic. New favorite VR experience, this is as amazing as Google Earth VR.Edit: 2 things I would love to see are the ability to create assets and to edit existing ones.  I think these are must-haves for this game going forward but if we get those I could see this being the Minecraft of VR.  At least for creative types."

Despite it being fantastic fun though and fairly (will elaborate for improvements) easy to use, it definitely does not feel complete, but fortunately with the recent workshop update it seems the dev cares about user feedback and is willing to implement features and changes so that bodes well for the future.While I definitely haven't played enough to exhaust the content by any sense of the imagination, I have definitely found myself wishing for a few things on multiple occasions which I feel like should be prioritised for updates in order to maximise the experience:- Some kind of raised scenery or ability to build up to create edges to a scene so your photos don't just seem to drop off the edge (it looks really weird if you're trying to take a photo of something) - just needs something like hills or sloped ground and that would do the trick i reckon.- Dogs and cats/domesticated animals other than farm ones would be great for city scenes in particular (dog walkers etc to add an extra element of variety to scenes)- Just a bunch of normal people as the large majority of the people models here are all different and somewhat out there which is great for making the main character for an event, but it seems to lack models suitable for bystanders/spectators which definitely add an extra element to your little cities.- Some of the textures (particularly for the racetracks) are slightly inconsistent in the way they seem to be put together, with some types of textures having more size options than others for some reason which is more weird and annoying than a lacking feature but something to be rectified nonetheless.- Particle effects of some description would be incredible and totally bring scenes to life (smoke, fire, dirt, sparks etc) especially for scenes containing cars as it is hard to create a sense of movement or speed or collision without tyre smoke or sparks from a crash etc.- Can't seem to find a microphone too which is obviously a tiny thing but was annoying when trying to pose my reporter in one of my scenes.- Definitely could do with some kind of ""pick block"" option - similar to middle mouse click on minecraft - was thinking maybe the grip buttons for vive, as I have found myself wanting this on many occasions.- Inventory is super, super cluttered. Maybe for similar objects (different skins of the same object), give only one object in the inventory and then let us select which variety on an options panel or something if we do the trigger-touchpad click thing like for moving a character's limbs. Just a suggestion for implementation but the inventory definitely needs to be cleaned up if there are going to be more models.Ultimately this is a really really cool vr experience and I can see it transforming into something with thousands and thousands of objects, where characters can be customised in a simplified hat-hair-skin-clothes-shoes slider style menu where the possibilities for creating amazing scenes are endless."

I've been waiting for a game like this. It may not be like a city simulator, where you get to manage everything... But it's the next best thing! You put together your little town or city by hand which is both tedious and fun (strange combo but it works!) -- then you get to place people and speech bubble to make a sort of 3D comic book. The game has a few bugs here and there, like gas station overhangs wont snap over pumps, and the shopping center wont snap to anything.It has a few drawbacks, as if you are someone who doesn't really enjoy building things by hand, it can get boring very fast. The game does offer plenty of objects to build with though, and I'm sure more will come in the future.This could also benefit very much by having workshop content, allowing people to import their own objects/buildings.If you like building things and you like comics, this game is definately for you! However, if you are looking for a city simulator, keep going.I give this game a 8/10 - Unique, plays well, good controls, loads of fun!"

You can build pretty much build whetever you want wherever I want.  The best part is I havent run into an object limiter and I have places around 800 objects in my town/city.  I love the trains and the planes.  I aslo havent run into any lag and I am running on a GTX 970.  I dont even need legos anymore.  I love the camera feature and it is adorable!What you should add.Animated objects - maybe be able to have cars driving around or make it so you can control trains.More hills and mountains.Steam workshop - I think you already are.More train buildings - bigger onesJust more objectsAnd maybe even multiplayer just for fun!1000/100 best building game in vr right now.

,Recommended,653930,34068870,Posted: 6 August,all,Janitor,"Just started to play this game, and it's the best VR game I own!It's a slowpaced game, but, it's very fun to make crazy little scenes that are throughout your creations.It feels like playing with LEGO as a child, and some cool things could be done with this game.I would HIGHLY recommend if you own a Vive or Rift, and are looking for a cheap fun game to play.And the developer(s) are planning to add a Workshop, according to recent discussions, which will improve the game so much.If you'd like a game where you are slightly able to play god, and are into scene creation, or are an adult missing the gold ol' lego days, then this game is for you!"

If you enjoy sandbox games or building/creativity games then this is exactly what you're looking for. At first, I was not too sure at how fun the game would be. It looked fun but I thought that I would be done with the game in 15 minutes and get bored. This was not the case, I just bought the game today and already have 2.5 hours into it. The possibilities of creations are endless, I highly recommend this game."

Because the devs of this title deserve some respect for putting this together.  Firstly it's different to any other thing I've tried.  It is not game.  DONOT buy this if you think its a game because its not, not in the usual sence anyway.......SO WHAT IS IT??  It's a little bit of genius written in code is what it is.It's a giant lego design board in front of you.  Create a town, decorate it, walk around it, destroy it, rebuild it and admire it.  It's for people who are too old to play lego but still have a desire to do so.  Do it in your own private dwellings and play god and love the software.  If you have VR and want something different, try this!!!!!"

76561198051626381,Recommended,653930,34061505,Posted: 6 August,all,cybermynd,"Ok, this is a charming product. I bought it for my granddaughter and spent an hour or more playing with it yesterday. Controls are easy and intuitive, object selection is easy and there are LOTS of assets to play with. Poseble characters and an easy to use camera make it a great creative tool with no legos to step on! Not associated with Lego but it has enough quality that it could be.I'm looking forward to using it to create sets for Mindshow (another great game).Highly recommended!"
76561198017157536,Recommended,653930,34387390,Posted: 20 August,all,paperbags90,"Originally I mentioned that the controls were wonky, but after about two hours of playing this game I realized it was just me and not the controls. It does take a little while to get used to, but once you do it is an absolute blast!I have only scratched the service. There are so many objects to choose from and so many stories you can create! Currently I have some robbers running off with bags of cash, people roiting outside Town Hall and a car crash one street over!I'm excited to get back in a finish creating my city!The only con is that there is no quick-undo button so if you accidently delete a building or screw something up, you will need to manually fix it."
,Recommended,653930,35167328,Posted: 23 September,all,Sandwich,"This little game is perhaps one of my favorite time busters, but that isn't to say that it is perfect or dare I say - complete. The first thing that I wanted to create in the first little area that I built was a bustling city scenario, lots of people, cars, and things going on. But after I placed about 7 or 8 people, I ran out of people that I was able to use while maintaining my inner city theme. To fix that, I recommend simply rotating color hues in the clothing and changing skin color, this could even be something that the player is allowed with a color wheel rather than lots of different character assets.From there, and perhaps I missed them, but being able to build bridges would be awesome to connect multiple cities or city districts in an island chain.Beyond this I think it may add to the aesthetic of building a story inside the game if we could add definition to the inside of the building. Desks, chairs, multi-floor building, school rooms full of shenanigans. To be able to flesh out the entirety of a city would perhaps be the ultimate end-prouct.Finally - I think the ability to scale up to a 1:1 scale would be the final great touch to further complete this game."

The amount of customizations and tiny visuals I've packed into a mini city is staggering and i would recomend to anyone who liked minecraft building or other city/town builders or loves lego and had an itching for it in vr.Also, devs seem nice and active, i expect many good things to come from this title."

,Recommended,653930,35387326,Posted: 1 October,all,TheBlueGeek,"This is one of my favorite VR games so far, and wil probably be the one I end up putting the most hours in. Unlike most vr games that are short experiences that take a couple hours tops, this game has so many variations of things you can do. The workshop support is also really nice, though there isn't a lot of people adding to it and it doesn't support character rigging."
,Recommended,653930,35358267,Posted: 30 September,all,Grant,"This game is as fun as it looks, bought it, don't regret it. I have not played as much as I would like to and now it has steam workshop support making even better. I sit back and lauch as my kids and me make all kinds of silly things, they had some crazy idea's, but we keep daddy's world separate because I would murder their faces for moving a lamppost...Anyway buy this game!!!"

76561197979930605,Recommended,653930,35478395,Posted: 4 October,all,Pillboxstyx,This game is incredible. My only complaint is that more people haven't bought it and added all of the custom assets they can dream up for me to use :DI plan on sinking some time into the town I've started.
,Recommended,653930,35479645,Posted: 4 October,all,Smugz,"Wow just wow... This game is a game you can only get bored of when you run out of imagination.. serioulsy. I was hesistant to buy it at first but then decided to risk it and see what this is like and it was my lest regrestted purchase yet. The art style is brilliant, the soundtrack is very well fitting, and to my surprise it is a whole lot of fun!Only negative thing I can say is that you can not share your creation with others via Workshop.Overall: 9/10"
