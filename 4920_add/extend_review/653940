Z for zombie, yeah yeah, I get it.But don't worry, that's actually one of the worst things I've got to say.The game comes with a set of scenarios to choose from with a different endgoal each time. Examples include fortifying a building and finding a flare gun, repairing a vehicle and using it to escape, preparing for a rescue helicopter, starting with one survivor and attempting to attract more and so on. Fairly standard survival storylines; a little bit boring if I'm honest. In addition to the somewhat mundane scenarios, you have an endless mode (see how long you can survive), and here's the good bit - custom games. Each scenario can be very heftily customized with difficulty options. You can make scenarios near impossible if you fancy a real tough challenge.Zafehouse Diaries is played through clicking on the icons, and the UI is intuitive and easy to follow. The tutorial mission didn't actually give me any instructions (was it meant to?) but I figured it out easily enough as everything has a mouseover text and is relatively simple. You have a set of survivors who have traits and equipment and you're in a town. These things are procedurally generated, so it's different every time. You give them options - move to a house (investigate it or breach it), patrol the surrounding area and kill zombies, snipe zombies, barricade / fortify your base, search for items, cook food, clean up the corpses and so on. So you click, click, click and assign your survivors and then hit the stop watch.Time advances one hour, and anything that happens is recorded in your diary. You then make decisions accordingly.Obviously it's not quite that simple -  ♥♥♥♥♥♥  happens. You might get new survivors or a trader and have to make a choice. You might find something really special and have to decide what to do with it. You might run out of medical supplies and food. You might get attacked by zombies in the rainy night. Dilemma's can occur where you have to make a choice that can have serious impacts on your survivors. Your survivors have personalities and traits, and can suffer from anxiety and stress. They can start fighting and disagree with each other, and you have to not only think what's best for us physically - but what's going to make my team not kill each other. There was an awkward moment when the game gave me two gay guys, 2 homophobes and a chick who hates men. Thanks game!! Go team! Woo!So it's not as simple as it seems, it has a decent scope of depth, and the random nature plus the custom settings give it a ton of replayability.It's a very niche game - survival without any real action. A lot of reading and story but in a very overdone setting, with nothing really surprising that I've discovered yet. Some people - particularly if you prefer action to reading - may find this the Zzzafehouse Diaries. Sorry, couldn't resist. At the same time, despite this, I find it quite relaxing and enjoyable. Okay, maybe a zombie survival game isn't meant to be relaxing - but I kicked back in the sweltering British heat (yeah, that's a thing, it's 30C with no breeze and we don't have air con!) with a sweaty baby in my arms and just clicked through the story. The decision making was just enough to keep my brain working and the random nature kept things fresh.  Customizing the story really steps it up a notch and makes things interesting and a real challenge. And really, it's quite realistic... well, as realistic as the zombie apocalypse gets anyway.If you like these three thingsZombie GenreReading words (if you got this far that's probably you!)Strategy rather than actionThen you will like this game!Thumbs up from me."
,Recommended,653940,32798178,Posted: 25 June,all,VG Purist,"If you're looking for a heavy action oriented zombie... go look elsewhere.  This is a true zombie survival game where killing a zombie is just as important as being good buddies with the person who you are killing the zombies with.Those of you who have played the original Zafehouse Diaries will not see too much difference on the surface between the 2 games.  However this is built on a new game engine with some nice changes and upgrades.The narrative is driven every hour by a watch and everything that happens during that time is written in a diary.  Time of day and even weather makes a difference in spotting zombies and attacking them.I've always wanted a zombie game that focused more on the survivors and not just about killing them.  This game sort of has that.  When you do things in groups, the relationships could get better or worse depending on how successful you are with the activity (and even then there are no real gaurantees).  After a while, the group may end up hating one of the other survivors so much that they will actually be happier if something bad happens to them.Not just a zombie game as there are random situations that may happen.  For example: one of your survivors could be wanted by another group and will hunt you down. Will you defend that person or hand him/her over?The greatest downfall of this game is that all of the ""rolls"" happens behind the scenes.  You never know how much of a difference between attacking at night or in the day really makes.  Or even how much of a difference being in a good relationship will make for the group while searching.  Of course the game says that zombies are harder to spot and what not but how much exactly??  One may never really know.https://youtu.be/RUBAZ5jUNrkOverall a good zombie survival game.  Veterans to the series will like the new changes and new people coming into this game will understand and pickup the nuances of the games very quickly."
,Recommended,653940,32523415,Posted: 17 June,all,Omen UK,"I have only played 5.4 hours of Zafehouse Diaries 2... or I should say, it took me 5.4 hours of playing Zafehouse Diaries 2 before I took a break from it.If you have played the original Zafehouse Diaries then you will know what the game is about and all I need to say really is it is an improved version of the original  game, with some things added to expand on their original ideas.  If you played and loved Zafehouse Diaries then you will probably buy this or will have bought it already so you may as well stop reading this review now as I'm not going to say anything you don't already know.If however you haven't played this game before and have come across it or searched for a reasaonably priced ga,e then this is the game for you. Zafehouse Diaries 2 is the second game in the Zafehouse Diaries series, it's a strategy game where you have from 1-5 survivors.  Ultimately as the game description says it is a a game of survival, exploration and relationships where the commaraderie between your survivors canat times affect how well they complete the tasks you allocate to them. The game is moved forward every hour once you have designated tasks for your survivors, each of whom come with their own skills, motivations and prejudices so it is also aboutasking the right survivor to do the job that suits them best and having them work with the people top ensure the task is completed, oh and there is the little task of  the zombie ap[ocalypse you have yo outlast.There are different game modes, some are straight up survive as long as you can, others will have you collect items and renforce a specific location till you are rescued, there are different options you can change to affect the difficulty.  Also there is the customization you can create your own custoom survivors, their eemployment prior to the apocalypse, and their prejudices and skills as well as creating custom job roles to give your survivors more variety and more items for your survivors to possible find on their travels.I would reccommend this game, was a big fan of the original and the sequel takes that game and improvees on it making it just as much fun as the original.  Now if you're satisfied that is enough of a review I am out of here to go play some more Zafehouse Diaries 2 :)Edit: 21/06/17In my initial review I mentioned difference, improvements on the first game without being too specific so what those changes are.To start off with the game now has different game modes, so when you start a new game it ranges from the basic tutorial which helps you get to know the basics of the game to No Survivors a last as long as you can endurance mode where you've to last as long as you can.  Along with each game mode there are options to customize your game to make it easier or maybe more difficult.The game itself looks familiar to the same game but it is like everything has been tweaked to look better.  When moving inventory items it's now a little easier to gather your stuff together, you also have three options to have auto load off, half full or full which will pr-fill your inventory with items you will need when breaching or assaulting a new location, on the left hand side of the screen your survivors and their icons appears and now you are able to quickly edit who wears what protection and what weapon they carry, a box opens to give you a list of all the avialble items so you can just click on it so it's easier to get your survivors kitted out.Most noteably is the interface, if you click on your notepad it will move you to a area where you can read notes, have the calender to see how long you've survived and if you are required to collect items it will display those you have collected, and have outlines of those you still need to collect.  Also on the main game page if you move to the top of the screen there is now a clickable diary to open to read your diary entries.  Overall everything looks fresh and clean and is easily accessible and feels easier to navigate your way around things.There have been other changes too but honestly while it looks and plays like the exact same game as the first, which is a good thing as the first Zafehouse Diaries was a good game, there are subtle changes, some larrge some minor, just make make things run a little smoother.One thing I do like is how Screwfly the developers of Zafehouse Diaries 2 have been quick to answer player questions on the steam forums for the game and made a few updates to fix any minor issues and you feel like they have real pride in this game which is what makes them so good."
,Recommended,653940,32815530,Posted: 26 June,all,GoldMath,"This game is simply unique, no other can come up with a mix of ""Drama RPG Survival Strategy Text-Story"". Decisions are punishing and sometime the faith isn't on your side, but it gives challenge and great stories.Starting with a group of five dudes who can't stand each other.5 days later, finished with three bros all infected who decided to fortify their own tomb, attract the whole town and full bang all remaining ammunition until death.Best game over, almost cry.Bonus: Peanuts price, active and listening indie developers."

I've had some survivors take several hours to serach 3% of a building and sometimes they got stuck moving from building to building. Aswell as finding single rounds of ammo and food. I did mess around heavily w/ custom stuff tho. There was just an update that lowered the food posioning chance, which is good as it was happening 1/3 someone ate anything. The game was just released. Screwfly is pretty good when it comes to tweaking things. Just look at the original which is an amazing game. Giving enough time I'm sure this one will be even better! Buy it while its on sale, then forget about it. When you pick it up again it should be fine."

They shared the soap.Zafehouse Diaries 2 is essentially a direct upgrade to the original Zafehouse Diaries. if you didn't enjoy the first your opinion is unlikely to change.It is much of the same in terms of gameplay with new added features, new content, updated user interface and better customization.As a fan of their games, It's a fun little sim to get immersed in and kill time. While the content is slightly barebones at times, the meagre price charged for the game is currently worth it.The devs are also quick to respound to critisim and fix issues, with the games balancing being intiually broken on launch, however they where quick to redmidy the problems put frouth by the community. So kudo's to them."
76561197988728533,Recommended,653940,33035492,Posted: 30 June,all,zaG,"This game is about...Blah, blah, blah.ZHD2 needs some improvements in creating distractions, rumors and tinkering. Distractions for example are not as necessary as they were in ZHD1. The whole town was flooded with hundreds of zombies but I never felt like I got slaughtered by the crowd. The massive distraction isn't as effective as the bonfire in ZHD1. It doesn't distract so many zombies. The rumor system didn't get improvements. It's just there. It could be deeper and wider. Tinkering is too random. You nearly have no controls about it. I want to say my people which items I want. You always have to tinker the same order. First cooking or construction because no one wants a combat pan. I never equipped that one. But you'll get one if you tinker for weapons first. Tools are so rare in that game that you don't want a combat circular saw. No you want a builder's circular saw. Another thing is I got a scoped shotgun. Yes, a scoped shotgun. I don't know how effective such a scoped shotgun is. The game didn't tell me. I think a sawed-off-shotgun would make more sense. And so on...At this state (two weeks after release) ZHD2 is too easy (by default). You can change difficulties in a custom game but you won't get every achievement in a custom game. You have to play the difficulty the devolopers chose. And that's too easy in my opinion. It is possible to get every achievement without spending a lot of tears. I wasn't annoyed, I didn't rage. In ZHD1 I was and I did. That helped getting better.Despite my critics (I learned the word ""despite"" by reading the diary in ZHD1) Screwfly games count to the best strategic games I've ever played (I started with a C64 and a NES). Because they are different and can get pretty tough.The mechanics aren't clear within the first drives. The more you get into the game the decisions you make get better. Their games include a lot of randomness. But you can keep it calm with clever moves. And that's fun.The maintenance service is impressive. I reported a bug and one day later it was nearly fixed. Two days later it was fixed. The communication between players and developers work! They implement features and improvements requested by the players.After I went through ZHD1 I bought ZHD2 and Fear Equation. I don't regret spending the money. Thank you!"

,Recommended,653940,32639483,Posted: 22 June,all,craybat,"One of my favourite series on Steam, and this game does not disappoint.I've played alot of action zombie games and, well, honestly they end up being too freaky for me. Maybe it's because of the forceful running towards my screen and the panic that sets in, or its the screaming and screeching noise that goes along with it. Could also be either the frenzy of a horde of flesheaters or that one truly scary f***. Maybe it's a combination of all those things. Either way, it gets harder and harder to motivate myself to put more hours into those games. I've just been spooked too many times.This game is different. It's scary, true, but in a way that gets you nervous but never screamish. I'd say its the strategic top-down view that does this, as well as the plot you get to create yourself that kind of gets the game acting alot like a board game. In fact, I think this game would be great as one, and has quite a few similarities with e.g. Dead at Winter.It's also that kind of game that doesn't present you with one super-character that helps you beat it all. Some are better than others, but the police officer, firefighter or mechanic aren't always as good as you'd think - you'll find yourself praising sweet Jebus once you get that cleaner or cook that can get your meals from one star up to four, or the mayor that helps ease the tension between your crew. My most prized character in my crew of five was an elderly teacher that somehow got along with everyone, which is rare, and also helped them teach each other new skills.You'll be really bummed out when your characters die - especially if they're on a simple investigation mission or get infected - which I guess brings me back to one of the great things about this game: I care. And I want to play it just one more time, knowing that whoever I end up with, wherever they start and whatever happens, I get to create another random awesome story and tune out for a few hours without my heart racing."

,Recommended,653940,32628486,Posted: 21 June,all,usernamewanted,"TLDR: Its not nearly as hard (damn :/) but its still pretty awesome !! :)So I waited a looooooong time for the sequel to Zafehouse - a long, maddening time. It took me 80 hours to 100% the first one and I loved the challenge it presented. The achivements were difficult and you had to tinker with your strategy every game... I don't know why, but zh2 just isnt the same.Which is not to say its bad - by all means it an awesome game and the devs have clearly worked hard to open up more detail to elements of the first such as breaching & defensive strategies. HOWEVER if you loved the first game for its challenge and its near impossible achievements, be warned that you won't find this here. It feels like by opening up some elemnts of the game theyve also downgraded a lot of the challenge and thats a real shame, in my eyes.Of course its still great to see the game, and the devs have expanded on what flooded the forums before like more depth to the relationship system (which by the way is still one of the more unique elements ive seen in a game and is really enhanced in this sequel) and a crap tonne of new modes, building types & aggressor dilemmas - although you should still be just as hesitant to cut off limbs :PThanks Screwfly for the new game - as a longtime fan I can't wait to see more in the future."

The game is basically the same as the prequel, but with more events and some better looking menus/ more customization. This is basically a standalone dlc for the first game.They do have a new, really cool customization system which may be fun for some, you can create your own characters, background stories/ careers, groups, weapons, gear and other items, but I feel like with this system they could've added more item diversity in the game,  expect to see mostly the same stuff from the original: crossbows, bats, wooden spoons, etc.Maybe if they added a steam workshop  for mods it'd add more playability."
