,Recommended,653950,33328638,Posted: 6 July,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"A charming kinetic (there are no choices, you only read) visual novel about a boy that goes back to his hometown to visit his mother, and there he recovers an important memory, one which he thought he had lost.For the current price tag, this VN is totally worth getting: the art style is beautiful, BGM is good and relaxing, and there’s even voice acting (in Chinese). This title is also quite short, so if you want something “quick” to read,Your Smile Beyond Twilightcan be a good call. I only have two complains: sometimes the text surpasses the text box, and it can get hard to read the last lines since they get mixed with the menu options. That might be a problem of the English version only, I don’t know.Speaking of it, the translation feels like it was done by two or three different people. Maybe I’m wrong, but it just feels like that. The game begins with a good and consistent narrative, and it suddenly changes; typos and awkward sentences appear and even tho I’m not a native speaker of English myself, I felt confused sometimes since a few sentences were very awkward and made little sense in English. Even so, I enjoyed this VN. It was short and still, I have this feeling that the devs put effort in it.6/10. I hope that the developers will fix the English translation soon."

76561198354104314,Not Recommended,653950,34315667,Posted: 17 August,all,SaintAnthony98,"*NOTE: Playtime is inaccurate, I played for about 2 hours.Your Smile Beyond Twilight is a kinetic Chinese visual novel about a man being haunted by his past.Pros:+Beautiful character portraits and backgrounds+Plenty of voice acting+CG viewer and music player unlocked after finishing the gameCons:-Little to no re-read value; on top of the novel being kinetic, the plot isn't complicated enough to warrant a re-read-The voice acting is uneven, sometimes great, sometimes very flat-Few CGs, what few there are usually have no backgrounds and have so few of details that even the character portraits have more detail-The plot is largely predictable, especially in its second half-Most of the characters are walking tropes, which would be fine if they had more depth, but, sadly, the protagonist is the character with the most depth, and he's the one with the most dull personality of the cast.-The emotional ending sequence that many said made them cry didn't move me very much, and I cry at animes, movies, and visual novels very easilyI said I didn't reccomend the game, but even though it wasn't my cup of tea, I still felt I got my money's worth due to the length for its price, the pretty art style, and plenty of voice acting, even if said acting quality is inconsistant. If you want a quick VN you can beat in one sitting and you have a few bucks left during a steam or winter sale, consider picking up, but don't keep your expectations too high. That said, I'd seen free visual novels on steam have higher quality storytelling, characters, and sometimes longer in content, so choose wisely."

Now, the tale may be hard to comprehend at some points, as it appears this is a Chinese visual novel that has been translated into English, but still.Also, note that one of the achievements involves playing the game for two hours... and falling asleep during that period can vastly inflate your play time."

,Recommended,653950,33396368,Posted: 9 July,all,Daybreak,A noble visual novel that sheds light on the human condition. Kind developers that provided a new English translation when the first one was lacklustre.
,Recommended,653950,33589562,Posted: 16 July,all,Wilson,"A short nostalgic train trip to the depth of one feeling.Overall:- A good one but short, wish there is more to see.- The music is simple yet rings your emotion.- Really wish there is more CG, I love how it convey the emotion alongside the music.- A bit sad for the English Translation text to be super packed that it covered some of the UI.I recommend avoid using the ""Save"" function if possible, not that it has any secret or spoiler.But the intention behind flow well with the theme of this VN.

,Recommended,653950,32919024,Posted: 28 June,all,minzart,"A sweet and effective tale from a promising Chinese doujin group.That was quite a pleasant surprise! This is not my first time reading a Chinese indie VN, but this is by far the highest quality one I have seen.Summary: an approx. 1.5 hour long kinetic novel about a man named Yunshan who visits his hometown with his girlfriend after they both resign from their company. The events all deal with the main character accepting the loss of his distant yet loving father, learning to embrace his loving and supportive girlfriend, as well as grappling with his past relationship with a mysterious forgotten girl and reconciling that with his current relationship.ProsVERY good voice acting!If you are a native-level speaker or are very familiar with Chinese, you shouldn't find any problem with the dialogue. The back-and-forth between the unvoiced MC and the two heroines all feel very natural and evoke a sense of young love.Fantastic production value.The art and music are just gorgeous, and the interface is fairly intuitive.A Chinese VN, with a uniquely Chinese character to it.(Note: I realize some people might consider this a con :^)) The ""dating habits"" of Chinese lovers, like joking about breakups and baiting the other into ""吃醋chicu"" (becoming jealous) and getting quizzed by your mother about marriage are all mainstays in any Chinese relationship, and this game manages to capture all of this whimsical back-and-forth without forcing it.ConsSlight technical issues. One voice line didn't play when it should have; it wasn't a big deal, but confused me for a moment.Apparently, this voice line was not recorded and will be added at a later time.Very short, cliché story with zero gameplay. If you want to play an actual game or a branching narrative, this is definitely not for you.Poor English translation. If you aren't able to play this game in Chinese and read it at a reasonable level, consider whether or not you want to struggle reading through a jumbled mistranslated mess. I played the game twice, once in Chinese and once in English, and the level of detail and added nuance and fluency in the Chinese version versus the English version is pretty appalling.I translated/localized the Chinese version into English as a pet project! It should be going live soon. Once it does, relay all concerns to me :)This explains why it lists me as having an absurd number of hours spent (idling) in a 1.5 hour VN.Overall, I would say this game is7/108/10(increasing score because main menu bug was fixed, English translation is better, and I had time for the story to grow on me). Although the story was verypredictableandnot really that original, the payoff was stillvery satisying for the price(you could also argue the main payoff has nothing to do with the actual plot). This is a case where theshorter length makes it MORE worth itto buy the game; the author does not drag out the story, meaning you ""only"" have to spend less than 2USD on a one-and-so hour visual and aural experience.If you enjoy this story, OR want to try a (better and longer) kinetic novel, try Keinart's One Thousand Lies. It's a 9.5/10 for me and probably my favorite VN ever, across any language or place of origin.Other VN to check out:Sunrider - 6/10Steins;Gate - 9/10Her Tears Were My Light - 7/10That Cheap and Sacred Thing - 8/10"

76561198417633714,Recommended,653950,34762230,Posted: 5 September,all,BadShitInsanityJapanoGedoens,"2 Bucks for a little Kinetic VN, and for what I got, it was absolutly worth it's price!It's a little VN, you can read through it in one sitting. Which is a good thing if you just want to have a quick read.But let's discuss the ""Game"" itself:I really liked the artstyle. There aren't that many CG's but the few it has are beautiful. I really liked the character designs and the last CG is beautiful. Just on Point.The music matches most of the images on screen and overall, I like it alot. I'm normally playing VN's without sound but the tracks in here have hit a point.The Characters are also fine. I've seen that some Reviewers said that they're walking tropes and I get their point. But I like the way these tropes are integrated here. Our protagonist feels ""real"", the female leads feel real. At least to me.The Story is kinda obvious at a certain point. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was heartwarming. I didn't cry (which suprised me) but I felt genuinly happy at the end, as the conclusion is something we all have to face from time to time. And although it might seem a little too ""on the nose"", I appreciated the way it was presented.Overall it's a really nice VN, especially for it's price. It's short, yes. It might even be a little dull for some. But I think that you should read ""Your Smiley Beyond Twilight"" and just immerse yourself in the experience. And I mean, c'mon, two bucks? There's no excuse not to buy it!"
