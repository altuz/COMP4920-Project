For 10c from a coupon, I suppose it was a worthy comical experience. You wanna play this game for fun? Don't bother. I'm not going to recommend a game I like more, because i'm not a biased child who thinks this is♥♥♥♥♥♥and something else is godly. This is more of a laughing stock than a game."

The lack of any other gameplay other than shoot zombies is just too repititive, and the same sounds are used again and again. its a waste of money (even if it is only $1)Overrall, its just a terrible game that was made for a quick cash grab."

,Recommended,654850,34006575,Posted: 3 August,all,Nepeta Leijon,"For what the game is worth its a good game. At least in my opinion. I bought this game for me and my friend and we both have made quick progress. leveling is easy. Great game if you dont care about graphics and want to see how many zombies you could kill between you and a group of friends. A few things could help improve this game.1. Headshots2. more of an effect on zombies the better armor you have,3. more ammo drops4. more gamemodes.All in all a great way to spend some time and kill some zombies with friends"

,Recommended,654850,35211876,Posted: 25 September,all,Nomad,"Possibly the best installment out of the critically acclaimed ""Masked Shooter"" franchise.In this game you take on the role of a heavily armed pedestrian walking through downtown Los Angeles when suddenly disaster strikes and you are left alone with a horde of Kentucky Fried Poodles® and homeless black men.Pros :- A clear seperation of street and sidewalk. No more will you accidently step on the sidewalk, you have to make the jump.- This game has mirror support. For people playing this game by watching a mirror that is aimed at their monitors, all the signs in game have reversed text in place already, thus making it legible for you.- A true sandbox experience. This game gives you the option to play in a way that you see fit, by offering you the choice between standing still and moving, shooting and not shooting, winning and losing.- A giant memory leak to make sure your computer performs at it's best.Cons :- No downloadable content available.Final score : 10/10"

,Recommended,654850,33599827,Posted: 16 July,all,Ace Trainer Joey,"Masked Forces: Zombie Survival is a game about a man who can't die fighting through hordes of paper-mache monsters that have come to life to wreak havoc upon a post-modern society where tiny pizza shops sell clothes, tiny hotels sell clothes, tiny banks sell clothes, and tiny buildings either no doors and only windows, tiny doors and regular windows, or there's the secret door out of city limits (the map) which is normal person sized.  It touches upon many sensitive topics in an interesting, centerist view and invokes many questions from the player, like ""With all this money we're saving from our infinite reincarnation, should we spend our money on hiring better architects or putting rocket launchers in the street?""The gameplay itself is astounding, you can have incredible variety in your weaponry ranging from a $1000 minigun at player level 1 to aterribleshotgun for $2000 dollars at level 5. The game boasts a wide range of over 1 map, ranging from ""City"" to ""City That Is Dark"". The multiplayer is what takes the cake, you can team up with iconic characters from the Masked forces saga, like shooter2618, jose.gonzales.123, and rainbowskye0. All of the above is packaged with the game, and I'll hopefully be able to snag a copy of the Special Edition when it comes out, which will include every DLC and a Masked Shooter plushie.Overall,  I've nover played a game quite nearly as good as Masked Shooters: Most Certainly Not The First Game With Less Content And Guns Which Are Now A Little Bit Orange Edition. I highly reccomend buying this game for any friends who don't own it already, as it's incredibly cheap on Steam. Of course, if you want it cheaper, you can just play it in a browser.Jokes aside, only buy this game to laugh at it with a friend, it has ""The Room"" syndrome, where it's so bad that you get your money's worth in laughter."

,Recommended,654850,33667174,Posted: 20 July,all,Apoch Weiss | Apochs.net,"Depite what Jim Sterling says, this game is ok for the one dollar (US) price point. Now, I'm NOT saying it's good. I've seen mobile ports that work better than this. The controls are simple, and the experience system is basic but effective. Play, kill zombies, earn money and experience, an get a gift box every time you level up and the ability to unlock better weapons. Save up and get yourself some better armor, stronger weapon, and you're good to go.There are only two modes for this game: PvP and Survival, the latter being a total of ten waves that grow in difficulty the point of near impossible. These can be done off-line and on-line and, surprisingly, there were a few rooms open during my time with this game at the time of writing this. Unfortuanately, I doubt what community this has will last though.If you're bored and want a quick, casual experience, I wouldn't immediately rule this out given the price point and quality as I did find myself entertained for a little under two hours. It isn't really something you'll want to dive into alone though after a very short time. It reminded me a lot of when I would go to the local lan gaming arcade and throw down against friends in Counter Strike. Maybe that's why I found some joy in this fairly basic title, but if I was able to enjoy myself then chances are you'll manage to kill some time with it."

I played this for 2 hours and got every gun, every upgrade, level 32 and got all the armour. I also have every achievemt. It should be free because there's nothing to do past that.Pros:-Fun-Not bad graphics-It's cheap-Better graphics then MinecraftCons:-Not much content-Multiplayer sucks-Multiplayer lag-Not many achievements-Graphics aren't good for todays standards-Should be free-Others games are cheaper (even though it's cheap) and are better (Half-Life)So if you want a game to pass time, go ahead and get this. Otherwise there's nothing to do after level 30."

,Recommended,654850,33563762,Posted: 15 July,all,🅶🅻🅾🅲🅺,"I've waited so long for this game, the entire Grand Theft Auto franchise, Unchareted, The Last of Us, Elder Scrolls, combined. Can't compare to Masked Forces: Zombie Survial by Freeze Nova games.Let's begin with the maps, there are 2 maps that are massive and are completely different from each other in every way imaginable.MAP 1: It's big city with lots of buildings, signs, lights, trashcans, and trees, and it's light out.MAP 2: It's big city with lots of buildings, signs, lights, trashcans, and trees, and it's dark out.The weapons, oh boy, the weapons are so unique from the first game, definitely a step up, instead of having bland looking guns, you've now got all the same exact guns but now they've got a color on the side.All the character customization you loved in the past game is still in the this game, nothing has changed.Now you might thinking, ""Why would I consider paying any money at all for a game that seems to have been copied and pasted, literally, with the addition of a few new textures?"" Well because this game is better and it's completely different and will change the gaming industry forever because the gameplay is just so imerrsive."
