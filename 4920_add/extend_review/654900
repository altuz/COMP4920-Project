Also, great for just relaxing with some fun puzzles and nice relaxing soundtrack.  For the price, this game is a definite great find, a really good value, almost a steal."

But, I am a big fan of Zup and the ridiculous principle of this game, so I will continue to be a pigeon and therefore buy Qop.Qop ✔Qop 2 :skstopsign:Qop 3 :skstopsign:Qop 4 :skstopsign:Qop 0 :skstopsign:Qop 5 :skstopsign:"

76561198141107604,Recommended,654900,33687731,Posted: 20 July,all,History Nerd,"Qop is a short fun puzzle game where you must manuvere your square to another colored square in the level. There are 60 levels and some of them are very easy and go to fairly hard. The game is enjoyable to play and is satisfying to beat a level you have been stuck on or you beat one where you were trying to take a long, incorrect path while the right one was simple, easy, and right under your nose. It is also fun collecting all 256 steam achievements in the game. It took me 75 minutes to beat the game and I would say that it is worth your time and your dollar."

,Recommended,654900,34417903,Posted: 22 August,all,Safari Man,"Very clean and simple design. Quite demanding at the end. It requires a lot of luck while randomly smashing buttons or complicated planning when you try to play like it's meant to be played. Some of levels will seriously make your brain hurt.But let's not forget about the reason, why people play it. Easy achievements.Overall, the game is cheap, pretty and a lot of fun. For an hour."
76561198042400645,Recommended,654900,33884293,Posted: 29 July,all,Arkatar,"Good puzzle design, though I found too many levels, even some of the later ones, to be rather obvious.  None of them were ""insufferably difficult"", as mentioned in the ""About This Game"" section of the store page.One quirk that was quite annoying is that I'm playing on a TV set, and I couldn't find a way to reduce the size of the game window.  Used alt-enter to toggle fullscreen on and off, but that didn't help; the window remained the size of the screen."
,Not Recommended,654900,33979708,Posted: 2 August,all,Cherry Soup,"I will not give this game any discounts just because the game is cheap. I cannot recommend this game even for short relaxing experience by several reasons.1. It does not work well with multimonitor setup. It only runs on main screen and cannot be ran on secondary one. RIP my intentions to casually play it on my bed from secondary screen. To be fair, you CAN get it to render on secondary screen via Alt + Enter, but if screen have different rendering resolution, like in my case, you gonna have fun with disproportional rendering of the game.2. It's slow. Painfully slow. So slow in fact, that I had to use CE speedhack to make it at least a little bit playable. But because this game uses physics for completely unknown reason - with speedhack it have collision issues. I was unable to run it stable at more than 1.5 speed increase. At higher (and even sometimes on 1.5) speeds physics freak out and you often find yourself locked out of controls or rotators rotate you as if you entered it from another direction. I came here to think on the puzzles, not to watch slow animations of how I solve said puzzles.3. Four. Damn. Achievements. Per. Level. Seriously!? Giving an achievement for every level is already bad idea, but GODDAMN FOUR OF THEM!? It's very distracting and completely redundant.4. Overall puzzles are extremely easy and rarely levels had me to actually even start to think on what I'm doing, as most of them just solve themselves with very little thinking on my side, as I just move block in only possible next direction. Neither challenging or engaging. Boring.5. Visuals. A bunch of levels are very crowded and I personally had hard time understanding when the block will end up at because of visual overload. Often it ended up in death and level reset.Conclusion:Puzzles: 1/10. Boring, not engaging and insultingly easy;Visuals: 5/10. Problems with level readability;Audio: Not rated.Technical implementation: 3/10. Physics for simple animations? Really? Also make it even slower next time.Total: 3/10. Poor implementation, boring gameplay.Total according to prices: 5/10. Still won't recommend."

,Not Recommended,654900,33676279,Posted: 20 July,all,tadrinth,"This is extremely similar to Orbox, which seemed promising if rather derivative.  However, it's actually less polished than Orbox: the movement is *painfully slow*, there's no trail which shows how you got to your current position, and despite a minimalist art style, the levels themselves are not minimalist and contain extra unnecessary blocks.And Orbox and all its sequels are free.  Play those first, then buy this because you are not yet sated on that kind of puzzle, then return this because it feels like molasses by comparison."

,Not Recommended,654900,33621630,Posted: 17 July,all,blarg,"The game is essentially just the sliding block on ice puzzles you see in tons of RPGs and action adventure games, Pokemon and Zelda being the most prominent examples (it has a few mechanics that differentiate it later on with different types of blocks you can collide with, but at it's core it's still just a sliding block on ice puzzle).  That on it's own is enough to make it pretty uninteresting but combine that with the fact that the pure white background makes it difficult to actually judge if shots are lining up and you get a game that's pretty irritating to play.  Some sort of grid or even just light grey lines emanating from your piece could have easily fixed that but I suppose the demands of their minimalist aesthetic made that impossible.On top of the uninspired puzzles and the minimal aesthetic getting in the way of the actual gameplay, the game constantly showers you with achievements making it feel like one of those pieces of shovelware that just throws in achievements to draw in the people who just want to get a huge number of achievements as fast as they can to watch the numbers on their steam profile steadily rise.  An achievement for visiting the main menu, an achievement for starting the game up, two achievements every time you beat a level, one for beating the level and one for accessing the next level, it's obnoxious and whatever merit their minimalist aesthetic has is ruined by the constant achievement notifications popping up in the corner.It's not the worst game ever made or anything but I found it completely mindnumbing."
,Recommended,654900,35485981,Posted: 4 October,all,GCC,Nice minimalistic puzzle game. Gets decently challenging later on. The main draw of this game is the achievements you get to decorate your profile.
