Small map, very limited things to do, no real plot or goal, car physics are awful. The game feels very incomplete and unless the game gets updated a ton I don't see myself ever playing it again."

,Not Recommended,654990,33512075,Posted: 13 July,all,Tyclone,Well this game is meh. I can see some potential in it and there are some funny moments. That said though there just isnt enough here to warrent a purchase. I found myself wondering what to do over and over. The music isnt bad. the colors are good but I cant justify it cause of the lack of content in the game. If they added some goals I might feel different about it but as it stand I cant recommend this game :(Check out my video to see some gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnoCvl6C9mg

76561198080653744,Recommended,654990,33512111,Posted: 13 July,all,gabelolguy,"The game is hastily put together, terriable and the car physics are crap. However, the developer has only just released the game and can still work on fine tuning the bad aspects. So, to the game dev... Here are a few tips.-Make it easier to get money-Improve car physics-Add items that you can pick up around the town (Not just the ones purchasable at the store)-Add some better physics that allow for more detailed and realistic gameplay (Braking of windows, ect...)By all accounts this is an early access game and only time will tell if this was a one-off quick buck scheme or a fun game that will allow for hours of wacky slap-stick entertainment. I for one hope for the latter of the two possibilities. Game dev, make us proud!"

,Not Recommended,654990,33822998,Posted: 26 July,all,Xepherian,"In summary, I don’t recommend this game. This game masquerades as a sandbox simulator, but it’s about as flexible as raw spaghetti.Dude Simulator is a game that’s a life simulator, except you can probably only do about 10% of what you could in real life here. The game does let you get away with a little more though – I never thought I’d get away by beating people to death with my pet chicken, nor level exactly one building with grenades.The game seems like a rough draft to an actual simulator game and would actually get away with this efficiently if it was sold off as an Early Access Game. I can give you a complete overview of what you can do in this game:You can drink beer, get drunk, and pass out. If you do that however, you’re going to spend the next ten minutes having a terrible experience in game trying to do anything that requires some steady coordination.You can get money from dead people. Whether you kill them or someone else donkey-punches their fartboxes is up to you.You can kill people with your bare-hands, !&!@-fighting, or one of five weapons found in the game (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, knife, grenade). Environmental damage doesn’t exist.You can drive cars, but why the hell would you do that when the map is so small?There’s nothing else to pick up in this entire god damn village.You can pee on stuff.You can spit on stuff.You can run around town belching and flatulating, because this is exactly what your parents expected of you.You can get arrested. Who finds that fun exactly?If you’re willing to sell your hard-earned time for steam trading cards, this game has a few. After 1.8 hours, I didn’t get any. I have no idea how anybody can spend more than an hour in this game since you can do all of the above in about thirty minutes of game time.You get to feel buyer’s remorse.I had the most fun gathering a bunch of police officers and throwing a grenade into the crowd of them, but grenades are pretty expensive so I could only get away with that a couple of times. I also enjoyed shopping cart drifting, mainly because I can flip my character on their head, putting them out of their misery.I don’t recommend this game. Just get… any of the other simulators. “Get Shower With Your Dad Simulator 2015” or something.If you want to see first-hand what some of the gameplay looks like, you can see so here. As an added bonus, you get to listen to terrible jokes. All for free.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw_m1Vn-Wrk"
