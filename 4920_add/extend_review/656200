,Not Recommended,656200,32989836,Posted: 29 June,all,NinjaOfWar24,"I've been waiting for this game for a while, and was a little let down.The game doesn't look great, it was clearly made for a 720p monitor. The style is cool, but without 1080p intended graphics, it doesn't look nice.The english translation is a bit broken, I highly suggest hiring a translator.The gameplay is confusing, and the tutorial was barely helpful. It doesn't explain that you actually lose stats if you train 50% (which doesn't make a ton of sense).It doesn't explain how to recover physical and mental state, which is also confusing.All in all, I really wanted this game to be great upon release, but it being early access, I hope it can grow to what I want it to be. Good luck devs, and I beleive in you."
,Not Recommended,656200,32997516,Posted: 29 June,all,TomahawkingAsian,"I think that this game has a lot of potential, though with it being in Early Access I would recommend waiting off until it has more features and certainly more balancing. (MOBA perspective only)Pros:- Each player has statistics that will impact how they will play in lane and team fights- Micromanaging player's training intensity and recovery is pretty important- Training is pretty core, as it helps you focus on the core stats that you want to improveCons:- There is no in-match decision making, once you're in the match, you just have to wait til it's over- Laning phases are too stompy and easily devoured. You could lose first blood and this could end up with you being Lvl 1 as the enemy is nearing lvl 18 (Same goes if you get first blood)- Junglers don't gank as much when you put them on the Always setting for ganking- Players tend to overstay in lane even with less than 10% HP- Near the end game, players tend to just group up and run it down mid, and end up dying repeatedly at the enemy nexusThough the majority of these will be fixed or improved through out Early Access, I would recommend holding off from buying until it's more balanced"

76561198097432699,Recommended,656200,33542679,Posted: 14 July,all,xgaptoothx,the game has great potential but there are problems. I am giving this game a thumbs up for its potential not for current gameplay.  I hope the developer realises this game could be great and listens to reviewes.1. training does not seem to be helpfull as when i trained my players got worse instead of improving2. i played a total of 20 matches and lost every one of them i think its broke does not seem like you can win as i have seen other reviews say the same thing.3. oposing team players alway fesh while mine alwayse seem to be fatigued.4. does not seem like you can make any money in game as i went bankrupt before end of season paying salaries of 20000 to 50000 per player 250000 per month and making only 4000 per loss 20000 to 40000 per month. go bankrupt easily.
76561198141201307,Recommended,656200,33166922,Posted: 2 July,all,anbang2000,"I bought this game right when it was released. All the reason why I buy it is because it's new!This game is basically a manager sim, mostly football themed. This one is brand new because it's ESPORTS!!! There's no real goal, but the closest are: make lots of money, hire the best gamers, beat everyone, and upgrade everything....On a unrelated note,the community are mostly chinese players. The game is definitely ""Made in China"". The english language is just a translation. We all know that all the fake stuff mostly came from China. Just an extra information in case you need to make decision to buy this game....I didn't liked manager sim. I guess you should wait if this game gets any better. Can't tell if this game is good.I might update this review when the game is better."
,Recommended,656200,33021614,Posted: 29 June,all,morph113,"It's really fun to watch the MOBA matches and how close they are to the real thing. You will see tower dives, ganking, turtling in the own base, failed recalls and everything you can imagine. It honestly felt like watching a real MOBA match.Having played only 1 match so far and done the tutorial, the game has a good foundation. The UI is easy to understand and the graphics look clean. The mentioned matches very closely resemble what you would see in a real match. The tactical options are limited and cannot be changed during the game as far as I have seen.Outside of matches you can upgrade your building and individual rooms which all give different benefits. You can set up individual training plans for your players, which do cost quiet a bit money. Hire or fire players. Read email, sponsor offers etc. and check your schedule and ranking. Currently there isn't a whole lot to do in the game, but since the early access just released I'm sure it will change.The game shows a lot more promise already than ProGameManager. While watching the matches I really feel like watching a match in football manager. You are rooting for your team and when they make mistakes or make a great play it's really fun to watch.For anyone who isn't a die-hard tycoon/manager fan you might want to wait a little longer before purchasing the game. Anyone who is really into tycoons and MOBA's or competitive FPS like CSGO can already enjoy the game to some extent."
,Recommended,656200,34730326,Posted: 4 September,all,Moose,"After 12 hours of game play of both MOBA and FPS, I think buying this game was a well made decision. Even though the game definitely has its flaws (language and game play wise) it does look like the developers are giving it their best to make this game a success.Some Pros:- In my opinion a unique game.- A lot of replay ability.- Great for those who enjoy micromanaging. (player stats and training of these stats)- Many countries .- Watch your teams game and take tactical breaks to change strategy.Some Cons:- English translation isn't quite there / missing text.- Training doesn't always feel like its worth it. (It drains way to quick)- Tutorial is rather lacking, you really have to figure the game yourself.- AI can be quite stupid at times.This game is still in early access but for this price I think its worth it. It really depends on whether you want to invest in a game that isnt quite done yet or want to wait till a full release."
,Recommended,656200,34319274,Posted: 17 August,all,bush wookie(chad),"i think the game is really great and better than the other games that try to be video game managers, there is one problem with trying to recruit people there is no tutorial on how to do that and when i finally did figure out how to recruit them they always say no even if i give them the highest salary with the best bonuses and no penalties. it would be great to get a more indepth tutorial on how to get people to join your teams and thank you for reading this."

Actually the idea of the game concept is good. However, in MOBA, there is no way to check the enemy's favorite champs or there play and last games pick. Even my team as well. So it's hard to find the best method pick or ban So, hard to ban the champs for enemy key player's favorite or high winning rates of champion. Second, table's arrangement is hard to see what i want.Third, my players doesn't follow my stratege at all. They just push and die, push and die, and never group. No dragon fight, no baron fight, no gaking Jungle with same Jgling all the time. Also, still the language of English is weird. Also don't forget to turn on the spotify cuz there is only one bgm in the game."

,Recommended,656200,35415294,Posted: 2 October,all,Its_Brogan,Honestly really enjoy this game. Best of it's kind in my opinion. Could do with possible new maps with the FPS game modes instead of just Dust II. English isn't be best and their are a few bugs. Overall though it has a very good base and start to a promising game. Would love to possibly help with the community in the future. Definately would recommend though.

,Not Recommended,656200,33012473,Posted: 29 June,all,byis,"Basically, like everyone else is already saying;In it's current state this game is NOT worth buying, but you can clearly see potential in what they have tried to do. It plays much like the old Premier Manager games where you simulate through a lot of things. It's very simplified and you don't have to micromanage too much. Many systems in the game seem to work fine, but some major ones really need to be fixed, and I'd argue that those should have been fixed even before an Early Access release. Alas that's not something developers gives two ♥♥♥♥s about these days unfortunatly.I have only played the FPS portion of the game, but I assume the problems apply to both sides.What is broken is the:*shoddy grammar*crushing defeats you will suffer for the first like 30 games. (Every other team seem to be so far ahead of you in training that you will get the♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked out of you no matter what tactics you choose. I would seem more reasonable to place the player in like division 8 or something with teams of the same calibre and then play yourself up from there.)*unintuitive training system. (I just can't figure out how you should space your trainings if you have upcoming games... It seems insane that a player could become exhausted from 2 days of training and not be able to play a damn onlinegame on day 3. These are supposed to be trained Esport athletes that doesn't have real jobs on the side for ♥♥♥♥s sake.)*soundtrack that is like a cheesegrater to your brain after just a few minutes.*mediocre GUI. It's just not very well designed."

,Not Recommended,656200,33589806,Posted: 16 July,all,Saint Erectus,"I would recommend this game, but unfortunately I ultimately can't.  For the reason that I have not been able to play the game.  It boots up fine, but when you get into the tutorial which is lackluster it completely crashes on me.  I have tried different means of making the game run on my PC (w/windows 10), but to no avail.  I understand that it is an Early Access game, but not to the point of it not working completely.  I was highly interested in this game when I saw it on Steam.  As of right now I would say to wait until more work is done before buying just in case you or other people who purchased the game don't run into the same problems I am having."

76561198119952447,Recommended,656200,33259281,Posted: 4 July,all,rickypang2004,"Considering that the game is in a kinda open beta version, I would say the game is done well.Club management games is not a new thing but esports club is a real new topic for that sector. The game shows all the basic of a SLG and it is easy for you to spend hours on it reading the pattern and finish the game.I win the top league after 9 hrs try and error and I guess it is a normal speed. You may say that the game time is too short but well it is less than 9.9 USD and it is kinda an indie game - no complain.It would be great if the following updates would be made for the official release. I guess the team would have the idea in mind as well:1) Name - i can't stand for player names like epic sports.....It's kinda lazy.2) You have to mimic famous players in the game or there is no point trading ppl. e.g. Fakar, TripleLift, etc. Most of the player are esports fan and they wanna build teams around their favourite players.3) Name and demography of a player should not be editable - ppl trade player because of their age, nationality,etc (For instance, a US player would love to make a pure NA team even the stats is a bit weak. ).4) Training logic must be refined. It is not important for the game5) Player simulation logic must be refined. There is no need to train a potential player up now.6) Facilities logic must be refined as well.7) Game simulation - The win-lose logic is kinda straight-forward right now and you need to put more weights on secondary parameters to make it sexy - like team chemisty, nationality, AI, counters, Position, special skills, age, etc....Gonna be a huge task.8) player icon - should be editable with uploaded pics.9) player trading logic must be refined.etc etc etc.AGAIN don't make me wrong - Seems a lot of comment but the game is enjoyable with current build.Too many things to share but no time for typing - For any chance if the development team read this and are interested in getting more feedback from one of their customer, please let me know :)"
