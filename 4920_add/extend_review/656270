The developer has taken into liberty, his own game, so he gave it a perfect 10/10.Keep in mind that ALL of the achievements are ""You played for 1 second!"", and that there are 12322 of these achievements (yep, literally all of them are this). To translate, you'd have to idle in game for almost 3 and a half hours.https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/?_escaped_fragment_=/content/44826#!/content/44826Another game using the same exact scripts and assets goes through fire and ice to clear up the assets:http://store.steampowered.com/app/601280/Village_Story/""Now we will be afraid to completely finish the game""Hard to finish or even work on a game when you don't understand anything about it, huh?Thank you SidAlpha for your Asset Flipper episode:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvVHSE6gHs(and thank you Mutan1988 for warning players on the forum)As a bonus, I'll let you know that, even if you did try to play, the game will freeze at times and sometimes just not respond, so you have to idle."

,Not Recommended,656270,34128814,Posted: 9 August,all,Rattlesnake8,"This ""game"" is just an asset flip. The developer bought an asset pack and released it as is on steam. They didn't change or add anything. You can't even build troops so when the enemies attack you have nothing to defend against them. The devs released this solely to make money off people who want the easy achievements. It's disappointing they couldn't have actually done something to make the game playable so you could find some enjoyment for your money. If you pick this up you'll most likely find yourself watching youtube video's with the game running in the background for the achievements."

The high amount of achievements for this game is there so people can leave this game idle for above 2 hours of game time, which is above the requirement for Steam's refund rules."
,Not Recommended,656270,33927857,Posted: 31 July,all,iJetGemini,"[UPDATE: After reading a highly voted review and seeing  it is infact stolen,  burn any connections with this dev and hope he disappears]You see this would of actually been a good 63p game if it wasn't broke.I know I am talking about a super cheap game that was obviously just thrown out for achievements but let me explain why it's broken as I describe the game.TL:DR; Game is literally broken and they know it. DO NOT BUY.So the game is a little 8-bit game like Civilization or Banish. You make farms, woodcutting huts and stonecutting plots to of course gain material. Then make houses to increase the amount of workers for more farms etc. YOU HAVE TO MAKE 1 WOODCUTTING AND 1 FARM 1ST, OR YOU WON'T HAVE ENOUGH MATERIALS TO CARRY ON WITH ANYTHING IN THE GAME.You use that material to make more of those or you can make barracks, walls and gates for defense. Only thing is, to make troops you need to click on the barracks and select if you want to  dismantle, make a foot soldier or an archer, but clicking on any of them doesn't work. Clicking on ANY building you've made, you cannot dismantle for some reason.  So it's broken right from there. 2 of the 3 scenarios involve making soldiers which you can't.Even if you were able to make the soldiers, the only thing after that looks like to attack the enemy bases and that's it. So you are literally paying 63p to gather wood, stone and food until you are inevitably attacked which is a couple of minutes.Oh yeah and the super cheap price for 12,000 achievements which is for every second in game. so just under 4 hours of leaving it on as I am now. I played the game and then the achievements stopped appearing so for your safety just sit in the main menu.See if this game wasn't broke and had a bit more after the attacking or a bigger map, I would of actually paid more for this game, but unfortunately it was just released for the achievements which is a bummer and they don't even care. Do not buy this.Oh yeah, and the title buying it is called ""The girl in red""? what the heck is that about.If you wanted to see the whole game and it's problems. check it below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2SihqLd-OA&feature=youtu.be"

,Not Recommended,656270,34354249,Posted: 19 August,all,XJ9,"+12000 achievements for 3.3 hours spent in-game for half a dollar@-Half-working building simulator - building is working but you can't order troops from the barracks, you can't dismantle your buildings (there are buttons for that but they doesn't do anything) SO unless you are playing the PEACEFUL difficulty, when there are no enemies at all, you will die in 5 minutes, because you can't make any troops.By the way, for a strategy game, there are so many buildings WOW - woodcutter, stone-grinder and farm for resources, barrack for units you can't even produce, home for units amount, walls and gate.

,Not Recommended,656270,34172088,Posted: 11 August,all,ToiletROCK,"The concept is there. I can see it becoming a strategy game in future, but its current state is rather disappointing.The music played at the main menu isn't annoying; it's rather pleasant so that's good. But the music only plays when you're at the main menu. There is no music when you're playing the Scenarios and Skirmishes. Could improve on that. I set the sound level to maximum (10). And yet, they are still barely audible. Especially less so with the music blaring away at maximum volume too (10). The sounds also kinda don't make sense. The sound for placing buildings is a barely audible 'thud'. When peasants are working on the farm, there is completely no sound. The sound of a pickaxe hitting a rock sounds more like a pickaxe just snapped in half. The sound of an axe chopping a tree sounds more like a craftsman using his chipping tool on a delicate statue. And for some reason, you can only change the sound and music volume while at the main menu. You can't do it mid-game.The game also lacks a tutorial. You can basically build two houses at the start of the first scenario and you're left with a bunch of clueless peasants roaming around, jobless. You basically have to restart the level then. There's no guidance as to how to tackle the first few levels so maybe a tutorial can be added. Other than teaching you how to play the game and start a base, probably should add instructions as to how to select your workers, deselect them, select multiple entities, etc. Unless those features aren't coded in yet, I can't figure it out.The gameplay is rather bland at the moment. All you can really do is gather wood, stone and food and build the respective plots to farm those resources. There is a barracks but you can't build any troops yet so it's essentially useless. You can build stone walls but there's really no point since nothing will attack you. You can build gates to allow access through your stone walls but you can only line them horizontally. Rotating the gates don't allow you to make them face vertically so that's a few bugs there.The achievements. Pointless and redundant. Really, one achievement for every second you play the game for a total of 12,320 achievements. That's almost 3.5 hours of idling since you probably can only play for the first 10 minutes before you realise the game is very, very incomplete. And best of all, since you get the achievement pop-up once every second, you won't be able to see how many resources you got so far since it's permanently blocked by achievement pop-ups for the first 4 hours of the game, assuming you even play that long.At this stage, I'm not recommending getting it. Too little content and too many bugs left unfixed. Yes, it's early access but it's so unfinished you can barely call it a game. Perhaps wait a bit to see how it develops or you can just get it now for the easy achievements."

And all you have to do is leave the game running for about 3 hours or so and you've got every single one!! That's it! That makes the game worth the 99 cents alone.Unfortunately, once you've gotten all those achievements that's it, for an early access game it's very barren of content and buildings. If you want a survival game where you can build stuff, I'd recommend RimWorld, not this.But seriously 99 cents for 12,000 or so achievements is worth it trust me...Yes, I really am that low lol."
