So far it's just a revolver and an ak-47, and the old western revolver in the dueling mode as of 8/3/17. Overall for $2 it's not a bad game, but don't expect it to keep you busy for a super long time."

,Recommended,657200,34487711,Posted: 25 August,all,GlassFishMan csgoroll.com,"This is a very interesting game. I saw a twitch streamer play it and was intrigued, and at the low price of 2$ I decided to give it a try. First 2 or 3 hrs were very frustrating but very fun at the same time, after about 4 hrs I was able to get the controls down and shoot with accuracy, my only complaint is the bullet loading, it is very random whether you will successfully pick up the bullet. Very fun to play with my friend, though no inviting to games/lobby system, it is usually easy to get into a game with friends. I am very excited to see what new things the devs are working on, Hopefully new handguns. I would not recommend this game if you did not have a friend to play with but other than that good game that will give you hours of fun. 8/10"

The akm is significantly easier to actually load, but because you can only control one hand at a time, aiming it is a nightmareThe only positive thing about this game is that it taught me why the 2 hour steam refund policy exists"
