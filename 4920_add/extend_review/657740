,Not Recommended,657740,34285214,Posted: 16 August,all,Twistor,"Briefly:Ballistic Attackis a short, classic-style tower defense game, that I would give a mixed recommendation.It's weird. I enjoyed my time withBallistic Attack. Yet I was bored at the same time. Why is that? And could I really recommend the game after that?Ballistic Attackis a really basic tower defense. There is a single lane, and monsters charge towards a penthouse that looks like there might be a Halloween party in there.You put guns in their way, because they are not invited(Actually there's no story at all, but I liked to imagine that reason.)There's a diverse set of towers: single-shot, double-shot, heavy-shot, fast heavy-shot, super-fast heavy-shot... Actually they looked more diverse on the screen. There's over ten towers with increasing prices. Each one can be upgraded for increased fire rate, damage and range. No buff- nor debuff-towers exist.One thing that stroke funny was that there's no gradual unlocking of towers as the campaign progresses. Everything is there from the beginning.If you can afford it, that is.First you can't, because early mobs don't give enough cash for that. So, the progression is kind of emergent as later you get more cash.I was expecting air units at some point, because there is an anti-air cannon. But they never appeared, so I never built one. I think that cannon had a confusing name.Instead, once in the later levels (like halfway through the game's 10 levels) I could buy my first plasma turret.It was awesome.Plasma turret simply mows through everything. Nothing could get past it; not weak mobs, not heavily armoured giants - not even the fast slithering alligator things, because it simply shoots so fast....too awesome.Plasma turret is OP as hell. Every level would be won after you got the funds to build one. Then it became boring waiting until the level ended. Unfortunately, it basically ruined the game for me.End of lineAfterwards, I feel that because of the overpowered cannons, the game was just too easy, as well as short. Its ten levels lasted a mere hour.What could have saved it? Maybe additional challenges, e.g. through interesting achievements. The current achievements are basically earned by completing levels. Perhaps adding something like ""Beat the level X without building plasma turrets"" or ""Beat the level Y without turret upgrades"" could have helped it.Btw, it does not have Trading cards, despite Store page claiming so, at least not yet.It's a fine game for its price for an achievement hunter/completionist. It just isn't much anything else."

It may only be ten stages, but if the developer puts on the effort post-release, it can easily have additional levels added in to extend the life of it and, honestly, I hope YarGri does. It's also something anyone new to tower defense games can sharpen theit teeth with. Grab it while on sale, or even for the full launch price (ninety-nine cents US) if you get bored and just want something to unwind with."

,Recommended,657740,34458446,Posted: 24 August,all,Matrix,"Really fun Tower Defence game, but short though.There are only 10 levels and you can complete them in a good hour or so. It has everything you need in a TD game, but it lacks some depth and currency management. It's too easy at the end, because some towers are just too strong and some tactics are just too cheesy. A little bit of fine-tuning the tower costs and their damage outputs would really help to balance things out and make the whole experience even more fun.Overall, a pleasant, short indie TD game that I got for 10 cents."

You can buy and sell turrrets, upgrade them for better damage, fire-rate and range.Pretty easy, no skill needed. Any combination of turrets may work, as long as you have enough firepower in your defense.Perfect for completionists, if you have an hour or two to spare.pros:achievements, easy, cheapcons:no tradingcards available"

76561198327901000,Not Recommended,657740,34710848,Posted: 3 September,all,Ghostfriendly,"This is a very short and simple tower defence game which its most favourable reviewers couldn't call more than a quiet way to kill an hour or so. Alas, when the game has so little challenge that all enemies were simply being mowed down at spawn point for half that time, I can't even say that.Levels 7-10 need much tougher new enemies, the towers need to be weaker, shorter ranged, and trade range for speed or firing rate for damage more between different types. It would help this if range/damage/speed were individually upgraded rather than upgraded together, or if some non-specialised stats (eg firing rate for snipers) couldn't be upgraded. Gameplay would be much more thoughful if towers had less difference in price (the upgrade system strengthens towers throughout the game already) and more difference in specialised ability. Graphics and ideas for towers/enemies are rather good, but the gameplay just needs more work."
,Recommended,657740,35322896,Posted: 29 September,all,N71,"Incredibly simple and plain Tower Defence. Very short. 1 hour or less. Even for this cheap price, buy it only on sale.Lots of guns, but not much difference between them. No freezing gun, no money tower, nothing. Pure massacre. No strategy required.But it is cute. Nice graphics, nice music (oh, yeah!). Pure massacre.I vote up hoping for addon or something."
