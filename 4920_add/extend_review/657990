76561198157369294,Recommended,657990,34452764,Posted: 23 August,all,Nobody,"So far only played a small fraction of an hour just to try out. people that are saying its the best or its the worst, both are wrong. its only been out for a few days... VERY EARLY ALPHA. it cant be a bad game becuase well its barely a game so far. not trying to be a d*ck but its very early. i actually like it alot, yea it doesnt seam as fun as the minecraft version but, its a good investment, cuz think about it hes a one man show with help from a few people, its not a firaxis or major publisher and yes 10 dollars does seam alot, but your not just buying the game, your giving him a reason to do it, your supporting him, also have to say i love games that dont just have like 2 or 3 different types of ammo, i love ammo like 9 mil or 7.62x54r, i feal like instead of having 50 crates of one type of ammo with a bunch of different guns you need to choose ok if i take the ak i will need 7.62 ammo or do i want a 308. stuff like that. more survival aspect, maybe you could implement a really big map and have the north very cold and sometimes sudden blizards happen, and in the south have high temps. different cloths have unique thermic levels, so heavy cloths are good for north but not south cuz it will make you warmer. i know its a lot to ask, but these are just some things i want in a game and i can never find one game that has all of it. so maybe if i start with a game that just started, it might actually happen. keep it going, and dont stop making this game a steam master piece. i believe in you. sorry for any typos or gramatic incorections <------ not really seeing what im writing. ight thats all for me see ya. and yes im recommending it cuz i see potential.grrrr before i clicked post review, i was playing a little and the game is not responding. oh nevermind it got back on track. yea im really doing the review like this. i feal like a disapointment. im gana send the review now"

,Recommended,657990,34333101,Posted: 18 August,all,CatGamez,Great so far! I have had so much fun playing this game that is so well optimized!
,Recommended,657990,34360840,Posted: 19 August,all,ColbyG,First I would like to say that this game is worth the money. I see a lot of potential with this game being a standalone game and not a mod for minecraft. Ferullo has done a great job on this along with his team.
76561198102205052,Recommended,657990,34401282,Posted: 21 August,all,Sassy,"First of all, this is not an Unturned Clone. This game is a mod for Minecraft. Released 5 years ago, the mod was and still is to this day great, so I suggest try it out and then try this game out.This game right now is on beta / early access, this means that all the features are not in the game yet, but they will be added with future updates.This game is really cheap as it is, and I think it is worth your time and your money.It's not a bad game at the moment, it just needs content which will come with future updates.One last thing, they will be no Pay 2 Win elements, you buy the game and that's it.Hope you are going to have fun with this game and I will see you on the apocalypse."

76561198023545828,Recommended,657990,34385646,Posted: 20 August,all,Gen,"For those of you who just want gameplay, here's a video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmrlhM1RvCU----------Crafting Dead is a simple, yet surprisingly fun Voxel Zombie Survival. The gameplay is pretty well polished, and although there are still bugs, it's surprisingly fun. The ability to gather your own resources through chopping wood and picking berries in order to craft new items is cool and gives you something to do when things are slow.If you're looking for a fun game to just fool around in, then this game may be it. The game is in Early Access at the time of this review, so things may change, but I believe the game is worth $10 at this point."
,Recommended,657990,34801991,Posted: 7 September,all,Bushman4065,Good game i think its worth 10 dollars since its just in beta i think it will be a very good game i think there sould be bikes or cars maybe anways out of 10 i would go 7...
,Recommended,657990,34355058,Posted: 19 August,all,vu1ture77,"very fun, wish there was more players, hopefully all the content from the mod plus more makes it into the standalone. Also if this game does get super popular like what happened to cube world, please dont ditch the game"
,Recommended,657990,34348962,Posted: 19 August,all,Daryl,"While there is not a lot of content to the game right now, there are plenty of zombies and players to kill.  This will be a game to watch as it developed into one of the best Zombie Survivor games out there.It does still have the feel of the MC mod to it but is so much more visually polished, I can't wait to see what happens in the coming months.  The developer is highly active in the forums with the community taking suggestions and answering questions.The cons I have for this game are to be fixed in future patches and one has to remember this is an Early Access game so if you are looking to buy a finished product you might want to hold off."
,Recommended,657990,34354793,Posted: 19 August,all,Oxibot,"Great little game, never played the mod but this is a solid standalone title. Early days in beta, but I found minimal bugs, and the game mechanics for pretty solid for the stage it's at. Fun little game. Item spawns may need tweaking, I was pretty set after 30 mins, but it's a pretty decent start for this game. Looking forward to seeing more.Here's some gameplay:https://youtu.be/tlOBLlrF38I"

It is a good ""Evolution"" of the crafting dead minecraft mod and is very good. Congrats on F3rullo14 for making a very good ""sequal"".However, I feel more familiar with the mod so I will return to it. This just currently feels a bit too clunky and unfamiliar for me. Since I've played minecraft for 7 years or so, so the mod feels familiar.I will return in a few weeks and see how far it has come!"
76561198128424798,Recommended,657990,34339981,Posted: 18 August,all,snuffey20,"(Review Below)So for anybody who is unaware, this game used to be a modpack for minecraft. I played that modpack about 5 years ago. I even spent around 75$ on in game items. Since then so much has chenged to a point where they have made a new game entirely. I am extremely happy to see what it has become and hope it continues to grow.Pros: Simple Multiplayer      Single Player     Both offical and player made servers Updated frequentlyGreat community        Easy to get involved     Simple but deep gameplay      Cheap priceCons: Too much system requirements usage for a game this caliber       Little Audio     (currently) one mapNot so Impressive graphics     Little Purpose and DirectionOverall I enjoy this game and are sure that it will be updated in the future. I suggest buying it about a week after realase for bug fixes and a bigger playerbase."
,Recommended,657990,34355366,Posted: 19 August,all,[SG] GucciCarry,When I first tried this game I didnt think it'd be all that good but it actually turned out pretty nice. Def needs more features such as being able to build buildings and such but it is pretty nice overall! Doesn't really even have that many bugs in it. Easily rate this game 8/10.Heres a videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjgYNwqxNgs

,Recommended,657990,34339236,Posted: 18 August,all,Bromthymol Blue,"Awesome, great recreation of the Crafting Dead Mod, made by a great developer. Smooth, and fun gameplay. Very supportive and kind community on Discord. Worth buying"
,Not Recommended,657990,34334359,Posted: 18 August,all,Jklenk csgobounty.com,"Before we get started I would like to share that I have a lot of experience in the Mine Craft version of The Crafting Dead with thousands of hours on it. (This game is based off of the mod pack and has the same developer if you did not know this information)Price: The Price 9.99$ is not worth it for this game to be honest i suggest lowering the price to 0.99$ maybe even 1.99$User interface: The interface for new coming players is friendly, easy to learn and straightforward. Little amount but crucial bugs like inventory items disappearing, Not being able to pick stuff up at times, Inventory is ""filled"" with nothing at times requiring you to relog, crafting is easy simple and fast which is great. Can not see friends names or tags at a far(Needs to be within 5 blocks in order to do so) which makes no sense in fights or duels with zombies and the other players. The servers were just small and didn't hold a lot of people i say increase it from 16 to 30-50 players. Can NOT exit the game it crashes every time.Basic Movement Mechanics: Very buggy, gets stuck on corners of many blocks (even grass blocks while running and walking). Many ""windows"" that are much larger than the character itsself, you can not jump through(No glass windows just air by the way). Occasionally choppy and cluncky. I like that you can walk with your inventory open though.Gun Mechanics: First things first the bullet drop is inane in this game, shooting from about 100 blocks with an M4 made me aim up 3-5 whole blocks above the player to hit, Snipers can not reach as expected to. Which means increase the range a ton. Guns are unbalanced Rifles Kill in 3-4 Shots, Pistols 4-5. Pistols have a insane fire rate compared the rifles. I like how the bullets can stack and they weren't spread out between rounds like every other game, When testing the guns you could actually see your bullets just curve and drop which I like that you see the bullet but it makes you notice how bad the drop is. FINALLY NO HEADSHOTS?!?! if they are even in the game it's unnoticeable.Visual Appearance: Overall the game has little to no shading and texturing on blocks. The campsites are just overall beautiful and are visually appealing good job on that but everything else is ehh. The weapons are ok but when you look at the guns they are messy and very sloppy. Everything looks 100% better in the inventory and from afar then when in your hand.Overall: The game has so so so so much potential but not enough to keep me sitting here waiting for the next couple of patches. The price is high but if you have enough money to blow on an indie game have fun doing so. I suggest lowering the price the 99 cents to 5$ max. Many bugs and glitches when initially playing the game but there are ways around some. A lot of them are game ending like when you get stuck you need a friend to kill you and then you walk all the way back to the location. I do not recommend this game at the current state it is in needs many patches and fixes.Rating 3/10 Needs a lot of work before it goes positive in my mind and a Price change."
,Not Recommended,657990,34376070,Posted: 20 August,all,Damon,"I loved playing the Mod and was looking forward to this standalone.I think Minecraft is the perfect base as you may call it for a game of this type.in this state of development i have to admit that i would not recommend it for 10€.it has much potential and i will play it, if it has more content."
,Recommended,657990,34743709,Posted: 4 September,all,Jimmy,"I like it!Good visuals, decent amount of loot and good pace for progression. Menu's and ui can probably still be improved hopefully to be a bit more minimalistic in the future."

76561198098735512,Not Recommended,657990,34334158,Posted: 18 August,all,TidySprinkles,"The game does have potential but as is it isnt very good. Yes it just got released but there are some things that should probably have been put into play before actually launching the game, such as headshots, couple glitches like not being able to drink water at certain times and the overall clunkyness of the game. Again I understand that it was just released but they should have put more thougt into fixing or adding some stuff before it was launched. The price seems a bit too much since it isnt really worth a 10 dollars. If it was a dollar than I would highly recommend it or even 2 dollars at most. Now on to the actual gameplay. It was fun for a brief moment but then I ran into a couple of glitches such as zombies being able to hit through walls, invisible bleeding players, getting stuck on certain blocks when running or even when standing there I got stuck on some things (dont really know what it was). The art style of the game is okay but it could be improved greatly as it seems that the creator added more emphasis on the campfire(by far the prettiest thing I saw in the game) than he did of the actual world. The gun mechanics where pretty bad especially the bullet drop concidering your render distance was alot farther than the bullet could actually travel. The bullet would also drop so suddenly I felt like i needed to aim 5 blocks above the person just to hit him even if he was just a couple blocks away. The controls and movement felt a bit off and didnt feel as smooth as you'd hope especially since you cant even change the settings while in the middle of the actual game for some reason (it was literally just shaded off for some reason dont see the point in keeping it there) The map felt a bit too small suprising since it is a 2000x2000 wide map but since the characters could pretty much haul♥♥♥♥♥it felt like some people could just die and return back to where they died in a matter of seconds. There are also issues when playing with friends since most of the time I wasnt even able to tell if the person running at me was my friend or not even with coordination because their name would pop up like a block away or if I was in headbutting distance (not a game mechanic but would be pretty dope). The servers are too small only being able to foster 16 people which isnt so much in a zombie survival game. However there are a couple of positives. I did like how bullets where able to be stacked and some small minor things like only able to get drinkable water from pumps, I also liked how you had to heal via medical supplies instead of just food and water, however at the siame time I do feel like max water and food or close to that should heal the player in some way. The inv is handled pretty nicely although still a bit too clunky. All in all my final remarks are 3/10 it has potential and I do feel like the develepor should have postponed it just to add some final adjustments (like fixing the gun mechanics and adding headshots or something) as well as I disagree with the pricing of the game as well but If some people like it as is and still feel like playing it then have fun."

Badly optimIzed and barren servers, I can't see any reason to pay £7, perhaps if it was free then it would encourage more players but right now it's simply not worth it."

,Not Recommended,657990,34357440,Posted: 19 August,all,General Pain,"Honestly, I cant give this game a positive review. I know that it is early beta, but there are MAJOR issuses, not even being addressed by the developer. Hit registration - players have very funky / hard to hit hitboxes which makes pvp not fun. Zombies, this is a zombie game after all. where are they? I have played for the the time you can see above and have not seen a SINGLE ONE. Am I on the wrong server or something? I'm not sure. But from what I've seen, there is very little focus on actuall survival, and this game is only based on pvp, which as said earlier, is unplayed right now."

,Not Recommended,657990,34832649,Posted: 9 September,all,extraram.exe is not responding,"As a game currently in Early Access, I can understand that this isn't a complete project and there'll still be a lot more to add in the future in the form of new updates in content, but as of now this game isn't that interesting and doesn't offer a lot to do at this moment besides collect goods and weapons to survive. Even when playing online with others, the multiplayer functionality doesn't really change much besides the added interactions between other players. And, since this game takes inspirations from other online survival horror games involving guns, those player interactions don't end all that peacefully.For what the game's currently capable of providing, it does it well, but nothing I can say really worth continuing for now. I might give the game another chance later down the line when more's provided, such as being able to build bases when teaming up with other players, collecting what you have and stockpiling it, and then going onto raid others. But, as a game that's purely just on collecting the best gear and killing anything that attacks you, it gets repetitive and boring and doesn't feel like a game worth $10."
