It pays off to work together in lobbies (more raid souls) and the staff have continuously been fixing the game since release. They've detected and fixed multiple bugs with great haste within the last 10 hours since release. They are also nice people in-game whom talk about what they hoped for in the game and how they executed it. This game has a wonderful anti-cheat system that i've seen in a clicker game, and they keep trying to make the game more entertaining. At the moment they are still working on the windowed screen options and some small bugs, which I have no doubt will be fixed by the end of this week."
,Recommended,658160,34333675,Posted: 18 August,all,Lazlatin,"Ok lets start from the beginning. The game has a lot of features which are not so common like in other clicker games.1) Talent System2) A Class System3) Multiplayer features4) Incredible active Dev5) This is not an idle game!!!Ok now the long explanation:1) Every 50 Stages u beat u gain 1 talent point which can be spend for various bonuses like more crit chance, more damage etc. When u spend 5 points you can spend those points to unlock the second row of talents and the third row will be unlocked after 10 points spend.2) There are 6 classes so far which each on their own give unique group bonuses. Those can either stack with other party members who own the same class or the different classes build a supreme combination. ( Now there are 8 clases )3) Ok u can party up with 4 other players and build a farm group. In this group everyone kills their own raid bosses and each killed raid boss grants the party 1 raid soul. (Those are spent to increase ur stats and also let’s you buy an arrow which multiplies your damage)4) Well lets just say i have seen more content updates in the last 4 days than in other games ever....... Whenever someone encounters a bug it will be fixed within 10- 15mins since he is in chat or Discord almost all the time.He accepts suggestions for new features from players and asks his community for future plans. A rare thing these days!!!5) What do i mean when i say that this is not an idle game? Well u could basically play it as an idle game but from a scale from 1 -100 ur effectivity would be around 1% and active players will be so much stronger and faster. U have to manually collect tokens which can be spend for new classes , u have to prestige a lot ( rebirth in other games) and u have to prestige a lot to gain more power.Ok last but not least the game is still an early access title and there are a few bugs here and there. Which is not a real problem which i stated above. The content comes fast and the improvements in the last 5 days were incredible. So give the game a chance. Oh and there is no pay to win or pay to anything. The only time u will have to pay is to buy the game and enjoy ur time! The DLC is only there to support the dev. ( Which will provide you with a small bonus to start, nothing which couldn’t be gained really fast )"
,Recommended,658160,34657766,Posted: 1 September,all,Darktoad,ClickRaid is already decent in its Early Release testing.   Only $2 so pick it up if you like clicker idle games.  It has different layout and features than most other clickers so is worth playing for some clicker variety.
76561198037931205,Recommended,658160,33907100,Posted: 30 July,all,KyeTheShy,"Saw this when I was browsing the Early Access games. Was a little hesitant at first because most clicker games I play are FREE TO PLAY (with in game purchases) but for the £1.59 price tag I thought why not.Started playing this game and straight away liked how it played. I'm use to playing Clicker games so it was easy to get into.There is quite a bit you can do but still needs a lot of content added to compete with the other clicker games,at the moment you have your basic objective of getting as high up on the stages as you can, Prestige whenever it gets slow and repeat. In between that you have Quests which reward you with Boss souls, and Damage Bonus% which allows you to get higher in Stages.Boss souls are used for Artifacts which currently there are only 9 of those. Currently 15 heroes to purchase with XP which is like your gold from other Clicker games and only used on Heroes for now. Raid souls can be used to increase each Hero Defence and Power, Defence being a max of 90% and Power being unlimited.Competitions happen every 24 hours and I believe they last for 24 hours. They are fun to compete with others but they do need better rewards.Multiplayer is this game most fun part. Never seen it before and you see others moving their mouse pointers killing enemies and bosses trying to get further in stages, I'd also always recommend always joining someones room.The Developer is one of the best I've seen in a while. Listens to everyone and gets those bugs/glitches fixed at an incredible speed. Suggestion are not taken lightly and strongly listened too. If you have a good Idea it will probably be placed into the game.All in All, Very pleased with ClickRaid. Don't be put off by the buy-in price tag, it's the only money you will be spending. Others click games can have you spend £100's to get far if you don't wanna put time into it.TL;DR Great game, worth the price. Needs more content but is still Early Access. Dev listens and responds. Fun multiplayer with up to 4 friends or players. 10/10 recommend."

Love the fact that it is MP and that you have too work together with others to get anywhere in the game.  The dev is very active in game chat and discord and fixes bugs, etc when they happen. Also new features and content added regularly with hopefully lots more in the future. It's also cheap on the wallet. Give it a try."
,Recommended,658160,33843483,Posted: 27 July,all,😡,"Haven't played it that much but the concept of having highscores, competing as well as multiplayer/events based games definitely caught my attention. The developer seems to really be onboard of this game so hopefully there will be a lot of improvements/upgrades done in the next few days/weeks. Game is cheap - definitely no reason not to buy it."

76561198042913113,Recommended,658160,34973842,Posted: 15 September,all,caidicus,"The New King of the Clickers is Here.Move over, Clicker Heroes, there's a new kid in town.After what seems like eons, Clicker Heroes' supremacy in the clicker arena seems to finally have a worthy challenger.While ClickRaid isn't free like Clicker Heroes, it also doesn't have tons of micro-transactions. Granted, Clicker Heroes was never greedy about their micro transactions, but they were always there.ClickRaid offers two things to pay for, the base game and a DLC that makes your cursor shiny, as well as supports the dev. I think it also increases the odds of encountering Raid Bosses, which is a good thing.Personally, I hope the dev offers more DLC for the game, not micro transactions. More little knick-knacks to support the dev as well as pimp my cursor even further. Who knows.So what's the biggest difference between this one and all the other clickers?Hello? Is there anyone out there?Many clicker games are single player. Some of them do a little extra, Clicker Heroes has what is basically a message board that your guild can use, though it's extremely limited. Worse yet, messages are limited to one per 30 seconds or something like that. It makes having a conversation with the guildmates quite frustrating.ClickRaid has guilds AND a live chat, which is a core focus of the game itself. You can chat to the whole world, or you can chat to the party you're in.Did I forget to mention multiplayer is super important?The party system is really a server system. One person hosts, 4 others can join their game. Each time you encounter a Raid Boss, other players all receive Raid Souls, which are one of the games' upgrade points. Additionally, in later levels, there are classes which provide speed and damage bonuses, increased experience, increased souls, faster hero damage, etc. If you have 5 different classes in the same room, you'll find your bonuses get buffed to high heaven.This is awesome.Should you buy the game, though?If you're a clicker fan, as I am, then yes... yes you should. You should stop reading this and buy the game immediately. It's worth the very modest price of it and its ""Supporters"" DLC. You'll get thousands of hours out of it currently, and the dev is updating the game likecrazy.Seriously, stop reading this and buy the game, you're wasting time.Don't read this review anymore, you could already be up a few hundred levels by now.STOP READING THIS!!! GO PLAY!!! Goodness gracious, some peopes' children."

76561198379537503,Recommended,658160,34905094,Posted: 12 September,all,VenomSlayerX,Pro's- game constantly evolves lv1-75 is your first mark so u can start obtaining boss souls- 75-650 is your next goal farming speed runs .5 - 1sec battles prestige when it takes too long to kill to progress faster- 650 unlocks Class system and class buffs as soon as u hit 650 u can clear wave 800-1000 + in a good party.- 1000 > 3000 then becomes your next goal Multi Class system where u can use a main and a sub class for party buffs.- Competition is every other day with a 24 hour cooldown and gives you double rewards so your progress speed doubles- Players under lv650 still give people above 650 party buffs and as a new player you want a fully active party to progress- Each class will cost tokens to unlock then u can freely swap between them and each class has its own lvl progress and will not be lost when swapping between the classes so u can test and level them all if you see fit or to fill party gaps where a buff is needed to speed things up.- Right click to start auto attacking so you wont need that pesky old auto clicker =) and f5 with max buy setting to save you a lot of time rather than clicking all the upgrades.- finally if you play early access server once the game goes live your progress will be kept on early access so you can continue to test / progress on early access or choose to start fresh on the new server =D.For an idle click game i give this 5* i would never pay for an idle game but considering how cheap this one was at the time i figured worth a shot. The playtime can be endless it merely took me 2 days to obtain steam achievements at stage 3k i assume this will be updated and i plan to return to obtain new achievements.

,Recommended,658160,34084188,Posted: 7 August,all,Kurip,"After 60 or so hours played in this game I think I'm ready to write a review for Click Raid.I've always liked clicker games, but after a I lose interest in all of them - but with Click Raid's multiplayer it kept me drawn in because it didn't feel like I was in a solo journey - joining a server is as easy as it can get and there is a chat feature, so you can meet people and chat with them while grinding away.I think the biggest positive for me with this game is the open communication between the developer Slikey and the community in Click Raid through the use of the Discord server. It's really easy to present your suggestions there and get direct feedback from the community and the one man developer Slikey. This is the first Early Access game where the ""We want to take feedback from the community"" reason of going into Early Access is actually true. If you just take a glance at the change log you can see people's complaints and features are being swiftly implemented everyday which is what I like best about this game right now, every day there is something to look forward to.When compared to other games I've played where I've spent more than 10x the price of this game and the hours I've gotten fom them then Click Raid definitely wins the trophy in that regards. 2$'s spent in return for 60 hours of fun is a win in my book and I plan to continue playing this game for many hours more.If you're a fan of clicking games then this is something you should get and join all of us in the grind of upgrading your heroes, your clicky and collecting souls and artifacts to help you progress and help you land higher in the competition that runs frequently."
,Recommended,658160,34747556,Posted: 4 September,all,Kw,"This game is fantastic. If you like incrementals, buy it ASAP. It's only $2.Pros --Active developer. Message this guy on discord and he gets back to you in like 3 minutes.-Talent tree-Multiplayer that actually matters, meaning you will 100% always be better off in a party.-Class system-Complex currencies like Boss Souls, Raid Souls, and Tokens.Cons --The only one I can think of is that when you first open the game it looks like a Clicker Heroes clone, but once you get past the early game, it transforms into a completely unique game."

Half of the game's popoulation is afk it seems.When you have rooms called ""afk farming"" because you get currency from other players being active without contributing at all, something's wrong with the game. Especially when it's advertised as competitive and active. In this game you can be all of that while sleeping (there are currently 5 sleeping servers, sometimes more) because others play for you and you just leech. Yay.Other than that it's ok, I guess. Nothing special, because everything special is purely on paper."

A much more 'active' focus on the game makes it feel like you're always doing something.Compared to Forgotten Realms, the Idle Champs knock-off, I find this game to be more engaged.(I only mention Forgotten Realms since they both have community chat.  ClickRaid is much more MP focused with the party system)Best EA game Ive spent money on so far."
