,Recommended,658260,35225317,Posted: 26 September,all,Eucliwood,"Despite of the news you heard about the bad port, the game runs very smoothly and you are able to config it to run at higher resolution from the setting file (I am running at 1080p with this).Character design looks awesome and unique, with beautiful and solid art style from Kishida Meru and his team. Moreover, Gust, as usual, has delivered really good soundtracks.Animation is fine, not at top-notch but stays acceptable as it is similar to other Gust games such as Atelier series or Nights of Azure.Battle system is classic turn-based system, with some enhancements such as using skills to ""knock-back"" your opponent's turn to 1 turn later.Story, as other Gust's games, is enjoyable and relaxing.To conclude, BLUE REFLECTION is a good JRPG, and definitely not a bad port as from what were mentioned. You should give it a try!8.5/10"
,Recommended,658260,35264809,Posted: 28 September,all,federated state of trollnesia,"I will reccomend this game with a few caveats:1. You have to like turn based RPGs2. You have to like the Mahou Shoujo/""Magical Girl"" aesthetic (Sailor Moon, Madoka, etc.)3. You have to like gratuitous Yuri/Lesbian overtonesThe game's strengths are its clean UI, its simple but strategic battle system, and its faithful adaptation of a tonal ""magical girl"" story. You can think of this game as a ""low budget Persona 3/4/"", essentially.Where the game falters, and prevents itself from becoming truly ""great"", are in how its ""dungeons"" are very weakly designed with few motivations for exploration and continued combat, its poor in-game camera, and its lacking difficulty (playing the game on ""hard"" helps, barely).Let's also not forget the ridiculous $80 season pass this game has launched with. And the $53 price tag. The publisher clearly has no idea what it's doing with PC games, especially since I only heard about this game the day before launch.For $15 to $20, this game is a ""steal"" - you aren't going to find a mahou shoujo RPG in English anywhere else, and if you are onboard with my three caveats above, you should love this game.I'd like to see more games like these brought into English, and the game genuinely looked unique, which is why I was comfortable paying close to full price for it. It's not Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, its battle system is trying to do something different, and I think it mostly works. Plus, the more personal narrative this game offers is something I prefer for a game to have, so I was able to justify paying way above what this game is honestly worth. This is a game to buy when it's really on sale.This is a budget jRPG trying to do something different so it still deserves props for that.Now, with that all out of the way, I do have to admonish the game for...Well, it's to be expected, right? A young female character NOT being sexualized in any manner would surprise me more than anything. And the ridiculous amount of lesbian overtones in this game is borderline funny and not offensive. The fact you can go on DATES with your female classmates really takes the cake for me and bridges the comparison to Persona 3/4/5 further.But was it really necessary to give us bath scenes? Scenes where our protagonist walks in the rain, so her bra can bleed through her blouse? Are details like that really necessary? It's a little creepy, or at least it hurts the serious tone the story tries to take in places. The story here is something you can take mildly seriously, at least for a mahou shoujo, and some of the oversexualization here really undermines that. I mean, mahou shoujo are sexual enough without the additional stuff here, just look at those costumes... I wish they'd exercised a little more restraint, and kept the fan service to a more sporadic level. Instead, it's literally everywhere. But this is an East vs West audience expectation thing. This game was clearly made for Japan, and I'm glad we got a localization of it. That nothing here was censored is great.If you can handle everything I've described, I strongly reccomend this; it's a unique game."

,Recommended,658260,35234093,Posted: 26 September,all,Geoff,"I thought KT were up to their old tricks again after hearing about the 720p fiasco shortly before release but as I gathered more information I became more interested in the details of what's going on. I'm going to try to focus on specifics here since other people have already mentioned stuff like editing the ini file (in My Documents, KoeiTecmo folder) to bump resolution and possibly enable AA though I haven't tried the latter through the ini yet.To start off with a tl;dr: This is a decent port that is most definitely NOT the Vita version, which that version has much of its visual effects cut.If you want to see screenshot comparisons between PC and PS4, there is a Steam Discussion thread made for this: ""PC vs PS4 comparison screenshots""I played through the first hour or so on PC while directly referencing a video of the game running on PS4 (Youtube ""Blue Reflection Gameplay Longplay"", video ID: X4J4iZTf1-g) and will comment on graphics with timecodes below (this overlaps with where the screenshots comparisons mentioned above cover but a bit more):- Bloom is present on both (3:05, 4:33, 7:52 for some reason more visible on PS4)- Depth of Field is present (togglable option on PC)- Shadow bugs are present in both but are at times slightly to significantly more visible in PC (5:48 hallway walking, the shadows under the windows shifting as well as some aliasing on the windows to the classrooms which are much more visible on PC, 24:30)- Shadow LOD popping present on both- Stair railing shadow map aliasing much more visible on PS4 than PC (7:29)- In ONE case I saw shadows missing on PC that are present in PS4 (12:04 and visible in one of the discussion screenshot comparisons)- It should be noted in that case there are some severe issues with shadow LOD on the PS4 anyway as they disappear in horizontal strips as the camera moves.- Otherwise every shadow that I've noted match between the platforms, including character dynamic shadows (53:10), self shadows (13:00, subtle), and background dynamic shadows (17:10)- The small outline around characters looks worse with PS4 though I suspect this is something that looks better as rendering res scales (37:55)- Generally texture quality seems to be equal on both platformsThis game doesn't have Borderless Windowed though seemingly works flawlessly with BorderlessGaming. Note that if you launch as Windowed at full monitor res it may require some finagling to actually force the game to be visible as it launches in a strange non-display state. In my case with multiple monitors it appeared on my higher resolution monitor and I had to use BG to fullscreen it, then remove the fullscreen to make it visible. From there, I simply dragged it into the correct monitor and re-fullscreened it. Single monitor users can likely just immediately use BG to fullscreen.The game runs smoothly at 60 fps, this seems to be higher than the PS4, though that may just be an issue of referencing from Youtube rather than the actual console. From what I can see it seems like the 720p 2D assets referenced were mostly pre-rendered video (to save download size on a purely digital platform I suspect), tutorial/encyclopedia screenshots, and possibly some of the UI icons.That all said, other people are reporting the usual gamut of issues such as instability. While I have not experienced this myself it isn't an uncommon occurrence so I can't say definitively that this port doesn't have major issues for everyone, but so far as I am able to tell it seems above average for KT, especially if we can get a few patches for people who are experiencing stability issues.Edit: After just over 2 hours, I did run into a crash while transitioning areas right after completing a mission so holding for a patch does def seem prudent, save oftenEdit2: On 10/5, there was a patch that boosted the 2d assets to 1080p res as well as a stability fix but I can't currently personally confirm the latter."
,Recommended,658260,35233337,Posted: 26 September,all,Mia,"I used to wonder what ""bad PC port"" meant. Now I understand! It's like running a PS4 emulator on your PC. A really good one. But you can tell that it isn't quite doing things the native PC way, and if you're used to emulators, you know it means that you'll only run it about 40% as good as the source platform. I have a GTX1080 and I wouldn't have expected it to run well on anything slower if it was that kind of port, and I don't think it's necessarily the developers' fault, if they started making the game without knowing they'd port it someday then they might not have chosen a viable engine option from the get-go. (It runs fine around 70FPS at 8K for me though (Yes, 8K), plus a bunch of manual antialiasing options in the NVIDIA driver.)With that nonsense out of the way, this is quite a unique game despite looking generic in the dungeon screenshots. I'm sure it looks like every other Atelier/Neptunia/etc game to you if you're a little jaded about these kinds of RPGs. But it has such a slow gentle pace that you might become surprsied. It's a pretty straight riff on the Persona series, except without all that jazz and rock and splashes of color making it extra cool and intense. Instead it's a very ""calm"" game, the other kind of cool - soft and low intensity and gently flowing. You glide between talking to your female classmates, getting to know them better, all to relaxing ambient music such as you might hear in Madoka, and every now and then you warp into a special area to battle demons and recover lost pieces of their souls.It's a pretty standard anime plot, including the part about Madoka-esque demons taking over the world while everyone except a few girls scattered about the world are blissfully unaware. Instead of a demon fox handing out the contracts though, two of your classmates who look like twins and seem to know everything that's going on (and both look like they want to cuddle you to sleep), slowly dole out magic rings to you and your friends so that you can join forces and share magic and awareness of this alternate part of the world's events.This game is CUTE. You have to know that and love that if anything is to seem extraordinary to you. The problems the characters face are just plain ""aww, shucks"" adorable, like someone who is afraid to be herself because she's too used to listening to what she's told to do. It feels good to her, but she wants to try expanding and feeling good about herself from the inside out, and you are the one to help her realize this. That's one of the least touching stories, really. I played the Japanese version before and it was definitely something that I couldn't wait to share with my English-speaking friends when/if it came out. (And it not only did, it did on PC! Sort of...)I still haven't gotten my controller working with this dumb butt of a port, but it was an opportunity to learn about Steam's built-in controller support and force the game to work with my controller anyway. There's lots of stupid things, like having to edit ini files to change your resolution reliably. But I think people are forgetting how amazing it is that just a year or two ago, PS3/PS4 ports were considered insane or impossible and everyone on forums and such insisted that the ones that weren't optimized for PC would be completely 100% unplayable. This is not unplayable. This is just... rough around the edges, early-alpha emulator style playable. If you really really want to play this game on PC and have one you spent more than $500 on in the last two years, it'll probably be fine, maybe not silky smooth but who cares.I definitely give this a recommend for the happy adorable thing it is. And anyone who wants it to be perfect, well I'm sorry for it not going well and I hope you can troubleshoot the game enough to be able to see what a fun time you could have anyway. But seriously, if you've been shopping for a straight-shot yuri nuzzles simulator for any length of time, I imagine you might not care about little hitches like those."
76561198016703284,Recommended,658260,35229888,Posted: 26 September,all,BlubberNuggetz,"A beautiful, slightly melancholic jrpg. The overall plot follows a young girl named hinako who is dealing with the loss of her dream to be a ballet dancer due to a knee injury. After recovering from the injury she begins school where she encounters two sisters who give her the ability of a ""Reflector"" in order to fight demons in humanities collective unconscious. The game is somewhat similar in theme to persona, but rather than fight with the power of your ""other self"" you fight as a magical girl anime type character and become stronger through fragments of emotion you receive. Now then, onto gameplay, at its core is a fairly basic turn based rpg with a distinct leveling system. Rather than level up through fights you level by gaining fragments of emotion from ""Common"" and using them to increase stats, which in turn unlocks skills. You get these by resolving issues for other characters and through crafting them. Its a simple system, but it works well and deciding which stst to up can be difficult. Exploration is bare bones and doesn't feel wholly necessary outside of gathering crafting items. Overall tje gameplay falls into the average jrpg tier, nothing top notch but solid enough to stay interesting. The story is where the game truly shines, the plot is melancholic yet uplifting and the light, almost watercolor, color scheme really helps set the feeling of it all. Game is fairly short, but worth the money for old fashioned jrpg fans or fans of persona. Would love yo see a sequel/similar game from the developers with more content. All in all I give it a solid 8/10."

With some adjustments to the computers graphics  console you can tell your graphics card to override the games own graphics increasing the quality of the game by quite a bit.This is an interesting little game and while I would love to see Madoka Magica Portable be brought over the West I doubt that is happening any time soon so Blue Reflection is the Magical Girl genre game we got and with the power of love, transformation sequences and frilly outfits I feel this game excels at being a stereotypical Magical Girl game.I feel this game is going to be a love it or hate it one and more so than the developers other Atelier games."

I am running the game in 4k with no issues other than a rather mediocre framerate performance for some scenes.  Use fullscreen and not windowed mode or the resolution will not be correct.You can break the 30/60 fps locks easily with Nvidia control panel program settings by forcing fast vsync or no vsync and you can also enhance the anistropic filtering this way.These are easy tweaks.The UI and all engine rendered graphics look crisp and very nice.  The various rooms in the school are filled with many objects and they look perfectly sharp in 4k without any low quality textures evident.Here are some screenshots:https://imgur.com/a/vGESWIn particular note how sharp and clear the text is on these signs despite how small they are:https://i.imgur.com/fVAy41p.jpgAlso, the UI looks fine:https://i.imgur.com/27TLhDG.pngThe game itself is set in an all girls school.

Consider upgrading from a two-slot toaster to a four-slot toaster if your system can't run this game well.Looks great, plays great. Hard feels like the ""appropriate"" difficulty if you want to be challenged at all.Only real complaint I have is with the occasional prerendered cutscenes. They've been encoded with a bitrate way too low for the amount of action they're intending to show in them, so they end up looking pretty blocky."

I already knew the game was more story driven than gameplay-wise with really complex combat system. You can do alot of things in the school, interact with people (although a little nitpick I have is that even when you progress in the chapters, you'll still see the same dialogue of alot of NPCs, but I don't know if later on the game they change that) and do side-missions.The leveling system is different than your traditional JRPG, instead of grinding by killing monsters you level up here by completing quests, so you don't have to worry about grinding.The soundtrack it's top notch and my favorite part of the game, each song really fits well in every part of the game, and they also added a playlist on your phone so you can hear you fav tracks when using the in-game phoneAll in all I'm having a great experience with the game, the story might be a little generic but it can still captivate you, and it's not a bad port, could have been better, but it's good, maybe a 7/10 portWith still a lot to discover in this game, I'm rating it with an 7.5/10 that may rise up to an 8.5/10 when I finish it"

I didn't have to fiddle with any settings in the documents folder to play 1080p. Gameplay is subpar, but the character writing is interesting and fun. The fighting actions from the turn-based combat are fun to watch and the general aesthetics are spectacular.I actually suggest people tune the difficulty to hard now that I'm two hours in. I've been playing on Normal, and it's been a little too simple. The fact that you have to build your characters doesn't feel like it has any impact with how easy encounters are (given that I've only had like a total of 20 enemy encounters), so I imagine the extra challenge will be enjoyable."

Though there is one thing, that I noticed, frame drops and the weirdest points, where it makes no sense.Game also seems to sometimes slow down in gameplay, though that might be my computers fault, since it isnt the best. It definitly does have performance problems though and it isnt just this PC version, since the PS4 version has those problems too.Too me it just seems like this game is overall badly optimized across all platforms and something, that could potentially even be changed with a patch, though I am not sure KT is going to do anything about that. I havent played the JP version, nor have I read up about potential problems in it, so I dont know if those were present there too.Overall the game can still be enjoyed even with those problems, so I can only hope to have some performance fixes soon, so we can all enjoy this game to its fullest."

I cannot personally confirm yet whether this works or not but it has been reported to work so I'm changing the review now. I intend to play the game again from the start to if there was other consistent crashing issues at other places as well. If the patch didn't resolve the consistent crashing issues, you can try to do thetemp fixI mentioned beforeI really enjoyed the game. The story is rather short as expected of a hybrid between VN and RPG. However the graphics are excellent. It's probably the best graphics I've seen out of Gust games. The overall performance of the game is also quite good. No stuttering or anything. There has been report of random crashes here and there but personally I didn't experience that. All in all, I think this is a good port. Better thanAtelier FirisorAtelier Sophiein term of performance and definitely better graphics than those two games.However there's a game breaking bug in chapter 7, where the game always crashes no matter what you do. So pretty much nothing can be done for now until a fix is found and implemented.There are also similar crashes in side missions that happened in later magma map. (Seems to be resolved by the recent patch, will delete this when I personally confirm it was indeed fixed)."

Works and looks great in 4k so far save for it actually giving me some frame dips here and there. So while it could use some optimization, it looks and feels like a solid port. Will update review once I actually progress further."

In my region the game costs more than zelda and its DLC added together. I didn't believe the community's review and wasted my precious time downloading and playing this crap.

,Recommended,658260,35248667,Posted: 27 September,all,cldw92,"POST-COMPLETION REVIEWPros:+ Cute waifus+ God tier artwork (all praise Kishida Mel)+ Interesting fragment / character growth system (unfortunately rendered meaningless by difficulty level of game)+ The OST is pretty epic. It lacks variety.. but the boss fight themes are pretty hype (as with all GUST games)+ Despite my criticisms below, there's a lot to be said about the main character's growth in this story. Watching Hinako change over the course of the story is pretty heartwarming.Cons:- Optimisation is meh (gotta use borderless gaming to play in fullscreen windowed, forced to mess with .ini files / resharders etc)- Interesting combat system bogged down by terrible difficult balancing (unfortunately combat is WAY too easy, especially after you get time warp enemies never get a turn, ever)- Mediocre gameplay, I was really disappointed with the zones. Only 4 of them, really?- Also the bosses, really? The first time was epic, then they started recycling them...- Genuinely melancholic storyline, which is kinda ruined by terrible pacing. Honestly I felt the whole ""invite out your friend"" mechanic got really old very, very quickly, and the small sub events weren't exactly the most well written or entertaining.- Side character development is hit and miss. Ako/Mao/Sarasa/Riko were pretty interesting to me... some storylines like Sanae/Yuri felt like they were forced in to just to tick checkboxes. On the whole, it's pretty bad. At the end of character storyquests you're forced to fight generic mobs. We couldn't have unique bosses for those, really?- Fanservice can be a bit too intrusive at some times- Translations aren't the most accurate at times (lost nuances + spelling mistakes + mistranslations)Conclusion:6/10It's a pretty nice stress free gaming experience with cute waifus. The first few hours of the game are pretty promising, with an interesting battle and growth system. The repetitiveness of the game is stretched out meaninglessly for absolutely no reason. If anything, this game would have been made better by being shorter and more story focused. Should have done away with the generic heart meter grinding and fetch quests and actually written more event storylines to develop the side characters further. Would have been better if it tried harder to be a VN and had less combat, given how poorly that aspect of the game was taken care of.TLDR: BUY IF ON DISCOUNT-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OLD REVIEWGame is broken - see cons below (Has been fixed)Pros:- Cute waifus- God tier artwork (all praise Kishida Mel)- Genuinely melancholic storyline carried out with SOME subtlety (i'm only on chapter 6)- Interesting combat system (unfortunately combat is too easy, even on hard for this to shine)- Interesting fragment / character growth system (unfortunately rendered meaningless by difficulty level of game)Cons:- Optimisation is meh (gotta use borderless gaming to play in fullscreen windowed, forced to mess with .ini files / resharders etc)- Gameplay is way undertuned- Fanservice can be a bit too intrusive at some times- Translations aren't the most accurate at times (lost nuances + spelling mistakes + mistranslations)- MOST IMPORTANTLY, the game crashes in the Anger/Management zone after chapter 5 with no known fix or cause as of yet - This has been fixedHonestly the game is a 7.5/10 for me, but because I basically can't progress past chapter 6 (story forces you into Anger zone in 7) there is no point in buying, or playing this until they fix it for now. Will edit my review once game is fixed."
,Recommended,658260,35325138,Posted: 29 September,all,Shad0w1and,"Changed to Positive because bug fixed.=====About graphics=====According to review, in general, the rendering is about the same as PS4, but the video is re-encoded and the quality is worse than PS4 (but still 1080P). However, you can set your driver with 16xAF to get an even better texture rendering than PS4. So I would say if you are considering the graphics quality, it is about the same as PS4 overall. (I have no idea why someone saying its 720P on PC, it is surely a lie)=====About your GPU=====In order to play this at 1080P@60FPS, you need at least a GTX1080. You will experience some frame drop if you are using GTX980(report by others) and GTX1070(tested by my roommate) and Fury Nano(tested by me). 1080Ti(tested by me) will be more than enough to handle a static 60FPS with only 65% GPU Utilization. GTX960(tested by me) is almost not playable at 1080P but due to its a turn-based RPG, you can still play it with about 20FPS(or even lower).=====Game itself=====I guess if you watched the video and screenshots from the description and like them, you will like this game. The game design itself is not great but it is fun enough to make you love your waifu.-""Is this game good?""-""It's lovely!""-""Is this game fun to play?""-""My waifu is beautiful!""That explained it well I guess.=====Hint=====Do not push progress too fast, its relatively short. I recommand focus on improve your relationship with others. Otherwise you will finish the game in 16 hours."
