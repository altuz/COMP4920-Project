,Recommended,658980,35398170,Posted: 1 October,all,Vildhjarta,"Just going to get to the point, I know this is EA, I'm keeping that in mind. (P.S I like this game a lot and hope it gets good updates)1. A lot of things to craft (Armor,Weapons,Potions,Dyes,structures,etc...)2. You can build houses, or even a castle3. Combat is a little wonky imo, but not broken.4. There is loot, You can find stuff almost anywhere, but most of time it's nothing good, and there is never really anything in chests, or anything amazing rather. (Assuming most people would think a chest would have something nice in it compared to a ruck sack or barrel).5.There are NPC's, but, Most of them are useless, and do nothing (I'm sure that will change in the future).6. There are only a handful of quests, but I do like that there are quests, and hope there to be more.7. Landscape is pretty bare (and broken in a few spots)8.Cities, and villages feel kind of dead since there is nothing to do other than loot everything.I will change this as time goes on, but I have high hopes for this game, and really want to see this get well taken care of.If you're looking for a full game, I advise you not to get it, but if you want to check it out, and support the devs, I suggest getting it."
,Recommended,658980,35283736,Posted: 28 September,all,Ghost,"I definitely recommend this game. All the negative reviews I've seen have been either opinions or complaints about bugs (from an early access game the first week after it is released out of closed *alpha*.)Of course this game definitely has its share of bugs. Sometimes you can't place things on spots where the object is green (this is usually fixed for me by pressing E and then clicking.), sometimes animals just stand there while you're attacking them. Sometimes something in your inventory will bug and you can't remove it for a bit.But to me, these are all minor bugs. They are not gamebreaking. Combat is not difficult. Combat requires patience, it requires you to block, to wait for your enemy to make a  move and strike when they are vunerable. You cannot just slash willy nilly at something and expect it to die (well, you can, but you will very likely die!) in the 10 hours I played the game, I was attacked by plenty wolves, yet I have not died once. The closest I came to dying was when I ate a Snowberry and it poisoned me and I couldn't figure out the recipe for medicine!The graphics to me are absolutely stunning, I have 8GB of ram and play on the max settings and I occassionally do stutter in the large cities (which is understandable, considering I'm running at the recommended amount). I love seeing the sun shine through the trees.Building is very rust like and very easy to use and understand. You can make all sorts of structures! I urge people to be creative with building shapes (rather than making just squares!) Decorating the insides of the houses is very cute as well.If you get bored of gathering, there are NPC quests you can do! If you get bored of questing, go explore the world!All in all, this is a great game with amazing potential. The developers are friendly and will happily answer questions. They appreciate constructive feedback. It definitely is worth a try - especially if you enjoy viking culture, if you enjoy Rust, or any game similar. At the moment, there is plenty to do - and I'm so excited to be able to be here for the journey! I'm very, very excited to see what is to come. Horses, farming, and even more quests!"

My only issue regarding gameplay was the lack of population, building is like ARKs with a similar feeling to Rust, resource collection is fun but not exactly the greatest, you can loot, and craft everything you need. the map looks nice and is immersive, could use some QoL improvements regarding the UI notably being able to see where your base/spawn point is located. overall i recommend this game. really please buy it so i can pvp ;)"
,Recommended,658980,35255978,Posted: 27 September,all,F1R3FLY,"A solid start to what looks to be a great game in the making.Albeit a short review, I would describe the game as a Viking mmo Rust-like game (survival with base building). Although there are bugs, the game is playable for me (gtx970, i5-6500 CPU, 16GB RAM). I am excited to see how the quest system develops. I like playing games in a ""living"" universe.Things still need to be worked on but that's to be expected from early access. The Devs appear to love their game and readily support it. They try to fix NB issues quickly. They also seem open to feedback, which is great. Still early days but I would give it a chance if you are a die-hard fan of the survival genre.If you don't understand early access or are tired of the genre, then I do not recommend the game to you. Go play Skyrim. The one with free mods.Recommended."
76561197979835198,Recommended,658980,35407976,Posted: 2 October,all,"Uhtred, son of Uhtred","The potential of this game is HUGE! Some people will argue that this claim is not a viable reason to purchase a game, I am not telling you to buy this game, only what i currently think about it. And, the potential of this game is undeniable, whether the devs will fulfill the desires of myself or the community has yet to be seen.What it already does great is a straight forward crafting system that exponentially hastens as you unlock better tools and unravel the mechanics of the game.Base building has proven to be quite exciting in itself, especially when teamed up with others. While what you can build is limited at this point, being able to build wherever you like and zone off areas as your own is quite an interesting prospect.Today, my clan and I explored a few marked towns on the map. Most of these towns at this point only serve as eye candy, however, to our surprise, the last town we visited was a ruin filled with skeleton warriors. As a party of vikings  we had no other choice than to avenge our murdered ancestors. We were unable to clear the area as the skeletons were numerous and some exceptionally powerful. In the process we found some good loot and one of our party members died before we had to retreat. If this type of scenario can be recreated throughout the open world or in ""dungeons/raids"" it would be tremendous for the game.I have yet to delve into pvp, or substantial questing - thus i cannot comment on these elements.As for bugs, I have encountered nothing game breaking. In fact, the ONLY bug I have encountered is an issue surrounding the placement of pallisade gate frames (in certain places they would be unable to build and would instead jump a few yards in a different direction where they could be placed). I have also heard about trees not visually falling after being cut, although a quick reload will fix this.The community is excellent.What I would like to see integrated into this game is some sort of experience/leveling system."

I ate a random berry started tripping screen went purple and green was hilarious.Spent the night hiding by a fire because of creepy wolves stalking me.Yes gfx are not great and game is clearly EA but I reckon this should be a great game. Very much like ROK
,Recommended,658980,35229703,Posted: 26 September,all,Cake,"Valnir Rok is looking great even when it's only in pre-Alpha.A few bugs and glitches but its expected.You should be expecting a buggy multiplayer game with a bit of high ping. (At least in NA anyways)It already has a fleshed out and simple tutorial; In its current state, the game IS playable but you will not experience a smooth ride. Although these bugs are not game-breaking, they may annoy some people. Relogging usually fixes the issueMy opinion?Wait out a few months if you'd like a smooth experience.But if you like survival multiplayer games + vikings, and would like to experience the development of a game from the ground up, buy it. It helps out the devs as well.Not sure about other people but i do indeed enjoy this game.I recommend it.EDIT 1: The more i played the more i discovered. Figuring out recipes yourself is very satisfying, as well as base building. You really feel a sense of accomplishment when playing this game.EDIT 2: Created House Baratheon in the game. Made a whole stone base with my friend. People tried to raid us but failed miserably. OURS IS THE FURY. I even recommend this game even more."

Exactly what  I'm looking for.Since it's on the Early Access, I understand that there are a lot of things to fix, that includes:-Server Ping Unstable-Some building parts that you cant build-Bugs (But the GMs already know, so im waiting for the patch)-Some Tools, Food ingredients that are useless for now-Job Boards ""coming soon""  (pretty sure theyre quests that youll get item reward or currency (which is useless for now)-Markets in different cities (they arent working yet)-Combat / Fighting Style (needs improvement too)Etc... so many to mentionHopefully theyll get it done asap.On the positive side:-Graphics are good, excellent lighting and shadows.-Game UI (I dont have a problem with that)-Gameplay (Superb)-Time (Day/Night Transition) - REALISTIC!-Not a leveling system which is good, you really have to hunt for gears-Skills are soon to come too-Oh btw, Game Masters are really active like they always go to each server everyday! Cant forget GM PrustaxTIPS:-First of, if youre gonna join a guild make sure you wont leave because if you do, your items will be transfered to them (not the items on your Char's inventory)-Second, build a base which is hard to find (for starters)-Third, LOOT everything you see, its handy!Its a long way to go, but I really recommend this game.A lot of potential for this. So DEVS dont choke now. LOLNice Work!"

I went in knowing nothing about it and after just under 3 hours im in love. The graphics are great. The combat is fantastic, the animations are satisfying. So many quests to keep you busy and the base building is so much fun.Im glad to be supporting this game, what you see is truely what you get in this and I love it."
,Recommended,658980,35254251,Posted: 27 September,all,Yung Lunchable,"Keep in mind when reading below that this game is early access at this point.The game is very pretty.  The premise is that you're a viking that's survived a bandit raid and you've woken up ashore from your shipwreck on the island of Valnir.  The rest is an open book. Early on, you take a few basic quests that teach you about crafting clothes and basic weapons.  After exhausting a few quest lines I decided to find a place to build a home after seeing some really neat screenshots and builds from other players on my server.  The crafting is intuitive. At times you have trouble getting items to click into place, but that's to be expected this early on. The freedom to build whatever you would like is very satisfying.The combat is where it gets a little messy.  I died quite a bit before the wolves were nerfed.  With basic gear, I couldn't seem to take much damage and I couldn't land any of my blows.  The swinging and blocking mechanics need work but again, I'm sure this will be improved.I have yet to join a clan but I've explored the island, built a home and interacted with others.  It's a promising game, and if you're into survival games (think Rust with Vikings) and Norse lore, you'll very much enjoy this. I have no problem paying less than $20 to support this game's development."
,Recommended,658980,35379263,Posted: 1 October,all,General Meowshington,"So much to craft ! So much to discover !Even its still alpha, i like the game very much so far:+ Discover the recepies (either per trial and error or with a little thought about ""what do i need need, when i would craft this in real life?""+ Build your own house/castle everywhere you want+ Gather ressources+ Craft ! So many things to craft !+Trade with other players (the community is quiet nice)Wolves/enemies are quiet strong at the beginning. Only with good fighting skills (blocking/dodging, only one attack, then fall back) its possible to win - fighting is challengingImprovements needed:Trees are regrowing even if a house is on their placeNPC / Interaction is missing, only a few Quests / NPC's in the Town are available. Many characters look the same.After building a house, this game needs more content. I still have not discovered the whole island. Maybe something like dungeons with more precious materials like silver, gold or harder metals for weapons and tools?More enemies ?The night should be more dangerously then the day, so you are afraid to go outside in some areas :)Producing your own farm and fields with plants and animals?I found some heal- and berserker-potions. Some day I believe we can craft them on our own.This game has so much potential.. List will be refreshed soon"

I have to say though that after only 6 hours it feels like there´s nothing left for me to do or explore as I completed the tutorial, built a home, killed a bunch of animals, crafted all the things that can be crafted and visited the bigger part of the map.I´ll definitely keep an eye on the development and look forward to more improvements and content in the future!"

I am looking forward to more updates to come for this game because it has a lot of potential to be a very good Viking game. Only problem is the wolves are crazy. And you will have your crashes and bugs because it is early access. And that's expected but I have to admit this is one of the best Early Access games I've played by far. I am looking forward to the future updates for this game.
,Recommended,658980,35252869,Posted: 27 September,all,EmmaJane91,"I fell in love with this game and im addictedOk can i please just start with thisThis is an Early Access Game!!! You will encounter bugs, you will find glitches and problems, There will be server restarts, updates and hotfixes. Stuff is still in development. But you have signed up for that if you buy this or any other EA game. So please remember that when playing & reading/Writing a review.Now thats out the way i can actually start on my review :)Its a survival builder. One of my Favourite kind of games. And this one ticks my boxes. It is fun. It is engaging. It has quests. Its a pretty big map to explore i havnt explored it all yet and i look forward to doing so. Theres places to loot. Relics to find. Build your base. Can even make decorations to decortae your home, if you want to make it feel homely. And thats just the PvE side.Now PvP. Its a viking game and it can be as brutal as they were. If you choose a PvP server you can expect to be raided at any moment, Walk into passers by while hunting and farming for materials.. Not everyone is going to be friendly. Need to keep your guard up and keep your friends close by. You may need them. You dont need to play with friends either as there are plenty of clans recruiting too, that you can join up with or play solo. (But i dont recommend that) xDAs mentioned above there are official servers PvP and PvE so both play styles are covered. You can also buy your own Private server. But which will you choose? The choice is yours on that one xDFor me it runs pretty smooth, there as some laggy patches but thats to be expected. Restarting game can fix it as well as when they need to restart server. I can easily play and stream with hardly any problems :) (My PC is an i5 7th Gen overclocked, GTX 1070, 16GB Ram) Graphics are decent. Looks beautiful. Combat can be abit clunky, but still enjoyable.Now the Devs & GM'sUnlike alot of games, The devs and GMs are very hands on. They talk to you and they communicate with you. GM's Will spend time with you talking when not busy and they are there when they can be to solve your problems and answer your questions. If they cant they ask a Dev or pass it on.Devs are very fast at working on the problems that are presant. They listen to you, ask questions and then do their best to sort it out and get a patch/hot fix out. They are very responsive and some of the best Devs i have had the pleasure of speaking with.I played in the Alpha last weekend, Bought the game as soon as it released. I did then receive 2 Free codes which i gave to friends :) We now play together. <3All in all. Its up to you if you buy the game or not. But i recommend it 100%"

,Recommended,658980,35440285,Posted: 3 October,all,Lunhill,"So first off, this game has a ton of potential and the devs seem to be hard at work with helping to make it something great. However, with that said, there are many things that needs fixing. This game needs to standout from other survival games since there are many like it and a lot of people are getting bored of the genre. Of course, there are a good amount of bugs which is a given for early access and most of them are bearable. However, raiding and base building needs a lot of work.Here is a list of a few things that need fixing:- Unbreakable Sword (This is being fixed soon)- Repairing of walls in combat- We need a build claim of some sort, otherwise you can build right over people’s walls or even in/on their base- Need to have some sort of animation for the bandage/potions. Right now, whoever has the most potions wins since youcan spam them behind a shield. Also, the fights don’t feel right. Fights in this time period will involve a lot of circling between opponents making for slower fights so if both combatants just slam potions and bandages it will not feel like a real fight.- Needs some sort of siege mechanic.- Can’t break workbenches/firepits/furnaces, so you can keep stuff in there rather than a chest. This obviously kills raiding. Also, tents and beds can't be destroyed.- Being able to roll while overloaded without using stamina aka Fat Rolling.- Needs a clan alliance option. For instance, my clan and two other clans decided to have an alliance with eachother. When it came time to fight, it was near impossible due to friendly fire. This is not a huge problem though. We just merged  the clans later on to keep that from happening again and continued to build in our respectice areas. If an alliance mechanic was implemented, it would make it super conveient and allow for more clan alliances.These are just a few problems or topics that need to be questioned. I fear that if some of these do not get fixed or get the attention they need, then it will scare players away. It would be great to see this game have some awesome ground and siege battles between clans. Right now, raiding is just too easy with the unbreakable steel swords (apparently being fixed Wednesday according to a GM I talked with today) and the constant smashing of health potions and bandages without any animation to use it.From someone who loves survival games and loves PvP, I think this game can be something great in the future. If the devs work on improving and making something unique here then this could be one of the better survival games on the market. Right now, the raiders who use the unbreakable swords to rip through fresh spawns homes have left empty hulls of previous player homes all throughout the southside of my server. May just be me, but it seems some players are leaving the server because of this, or worse, the game entirely.Finally, if you love survival games or the viking era of history, pick up this game. You will have a ton of fun. The devs are active and glitches/exploits seem to be getting fixed fairly often. Once the sword bug is fixed then we may see a lower amount of online and offline raiding. So far, most of the people I have come across don't KoS you and for the most part are pretty cool people all looking for a new survival experience. This doesn't mean there are not the raiders for that will come with any PvP/Survival game but it is still fun for that immerses you into a cruel survival world.For those not a huge fan of the survival genre but are interrestsed in this game, then you should definately put it on your wishlist and wait for some polishing to be done to a few things in game. Also there are PvE servers so there is always fun with the community there. Also,tThis game is not all about PvP. There are NPCs, villages, and quests so there is enough to keep you occupied. Merchants and some other RPG elements have not been fully implemented yet, but I imagine they will be soon.In the end, I say this is a great early access game and has a great amount of potential if certain aspects are improved and taken care of. Definately worth a buy for fans of the genre!"

,Recommended,658980,35355985,Posted: 30 September,all,Maelstrum,"This game has great potential, sure it has bugs like any pre-alpha and alpha releases. The mechanics of combat are good, being much better then other similar games at this stage of development. Ranged combat seemed extremely hard at first, but after a day working at it its now a breeze. They are going to have to rework the mobs to respond to being shot from a distance and run away or charge. etc. the graphics are exciting and the atmoshphere feels engaging and immersful. There are gliches with targeting some objects ingame but the dev teams actively working out the kinks as we report them.The crafting system seems a bit daunting at first. You will figure things out rather quickly with trial and error. Less then a week in and I think I can craft everything in the game up to this point. I am excited to see what else they add in the future.I will revisit this weekly for more info."

Of course when I heard of a Viking one on it's way I was pumped. Considering where they are in development I think they are on the right track. As long as they not only keep up with maintenance but also new content then I can see this being a huge success. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival and understands what a pre alpha game can be like at times.
,Recommended,658980,35228381,Posted: 26 September,all,Ron Brrgundy,"Valnir Rok is a Sleepr game, its new and exciting. yes it is Early access so EXPECT bugs. don't expect a perfectly working game because its not. so in my opinion this game is worth 30$ not 19$. I really think this game is really cool the RP potential is far beyond any game I have tried. theres a few Inventory bugs Server list bugs and also there is an issue with building that I do not like, When you build a wooden structure there is no way as of yet to upgrade it it must be deleted, so therefore if you delete a wooden foundation everything above it drops too.so it must be Deleted and fully replaced which is a big pain in the butt and it really needs to be fixed. Other then that the game is pretty cool and is very much worth the buy.  8/10 for me*edit* all i have to say is woooow!! I am blown away by how Helpful and active in there community the Valnir Rok Devs are. All of us players in my clan reported a bug together and the bug was fixed shortly after same day pretty much same hour. These Devs are Awesome I am seriously stoked for this game and the future of it. The building system the Devlopers the community, one of the best i have ever discovered. And this Game is Well worth th ebuy, In MY opinion this game is better then Dark and Light and Ark, the devlopers are Responsive Respectful and cool headed, either with positive feedback or negative they take it all in stride, this game and its current player base deserve more players for RolePlay and in General. Come give this game a try"

(any server) Chat on the server seems to be the same thing, everyone is crashing left and right constantly and asking for solutions. Aside from this it's your typical early access mess, with the game being in a really REALLY rough shape, that part I expected, but unfortunitely since the game is physically unplayable for me currently due to the crashes, I'm forced to refund this. Though I may check back in to see if the game has approached playable in 3 months to a half year or so."

And also I'm very kind to early access games, so just in case of that I just want to give players a decision, to buy the game in its current state or not. Also i fully understand Early Access Games and this is only my personal opinion.So first we come to the positive Things from the game right now:Joining a Server ist decent and fastThe setting is nicethere are Many things to doThe quest are good written so the game have a storylineServer owners can do their own quests which is pretty nice and a unique feature.the Base building is nice and smoothNow to the negative things:the character creation is in my opinion not good. U have only slide options, no different face, body... Options, which makes every character looks stupid.The wolves are OP, as a new player you can't defend yourselfe. They following you very long and if they hit you they do massive damage and as new player you can't craft a bandage that fast or u don't even have a recipe for it already.The AI (Animals/Npc's) are pretty bad animated, they are lagging and it feels pretty unoptimized.The Controls in overhaul feel pretty squishyThe quest menu.. I don't know I can't get with it..The combat is not really good. There is a option to dodge and stuff but it doesn't feel smooth at all.Some things I want to mention also are:1. U need to like the quests they are really like in other mmorpgsGather this.. Gather this.. Kill this..2. The feeling about being a viking doesn't come up in my opinion, (focused on the early game)So this is my opinion about the game in its current state. It's your decision if you like or if u skip this game, or wait till it's fully released. I hope I can help some people with this review. I'm looking forward into this game but I don't recommend it in its current state."

Yes there are bugs and the combat system currently seems a bit laggy but thats expected. The community is great so far, hopefully it doesnt turn into a toxic cess pool of KoS, much like rust. Not sure why theres some bad reviews about the crafting system I found it rather fun. reminds me a lot of the H1z1 early days crafting system.

They will also add dungeons soon.Performance wise, i am running at a stable 144 fps on highest settings possible. if it dips, it dips to 120ish, so it aint bad.Combat needs some work as it can be a bit clonky, but combat is still diverse as it is with dodging, evading and combos.Map size seems perfect for the amount of servers, and i love the fact that you can play it how you like, either building your own village or just using the existing villages to do quest's rather than farm for your own place.All in all, i would DEFINETLY recommend it to anyone who likes the genre.Extra side note, the dev's are extremely efficient if bugs come up and they do fix them asap and they are listening to inputs about what should be implemented in the game next. so if you want to help shape this game for the future, it is definetly possible."

A game like thos has been in need of development with the whole ARk style etc. Nailed it. Okay there are bugs but there will be and there is a lot less bugs than there is in major games tbh. The crafting could be improved on ways to find out what materials you need to find. I have spent 3 hours playing and streaming and everyone seems to like the look of this.Can not wait to see how this develops more. Well worth 13 quid to help the delevopers make this a major game.

So far I can't complain, and I know it will only get better.  I do wish there was an option to just WALK, and not run, as the movements are already a little jerky, and sometimes I just want to walk up to people, and things.  I find my character moves just a bit too fast.  But the quests have been fun; I love the graphics, and the landscape, (hence, why I want to walk sometimes, and take my time exploring) the animals and wildlife look good too.  I love the crafting system, and the inventory management as well.  Love how you can create a backstory, though the character creation could be upgraded a bit.  I can see the devs put a lot of time and effort into this and it was worth it.   I will recommend this game for sure."

There are many things that this game has done in the right way so far that I have to give big props to of corse these are my opinion an will very on the person. The smoothness of the combat and the texture of the world/characters. As you start an gather materials to try and survive the world takes you in as you see buildings, animal life and the world draw you in.  Yes this game is still in Early Access but to me they have gone above with this one that many survival games have been lacking.  After adventuring out maybe figuring out a few recipies you may come across NPCs that give you guests.  This alone drew me in, they had stepped out of the box of normal survival games an done something that could really change the way survival games are made.As I say above I have have not put in much time but I think this was the best 17.99 (on sale) I have spent in a long time on a survival game.  I would have gladly paid more for this game an I can not wait to see what the devs have planned.  An to the devs, keep up the great work and please keep us all informed I do not want to see this game go down hill.Pros of Early Access so far:----------------------------QuestingCrafting system is deep and rewardingTextures of buildings an the land scape are an A+Friendly community (I pray it stays this way)Smooth combatCons (Have not found any yet but will edit post if found any):"

I should be able to get clothes, some sort of basic weapon, and a torch before I even leave the beach to be killed by said wolf.Plus, someone needs to feed that wolf.After about 5 hours I'd say the game is pretty good.  There's definitely alpha type issues.  Here's a hint for new players, get off the beach.  There was more civilization off the beach.  I expected darker forests but there's an inn with a guard at the top of the hill!  No room service.  During those 5 hours I did have 6 more wolf encounters.
