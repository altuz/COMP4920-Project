,Recommended,661000,33839834,Posted: 27 July,all,S0YxSauCe,They nailed it alright. It really is relaxing games ever. Noted: Nubs and plebs friendly game(suitable for low-tier achievements hunter)

,Recommended,661000,35167256,Posted: 23 September,all,GlockTheDoor,Fun game! The D&B music is pretty solid. Great game for killing some time. Got it with a discount and it was definitely worth it.
,Recommended,661000,35054533,Posted: 18 September,all,ImPsychoTv,Do the alphabet and start it up. BOOM! Easy 27 achievements.
,Recommended,661000,33625264,Posted: 18 July,all,d3wu,"It's a really cool line following game, where you have to avoid various objects. Its minimalist desing is really good and the mood is really relaxing. Good time killer and smooth game."

,Recommended,661000,35052550,Posted: 18 September,all,Tezlakipuka,"Really relaxing to play on TV with Steam Controller. The game only requires a left and right key, but a constant increase in speed requires quite some reflexes. The graphics are pretty much limited to the background and the white lights, which is fine for the concept. The soundtrack is great.The controller support needs some work. I couldn't find any option to directly press the retry button without moving the mouse pointer over it, which doesn't disappear during gameplay.Overall, its worth the current price of 0,99€."

Not Recommended: 4/10"
,Not Recommended,661000,34006137,Posted: 3 August,all,Magnus,"None of the other reviews make a mention, so here it is:As of this review, Flow:The Sliding does not feature trading cards.I gave this game the benefit of the doubt on its claim of having trading cards, as the store page feature list for Broforce also omits cards despite their presence.It's only relaxing until you hit an obstacle, the sound effect of which is quite jarring in contrast to the complete silence unless you have your volume turned right down.The achievements offer no incentive to play the game.Roll your face across your keyboard to collect them all."

,Recommended,661000,33625736,Posted: 18 July,all,Greagoir Snow,This game looks so simple but after a few minutes you are throwing gamepad away trying to beat your previous record.
76561198128853559,Recommended,661000,34351389,Posted: 19 August,all,Raziel,I dont know why people dont like this game. It takes less than a minute to get all the achievements and as a small time killer i can think of worse games to play. I got this product for 8p using a coupon from creating a badge and it was worth the money. If you can get this product in a bundle or when it is cheap then do. Whats the worse that can happen?
,Recommended,661000,33605782,Posted: 17 July,all,Arthur,"A little no stressful game that does not looks good but is very funny and rather sporty. The graphics palette is not the most complicated, but the sceneries are sober and inspired, really a good hobby for less than $1. 5/10."

,Recommended,661000,34265880,Posted: 15 August,all,dorymeister,"Great game for what it is, I got a discount on it for doing a badge and it was 8p. I probably wouldn't spend the 79p on this as it is literally a randomly generated line that gets faster the longer you go."
,Not Recommended,661000,33959706,Posted: 1 August,all,Ontes,"Flow: The Sliding is a perfect game for achivement hunters, but its a really bad ""obstacle"" platformer even for the 0.05$ i paid for. You control a laggy orb, moving it left or right to avoid hitting obstacles. The orb goes faster and faster every second to your inavoidable ""game over"" screen. There are no leaderboards to compete, there are no achivements to do, just a linear, simple, frustrating, laggy game. Worthless to buy.Pros:+ Easy achivements, spam all buttons+ Can even work on a potato PCCons:- Horrible art design, changing colours are blinding.- NO MUSIC?! just an annoying DPSCH sound when you hit an obstacle. Horrible.- Linear, nothing to do.- No leaderboards, no steam cards nothing- The orb is laggy if you want to move it to center.Graphics:3Presentation:1Sound/Music:1Gameplay:3Overall:2.0"
