76561198053422627,Recommended,662210,35166819,Posted: 23 September,all,Zaxtor99 ® YouTube,"I just bought this game and played my first hour... and I gotta say even tho I don't tend to like RPG maker games...  This p.huking game is P.HUKING AWESOME AS P.HUK!  :-)It is very cleverly written and made me burst into laugher two or three times in just my first hour of play as well as a few chuckles too.  The last time I played an old school RPG game of this style was way back in like 1996 or so when I bought ""Chrono Trigger"" for the Super Nintendo!Watch this P.huking game P.HUK me up!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq9W3jt6kvQAll I gotta say is two things...1) You're already reading the reviews for this game, so you are thinking about it.. STOP.  ..Just BUY it!  ..It's a really good indie RPG maker game for sure.2) When you buy it and play it your first time, Remember to SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN.  LOL.. I just lost a battle an hour into it and forgot to save my game before my fight like a doofus.  I'm so used to current gen games auto-saving that I completely forgot about how important saving these kinda games is!    Oh well, no biggie because this game is really enjoyable and starting over will just mean more enjoyment!I'll be back to review this game once I finish it, but so far, loving it.. looks like it's gonna score a minimum of an 8 out of 10. That's not bad at all for a game at this price, especially an RPG.  :-)"
,Recommended,662210,34157249,Posted: 10 August,all,Creamii Kid,"So,First of all let me say this was a nice fun game to play. It is exactly what it says it is with some extra charm.I really enjoyed the dialogue, the characters and the overall story. (I love Pontius <3 )Yes, there were a few things  I personally would change/did not really like. I found it hard to see what character I was selecting in combat, and when I was searching through my inventory etc. Also, I felt like every fight I was running to a different enemy. It took away from the story a bit. The overall area of the areas can't possibly be a habitat for all those creatures.)You can tell that this game was the Developers testing the waters and I am glad they did. I can't wait to see what is in store for the future.If an update can be made to fix a few things that would be great. I give it 6.5/10"
,Recommended,662210,35196077,Posted: 24 September,all,ImTheMetalLord,"First let me say I'm a bit bias.  Any game that takes on the Metal genre is already a great game.  But now can that great game become something I really love.  I could name a few examples where I expected this to happen but didn't.  I could also name a few that barely where even a bit better than my expectations simply cause it's claims to be a metal type game.  So in this case I'll grade this game in two ways.  One, how it compares to other games in general and two, how it compares in the Metal genre of games.I did not go into this game with very high expectations.  As stated previously it can't be all that bad after all it's got Metal as a backdrop.  So comparing it against other games in general I'd say it met or overcame my expectations.  The only negative in general thing I have to say about the game overal is the lack of graphical settings but I soon found myself forgetting about that and enjoying the story/gameplay/music/fights/explorations just to name a few things that helped me forget.  I'll mention the others below when comparing it against Metal games.  Seriously, great, funny story telling even if you don't get the Metal references that are a plenty.  The turn based combat is simple to pick up and easy to plan your attacks.  The art work isn't perfect but it sure as hell isn't any where close to the worse I've seen.  Overal I'd leave you with this.  I have a major gaming ADD problem and using a first time out in a game I'm lucky to play an hour.  Next thing I new I was at 2 1/2 hours in this game and it was past my bedtime.Now to compare it against other Metal games this is one of my top 2 or 3 games.  Hands down the most fun, less stressful, great metal riffs (although I wish it had a bit more to begin with), and helped me totally escape reality.  OH and I laughed so hard at this game.  Any metal head will love the metal references.  They are in your face.Thanks Crankage Games for a fun game.  I think sometimes developers forget the fun part in gaming but you sure didn't.  I look forward to your next project and hope you keep puting out the fun.\m/ Peace \m/"
76561198056626793,Recommended,662210,33823271,Posted: 26 July,all,chronix112,"1st off this game is ♥♥♥♥ing metal. I wasn't expecting much when I picked this up. I fully expected this to be just another generic rpg maker game, with just some shameless metal pandering tossed around here, and there. I was pleasently wrong about this game.This is a rpgmaker game, and there are some stock assest used here and there, but surpisingly this game has a decent amount of orginal assests. The soundtrack deserves  a special mention as it is really great, and the dev should consider having it up as a DLC option.Metal as ♥♥♥♥♥ has great atmosphere and many moments that will make you think ""damn that was ♥♥♥♥ing metal.'This game  isn't your standard recruit the character, do their little quest and then forget they even exist, until some plot makes them relevant again  later in the game.Each of the characters have distinct personalities, will give their take on things, and will be very talkative throughout the journey. The banter between chracters reminds me very much of the old Lunar jrpgs. Also just like Lunar most  objects are interactive  rewarding maybe finding items. some character comenting on it or even a  small amount of xp for clicking the random thing. People with OCD beware as you will be clicking up a storm trying find everything.Plenty of metal references are littered thoughout the game, some are mainstream freindly, with others being a bit obscure that will make you smile if you recognize them.There are a couple of  negatives though. The battle system is for the most part cookie cutter rpgmaker fare with the standard attack, magic, item etc...options. The game is fairly challenging, but the afortmentioned bare basic battle system doesn't light the world on fire in the excitement category. Metal as ♥♥♥♥ is also on the short side. If you count my idling  you can beat this game in under 5 hours.  In a way that can  be a +  as it is a very entertaining 5 hours, and  Metal as ♥♥♥♥ does not wear out its welcome like a lot of other comedy focused rpgs end up doing.  Closing this review with a hymn made by  some of the great metal prophets of long ago.""♥♥♥♥ Made Heavy Metal And He Saw That It Was Good♥♥♥♥ Said To Play It Louder Than HellWe Promised That We WouldWhen Losers Say It's Over With You Know That It's A Lie♥♥♥♥ Made Heavy Metal And It's Never Gonna Die"""

76561197978333529,Recommended,662210,34008912,Posted: 3 August,all,Jaorn187,Game was really fun. Simple controls and packed with silly stoner jokes and some non weed related jokes aswell. Really Enjoyed the hidden items that give xp and sick bonus at end of the game. 5/5

,Recommended,662210,34569433,Posted: 28 August,all,Eevee Greyhame,"I really liked this game! The humor was great, the story was engaging, and the mechanics were simple, yet still really fun. Play it!"
76561198193028131,Recommended,662210,34701711,Posted: 2 September,all,Beaudacious,"Bought the game the day or so it came out, but only finally found the time to play it very recently. Fantastic characters and humor that actually was some of the best I have ever seen in a game. Great job Crankage, I will totally try out whatever else you make."
76561198403185282,Recommended,662210,34826755,Posted: 8 September,all,tracieraine,"Well done to the creators of this game! I will be honest I'm not quite a fan of RPG, however the hilarious story line and over all ins and outs of this game had me genuinely intrigued and invested to play. Throughout playing I found myself snicking like a little child, which I tried to stop because that's not very metal as ♥♥♥♥ of me...So if you have a few spare dollars and time on your hands, I would highly recommend checking this game out.To the creators again, huge congrats and can't wait to see what games you have install for the future."

,Recommended,662210,35301991,Posted: 29 September,all,Konald Wump,"Metal as ♥♥♥♥ is a throwback (for me at least) to Gameboy games that were crafted lovingly instead of being♥♥♥♥♥♥out to meet a release date. The dialgogue is on point and MaP is one of the few games to make me audibly laugh while playing through it.If you've ever played a Final Fantasy game the mechanics of managing a group, using turn based combat, and smart item use should be like second nature.The mash-up of Metal themes and Anime tropes is a hilarious mixture that I think goes a long way in showing the creators' humor.If you want a fun little game to enjoy pick this title up. At $5 I can wholeheartedly say it's worth the price of admission."

The title is a word pun, how cool is that! I feel like this game was written by me and I am so excited to finish it. Cannot wait to see what Crankage Games puts out next!"
,Recommended,662210,33548895,Posted: 14 July,all,Serious Table,"I'm still going through it, but have been enthralled by the quick wit and hilarious character interactions already present in Metal as ♥♥♥♥. This has been a lot of fun to play from the very beginning, and comes recommended!"

Hidden secrets, jokes, and puns galore. I never want to stop. I'm very happy with the fight sequences and the dialogue mid fight. As well the serious yet fun and joking humor is a nice touch. I'm excited to see if another game follows from Crankage Games"

I'm not a fan of Metal type music but this is still a great game.

,Recommended,662210,33535602,Posted: 14 July,all,Morikelvar,"Honestly im not one for metal but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game hits the spot. The dialogue is hilarious (old man quivers is deff a fav!!), the stroy line is awesome and the little nods to other fandoms will have you smiling like an idiot. I was also surprised by the gameplay in terms of the battles, what i thought was going to be easy actually turned out to be nicely challenging and had me really invested in the game!! 10/10 highly recommend, especially whilst it's on sale!!"

Anyone older than 12 should spend a few dollars, light up with Pontius, sit back and enjoy the ride."
