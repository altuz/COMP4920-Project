Posting daily updates of planned changes so u know what their working on, really enjoy this game, can't wait to see what it becomes."

It's sups early though so obviously there are things to be worked out, but it's kind of cool to be involved so early so I can see the big changes that happen with each update.The new tutorial is much appreciated! I know how to get my bud so I can sell it.The development team is pretty responsive and they seem to be excited to make a great game."

It's playable even in early access, and an interesting concept to the game. The tutorial is a good start, though I got a game over unexpectedly after putting the farm in the poor house (really easy to do).  Give it a try, and see if you last longer than myself!"

76561197960463503,Recommended,662910,34562452,Posted: 28 August,all,Lemon Jello,"So far so good. I have played this game as a release on steam and even beforehand in the earlier stages and it's cool to see where the game has gone. I started as Sage because I liked his perk of bigger buds, because to me bigger buds = bigger wallet. By the end of march I had two separate plots, a lawyer who had my back, and 33 grand in pocket with several happy costumers including Green2Go, who had reoccurring contracts being offered, which I can only assume is a supply chain throughout the game.There are little bugs here and there so far, but  haven't encountered any game breaking bugs. I was able to save my game and load it without any problems. However, I played as ""Sage"" and the game avatar was ""Polly"" but when I went back in game, I was Sage. Also, a few contracts called me ""Polly"" but I was Sage. Sometimes I've noticed the nutrients bars will have a gap at the bottom of the bar, and if I add the water/fertilizer, the bar drops down and starts to add to the top again. Not sure how this is affecting my plants but I thought it was worth mentioning. Sometimes it's a little difficult to target a plant, or know if I'm targeting the right plant. I've had nutrients add double when clicking consecutively.Once I play more, save up some, unlock some staff, I can update this post. As a tycoon game and early access, the foundation is there, and there is more to come. Keep it up, Joint Ventures!"

After multiple restarts, I was able to do contracts (for some reason, sometimes the contracts list is totally empty and requires you to interact with the tutorial cell phone, atleast was the case for me). However, even after doing contracts, I found the game much too difficult to stay afloat financially. After making about 5 sales, I was in the red again a few seconds later. The game has a really cool concept and has some awesome potential, however right now it really needs some TLC. As of now, the game isn't built for it's demographic: stoners. Its unreliable user interface, confusing tutorial system and in game financial difficulty you witness at the very beginning of the game result in a very broken and unforgiving experience. As I said before, this game has some really good potential and I want to like it. As it stands, I wouldn't recommend buying this right now. Not even for the sale price of $11.99"

It could be very special with continued development.  The developers are trying to make a Tycoon/Farming RPG hybrid and are extremely responsive to their players. The pace is fun and very 420 friendly.I'm giving this game another 3 to 6 months, let's see where they take it."

The foundation is there but Unfortunately, I feel they entered early access a little too quickly. Having more systems in place would have gone a long way to making this a more enjoyable experience. Right now, I sadly can not recommend this title. More updates and continued communication will go a long way to making this a successful and fun weed growing simulator.For some gameplay and a more in-depth First Look check out my video review here:https://youtu.be/iPX1hsQrDiQ"

No where near the effort it takes like a stardew valley, but definitly a challenge to get the dope done."

76561197985029476,Recommended,662910,34581624,Posted: 29 August,all,pandamonium,"Alright, after a solid 8 hours of playing it's time to leave my review. Full disclosure; I've gamed with some of the developers but my review is impartial.My first observation is that this is not a complete game. After about 4 hours and at least as many new games, I finally felt like I understood what they're trying to do with this game and I love it. But I need to see more.Yes, there were a lot of bugs a during launch but as of version 0.25 or something all of the show stoppers seemed to have been worked out. It's not clear how many people are actually working on the game at any given time but I see the devs are very responsive and clearly care.Would recommend and would like to see multiplayer co-op, indoor growing, and more decorative and functional stuff to decorate my farm with. Also, I want to open a weed shop in Seattle I hope I can do that soon."
76561197993209725,Recommended,662910,34677185,Posted: 1 September,all,"Oh, Magoo...","Just booted it up, and so far so good.  It's a heartfelt little homage to SV and other farming games, but with a very unique pot spin.  The plants themselves have been made the star with several attributes to be maintained (more complex than just watering and walking away.)  Good backbone for a game here, and plenty of room to add on.  Hoping this one fulfills its potential."

76561198306479918,Recommended,662910,35092348,Posted: 20 September,all,TheTLS,"I've played this off and on since buying it on Early Access when it first came out, and I am blown away by the improvements.  I would not consider Cash Crop a complete game *yet*, but I think it's getting close, and it's surprisingly fun to sink some time into.  The music is super interesting, and I like the uniqueness of the strains and contracts (which is a neat mechanism).I would like to see some options for buildings, not just staff and crew.  And I do think that after a  while, the farming gameplay gets a little tired, and I would like something else to do with my time.  Theoretically I could have 3 fields and three crew tending those fields and I could sit back and just watch the clock tick.  Quests, interactions with NPCs, and purchase-able farm upgrades would go a long ways to adding replayability.However, overall I found this to be surprisingly fun, and it's neat to see the upgrades and progress made on the game since launch.  The graphics are fun and the game is self-aware and cheeky, which I appreciate.  I would recommend this game, especially seeing the improvements they are making."
76561198072031165,Recommended,662910,35119343,Posted: 21 September,all,Storm,"Still VERY early access. Almost every upgrade in the staff area says ""Available in upcoming patch"". Same thing if you look at the map, you can only buy one other farm right now. Controls are still very basic, no ability to restructure your farm. Settings are very limited. The police heat gained from deals and having too many plants needs rebalancing in a terrible way. Your workers are basically usless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I don't recommend hiring them at all unless you are trying to unlock damien for a seperate play through. Unless I am mistaken all they do is over water crops with the bucket when it gets in the yellow zone and harvest. I haven't had one replenish nutrients. All in all the game is basically unplayable in its current state but I know is has a LOT of potential if they keep developing it. I have played for a few hours now and have basically every aspect of the game completed. I will certainly keep checking back with future updates and don't mind paying the $16 to help them keep developing. Sorry devs if you take this the wrong way, I just want people to be informed."
