,Not Recommended,663110,34009592,Posted: 3 August,all,KyleKidd,"First Impression Gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqlbJ7B2AuU&feature=youtu.beWhen I first started up the game, I got a very ""H1Z1: Survival"" vibe, but that quickly wore off.  Almost immediately after logging in, I was relentlessly killed by other players.  The big glaring issue with this, is that new players start with a fully loaded AK47, but you lose it after you die.  So, players who have been there a while are farming ammo and guns off people who just spawn in, then those players are left high and dry.There is no teaming up in this game, unless you load in with a friend. Also, the player base appears to be entirely made up of Russian speakers (not an issue, just beware if you're looking to voice chat in English).The graphics feel old and muddy, while the sound seems pretty decent.  For the little amount of shooting I did get to do, the hit detection seemed to work okay.  Although I did unload 5 shots from a shotgun point blank into some kind of swamp monster who seemed unaffected.For the actual meat of the game, you spend most of your time wandering around and looking for supplies to patch together weapons and survive off food you find in random locations.  The game world feels large, and fairly sparse between locations.  There are random areas that have this electric looking blue glow which will kill you if you go near.  I'm not sure if that is supposed to be a visual representation of radiation, as that is also something you are supposed to avoid.All in all, this game is playable and the online servers were actually very responsible.  I did get bored quickly though and feel there are better options out there.  I'm going to say the game has some potential, but I can't recommend at this time."
,Not Recommended,663110,34003291,Posted: 3 August,all,ChaoticFury790,This game is like a knockoff multiplayer stalker wannabe that also has pay to win aspects such as buying weapons and ammo for real money. Stay away.

,Not Recommended,663110,34002859,Posted: 3 August,all,The Majestic,"This game is okay at best it's not the best and it isn't bad but i can't recommend it, even tho you buy the game they still expect you to pay real money to buy gold to create a group and to buyweapons not forgetting you still have to buy the game and yes i know it isn't expensive but still buying a game and still having to buy stuff in game? like honestly? the spawns are aint great the way it looks is basically like a s.t.a.l.k.e.r. trying to find your friends it stupid as you can't even group up as i don't expect to buy a game then have to pay ingame credits to get stuffIf anything changes or gets better may change my review but untill then I do not recomend it"

I'm going to keep it because it has room for improvement, because it was just released. Full of Russians of course, so some are greedy (most are greedy). Because it was so cheap, im going to also keep trying back at it every once in a while, but I believe the paying aspects are a little overkill and too early for the game's development. It's a little amateur to make that addition. Some may believe that it's a little too overpowered to have some and most of the kits in the game, but you can find so many of the weapons, and even craft them in little amounts of time, then quickly raid the guys who had wasted their money on a kit in this game instead of finishing the collection of vodka and adidas jumpsuits like the slavs they are.Rating on this game:♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Review is subject to change along with the game itself"
,Not Recommended,663110,34251409,Posted: 15 August,all,berdyev,"I tried to like this game. I really did.It has very similar atmosphere to STALKER, therefore I tried making the same connection as I did while playing Stalker. The only problem I have is with the Multiplayer. Don't get me wrong, it works fine, it's the servers and its population. Seems like every server you join is a Russian server, with a sh*tty ping and KoS (aggressive) players, that kill you once they see you, even if you don't have sh*t on you.Yet loot spawn sucks too. Even worse than Hardcore DayZ's loot. FFS. Create PVE servers and put few in America, and they I will give it a shot. But right now, f:trump:ck this game."

This game...okay fine, the gun models were decent for three dollars and being a Unity title...everything else was a fail though.
