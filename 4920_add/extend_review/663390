,Recommended,663390,33934138,Posted: 31 July,all,Cablenexus,"If any of you ever searched for a Monopoly like boardgame on Steam (or elsewhere) that you can pick up quick and play a fast game, without account registration or reward system that let you only play if you have enough coins in your account, you can't find any untill today.Rento fortune fills that gap for me in my gaming library and I'm glad I bought the game.I was sceptical at first. The developer don't have any other games on Steam and at first sight it looks very casual/mobile/tablet to me. But it offers exactly a well done Monopoly like game with the rules as you are used to or with new rules you can choose at setup.There are a few boards you can choose to play on, you can select a fast game and finetune some options (like rent in prison or not).A very user friendly room system let you select a game someone create, or you can create your own room (with or without parole) and wait for others to join.I played at many different times and it never took long before the room was filled. Except people are very inpatience and join the room, wait a few seconds and left, so you have to wait anyway till 4 players stay. You can add bots (AI players) but I don't like it that way since much in this game is decided by trading property and the AI can't ever be as capable at that part as a human player. (there are just too many things to take into account when trading property). So the AI player can sell core property to real players way to cheap for example.My advice is too pick this up when you want to play with real players or like to cheat the AI.When you pick the game up for 5 dollar (what I paid) you get a complete game with all options unlocked. There are no microtransactions like in other causal games. You buy you pay how much you want and the rules are the same for everyone. No pay to win here. No pay to play either (except the price of the game;-)The casual/tablet part is most noticible at UI and graphics part. The board, dices, cards and pawn are functional at best. There is nothing spectacular (yet) just functional presentation. Not very bad either, but it doesn't feel artistic to me, or original. since games are a form of art for me I would love to see this in any game. Even in a Monopoly like casual game.For example there are no pictures on the board. At least put a smal Eiffel tower in Paris (or whatever). Only a name. The dice are all standard (you can only choose a color). My whole nation (Holland) is missing completely in the game so I have to select another country flag ingame and I can't buy Holland on the board.There is a Halloween theme that stands out from the rest of the game, but that is not the theme I'm looking for in a business game. I would love to see a hotel theme, a world wonder theme, a African theme, Europe, World or American theme. Probably even open the Steam workshop so people can edit their own themed boards?As I understand the game was in development for a few years for mobile. Game is stable and everyone can play it on any hardware (see the sys req). Since they offer the game on PC now I hope they take a step forwards and make a real PC game from it by finetuning UI elements and offer more freedom in theming, naming and ways to play like how the PC audience want it.All in all it's a fair recommendation for hours of fun. When you are in the game and everyone plays it's just a fun nostalgic (for me) boardgame that can lest from half an hour to an hour or two. Full with trading, intrigue, outsmarting your opponent and lot's of luck with the random dice rolls. Enjoy!"

,Recommended,663390,34377397,Posted: 20 August,all,漢 a.k.a GAMI,"Rento FortuneBought this one because I was looking for a ""Monopoly-like"" game. First I was very sceptical, but it turned out to be a great game.Even though I probably have the worst RNG on this planet, I still had a lot of fun times.Recommend to play this with your friends and hang out in Teamspeak, just for the tortune when the RNG-god strikes again.Positive aspects I found in my playthrough so far:- Map decision: There is not only one board. You can choose from a ton of boards with a different land order.- Decent trade system, you're free to make trades with other players anytime at your turn.- Online Multiplayer lobbys- Customization regarding dices and figures- Additional game modifiers such as the bonus ""troll"" dice, rent in jail, pre bought lands and more- You can start an auction instead of buying things directly --> Often turns out selling land to people for ridiculously high prices {or u get rekt..}- Frequently coming updates.+ Great developer, that cares a lot about the community and the game itself. Recently found a bug, that denied me to play some of the newer boards. I reported the bug and in the next 2 days, it got fixed. It's always great to see people working hard on their stuff to make others enjoying the content moreAbout any negative aspects:I only found a bug that bothered me, but this one got fixed right away.Beside that, the only thing that might be a bit annoying sometimes is, that you can bet $1 more in auctions than other people, which sometimes results in an endless bet. No matter how much you bet, some people in Online lobbys always bet $1 more than you. It should be like a fixed minimum % amount of the previous amount bet. That's all.At the end, I can recommend you the game and it's definitely worth the 5 bucks.Thanks for reading my review ∠(｀・ω・´)"
,Recommended,663390,33561692,Posted: 15 July,all,Zezima 超级白 ✪✪✪,"NOTE! The main keyword here is ONLINE MULTIPLAYER!I recommend this game for people who are looking for a Monopoly game which allows you to play ONLINE with other players.It also seems that the online multiplayer was integrated not just the PC platform (Steam). Mobile platforms (Android and iOS) for multiplayer were integrated together as well, which makes multiplayer even more easier to find a game and players joining my created room.Board ""B3"" feels very close to the original gameplay of the Monopoly, and best of all, you can play online with other players!Also there are some differences to the gameplay even with board ""B3"" which will definitely avoid copyright issues - Fk EA and Hashbro who only know how to sue for copyright infringement, but can't even make a proper online monopoly for us!So YES! I will recommend this game! All we need now is to get more players!"

,Recommended,663390,33812454,Posted: 26 July,all,Taka,Finally Found a Monopoly game that have good amount of people playing it. Multiplayer and single player mode. Alot of adition mode to choose from. Compare to the other monopoly game on steam which only vs AI. This is the best and moblie user can vs you also. Cross pathform. Totally worth it ^^.
,Not Recommended,663390,33648237,Posted: 19 July,all,PinchPeak5203,This game can be tons of fun. It's such a good Monopoly game. Nothing else can compete with it. Especially with it's incredibly easy to use multiplayer system. It's loads of fun to play with friends and there are lots of different boards and custom options for your game. But there are just so many bugs right now it can make it quite an unenjoyable experience.There's a timer that ticks down on your turn and if it gets to zero the game says you're afk and a bot will take over. I have lost multiple games from being in the negative and a bot takes over while I'm selling my houses and the bot declares bankruptcy for me even though I would have been fine. This also happens at other times like when trading with players or playing the special tiles like the spinner.If a bot takes over while you're playing the spinner the bot will role the dice and do stuff you don't want it to for you until the spinner is done. And some times it can bug the game and you won't be able to exit the spinner and will have to restart the entire game.Also there are a lot of problems with fast mode breaking the bots which totally ruins games if any online players leave if on this mode. The bots won't build any houses or accept any trades. And you can't travel on your railroads in fast mode. All these issues with fast mode suck because fast mode would be the best if it wasn't broken.With these issues the game was just completely spoiled for me after the first few hours. The game at it's core is super fun. But until they fix these problems I cannot recommend it at this time. I look forward to thumbing this one up in the future for sure though.

76561198161494387,Recommended,663390,33737902,Posted: 22 July,all,* LGG * Cheese Brain |E|,"Pretty good little board game. Anyone who has ever played Monopoly would pick up how to play basically right off the bat. There are a couple added features that make this a tweaked variation of the aforementioned game. There was a decent number of lobbies to join in multiplayer as well. Only real suggestion would be the added option to kick players if they are too slow on their turns. All in all, good party game to play with your friends. And if you have no friends, you can still join other peoples' lobbies."
,Recommended,663390,34181300,Posted: 11 August,all,c5,"As it stands, Rento fortune is a very well implemented Monopoly clone that does many things better than recent official versions of Monopoly. The fact that you have online play is an immense step up from the Steam version of real Monopoly, and I particularly liked the timer that forces you to make a move within one minute of your turn starting. People taking forever to take their turn is a huge issue on PS4 Monopoly, and the timer keeps the game going at a great pace. There are several different boards, which is nice, and one of them is basically hte exact layout of the actual Monopoly board, albeit with some of the values changed. The rules aren't an exact clone of monopoly, and some of the rule changes I feel make the game a bit worse. I don't like that once you bankrupt someone, their properties simply go back on the board as opposed to you getting them. While this does prevent a juggernaut from taking form, it also extends the game by a great deal. The game also foces the infamous ""money on free parking"" house rule, which is just bad. Board game mechanics can't be copyrighted, so I think they actually could adjust these to be more accurate to the real, but it does seem like the company behind Rento Fortune is still updating the game with new things, so who knows what's in store. My big question before playing this was whether it would be well populated or not, and pleasingly, it is! It only took about a minute for my room of 5 to fill up and get a game going. If you want something Monopoly-esque but are disappointed by official versions, this game is a good way to get your fix."

There is even a couple variations of boards and play styles depending on how you want to play and at what speed.

When there are 4 players, for example, and one person leaves, it is easy as hell to buy all of the property from that AI player in trade.  It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  I think when a player leaves, all of their property should go to open again.  This breaks the game entirely."
