76561198036943999,Not Recommended,665180,34068168,Posted: 6 August,all,SamuraiJones,"It's kind of unclear exactly what you're getting with this game, even after looking at the reviews and forums. Clearly there is some censored sexiness, but that's kinda vague, so I'm aiming to clear that up.This game is hentai (porn). Not tasteful titilation to spice up a game (a la The Witcher). Not even excessive tasteless titlation to justify an crappy game (a la Bloody Boobs). This is hardcore, close-up of a chick's crotch style hentai. If you've explored the japanese visual novels, you'll find these scenes pretty on-par with those.Except it's got censorship. Nasty, vulgar censorship. They don't quietly skip the H-scenes, they don't tactfully adjust the field-of-view to make it less explicit. They paste a demented bunny pic over the offending parts, and continue normally. When the original has a long, fullscreen closeup of the woman's crotch, you get a long, fullscreen closeup of the freaky bunny. The steam version censors boobs as well as genitalia, so the H scenes are something you could post on Youtube without raising eyebrows.There's a patch of course, but it's not a free and easy patch (like Hunie Pop). In fact, as of right now, the game is selling for $2.40 (on sale from $4) and the patch costs $5.85 (on sale from $12). On the forums, there are people looking for a free patch, and they're getting shamed, along the lines of ""the developers worked hard on this, if you're going to steal rather than support them, why stop at pirating just the patch and not the whole game?"" Yea, I'm sure it was twice as hard for the developers to back out the censorship as it was to make the game. Idk. Certain community members seem to think the explicit content is a DLC.Well, there is a community patch(http://steamcommunity.com/app/665180/discussions/0/1471967615843591758), and while I had some difficulty downloading it at first, it does appear to work to the point of restoring the typical japanese mosaics instead of the freaky bunny (I've only gone through the first scene, but I assume it works for all). But if the developers are treating the H-scenes as DLC, I suppose it's possible they'll push out an update that breaks the patch or try to have it removed.The game itself is a bland jrpg, with a really bad translation, but about what you'd expect for $2.40. The H scenes seem pretty tasteless, although perhaps they're just not my style. At this cost, I couldn't justify a bad review for just those elements. But selling the patch on another website for twice the cost of the game is just sleazy."

There's absolutely no enjoyment to be had here, even in an H-RPG, when the translation is so♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. I really should have learned from Material Girl, but I wasn't thinking.I know it's only 3 bucks or whatever for the game, but you're better off taking that money and supporting someone like m1zuki on Patreon or something. That guy does extremely high quality fan translations, and releases everything for free.I'd love to continue buying the games they release on Steam, but SakuraGame needs to significantly improve the English translations in the future for that to happen. Pay someone to do it if you must.Not Recommended because of poor English Translation."
,Not Recommended,665180,34096089,Posted: 7 August,all,Vodoka,"Bad translation, etc. You know what you are getting, this is SakuraGame release.So what else does Dark Elf offer?Pretty much just really bland RPG Maker adventure. There's no interesting world here, just adventure backdrop for some fantasy themed sexings.It's also worth pointing out that this one one of those ""lose to ♥♥♥♥"" games, and since the game is so insanely easy, if you are not actively trying to lose, you'll be going through the game without seeing a single sex-scene. Congratulations, you just played a bland JRPG with horrible translation.Granted, the game does one interesting thing. From the store description, you might think that at some point the story diverges, and titular Dark Elf might fall to depravity. Well, if you are playing the game without losing, you will never see this happen. But losing against specific mission-end bosses will make you get sex-scenes, and cause the story to diverge. But if you don't know who you need to lose against, it's just a crapshoot of suiciding on battles.Since the porn is pretty much the main deal of the game, might as well go over that too.You get very standard stuff here. Heroine is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥or coerced into sex, and she eventually ends up ""liking"" it as scenes progress. The art isn't anything to write home about, and I've never been fan of girl looking absolutely miserable during sex, which is the standard in these games.Personally I'm not the fan of the scenes, or the art. And since translation is what it is, the writing will not be very erotic either. Though it can be pretty funny at points, so I guess that is a plus.Again, you get what you pay for. Which is sub-par release. I guess if you are poor, and absolutely need your fix of fantasy-themed♥♥♥♥♥♥porn, might as well go for this? But in any other situation, don't."

,Recommended,665180,34269364,Posted: 15 August,all,末原 恭子,"Before anything else, let me first disclose how much it will cost you to play this game with full uncensored experience (well some are still censored for some reason but anyway), it's about 8.46 usd. If you buy this from steam, you will find out that h-scenes (if you don't know what h means then stay away from this game) aren't included. You need to buy the DLC from another site (dlsite) to play the full game.Now to the review!The game itself is quite complex for your standard eroge. If you play it right, by right I mean as a righteous Dark Elf who only wants to save the kingdom, then you might not even see one single h-scene despite having downloaded the upgrade. If you play the game, even more right, which means going around looking for guys to knock you up and screw you over by failing missions purposely, then this game turns into 'that' game which demands you to play it with headphones on and with one hand free, preferably your dominant hand.Story is very basic with the lingering theme of coexistence between basically 2 races (monsters and humans where 'monsters' are elves, orcs, tentacle plants etc). There's an evil king and it's up to you to either screw with him or... get screwed by him, if you know what I mean. The plot advances through a quest system which will feel very familiar to veteran players of RPG games.Gameplay is also very basic, go to quest giver, do quest, return to quest giver. Fighting interface is your standard turn based RPG system, the game of gentlemen! At the start you and your enemies get 1 turn each, but if you have enough agility, you can perform 3 turns. If you're the honorable dark elf who wants to rid the world of these evil orcs, you'd thank the devs for the agility mechanic slashing their weewees off before they can even stand up. But if you're the dank elf who wants to be covered with white sticky glue all day, you'd hate it because the gooey gooey bits usually happen after you get beat... which gets harder when your opponents take forever to attack and then miss when they do. I've played as both! If you want to experience both worlds I advice to play as the honorable dark elf first, just for the story. Then, on your second playthrough, the game gives you a suicide button anyway as it knows you'd want to spread your legs wider than a dead frog on a roadkill just to get those CGs!Graphics. Well... what can I say? After playing games that have really redefined graphics, going back to these outdated 2d graphics is a litte awkward. BUT, it at least works! The characters who matter, by matter i meant those who you'd want to see get nailed and pounded to the ground, look very beautiful. The CGs where properly drawn, cut scenes were properly animated and the overworld graphics isn't too bad either. It's not amazing, but for what it wants to give us, it's just okay.Now for the elephant in the room, no I don't mean the metaphorical use of 'elephant' for a man's sexual appendage, i mean the other one. The English translations. Fortunately I know Japanese so after seeing the abomination that is the translation of this game, I immediately switched back. There's just no denying it, the translation is shayt! Those motherfawkers out there who say 'Persona 5 translation is shayt doiiiiii' you... don't know... what shayt means. This game's translation is shayt! Names of the same person are mentioned over and over with different spelling each time that you'd think it's about a different person! I- I just don't know how to explain it. It's just... it's shayt! How do you explain shayt? It's something that comes out of an animal's sphincter ... it's brown... and it smells. It's just so... bad, it's worse than my attempt here to misspell swear words just so that steam won't heartify it!So overall, do I still like the game? Yes. Despite the translations I still like and recommend the game. It's just worth it for how much they're asking for. Seeing how many ways the developers made it that you can get yourself fawked, literally, is just err... with a lack of a better word, fulfilling. And before one of you feminists go 'you're a sexist for liking this game doiiiiii' I'm a girl and I liked it and had a lot of laughs playing it. I also draw H-doujins, these kinds of contents aren't exclusively for men only! In conclusion, I recommend this game just for people to experience what an eroge is. If this becomes successful, who knows, the better ones from Japan might make it in steam too.Edit: I forgot to note that this game only makes use of the keyboard, so your left hand. This game is very friendly for right handed people!"

,Not Recommended,665180,34045555,Posted: 5 August,all,Lumina,"My review will stay negative until there is an update to the game so that you can switch it to the uncensored version without having to go onto websites and download patch's etc.Why put the game as a R18 rating and do a big disclaimer at the beginning about you having to be 18+ and that it contains sex etc. if the game is just going to be censored and contain nothing, I hope they change this in the future and an option is added in game for you to switch to what version you want but I will not hold my breath.Even in some visual novels on steam I have come across there is a file in the games folder location called ""Patch.pny"" and if you edit it and change ""true"" to ""false"" after the censorship bit, when you next load up the game you are playing the uncensored visual novel.If the game is going to be advertised in a uncensored way and have tags also relating to that than there should be an option in game or in the games files to change it to that so people can get what they want.Edit: Since my negative review according to some is unjustified it seems I shall add more to it to appease them, the english translation is quite bad, one of the worst I have seen, even though they removed all of the explicit scenes they kept explicit dialogue in and without the scenes to back them up they just seem like a childish addition and even though they removed the explicit system they kept the ""H-profile"" on your menu where you can view all of the stats for the system they removed, so you get a nice reminder every time you open the menu that you are not playing the full game. The story is pretty much non existant and there is not really much to the characters.I only played 2 hours of the game but the quest system in that time is literally just running back to the same building, talking to the same guy and getting all the quests from him, whether they actually add any depth to the questing after teh 2 hour mark I do not know"
76561198170769059,Not Recommended,665180,34125497,Posted: 9 August,all,Crossforge,"A couple of days ago I posted a rather brief and harsh review of this game, without going into detail why I think it sucks. I deleted that review and decided to give this game another chance for some strange reason.  I believe it’s a sign that I need to get out more.Well, I finished the game to the end and it still sucks.Let’s get this out of the way first, this was not made by Sakuragames, this is not a game that was built for steam, and abides for the most part by steam rules.  Though there are some patches out there that will give you access to the naughtier stuff that still remains softcore.This was made by oneone1 a sleazy hentai company that makes rpg maker made games of debatable quality.  And like so many other hentai games you find on steam, came out and while ago, and are now coming out censored in order to abide by steams policies about this sort of thing. But they’ll gladly uncensor it for you for a price, that’s right, you have to pay them through another sit to get a dlc patch, or play a 3.00 censored and bland rpg maker game, as this game clearly sells itself on its hentai value.Quite frankly I’m a little saddened that Sakuragames partnered up with a company with such shady business practices.  As Sakuragames have been more than fair with their own products.   Any naughty patches for their games are provided free of charge.  Their games can be obtained for less than Starbucks expresso.   And if that wasn’t enough Sakuragames has a refund policy that goes beyond what Steam offers.  That’s right, even if you payed $2.00 you can get it back (which they've done with this game as well).So to see them partner up with oneone1 who tries to bilk you out of more money is a little like your favorite publisher getting tied to EA.Some folks have taken upon themselves to offer an unofficial patch.  Whether or not you consider it piracy I leave as a debate to others, and believe me they ARE debating this on the forums.But whether you go into this game steam lite, unofficial or officially patched you have to options for the main character.  Play the virgin or become a depraved sex addict, those are you two choices, Oh sure the game does have multiple paths you can try.  But that’s what you got in the end.So how do you get to walk on the naughty side?  Well gang that’s the best part, you need to let the dark elf get sexually assaulted by at least one boss monster.  That’s right no consensual one night stands here.  *Sigh* Look I get that some people are into this♥♥♥♥♥♥fanstasy stuff.  Much as I’m tempted to get on my SJW horse, I did willingly buy this game and play it, so I’m not one to cast stones.   I just wish this kind of thing didn’t dominate the Hentai market.  I mean is there hentai out there that doesn’t employ rule 34, 35 and 36 at once?But be warned you got to really be into it because the game force feeds it to you, in graphical detail with scenes you can’t skip.  There is a Skip option in the menu but that only lets you skip scenes you’ve already played.So let me repeat that you want to play the virgin side, by beating ever boss in the game then no naughty for you. Instead you’ll play a short and mediocre Rpg maker experience that is poorly translated.   But if you want the naughty you have to let the elf lose.Once she “losses her innocence” she can never get it back, you don’t have a choice her because the game starts having some of the monsters auto assault the  elf which takes her further down the corrupt path, and there’s nothing you can do about it.  But hey, if you want you can adjust the menu to skip the in combat hentai scenes, so, good job with the minuscule options oneone1.If that isn’t enough the game will start forcing the elf to take demeaning contracts she can’t avoid, to be treated to more graphical hentai scenes you can’t skip.  Oh and if you manage to defeat the final boss, well the fun doesn’t end there, but why spoil it for you.And all that punishment for the “crime” of getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at best this is shoddy workmanship on oneone1’s part, at worst this continues a disturbing social trend of blaming the victim.So yeah, don’t buy this."
,Not Recommended,665180,34512849,Posted: 26 August,all,Ishman,"Interesting game from Oneone1, saddled with a machine translation by a lazy Chinese company.I'm conflicted on recommending it because I'd love to see more stuff coming to the west, but no right-minded person should support such an abyssmal effort.Incidentally the game is riddled with bugs due to the machine translation altering much of the triggers from firing due to flipping slashes around in the script files.And no, you can't fix it because Oneone1 encrypt's his scripts.Edit: The people responsible for the 'translation' forgot to reencrypt the script files, so you CAN fix them. Have at it. Extracting the original japanese to more easily effect a real translation would require breaking the encryption on the non-steam release however."

My issues with this game are:  The dialogue/translation from Japanese to English was terrible.  The story was bad.  The game was short.  There was zero strategy and though the description of the game claims there is nudity, there is none.  I really don't care if there was cartoon nudity, but don't say there is nudity and then remove it from the game.  Also it appears that half of the game has been disabled because all the sex that can be tracked via game stats is not in this game.  All in all, you can get a better Hentai game by going on Google and typing in Hentai and then picking a game.... and for free."

Clutching your babes to your breast.King Auckolus has marched his legions into our lands... Laid siege to every fortress from here to the Blue Mountains.. Rabid and ravenous, he bites and bites away.Men of the north, you stand at the precipice! Your kings have failed you, so now you turn to the gods! And yet you do not plead? You do not kneel to dust your heads with ash? Instead you wail, ""Why have the gods forsaken us?""We must look into the trials we failed long ago!In a time past, our world intertwined with another through an upheaval scholars call the Conjunction of the Spheres...The gods allowed unholy forces to slip into our domains. The offspring of that cataclysm was the nefarious force called magic...Yet we did not banish it, instead studying the vile arcane for our own power and wealth! And the monsters at our door... the unholy relics of this Conjunction?...the orcs... the floral corpse eaters... the demons? Did we raise our swords against them? Or have we laid this burden on others?On so-called Dark Elves... Stray children taught the ways of foul sorcery, their bodies mutated through blasphemous ritual. Sent to fight monsters they could not distinguish good from evil. The flicker of humanity long extinguished within them.Yes, their numbers have dwindled throughout the years. But still few roam our lands, offering their bloody work for coin. To this day they shame us with their very existence!The north bleeds, flogged by war! The battles are the gods' whip, chastisement for our sins!And let us not forget the terrors, the scourges from beyond our world! The wings of darkness rule the skies with every full moon! The dark raiders abduct our children into lands unknown! Some say they herald a second Conjunction!Can we chart a course back into the light? Will we find the strength to banish the mages from our kingdoms? Unite around the warmth of the Eternal Fire?Nigh is the Time of the Sword and Axe! None will fight this war in our stead!

,Recommended,665180,34158064,Posted: 10 August,all,Jackster,"LOL. Where should I start?Well for one, I got this when it was on sale for about 2 dollars and something cents. Now I see that it's now back to it's original price of 4 dollars. So this review is going to be based off what I paid for.It's an RPG maker game with RPG maker sprites, graphics. A little improvement and original graphics (I think). Whenever I try to sprint, there seems to be a little lag. I haven't experience lag while sprinting in other RPG maker games. It can be annoying.Secondly, you can easily tell that the creator or translator of this game isn't fluent in English so the dialogue kills the vibe from the H-Scenes. However, you can easily get the gist of a sentence.Unlike many RPG maker games, there seems to be effort put into combat. It's not just pictures of enemies and the basic attack scenes like a line slicing across the enemy picture. The main character actually moves her body when attacking, defending, and dodging. However, a lot of the enemies are the same sprites you see in basic RPG Maker games.But of course, there are pros to the game. First off, despite the not-so-great English, the story is pretty good despite many other games having similar stories about wars and orphans. Also, there is a voice over that fits perfectly for this character. Despite the stupid rayman looking creatures and flowers covering her body, the H-Scenes are awesome. This game is a good time waster for the price you pay. You do get into it and it's pretty entertaining."

So far so good, the censorship is kind of terrifyingly funny (it's a giant rabbit with a **** eating grin) The battles are nicely animated, and I like the way they flow. Not too far into the game, but basically you play as a Dark Elf in a world with racial bias against you. You are a mercinary that takes on various jobs to earn a living and support the the boy you saved when he was little. Not a bad game, and it's very inexpensive, so it you like JRPGs and boobs then it's not a bad little game."

But after playing it for a couple of hours I didn't find any H scenes, and read that unlocking those is the stupidest way of implementing porn into a game ever. And of course, once I did start getting them, they are not even good H scenes. Just don't but this garbage, or anything else these ""devs"" produce.

,Recommended,665180,34024026,Posted: 4 August,all,Yuuki-Chan Mercy Main,"Dark Elf is a new game from the publisher SakuraGame and once again proves to be a fantastic title.I will start off however by saying that the game in terms of dialogue does not hold a candle to the earlier work of Material Girl. When buying the games by this publisher I expect and hope for the google translate level of english that came from Material Girl. Dark Elf delivers for the most part with the english making for hilarious dialogue and the config menu is very difficult to understand. Punctuation and grammar is improved in terms of understandability from Material Girl which is a bit of a shame.This game has some good hentai themes that are very similar to that of Dragonia. If you go down the ""dark path"" early in the game you will run into many H scenes that have the same hilarious rabbit and flower censors that are found in Dragonia. Unfortunately this game, before an R18 patch, actually does censor the nipples which is a bit of a letdown in that regard.Gameplay is standard rpg maker stuff and not too interesting. This game is meant for the dialogue. The music and sounds are whatever. But honestly you arent buying this for the gameplay.Overall its pretty good I like it.End my suffering."

He told me this was a bible story telling interactive game. To my surprise, he committed a sin and told me a lie. His father. The one that gave him life. After doing my research I found out this game was FULL OF SIN! Nude women!? Violence?! How is this even allowed on the Steam Store? I am disgusted at both my son and the people who are in charge of what is allowed in the steam store. This game was featured on the trending page for Christ sake! (forgive me Lord God for using your name in vain). I would like my money back and the game ""Dark Elf"" to be permanently removed from the steam store. I thought this was a christen platform. I am both repulsed at Steam and the game developers for trying to infect the pure christen mind of my son. In conclusion, I am convinced that there is no saving the youth from wanting to see those sweet SWEET, busty, double D anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.-With God always, Bob Jones"

Apologies in advance if I offend anybody else's sensibilities by speaking my mind.When I saw the title pop up in the list of new releases, I was happy, expectant. A game titled ""Dark Elf"" surely had to be celebrating the glory of this dark-skinned, pointy-eared race of beautiful fantasy humanoids. It had to be elegant, maybe a bit haughty, but truly stunning to behold.At that point, I did not even care an ounce about the gameplay. Who really needs super-extravagant gameplay when there are Dark Elves to be had?Ever since Record of Lodoss War showcased the marvelous Pirotess, Dark Elves had a special spot in my heart. I even collected Warhammer Fantasy Battles' Dark Elves/Druchii, even though they were pale-skinned as their Ulthuanian High Elf cousins (which was not a surprise, considering how much of their land of exile is covered in snow). Chloe and Origa Discordia were heroes of their people before the Black Dog band came and ruined their lives. Sansei Muramasa from Full Metal Daemon even made it into Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel, which recently released on Steam. She showcases yet another example of Dark-Elvish grace. Yao Haa Dushi also showed the stoic might of her people in GATE: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri, and life was good at Alnus.I hope you can understand my excitement to a degree. These dark coffee-toned beauties are a sight to behold, and one easily appreciated.But then I saw this game, played it even, and my disappointment, nay,offenseknew no bounds.This is no Dark Elf. Fraylia, or Frelia, whichever spelling in the game is actually supposed to be true, is no Dark Elf. I find the game's premise utterly deceptive. At best, she is aToast Elf, who had a light tan from going to the solarium for a few hours. Maybe she even just used some tan-lotion (which might explain the light-spots on her skin?).Dark Elves Matter, dear developers.They are an already marginalized people who always stand in the shadows of their High Elven cousins in popular media. They are rarely considered to be included. Every piece of multimedia involving them is a rare gem, especially in western regions. This..... blatantwhitewashing, is inexcusable.How could you do this? Why did you do this? I will never understand it.I will not refund this game because I believe that the designers of this game were merely misguided, rather than held malicious intent. Rather than refunding, I would prefer my voice as a customer be heard for future reference. Please make Dark Elves great again?"

But the voice clips played at the start and end of every battle is extremely repetitive.But the ""breasts""... the so-called breasts which look more like a pair of gigantic grapes ruin the hentai scenes for me. But hey if you're into grotesque boobs then this'll be perfect for you.This is the only game I've ever played where I'd rather play the non-hentai path.And the sweat on the bodies (I'm assuming it's supposed to be sweat) doesn't look like sweat at all, more like dilluted blood.Playing hentai-mode makes the game funnier though, with random sex scenes in battles.And the sex stats are a fun addition, even though they are terribly inaccurate :DThe game has been machine translated: Google translate, copy, paste, save, close.No edits or fixes whatsoever, one NPC could have at least 3 different names (France, Mr. Frans, francois for example) and plenty of typos."

76561198047378722,Not Recommended,665180,34015204,Posted: 4 August,all,Teruyo,"EDIT :This review is quite long so Im posting my edit here because I think it's quite important. I've been quite nice in my review as I've seen this as the botched translation attempt of a nice H-RPG. But I had to reconsider my position and stop recommending this game after constating the following :1.The uncensor patch sold on DLsite English doesn't uncensor battlers (sprite of characters during battle). From what I gathered this is NOT intentional, but it is a big mistake for a paid patch.2.The game has bugs that'll crash the game wich aren't in the original version, most likely a result of the aforementioned bad translation. This is BAD and I can't recommend the game in this state.Play the japanese version on DLsite if you can read japanese or if you aren't bothered by using a machine translator and a text hooker. But this Steam version is a joke. I can forgive a lot of things, but not bugs.------------------------------Im a big fan of ONEONE1 and haven't played much of the game yet, but I can say some things right of the bat so here's an early preview.First, it's a japanese H-RPG made on RPG maker. And a lot of RPGMaker's original assets are still used. So if this kills it for you then don't bother. The uncensored version will be released the 05/08 on DLSite english for 6$, while the original game (that you can also buy on DLSite) costs 9$.Welcome to the wonderful world of japanese amateur porn games. Now that the price, patch and RPGM issues are dealt with, let's dig in.The biggest reason to get this game is the translation. H-RPG have a fair amount of text so a translation is fairly important in order to be able to enjoy them properly. And I have to say that the translation is ATROCIOUS. Sometimes so badly translated that it changes the meaning of some sentences. I've played many H-RPG with amateur translations, and this ""professional"" translation manages to be worse.It's not as bad as a machine translation, but it's barely better. Really disapointed by the abysmal quality of the work done there.The game itself follow the standard template of the latest ONEONE1 games :-Voiced main character. Wich is one of the best things about these games. The elf is entirely voiced, including lewd scenes.-Fighting system is his usual active time battle system. Nothing really new here, you have one character with a lot of skills and you have to use the right ones depending on the ennemies weaknesses. Nothing to write home about.-Battle r*pe. Like in his other games, the ennemies can initiate ""H-Attacks"" that make them r*pe the main character. Unfortunately they also have the same downside of being so fast that they aren't fappable.-Multiple Routes : You have 5 endings as well as multiple routes, including a virgin route. So you've got a fair bit of content there.-H-events : Like in all H-RPGs, you have pornographic events triggered by story progression, talking to NPCs, working certain jobs or losing a fight. Some are short events with generic cut-ins that may change depending on how lewd the heroine gets (not far enough to confirm it), some are longer events with full illustrations.Overall I think it's a pretty good H-RPG with an awful translation. If you're okay with that then I recommend it as ONEONE1 is one of the best amateur H-RPG devs in my opinion (along with Ankoku Marimo, Clymenia and Scale's Garden).If you can't deal with such a bad translation, then don't bother. I really hope they'll step it up for the next games."
