,Recommended,665330,34054935,Posted: 6 August,all,Jin,"Got Booked for a Lightweight Title Defense match against a guy called Earthquake who's build was *Obese* and was 6'6"" tall. The match started and the ref started to hit me for bumping into him, so I had to defend from two different people. Everytime Earthquake would pin me the ref would count fast, but If I tried to pin Earthquake he would count slow. Eventually I got tired of his♥♥♥♥♥♥and beat his♥♥♥♥♥until he got injured so they had to call in Andre the Giant to be a special ref because the other guy wouldn't get up off the floor. After I finally beat Earthquake, and the end of match results came up saying that the ref (not Andre the Giant) ended up suffering from a deadly injury and died later on.10/10 would defend lightweight title against a morbidly obese wrestler and kill the ref in the process for trying to screw me out of my title defense match again."
,Not Recommended,665330,33677005,Posted: 20 July,all,Haggleman,"Unfortantly while I would like to recommend this game being a fan of the developer's work for many years now I can't because of a game breaking bug where the game runs at 25% of it's intended speed. (15fps should be running at 60fps) This makes controling the game very sluggish and the animation very jerky.Without the bug Wrestling Revolution 3D would be a fantastic indie developer effort that adds plenty to the wrestling gendre as a whole. Has one of the most intresting carear modes you will ever find in a game of this type allowing the player to either become a wrestler or a wrestling promotion owner and with all the pitfalls you'd might expect from your chosen carear path. This game does not sugarcoat the problems that can happen like an WWE game might.Also you can have 30 man hardcore, dual ring battle royales if you wish..."
,Recommended,665330,33684937,Posted: 20 July,all,DestructionHerbie,"Edit: Minor update regarding multiplayer... though major implications for those who might otherwise purchase.---------I have played dozens of hours of this on mobile, as well as the old Wrestling MPire games from the old PC days (Hell, I even actually paid money for a few of them before Mat made them freeware).  I am glad it is now available on Steam!  There's a jankiness to Mat's game which I happen to be fond of, and with his return to the PC the modding community should be able to make this a real beast.As of standard, there are hundreds of wrestlers based on real-life counterparts which can be completely changed in regards to looks, appearance, movesets, and music.  The match options are quite varied, with my personal favorite being the  ""Last Man Standing"" match in the Office setting... nothing quite like winning a match by throwing your opponent through a window!Career mode does not really have an end goal, as you just go until you just decide you've gone the distance you want (provided you are successful) or you run out of money to live the life of a wrestler.  Matches are randomly assigned to you, but you have the option of booking your own matches if you can find someone willing to tangle with you (even people from other promotion).  You can negotiate your contact, decide to turn on people who were your friends, increase your stats by doing it the hard way of training or the ""easy"" way of steroids.  You can party with the boys to increase your friendships, but at the cost of possibly not being work a damn for your match next week.  Could use some choice and scripting updates, but perhaps that can come in time or in mods.As an aside, I think it was eliminated from the mobile game due to occuring too much, but something I would kind of like brought back as an option would be the ability to die.  Other wrestlers can die in-game (sometimes from a severe beating or accident which happens in a match, other times accidents outside of the ring), but I think now the worst which can happen to you is being crippled and driving your stats to hell.  Even without you being able to have your own wrestler killed, it is still the most potentially grim career mode you can play.Booking mode is just that... you book the shows, hire/fire the talent, etc..  If you desire, the results and ratings of the show can be simulated, or you can take control of anyone and everyone to determine the entire card.  You can be fired as a booker if your show sucks or if the owner just decides he/she/it doesn't like you, but generally putting on quality will keep you going forward.Training mode is functional enough, and is more detailed than I remember on mobile.  It could do with a few tweaks.Namely A) disallow intereference during the training session, B) Disable ""injuries"" during training, and C) some kind of counter or timer established when you have met the prerequisites for completing a training objective.  A newbie might get the impression the session simply isn't advancing because they only dodged 5 times instead of whatever number the coach is looking for.There are issues with the game, but I will address the biggest one since I worry of its impact on sales and reviews... and that is the framerate.  It is not a limitation of my hardware, but moreso the framerate being linked to gamespeed.  Its the same rate whether it's just two scrubs in the ring with everything turned down or 30-man, double ring with 30 pieces of furniture and 50 weapons littering the arena.  The framerate is the same.  It only goes up by increasing the ""Game speed,"" which does indeed give a higher frame rate... it also makes the wrestlers turn into the flash on crack.  This will probably be the biggest complaint from us PC Master Race types and may deter the greatest number of people from giving this game the shot it deserves.  Simple looks and feel are quite forgivable nowadays amongst many PC players, but low frame counts are not.  It needs addressing ASAP.Second issue is the lack of online multiplayer.  Realize it is unlikely to ever happen, but it will be a major issue for many wanting to game online with friends... maybe even moreso than the framerate issue.  If there were online capabilities (even a P2P setup since servers would be entirely out) this game would be PRIME for YouTubers just due to how crazy this game can get.Overall I think it's worth the inital asking price, and considering it is on sale right now it is definitely worth my money for an ad-free PC version with mod support.  It is a rather open for potential modding and if successful maybe it will mean a PC port of Weekend Warriors or a more robust wrestling game down the line.  Mat, I still think you should hire a few guys for grunt work while you do the creative, but if a one-man show is what it is then so be it.  Good luck."

I absolutely love MDickie's wrestling games, but so many features are missing from this one, that i just can't recommend it.No gore, no limb loss, no backstage area, and the whole game feels like a crappy alpha. Every time i click the right mouse button, some weird button appears that has no function, and shouldn't be in the game. It feels like i'm in developer mode and i have no idea what i'm doing. And what's up with the game speed? The standard framerate is atrocious, and if i increase the speed in the options menu, the whole game starts to run too fast!So over all, i can't recommend this unless they patch it up, and put the missing features back in. Until then, it's better to just go to MDickie's website, and download Wrestling MPire Remixed. That's what i did anyway, and i'm having fun."

,Recommended,665330,33883858,Posted: 29 July,all,OverlordDarkWolf,"I will be comparing it to Wrestling Mpire Remix for my review.While it doesn't have the dismemberment (there's still death), glass, explosives (like water bottles, beer, camera, and TNT), and other things of WMR, it vastly improves on animations, different types of moves, clothes that you can customize the color of, modding, and camera controls. Custom music is now MP3 as oppsed to wav so the quality of your custom themes won't have to be degraded. As of a recent update, Xinput gamepad controls can be customized. One very major plus is that training is no longer a RNGfest, which I cannot stress how grateful I am for that. The AI is still occasionally a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ though.(EDIT) I forgot to mention that also as of this date, 7/29/2017, that there appears to be only one universe as opposed to WMR's three universe save slots, so be careful when managing your booking career and wrestling career. (END EDIT)The training is now very stat-specific, as opposed to WMR's training which you pick a stat and hope it or any other stat improves. I had such a frustrating time in Wrestling Mpire Remix when training, trying to get a stat up to a requirement or get fired, so I'm glad that changed. Managers can help with training but I just press three buttons in a 1-2-3 sequence and still make it to level three solo. Automated training takes a dive from WMR, though, and you are lucky to have it go past level one without a manager.Custom music is at a 200 limit, as of 7/29/2017, but there are mods to go past that if you wish. You also have to make sure the file isn't too long or large, or if it is 30 seconds or so, loops well enough. Since it's mp3, you no longer have to convert to a very specific bitrate and wav format, so quality should be good.With the character editor's color changing on some outfits, it makes it harder to have the same outfit as someone else. The addition of beards and various hair lengths also add to the degree of customization. The moves have been seperated into different sections and are far more easier to read than WMR's move list, which I am thankful for. Entrance preview is good if you want to see how you set everything up, which WMR didn't have I recall.The AI seems more proactive in this than in Wrestling Mpire Remix, in my opinion. However it can still, on ocasion, adopt a never-give-up attitude, drawing out the match or win against the odds. However, there is a restart match option in the menu so I am also thankful for that. I personally like the challenge and use the health meter as more of a guide line for how the match may go.Overall, I recommend this game if you want a good wrestling simulator, as I definitely had more fun with this than the WWE 2k game I have.Also, on a final note, there are a lot less quirky funny but game ending bugs in this game than, say, Wrestling Mpire Remix's ""fight yourself in a tag match against your self"", or WWE 2k game's ""AI's Brain leaves on vacation so it'll just stand there forever"" style of bugs, which is just sinful since WMR's ai actually tries at doing something."

If you're a fan of MPire this is a must buy; if you've never played it and are on the fence, if you like the older wrestling style games this one harkens back to the 90's style of WWF game move execution.I miss the dismemberment, backstage fights, glass, TNT, and the ability to talk to other wrestlers to arrange fights, tag teams etc. but I'm hopeful those will get added in at some point."

You're stuck playing it on this tiny window because if you resize it, the playing area itself won't change so you'll just have a bunch of empty space and the game itself in a corner somewhere.Those minor complaints aside, one of the best wrestling games I have ever played. I've always loved MDickie's take on the career mode where you start from the bottom and have many companies that can hire you with wrestlers dying and new ones being made. This is all I ever wanted from a wrestling game career mode and the storylines are very dynamic too instead of limiting you to a certain storyline at any given time. Every time you start a new career, your path to the top (or to distruction) is different. The main reason for buying this though is the fact that I dislike paying games on mobile and this game always seemed like a big waste as a mobile exclusive to me.I haven't been brave enough to try out the booking mode in this version though, because I don't know if it's gonna do the same thing it does on the mobile version and have those two separate modes affect one another which, if it can't be avoided, is kinda one more minus side for this game."

It plays out like the old N64 THQ games and is actually a very solid fighting game in its own right, with a lot of variability in the types of matches you can participate in. The editor is not half bad and allows for quite a bit of customization. The campaign mode is hectic, but plays out as a reasonably interesting RPG wherein the outcomes shift depending upon your performance and choices while the larger game world constantly evolves as you go.

,Recommended,665330,34497289,Posted: 25 August,all,Not Finished with You,"After two hours I finally have the roster updated to their real names.This game is a ton of fun. Old school gameplay and graphics with some modern additions, endless match types, and a huge fully-customizable roster in a game that never takes itself or pro wrestling seriously make this a game that any wrestling fan should try.The only downside is the user interface. It's not at all fluid as the menus suffer from being copied directly from the Android version of the game. If this gets fixed I'll give this a higher rating, but as for now it sits at a strong 7/10 that will give you countless hours of entertainment and provide a lot that WWE and 2K Games simply can't.Rating:7/10Update:After another 29 hours I can safely say that this quite possibly the greatest wrestling game ever made. Somehow the game manages to capture the flow and unpredictability that even Yuke's hasn't managed to quite figure out over the past seventeen years. The game isn't too serious nor is it too much of a parody. It's just the right balance, and it surprises me more and more every hour with new move combinations, random events, and even botches happening that change the entire course of your wrestling or booking career. Any wrestling fan should love this regardless of whether they're a casual fan or a lifer like myself.Downloading mods is super easy too in case you actually want real wrestler names and themes rather than the hilarious parodies of those wrestlers. I highly recommend this game along with WRHD and the Real World Mod from WR3Dmods. Everything gets turned up to 11 in the career modes when you're using real people instead of parodies.However, the UI issue is still there, and I hope it gets fixed. MDickie listens to his fans and hopefully this and the occasional camera issues get patched soon to make it feel more like a proper PC game instead of an Android port.Updated rating: 9.8/10Buy this game, give it a few hours, and watch the magic happen."

It may seem very random at times, but you actually need to play as a wrestler who has a high skill level. If you play as a wrestler with a high skill level, they have a better chance at countering/performing moves without error. But anyways, it's a pretty fun game, even though it can be very annoying at times, but it's still fun. My favorite mode is the booking Career mode. I really like booking the matches, setting up the rivalries, and develop the roster overtime. That's all I have to say."

WMP has never been good in that regard, but now it is absolutely unplayable, if you are going for a Booking Career- No sorting features anymore- It's a pain to scroll through the list of wrestlers, since it is designed for Smartphones and not optimized for mouse controls in the least- You can't seem to rename your federation- FPS problems even on high-end systems- Overall Clunkyness (normal for MDickie games and I don't mind as much)- ""Run"" is bound to ""Z"", which is a no-go, since german keyboards have the ""Y"" in place of the ""Z"". Wouldn't be a problem, unless...- ... you can't rebind keys!All in all, I just can not recommend this game on PC at the moment. I will repurchase and recommend this game, once the keyboard&mouse problems are resolved and the menu gets more features in booker mode. All the other issues are something I have expected anyways.As of now, Wrestling Mpire Remix for PC and Booking Revolution for Android are the superior games."

,Recommended,665330,33967687,Posted: 2 August,all,{WeB}*Simo*,"MDickie wrestling is finally on PC and it's great to be part of it again. Having been a 14+ year fan of MDickie games the wrestling has never been better.The wrestling animations are very smooth and there are lots of improvements such as transitioning a wrestler in a grapple and free-flowing attacks such as springboards and dives.Another great feature is the 'charging' of attacks/grapples by holding down the respective buttons. Any MDickie veteran knows timing attacks is important to miss being attacked or grappled because you mis-timed the animations. Holding down the attack button charges your attack for a more powerful version.I would recommend getting the WRHD mod from wr3dmods, this improves the games environment graphics and menus, which really complements the N64 look of the game.More random things can happen during matches also, if you beat up your tag partner too much they may turn on you, or if a make decision is a bit fishy, the ref can restart the match. It's what I would call Classic MDickie scenarios. A pleasant RNG fest that will keep you coming back for more.You can also mod the game to have 100 wrestlers,weapons and items to have some real royal rumbles. Weapons and items can be stacked too like the old Big Bumpz days! 10 stacked tables? It's now a thing. Ladders finally have climbing animations too which is nice!Career has been fleshed out, there's a fresh roster of MDickie parodies (Nakamura, AJ styles, Bray wyatt etc) and these can be changed to their real world varieties thanks to modders (Again, check wr3dmods for these). You can even add .mp3 themes to your music folder now. No more converting them to .wav!Sadly, at the moment some MDickie staples are not present, but no doubt they will be added down the line. No blood drips, dismemberment and classic weapons are missing such as TNT and the glass panes.Modding is a little more restricted but it can be done. A lot of the things need to be edited by opening the main game (which is a compressed Flash file) file in a Flash extractor program. Wrestler costumes can still be added / edited the same way (Jpeg files in the costumes folder). For those who have modded previous MDickie games will know the score.It's classic MDickie and it looks great. The flash based engine is very reliable unlike the old blitz based engine. It runs fine and it has never crashed on me yet after 16+ hours."

,Recommended,665330,33743878,Posted: 23 July,all,Forlorn,"Based on the mobile game of the same name, this simple wrestling game may not look modern, but it has tons of wrestlers based on real people, funny gameplay, and up to 30 in a match at once! You can find the real wrestlers names by checking the Guides on Steam, or searching Facebook. It's got interesting career and franchise modes for when you want to go deeper than chaotic exhibition matches. Even the customization is quick yet satisfying. It's worth the money, even if it's as choppy as a classic or mobile game."
76561198137566501,Recommended,665330,34179833,Posted: 11 August,all,TheLastMethBender,"The first thing I do when starting this game is 'attempt' change the difficulty  to easy to learn the controls and the combat system. I clicked scrolling past all the options until coming to a stop at ""extremely hard"" after which the game wouldn't let me scroll backwards to easy or any other mode. I tried clicking every button on my mouse and keyboard and it would not let me go back. Im now permanently stuck playing the game at the highest levelThis is great, it shows the game dev wanted this game to challenge you to its fullest and symbolizes that life is hard and you can't just push a button to make it easy.  Either that or the dev couldn't figure out how to program a ♥♥♥♥ING basic menu, but thats just silly and highly unlikely.I also like the controller support options. There are two options in the menu ""keyboard"", and ""CPU"". The CPU means you just watch a bunch of AI fight each other, which is great. Way to show that PC master race pride and say ♥♥♥♥ controller support. I personally like the CPU mode the most, its like watching a lets play channel with no commentary.I highly recommend this game. The confusing as ♥♥♥♥ menus add an indie charm.And the loud as ♥♥♥♥ ear bleeding music in the menus is very catchy  This game is so fantastic I don't even feel as if im worthy of playing it, which is why im returning it at a whopping 8 minutes of gameplay (mostly spent in menus)11/10"

Not to mention the fact that wrestlers won't stay down long enough to pull off anything interesting. I'm sorry but It just feels like a game someone made in their basement. It's so bad it almost makes it good. The 30 man battle royal is uncontrollable and all over the place to a point you put your controller down and spectate. But it's sure to make you laugh. So far thats what this game has been good for, a laugh. Which is fine for an hour or 2, but if this game is worth even $10 than Fire Pro Wrestling World is worth $100. It's just on another level of gameplay, animation, fluidity and customization. I unfortunatley regret buying this game which in no way resembles the classic N64 wrestling games as stated."

Now the actual wrestling is the worst part. a little slugish controls seems to go in and out at points. Where the game is getting over is the story mode of trying to become and stay a top guy in the wrestling revolution universe. Anything from getting sick to deaths. You can get labeled neglent and even get kicked out of wrestling school and have to start all over. My first run i made it to the aaw (wwe) beat ""shawn micheals"" to get the belt. Contract was up asked for health and they told me to kick rocks. Gave the belt back to shawn and shortly after got kicked out of wrestling school for failing to get my staminia up to a 80. So everything aside if you are into wrestling like i am its a fun game. The matches can be frustrating and still not 100% sure how to do counters or get out of holds. Another big flaw was trying to hook up paddles to the game. It evuantly crashed my pc everytime we tried to make it work. hope this is helpful and good grappling!!!!!"
