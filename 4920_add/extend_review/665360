,Recommended,665360,34850789,Posted: 9 September,all,stuyven,"Okay, so first off. If all goes well that night, this game can be wildly entertaining and hilarious. Like, gut-ripping, extensive laughs can be had.However, there's a few things that can make the game really f*cking annoying and almost unplayable.The first and most blatantly evident issue I have with this game is that there is no order sometimes. At all. In order for a stand up room or battle room to work, the players have to simply cooperate together so that the performer or performers can tell their jokes or rap their bars, then the audience listens and decides to heckle or vote off from there. However, this rarely happens. You need a room full of the right people. Otherwise, it all goes to sh*t.In most rooms you enter, there's total random chaos. It can be entertaining from time to time, but it mostly makes for a nonsensical and annoying experience. Like, you can jump into a rap battle room and sit there for 45 mins and it will just be kids and dudes screaming, blowing on their mics, and shouting nonsense the entire time. People get voted off for no reason at all, and the people on stage do the same sh*t the audience does. Sure, there will be a laugh or two, but at some point, you think ""Why buy a game with a specific stand up, singing, and rap battle performance theme and just get on to scream ramdonly the entire time?""I'd like to say to the devs that there should be options for the room admins to allow a bit of order. I don't care if some people want to act totally insane in their rooms, but you should be allowed to create an environment in your room where there are some kind of rules.Room admins should be allowed to:*set timers for each person rapping or telling jokes or singing*create an amount of rounds when each person can rap or tell jokes*disable voting or save voting for after said amount of rounds are complete*mute the audience while people are rapping or doing stand up*add beats(if they choose) to be played on a music player within the game and not via speakers into your micAgain, the game is capable of being insane amounts of fun. When people are being cooperative, the stand up can be super hilarious and the battles can be epic as f*ck or hilarious as f*ck. However, it's mostly just everyone cutting each other off to yell inaudibly, screaming nonsense over one another, just voting people off the stage before they've even said anything, and nonsensical choas. If room admins could implement some order to their rooms, then everyone wins because the people who just wanna f*ck around and scream for no reason and say random stuff can have fun in their own rooms and the people who wanna have fun listening to each other's stand up and raps can do the same.At the current state, I can't recommend this game to everyone, then again it's only $5, so I'd say it's worth a try if $5 isn't anyhing to you. But, if the changes I mentioned can be added, this game could be absolutely amazing. I love the concept and I was so stoked when I found out about this game. With it's flaws, I've had moments while playing where I was doubled over on the floor, absolutely dying. And while those experiences were totally worth it, it really sours it when it's mostly jumping from room to room for a few hours until you find one that isn't just screaming and nonsense."

,Recommended,665360,34541790,Posted: 27 August,all,Lifehouse,"Okay so lets get real here.I love the concept of this game and thats why I decided to post this review as a positive one instead of a negative one.The reason is quite simple. It has a lot of potential, if the devs of this game update it a bit.At the moment almost every room is filled with 12-14 year olds that are just being obnoxious or completly racist.I've played it for a hour now and here's a list of things I like:- The ambience, its definately a comedy club- There is a core base of players that actually are trying to do standup, some of which are seriously hilarious.- There's a option that will make the camera go into a more cinematic POV. This is amazing for people that would love to record this game for Youtube. (Keep in mind, im saying youtube on purpose, I would not play this game on twitch because of the obvious streamsnipers that will spill racial slurs and such)- There's a wide variety of character customization options, there's definately stuff there for everyone.- When in a decent room, there's definately room for growth if you are looking to pursue this as a career.The things I hate about this game and/or should be added/changed/fixed:- The obvious squeekers, 12yr olds that just google some racial oneliners.- There's no reward or punishment system in place so its a viscious cycle.- The menu is horrible, you are very limited when it comes to audio settings. Which if you think about it.. is funny cause the audio is the main element here.- While were still on the whole audio thing.. while i was on stage it was so distracting to hear the laughing emotes of the crowd, they are to overpowering. Im thankful for the laughs ofcourse, but they shouldnt be able to overpower the person thats on stage, audio-volume wise.- There needs to be a review system in check which will block little kids from joining the rooms that are actually good.- There needs to be a option to pass on the 'HOST' to whoever the Host wants to pick. I was in a room earlier which was amazing till the HOST had to go, some squeeker got the HOST and just ruined the room.- I'd like to see different bars/clubs/stages added for diversity.There's actually a lot more to be said about this game good and bad. If a dev wants some suggestions or critism then hit me up.Conclusion:Is the game worth it? Yes it is, I imagine this could be hilarious with a bunch of friends. If you are thinking about buying while you are playing solo. Then be sure to follow the development of the game. Cause in its current state it will annoy the people that actually wanna play the game the correct way. So please, if you are buying this game..please don't join the racial slurs and squeekers..I enjoy memes and memers, but this isnt the place. And incase you do want it, host a room yourself and make sure to include it into the title. I'll be sure to steer clear of it.If you found this helpful, please give it a thumbs up."
,Not Recommended,665360,34534911,Posted: 27 August,all,Lichruler,"The concept was a pretty good one. Stand on stage, try to be funny, get heckled, deal with hecklers, continue to try and be funny, and if it fails, get voted off stage.What it ACTUALLY is, is 10 year old kids screaming racial slurs, telling everyone to kill themselves, people with microphones up way to high so no one can hear them, a lot of hatred, people trying to be the center of attention, and no actual way to vote people off the stage.That aforementioned 10 year old screaming at everyone to kill themselves? Yeah, he's center stage, and you can't make him leave unless you're the host.If I wanted that in a game, I'd go play league of legends."

,Recommended,665360,34615414,Posted: 30 August,all,Lt. Apfel-Jouse,"I adore the game, but it has its faults.Pros ✓✓ It is very customisable. While it is limiting at times, you can make characters from scratch, yourself or something from pop culture, with lots of features. Only lacking a beard/moustache picking option.✓ Constant updates, if you have a bug, it will most likely be fixed within weeks/days.Be warned, this is just from the first week of the game being out. I am not aware of the future.✓ Very good modes and nice control of them, if there is a squeaky kid, you can ban, kick, or mute him. This was the thing most needed in the game and I'm glad they implemented it last week.✓ Very funny gameplay, with brilliant execution - however, this is dependant on the lobby. Some lobbies are utter trash, some are godsends.✓ Emotions are included but I would prefer a menu on the bottom like the cheer wheel, sometimes hearing someone's keyboard clicking is a little immersion-breaking.Cons ✗✗ People have really high expectations. The video from Dunkey was of his best moments, from presumably hours of gameplay. That is not going to be your first lobby in the game.✗ Some people are extremely ignorant. Whether it's random kicks/bans or the morons saying 'GET OFF THE STAGE' in the middle of a long joke, you're most likely going to have to resort to one liners.✗ 'Children'So, this game is full of a lot of them. They're going to be saying a lot of unfunny or old jokes that everyone in the lobby hates. You'll eventually find a lobby of them, or a lobby of fun jokesters. If you find a lobby of children with squeaky voices, leave. If you are young yourself, please make your voice at least a little deeper from the character screen.✗ Racial slursBeware of these. They're everywhere. If you don't care, like myself, move on and you'll have fun. However, if you get annoyed by these, they are quite literally going to be in every lobby, regardless.✗ PriceNow, for what it is, this is a reasonable price. It is well priced, but for the state it's in at the moment, it can be a negative factor. Personally, I think the price has paid off.TL:DR;This game is basically for you if you are one or two of the below:Patient, Not Offended Easily, Racist,Narcissistic, Rude or CharmingThe game is sometimes professional, while also being silly at the same time. It's very enjoyable but I am afraid it may fall  into obscurity in due time."

,Not Recommended,665360,34465901,Posted: 24 August,all,Dash,"This game really, really needs more time in the development oven. What I would suggest to the developers is to implement a sort of ""Lineup"" mode. Allow for a larger audience and implement a lineup mode or queue for those who want to get up on stage and actually try a performance and rework the audience interaction system completely because the way things are now just doesn't work.People are constantly up and down off the stage because there is no real structure to the system at all.Jumping in the only populated lobby for a while was a good laugh but it was mainly just banter, racism and questioning why we bought the game. For what it's worth I had a good laugh with those first few really early adopters but I can already see how this is going to go downhill really fast.I really hope this game can become something because we need more asymetrical multiplayer fun out there, but right now this is literally a glorified chat room, and that segues perfectly into my final bit of criticism.If you're going to make a game that is basically an avatar based chat room with a theme, at least make sure the vocal encoder you use is good. I mean, really, we're talking vocal encoding quality on par with what you'd find in a 90s game here.Turns out those were just launch jitters, all the videos of the game I've seen since I wrote this sounded just fine.Really, especially for those on stage, you need as little vocal compression as possible."

Maybe add a detailed room describtion to make it clear to everyone if people actually want to try some stand up comedy. If people just want to fool around I don't mind it, but my experience was that a new guy comes on stage about every 5 seconds, says something like ""my wife left me"" and leaves again. The one guy who actually tried some stand up (he wasn't very good but who cares) got insulted and booed off stage pretty quickly.It would be really nice to have some sort of option where you can select if you actually want to try some comedy stand up. It's also essential to be able to ban people from certain rooms, as people in the audience are able to talk, too* (which is a good thing in general). I'll keep this game and hope this gets sorted out, as the atmosphere and game itself is pretty nice and has potential.*edit: With todays patch you're now able to ban people, so it's no longer an issue."

You could get your friends in on the action too and perform with the dual mic mode, but you could have these sort of sessions with your friends on Discord or Skype; just throwing around a bunch of jokes at each other, but here it's with complete strangers. There is fun to be had though.Surprisingly there is a Singing lobby that I found to be the most enjoyable, since I enjoy songs, but things can get awkward because singing to a bunch of strangers is a little more nerve-racking than simply telling them jokes. In my case, I had no problem, because personally, I like singing. Experience in this lobby may vary.At the price of $5 it seems reasonable for a few laughs, but Lighthouse Games needs to find a way to give this game longevity with future updates.*I will give this game a thumbs up, because I enjoy this game rather than being annoyed with it, but keep in mind that you will have to search for a lobby with a good host who will ban anyone trolling to have a fun experience.* The following are some suggestions I think can help this game get better in the future.-The game can benefit from a 'performance queue' where the people who want to perform can put themselves on a waiting queue, rather than being the first to press the 'perform' button as soon as the person is done on stage.-Comedy Night should also add a point system, to make it more like a game and less like an elaborate chat room. Yes there is the audience vote where you can get a guy off the stage, but maybe add a karoeke mode and have a final score range from 0-100. Just something to have the game be more engaging."

Oh my did I have fun customizing my character, you even get to choose a voice modifier which for people with deep voices will make it 10 times funnier for the audience.-The art style makes it a lot better-You can control your character's facial expressions with W,A,S,D and ,Z,X,C,R,F,V. Sounds complicated but it really isn't.-You can ban people-Most of the time is actually is quite scary getting up on stage in front of people.-You can find extremely funny people and get to be their friend.-Game modes... Kinda. Not only do you have a standard 1 mic comedy show, but you can also have a dual mic show! Which makes for some great times when you have 1 person setting the joke up and the other person ready to knock it down. That's not it though, you can have rap battles and singing shows.-I couldn't find actual bugs that affected my gameplay.CONS-A lot of the time you will get boos for not reason and people just talking trash about you like ""Kill yourself get off the stage"" and other slurs. That has happened about 7 times to me.-Random bans. Some people will ban you from their lobby for no reason.- Unfunny kids that stay on the stage for ages and the host does nothing about it.-YOU CAN'T VOTE KICK PEOPLE OFF THE STAGE OR OUT THE LOBBY.I may updateOverall opinion: The game offers laughs all the time, no matter what lobby you join. Does it live up to the price at the moment? Kind of, the price could be slightly less but if you want it, it is a fine price. I think it is one of my favourite games at the moment."

,Not Recommended,665360,35120186,Posted: 21 September,all,Kae Teh Gunbunn,"TL;DR: It's like trying to tell jokes in a YouTube comments section.This game provides a quirky and fun platform for people to take the spotlight with a small audience. The premise is very unique and I really give the developer props for making something so original. If you can get a large enough group of your friends together, this has the potential to be a fun game. I've had a few good moments with a few decent audiences. My favorite time was when three of us changed our profile names to different U.S. Presidents, dressed our characters like them, and did political jokes. Hilarious!I'll say this first. I've done real life stand up and improv at comedy clubs when they have amateur nights. People in 'real life' will generally be respectful and let a person tell their jokes. The best that can happen is roaring laughter and people buying you drinks for making them smile. The lack of laughter or throwing up drunk usually would be the worst thing that can happen. So in that case everyone can still have a great time tossing around new jokes without worrying about too many unruly people, whom are always promptly asked to leave.However, that's not what it's like in this game. At no fault of the developers, there is one fatal flaw...  The other players.It's a shame that it only allows 14 people in any given session, but it's also a blessing in disguise. In great contrast to real life, the majority of random players that you find in Comedy Night sessions are not respectful at all. It's a roll of the dice if you get an audience that will listen to people's jokes, or rather just boo and heckle every person that gets on stage because they want their turn to make noises in the mic. Usually it's the latter. Most admins don't police their sessions, and let audience members be loud and boisterous to the point you can't hear the person on stage. In most rooms, if you take longer than 30 seconds to tell a joke, ""get off the stage"" is often shouted. I don't have to participate to witness all of  this. They do it to everybody.The majority of people telling jokes are reading them from websites, so you'll hear jokes repeated quite frequently after an hour or so. If they aren't doing that, they're mostly spewing some of the most vile garbage you'd ever hear just to get an edgy response. This includes badly delivered jokes about racism, sexual assult, pedophilia, sexism, holocaust denial, 9-11, cats and dogs living together. Mass hysteria. Others like to play loud sounds from YouTube, scream, fart, or make any manner of strange noises into the mic. The community for this game became cancerous very quickly. I told myself that if I have to hear another 12 year old yell racial slurs at the stage, I'll uninstall this game... and I did.This game requires more features for controlling the crowds. As admin you can kick or ban them, but due to the low player count, you wont be able to fill up the 14 seats if you keep banning people. I'd like the ability to mute the entire audience so everyone has a chance to perform without interruption. There are nearly a dozen buttons for audience reactions like laughing, cheering, clapping, booing, and even crickets! This should be more than enough to gauge how good or bad everyone's jokes are. This game is doomed due to being filled with people that would be kicked out of any REAL comedy club in a heartbeat.Edit #1: I'm happy the devs responded to this review. I stand corrected that the game has a feature to mute the entire crowd. Still wish that this wasn't nessesary. They have promised future changes in the coming weeks. I'll still take a break from using this game, but will keep an eye out for improvements made. I'll rewrite my review if there is better crowd control in place than simply client-side muting or blanket muting the room. Might I suggest a banlist that is stored on each player's account? That way it would remember who you banned and auto-add them to sessions you create."

I really think that that the organized rooms that have hosts have a massive potential to make this game viral in the comedy world. It's esssentially a digital alt room and I haven't laughed as hard as I have even at real open mics. This game just needs a few updates to it: possibly add a button like holding down the space bar to let out a digital laugh that doesn't interrupt the comic too much but to at least have a real time laugh that let's the comedian know if it's funny.  Plus rules for rooms like timed sets and actual host awareness. If the game developers go to any open mic they will get an idea on how to update these rules I'm sure. Another important thing is to somehow fix the  volume leveling because some people are too quiet and some are way too loud; an option to turn some people down or up would work.

,Recommended,665360,34570338,Posted: 28 August,all,PankcakePiledriver,"This game has A LOT of potential and with some more development could really be something special and new.Yes, there is a lot of toxic community to sort through at the moment, but if the game devs continue to develop this game and players with a passion for real comedy help build better communities, it could be a gem for people that really want to give standup a try.We just had a pretty great comedy session in which people took turns telling 5 min embarassing stories from their lives and a lot of them turned out to be hilarious. However, it took a heavy hand from the mod to sort out hecklers, players with an attention span of less than 10 seconds and those that just wanted to yell obscenities to a hostile and bored crowd (usually all the same players), but once we got a good crowd of people that actually wanted to be IN on the game, we had a great time and a lot of laughs.I know the devs have mentioned that they want to add the ability to make private rooms, which I think would be a great addition for players wanting to build real comedy communities or just keep out the riff-raff.Also, I think it would be good to add the ability to change the name of the room or to add a 'subject' line for the room. As people come and go, different topics or comedy games come up and it would be good to advertise that to players in the lobby that might be interested. In our case, we landed on 5 min story-time. Having multiple categories like Beginner, Pro, Dual, etc. are good, but it might be fun to give players the optiton to set some of their own rules within the categories.Lastly, good mods will be needed to help build these communities and really allow this game to shine. They'll need to be people with a passion for real comedy beyond that of shock value that many players currently tend towards. There's a lot of potential here. I think between devs and players something really great can be built.PS. I saw mention of players asking for tomatoes to throw. That'd probably be pretty funny to add as well.PSS. Some players mentioned wanting the ability to control the volume of other players as you may not want to mute, but just turn them down to balance them with the rest of the group."

Being that this every comedian in this game is a real person, it is entirely player base controlled. This sounds promising at first that the deveoper put so much trust in the creativity of its players; unfortunetly, this also presents its challenges. My expierience with this game was nothing short of abysmal. There seems to be an extreme lack of order and structure to the comedy in this game. Anyone can join any comedy room without a code or without any requirements and this allows anyone regardless of who they are to join a room.I was expecting people to tell original and innovative humor, however I received the opposite. For some reason, the majority of individuals in this game that I have encounted are outright unethical, ignorant and inconsiderate. People will scream obscenities into their mic while a comic is performing. People will tell stale jokes about ""ground beef"" and ""hebrews"" to the point of driving a sane man mad. Some indivuals will go so far as to put their microphone into the bathroom with them and will announce their defication for everyone else to hear.My expierience may differ greatly from yours, as there are different people on this game at different times, however I can guarantee you will encounter ignorant, disgusting people somewhere in the game at some point. Save your money and either wait until the developer improves the game to allow for a better community or, perhaps you enjoy anarchy and old jokes for 4.99."

It's just another one of those games that sounds good conceptually, but blows when you actually play it. Most of the people are just spouting boring jokes from places like reddit, it's clear half the people have their phones out, literally looking up jokes while they play. I mean, c'mon.I tried to get some entertainment by being an asshat. But, when every person is doing that, it feels really unspectacular. This concept has pontential, but this game honestly sucks. People aren't funny, they play loud noises, and do literally nothing. You're waaaaay better off jumping onto a message board, or talking over a live chat. This is essentially paying to do that. The difference is using messaging and live chats, you have control over the content and who you talk to. There are moderators who stop obnoxious people. This has nothing like that, and it's exemplified by the people who blow into their microphones for minutes at a time....I should have known better. I thought for a second and knew this game was trash, but threw some cash at it anyway. It's a small fee. But not really worth it, unless there are significant improvements. And the low price is exactly how they got me. It's not worth your time, I worked hard today. I should have watched a movie or played a different game instead. I mostly just feel like I wasted 2 and a half hours, now. Which kinda sucks."

It's hard to list all of the great moments, but one that particularly comes to mind is a guy who took music requests up on stage and played them with his guitar.The microphone quality is very good in this game and you can clearly hear if someone has a cheap or good microphone setup. This makes things great for singalongs for an example.One thing to note is that a lot of people won't be acting very seriously when they're performing on the stage, but personally I find that hilarious. If someone tries to tell a simple one-liner, a pun or a your mom joke, you get instant feedback from the rest of the crowd who can talk, applaude or boo. It feels like you're part of a group of people you have never met before. Everything turns so goofy, but yet it's still funny.I think you should get this game considering it's only around 5 bucks. This game has great value considering its price. It might take a while to find the right room in-game with the right people that will make you laugh, but give it time. It's definitely worth it."

Sure you get some people who Google or use Reddit to find jokes, but when you find that perfect lobby you can end up spending multiple hours in there and make new friends.The only thing I would change is to have all servers have a vote off option like the dual mic server because occassionally you'll be in a server where the host is AFK and one person hogs the microphone and you either have to leave or pray that they get bored enough of everyone booing them that they get off stage.I would also suggest they add a queue option to going on stage because sometimes you'll see the same 3 people getting on stage just because they're the fasted to click the perform button and maybe a queue option will give everyone a chance to tell some jokes.I do recommend this game, but do not expect every server to have comedy gold.

In every room, it was just white guys dropping N-bombs with no jokes whatsoever. I literally played the game for less than an hour before I couldn't handle any more and had to stop. The only reason I'm not asking for a refund is because it was only $5 and it's not exactly the developer's fault. At the same time, maybe promoting the ability to heckle wasn't such a great idea, and maybe the addition of some better moderation features would make for a more constructive community of people actually trying to entertain each-other, with a modicum of an idea of what they should be doing to achieve that."

The concept is solid and it could be a platform for really funny people to try out material, but for now it's just a bunch of people being obnoxious with no way of weeding through the racial slurs and terrile one liners to find anything actually worthwhile. No fault of the developers, so it still gets a recommendation because the actually game is great, the community is just abusing a great idea. After the initial wave of 'hype' or whatever you want to call it over having a room of people held essentially hostage to whatever inane thoughts you want to shout into your microphone passes, I hope more quality pops up.As a note to the developers, though, being able to curate a list of people allowed into your room or at least better filter it would go a long way. Even a simple rating based on amount of 'boos' vs 'laughs' a particular user gets would boost the actual appeal of entering a random room."

If you buy this game you join a room which 90% of the time will be a bunch of black/mexican/gay jokes that people look up on sites, and then any jokes with slight originality lead to silence. If you can't make up an original joke, or have a dry sense of humor, this isn't a game for you because nothing you do will be funny and nothing they do will be funny to you. It's full of either that or 12 year olds who max out their voice pitch on the high side, and then scream into the mic for 40 minutes until the host kicks them.The idea was a good one, but in the era of memes and edgelords, this game is forced to have the worst community."

If you are one of these kinds, pass this game up. I just think it's a shame negative reviews are left by overly-sensitive snowflakes.The game itself has a very neat concept. One or two performers (depending on the gamemode) will go on stage and be able to tell whatever jokes/stories they want. Once the performer(s) chooses to leave the stage the rest of the players have the option to go on stage next. When you're not performing, you're sitting at a table in front of the stage, with a list of reactions you can choose from (laugh, boo, cricket noises, etc). You can also still talk as part of the crowd, but you'll be at a lower volume so everyone can still hear the performer. Obviously, this game will gather people with awful microphones, but you have the option to mute a player if he or she is micspamming. If things get boring you can always join a new room.Things I'd like to see added/fixed:- Text chat. I don't see why this isn't already in the game.- Private lobbies. Again, I don't see why this isn't implemented already.- Some bugs. It's possible to get stuck inside other players or on stage.- Automatically adjust voice volume. If someone starts to micspam loudly, it would be nice to normalize the volume so I don't get ear♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Overall, a cheap purchase for some good laughs. I definitely recommend."

Cool to be creative and it teaches a performer how to command a room and is a practical application for those persuing a career in entertaining.  Allowing the user to create the room and choose the topic allows for a broad range of creative expression.  On a negative note most people who jump on stage are just doing so to hear their own voice, say racist things or hijack the room and ruin everyones experience.  The number of homophobic/racist/mysoginistic people in this room is astounding and I wish there were a way to police that.  I'm not talking about racial jokes or jokes that even cross the line.  I'm talking about people screaming the N word for no reason and using slurs just to try and shock people.  That's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part of the game and there's a lot of it out there.  The heckling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are annoying too, especially when they bring nothing to the table.  When you get a good room with good people its an awesome game.

,Recommended,665360,34589293,Posted: 29 August,all,Element,"Comedy Night is a great game with great mechanics and a simply layout but like any other game that depends on the players to entertain each other, it lacks in content. You might find yourself bored within a couple minutes if you can't find any players that will actually do what they're supposed to. The rap battle system is not used how it's supposed to at all and I can tell you that the hour I had on that gamemode, I saw not one pair of players rap battle each other. The stand up is just as bad; witty one-liners is all players offer. The singing has to be the best gamemode in the game and even that is not that good. They need to add a karokake system where you can pick a song, as well as a voting system to kick annoying players or ones that won't get off stage and follow the rules because I've seen some server admins who do nothing about this. In short, this game has a lot of potential but it needs to be worked on. Despite it being mediocre, I'm giving it a thumbs up because it just came out, and while I can't assure you it will get better, I can say that it has a lot of potential and I enjoyed myself."

I figured that on some nights I could sit around and listen to some ok ametuer comedy instead of watching a stream. Unfortunately, the content produced by random people on the internet is pretty much garbage.Pros:Build a character - There was some good thought that went into building your character. There are good options.Emoting - There are good ways to express you opinion in the audience.Cons:Taxing enviornment - Running this game is more taxing on computers that LOL. If you don't have a sound card, don't bother.Connectivity - Generally this isn't a problem, but if you have any lag at all OR if the comedian is having lag, then you just hear random syllables and thats no fun for anyone.Rooms - So this one bothers me. When you join a game, you get to either join a room (max 14 people per room) or you have to create a room. It takes a long time for people to join your room, let alone anyone with comedic talent.THE COMMUNITY- Yeah basically this game is just a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who don't have decent jokes that like to heckle good performers."

Even when a joke hits home, you typically get little to no feedback, making it impossible to tell whether one of your jokes was actually funny or merely not worth mentioning.  You only get notable feedback when the other players are not enjoying your jokes.This means that the only possible reliable sense of reward is from hearing jokes made by other players... which are not typically very good.

I download and installed the game, set up my character, and I was ready to have some fun! Obviously, I scrolled through the servers and selected one. Within *fifteen seconds* of being in the chat room, having not said a word, the other (male) members of the server realized I was a woman, and immediately banned me. I don't normally complain about stuff like this, as discrimination against women is common for trolls on the internet, but I still felt offended and incredibly discouraged.I don't recommend buying this game if you're female.

And the ones i found were funnier than the rooms dunkey showed.Anyways the developer added a ban feature very quick (with this features, you can not longer say thats its a bad game because of the community after my personal opinion) and are improving the game experience and care about the community whishes. (For example the new rap room type, i saw many of them and now they are official included.)Conclusion:Its a simple game idea which was great implemented and it only costs 5$. They could raise it to 15$ and i would still buy it.Its a Great game for people who loves to laugh and are not that bad in english, never saw that type of game before.10/10 <3PS: I would enjoy an optional room setting to choose the language of the room, because my english is not the best ^^"

Also you could have multiple admins e.g you want to give your friend the same abilities with the exeption of kicking the room creator and giving others the same permissions.The game does have a possibility to be a somewhat popular game.

,Recommended,665360,34625660,Posted: 30 August,all,c5,"Comedy night is an interesting game to rate. The idea and exectution are great, but whether you have a good experience or not really depends on the people you're playing with. There's a ton of tolling and spam, and even in the servers where people are trying to actually tell jokes, there's a lot of attempting to be overly edgy or shocking. When you're really in a good room though, it's pretty fun and I've found that when I put in the effort to actually tell a decent joke it usually gets a nice reaction. It's rally satisfying when you tell a joke people actually like.I think it still needs some features to reach it's full potential, like more moderation tools (the ability for the audience to votekick would be great, as some people just stay up on stage trolling without leaving.) Additional server lists for different types of comedy or storytelling would be great, and private rooms would be amazing. That said, the development team has been adding lots of new things at a frequent basis, which is good. I don't know if I would wholeheartedly say you should rush out and buy this game right away, but I think that if you're willing to sift through some of the game's more unseemly elements, you'll have a really interesting and unique experience you can't get from other video games."

,Recommended,665360,34619956,Posted: 30 August,all,Jack,"Comedy Night is a fun game that is definitely worth $5 if you intend to spend a couple of hours every once in a while listen to people tell jokes or scream into their microphone. I for one, really enjoy the game because I can usually find people that tell good jokes and stories. Other people may not like it as much, so I'll list the pros and cons.Pros:- You can usually find a good group of people who tell funny jokes.- The host can ban/kick people who are anooying.- Its $5.- You can customize your character and dress up as someone people recognize, and use jokes that are specific to that persons role.- It's fun to just sit and listen to people for a couple of hours.- Sometimes there are good singers and rappers that come along in the Sing/Rap Battle modes.Cons:- Racism. This is probably the biggest one. The main jokes that are told in this game are either dark or racist. If you aren't OK with those types of jokes, I would not reccomend this game.- People screaming as loud as they can into their mic. Sometimes funny, most of the time not.- Hogging the stage. Lots of times the host will be gone and people will sit on stage for 20 minutes doing nothing. It gets old.- The crowd. Sometimes you can be telling a joke and people will just boo you and tell you to get off the stage. Sometimes that's a good thing if someone isn't doing anything on stage, but if you're telling a joke the community is sometimes not the greatest.- Most of the time, you can't hear people speak because everyone interrupts them, so be prepared for that."

This game isn't a great place to practice your stand up act since the community consists of like 50% brain dead monkeys but it's worth the money and the devs have been working overtime. Great game and I hope this game gets more and more updates.At time of writing, the game has servers dedicated for rapping, singing, and comedy.Definitely a quality pick if you like CSGO voice commsPick this game up if:You like low brow humorYou don't take yourself too seriouslyYou aren't scared of getting boo-ed or hated onWhat this game needs now:More cosmetic options. It currently has a ton of options to customize your character but I believe it needs more to make your guy stand out of the crowd.Needs text chat options so people can commmunicate without interrupting the performer.More emotes and some that don't carry sound bytes which can be distracting.An option for the host to kick someone off the stage and not out of the room."

I wanted something where I can be a stupid edgelord and goof off. You'll meet plenty of people like me on there. All the stupidity is part of the game. Just relax and don't get so offended easily.My only slight red flag is that I think they should add more features to this game and flesh it out a bit if this game is wanting to be relevant in the coming months. But so far Developers are hearing us out in the forums and will continue to support this game. I'm confident they will keep this going as long as they can."

This is not because anyone is really racist just because they want to be offensive for the sake of being offensive or in an effort to sabatoge someones twitch stream.In the first 5 hrs of playing I had a grand debate and was given the stage for quite some time by the admin to field questions from a wide range of room participants on gun registration. The next day I was part of a room that created a hillarious meme ""SQUEEKERS!!!"" sometimes you just have to settle into the swamp of morons and wait for the magic to happen.I tried to create a little 5 min set but its exactly as hard as you think to keep a room of 14 random people on the internet, whom can freely  heckle you  at any moment quiet  enough to try it out most of the time."

This doesnt mean the game is bad, oh no, far from it. Due to the fact that the content is determined by the players themselves, this allows the game to have incredible potential depth, or memes. Memes are fun. Though some speaking animations could use tweaking, theyre fine enough for this hilarity.

I like how when your on stage, you can actually move the mouse and click  in the direction of the person you want to speak to in the audience and your head turns to them. The best mode to me is the Dual Mic mode, because you, the audience, can vote someone off - which keeps the variety of people on the stage! You do have few people that have ""potty mouths / bad language / racial slurs"" but if you can look past that (by simply exiting the room, or ""muting"" them, or create your own room where you can administrate everyone) its a great game!"

I've made some great friends, sat through trolls sounding like a cat in a dishwasher - but it's all great. This game is a better $5 than Golf With Your Friends (for music lovers).I've heard lots of racial slurs, cursing, bad memes, dirty jokes and complete idiocy. Yet, it's the charm of the game. Not for young kids AT ALL. This game is for adults, by adults.The graphics have a fun, kitschy style that harks to a proto-animated version of a comedy club, that Jerry Seinfeld would have performed at early in his career. The avatars are a bit...ugly, but I live with them.Great $5 game, even if you play it once. Albeit, you're gonna play it more than once.It's also riddled with Rick and Morty memes, which I love in hindsight."
