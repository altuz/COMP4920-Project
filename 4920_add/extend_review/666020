,Not Recommended,666020,34245298,Posted: 14 August,all,Spooky Skies,"Shark Dating Simulator XL (SDSXL) has a lot of potential but ultimately falls short and we see SDSXL sink to the bottom of the reefs quite quickly. Uninstalled and forgotten.Comedy is a skill which very few people grasp and doesnt just mean being random and putting random things in for the sake of it.The skeleton of the story and general direction of it I enjoy, the actual content is mostly cringey and forced humour which tends to be either very hit or miss. Talking of content, there really isnt a lot of content to the game which was quite unfortunate as the store page reads as though there would be a multitude of routes and options thus leaving my excitement and hype for SDSXL very short lived.Unfortunately, as with most Early Access games this has been released far too early. From all the delays and setbacks just for one part of the story which was twenty minutes, I'm very doubtful on the ""early 2018"" goal being hit. Hopefully with a few more updates this game will be set back on track and will be recommendable, but until then, I feel very short changed and let down.That's quite surprising, considering SDSXL comes in at a very low price. Hopefully the initial wave of ""OMGBESTGAMEEVER"" and ""ILUVSHARKS"" will die down and SDSXL will get the valuable feedback it requires to be a good visual novel but until then, I can't quite possibly recommend it."

(120 FPS)NEUTRAL:- +18 (NSFW)-The game is not very long but it doesn't has to be.CONS:-Final ""puzzle"" (or game) seems impossible to get perfect.-One ending is dissapointing.Overall, the game is well worth the dollar to try."

It contains a deep and intresting story, bursting with character, personality and humor. The current version of the game, at the time of this review, only contains one story/shark, but it is one that can be replayed multiple times, with many different paths to take, keeping it fresh for multiple play throughs. The humor is one of the games biggest strengths. I found myself laughing not only to myself but outloud as well at some of the jokes and choices. Funny, witty, fun, and sexy are all words that discribe this game perfectlty, and for only $0.99, it is 100% worth the price and your time.

Shark Dating Simulator XL at its current state, has a tiny story for you to play that last about 20 minutes. The story was interesting to read, and will probably have ALOT more to offer, hence why the big ""EARLY ACCESS"" title is below the game. The comedy was alright, not the ""highest quality top of the line funniest thing ever lmao rofl so funny"", but atleast something to smile at, wont fit everyones taste. The minigame to win Shark Chans heart was ok to play as well. As every early access game goes, there will be more in the future, grab it now at the price it's at if you want, dont expect a fully functional game and give it a negative review because there isnt much to do. The developer promised a lot of things and as long as he is keeping us updated and developing the game, I see nothing wrong with this right now. Also, I dont even want to know wtf goblin chan looks like."

,Recommended,666020,34265086,Posted: 15 August,all,Draggo,"This game was released way too early, and as such, you can blow through the story in like 20 minutes if you can read fast enough. The page is quite misleading, and it kinda doesnt have much dynamicism in the story. I really think this could be better if the story was expanded upon, andIf there was an R-18 patch to this game alike other visual novels.The cheesy, edgy humor is going to be hit or miss. I personally enjoy it, and I enjoyed the story even if it is incredibly brief. It really does not give you some sort of excitement in the main part of the story for choosing different options, which makes it kinda unappetizing to bother with the dynamic story. The end result is a silly minigame that is kinda easy to beat. Though the end result was satisfying if I do say so myself. I still think the story of this game could use some more thought.The thing is, I kinda don't care to criticize this game given it is one dollar. I have seen games even less interesting than this go for ten dollars before. At least you grow to kinda like the main character in this game, which is more than most visual novels have done for me. Probably biased because its an anthropomorphic character, but oh well. Given that you get an incomplete game, I would recommend waiting if you wanted a game longer than just 20 minutes or so, depending on your reading speed. If you just want to see some shark breasts, definitely recommended."

So bought the game, and OMG not only this game is one the weirdest dating simulators i have ever played, but also THE BEST... so far.So the story is that you just a new graduate of Scuba School and you work a chick (whose also your boss) named Marina Fishpaste and she is trying to get a talking fish to study with. You go underwater and see this female shark that has actions as a tsundere girl. I know there many storylines in the game, but so far i only wanted to date the shark, i mean why else call it a shark dating simulator? As you progess in the game, you start to know more about the female shark and her story. While you're playing the game, if you choose the right dialogue you get some balls, and then you use them to play some sort of mini game.VerdictI only progess through one ending in the game so far, should i recommend this game? Um... YES. I kinda recommend this game, eventhough this an early access game i still recommend this game! They have some funny dialogue, the shark girl character is intresting, and most of all, it makes me want to see some shark porn now. Congradulations Conan McPhee! You just made not only the weirdst and funniest dating simulators i've ever played, but also one the best i've ever played! Its so weird but yet i love this game so far! I am definitely looking forward to more cute shark girls, more storylines, and some improvements!10/10Pros-Great humorGreat artInteresting storylinesYou get to date a cute shark girl!Shark bewbs... and buns.Cons-Kinda bothering minigame."

,Not Recommended,666020,34251853,Posted: 15 August,all,Fundz64,"*edit/update: I did a little research and found the game has a completed SFW mobile app version of the game.  Though the mobile game doesnt have the interactive puzzle as the steam version, I am more willing to suggest that game for the time being.  I've since then sent my support on the patreon and suggest other fans of the game to do the same.I'm a sucker for waifu-material visual novels and bonus points for reminding me how much i love sharkt_ts. I personally dont regret buying this game since I feel like there should be more sharkchan dating sims out on the interwebs and it was only a buck.....H O W E V E RI could tell, from the first five minutes in the game, that this game was not meant for steam standards.I would play dating simulators like these on newgrounds for free (back when it was in it's prime).  I don't mind the fan service and the cheesy punch lines it gives out but buying this game for the sake of 'rubbing a quick one out' is short sighted and in the end, only leaves me with a sad boner.There is potential in this dating sim, i'm thankful this is still in early access, but the dev has a lot to catch up and adjust if he wants this game to 'swim' well with most of the waifu dating sim fans out there.in regards to the chapter 1 puzzle game [spoilerI personally find it silly to have that last pose censored considering it is the only part of the game the player actually has to work to get right even if steam rules prevent posting genitalia [/spoiler]it pains me to unrecommend this game, butthere is still much work to be done, even if the game isnt officially complete.I have faith in you, Sharku-senpai-sama-animu-chan-ugu-desu"

Great art, great humor, and a fun little minigame at the end that makes it a bit unique compared to other dating simulators. I look forward to playing again just to see where different choices will take me. Plus looking forward to the updates."

Sweet one liners, snarky back and forth, balls all over the place and friggin' talking fish, to boot. It's crass, it's deep in the outfield, not to mention simple to pick up and play, and it all works nicely. Visually, it's no catch of the day, but it's enough to get the job done, same with the tunes as well. In all seriousness, it was worth the .99 cents easily 5, maybe 6 times over. I can't wait to see what the other stories are like."

It was an amazing experience and I loved every second of it, and I even got to see the Dolphins do their tricks and all that jazz. But when I went in the underwater tunnel and saw those sharks, I fell in love. I started to obsess over the sharks all year, great whites and the lot of them. But that next summer, we went to the ocean and I had a accident. A shark was in shallow water and I had gone deep enough for it to take interest, I lost my right arm that year, having been right-handed from birth. Not only did I now have to deal with learning to live with one arm, and but with trying to re-learn how to write and use a different hand. It was a painful process and my love for sharks turned into hate. I never did learn how to my use my left hand.But now that I've found this game, I remember why I just loved those sharks so much, their cute little bows and their great personalities. 10/10 would learn to finally jerk off with my left hand again."
