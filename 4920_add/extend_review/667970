76561197973483579,Recommended,667970,34000520,Posted: 3 August,all,baka,"Quick first impression from a DCS world A10C fanIf 0 was arcade and 10 was full blown flight sim this would come in somewhere around 6.5 in terms of systems which is a nice balance between fun and realism.  The devs obviously know a fair bit about aircraft operations, there is no quick start. Battery power, APU needs to be fired up first, HUD turned on ect but then no 15 mins wait for NAV system to finish aligning or more complex systems that would take along time to learnThe flight modeling for fast forward flight feels fine and is not too challenging. VTOL is hard, I mean really hard to get the hang of.  This means many will love the challenge while some will find it very fustrating (maybe there is an auto hover function but I have not found it yet)  Personally I love the fact that I suck at it, it means I have to put some time into learning to fly the dam thingThe controls are well though out the grip button is used to lock hand to collective and/or stick is a very good idea.  I honestly think I would be flying alot better with my HOTAS but the trade off is I can use the systems with my hand without having to find my controller and let go of my HOTASI recommend this game but for some it will be not hardcore enough, for others it will be frustrating if you have zero experience at this type of game perhapes.  The scenery is by far the weakest part of this game and I would very much like to see it improved over time.  It's deffently worth checking out if you have any intrest in flying thoughWill it replace DCS:world?  Not a chance but I really don't think that's the aim, its fast and fun... can't really argue with that"

There are semi-complex systems and procedures, but they are learned in less than 10 minutes. They are simple to learn, but hard to master. Active development means new features and systems are on the way, and the devs are active on their discord servers to answer questions.HOWEVER this game has some drawbacks, being in early access. At the time of writing some of the tutorials are unfinished, but the creator has youtube videos to fill the gap until the interactive ones are complete. All the voice acting is done by one person, and is in general kind of lame. I believe that this will change in the future at some point in development.There is a ""story mode"" campaign, which connects (at time of writing) 5+ missions in a narrative, there is also a freefly mode that lets you fly with no enemies, static targets for weapons practice, or a full on hostile island with large battles occuring.I fully reccomend this game!"
,Recommended,667970,34107831,Posted: 8 August,all,Rafport,"Ultrawings did a decent job emulating the stick with hand controllers, but VTOL VR is simply incredibile: you can configure your (virtual) seat and the stick position, placing the VR wand over your knee so it acts and bends like a physical stick. The thrust lever as well, it's super intuititve and precise. The whole cockpit is the better example of interactive panel I ever seen in VR, there are plenty of controls but all of them user friendly and readable.I feel guilty because I was following VTOL from some time, but was skeptical: landscape looks blurry and lack details, the airplane is not appealing, the virtual cockpit looks weird to manage just by hands. I had a chance to try it and was so wrong about everything."
,Recommended,667970,34040349,Posted: 5 August,all,SaulKain,"This is really very cool.Flight sims are the primary reason I bought a Rift.  As a result, seeing new flight sims developed for VR makes the experience that much better.I did a free flight around the area. The flight controls are extremely intuitve.  I was about to find the tanker and refuel.  I was then able to make a vertical landing as well as an arrestor cable landing to test functionality.  All in all, the VTOL feels like a cross between an A-10 and a Ka-50 in DCS.  I say Ka-50 as there is no counter-torque required.  The flight controls are complicated, yet forgiving with SAS enabled.My only gripe is the less than precise rudder inputs.  If the developer adds support for rudder pedals, it would make control inputs that much better.I am really looking forward to watching this game develop."
,Recommended,667970,34375722,Posted: 20 August,all,"Moondog, the Viking of 6th Ave.","I've been wanting to review this since I bought it, but figured I'd give it a few more hours of my time before coming to a final verdict.Short and sweet, this game has its flaws, but is well worth the seemingly absurd price. I'd pay more for it if it costed more, but I'm glad it doesn't. I've spent more money on much less entertainment.VTOL VR has a good balance of arcade and sim. As others mentioned, the flight model is simple enough for inexperienced players to pick up on without a lot of time investment, and complex enough for veteran flight sim players to feel comfortable in. There are definitely some areas that could use improvement, but overall, for the state it's in right now, considering it came out less than a month ago, it is excellent.It has some performance issues. I'm running a 7700K at 4.2 with a 1080, and most of the missions that start you on the carrier (quick flight on hostile island, and campaign mission 4 in particular) generate some heavy frame drops, almost to a sickening point. Utilizing the spectator cam makes this much, much worse as I've found out tonight. Definitely going to need some major optimization down the roadWith performance issues aside, this game is a blast, and probably the most fun I've had in VR since early Sairento and H3VR. The fact that it also puts you in the seat of a fighter aircraft is pretty sweet, too. Since you don't move, it's playable in my small room, where I can't play room-scale games; I typically have to move my entire setup downstairs into my living room to do that.There is a plethora of weaponry to choose from, and each one has its own uses and downsides. The weapons systems seem very realistic, from what little I know of air combat systems, and are a blast to use when you figure out how they work. Using CCIP/CCRP with bombs is awesome, and head-tracking air-to-air missile locks on jets screaming over your cockpit is simply exhilarating. The developer is consistently pumping out new tutorials on weapon systems usage and most of it is pretty intuitive. The cockpit UI is simplified enough that you don't have to worry about 90% of the stuff a real pilot would, and you can just get right to the action (well, once you've figured out how to engage the APU, start the engines, unlock the brakes, swivel your engines, release the catapault hook, set the flaps....) and start blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up.The controls are VR-only. You cannot use a mouse/keyboard or any kind of HOTAS (as of its current state). This may sound whack at first, but you quickly get used to how the controllers respond to your input and it becomes as fluid as if you had an actual stick in your hand, especially if you have a chair with an armrest in the right spot that you can just balance the bottom of the controller on. Not sure if it's the same for the Rift, but the Vive wands are a very comfortable experience. There are also adjustment buttons on the stick and chair in-game to make sure you're in just the right position.Overall, it needs polish. But this is a very early stage of an early access title, being created by, as far as I know, one guy. You can tell the radio comms are all the same guy, which I'm assuming is the dev. But I'm also assuming these are placeholders that will be polished out later on. Same with some of the environment texturing and so-forth.I would recommend this game to anyone with a VR system and an interest in modern aerial combat, or just piloting in general. It's great fun."
,Recommended,667970,34034155,Posted: 5 August,all,wizoz1984,"This is a great game in early development. I have been waiting since the Vive was released for a VR F16/Helicopter fighter game as when this game came out I jumped on it.The game puts you in a cockpit of a warplane and you have buttons, alot of buttons. You use your Vive wands throughout the whole game to control your hands in the cockpit with the ability to press buttons, flip switches, and even grab a virtual flight stick and throttle freely. The in game tutorials help you learn how to fly but it will take lots of practice to master. Its one of my top 5 games on the Vive and its one of those games that you just cant explain or describe how amazing it is until you try it."

The VTOL flight model is user-friendly enough to be fun and tricky enough to be even more fun.  The graphics are simplistic but gorgeous (with super-smooth frame-rates).And all at half the cost of a DCS aircraft,For an early-access game there are suprisingly few (if any) issues.  Couple of things I'd like to see (beyond the additional content already underway), if possible:- Ability to pause in-game- Allow oculus users to use extended index finger to toggle buttons (without trigger press)- Ability (or instructions) to use own music in-cockpit- Option to use HOTAS controls (although this is very low priority for me)"

This game has more content than most finished VR games out there.A must have if you are interested in flight sims and have a VR headsetThis game does flight-simulators right. while it may not be as realistic as DCS. Sitting in the cockpit, flicking switches by yourself and being completely immersed in the game makes this one of the best flight simulator experiences i've had.The controls are fairly intuitive, and if you have played flight simulators before you will most likely not even need the tutorials, the aircraft is much less complicated than what you find in DCS and BMS.This would be an amazing start for people wanting to get into (combat-)flight sims. Because everything feels real and ""military"" while being simple enough to pick up in short time. Though the full-VR support might spoil you for other sims.I don't know how good the game is on the Rift, But the Vive controls very well"

( (BOOM) ) :DThis really is the future of flightsims, its simply the best most immersive experience you can have without a real cockpit to sit in. VTOL VR sets a new benchmark for VR motion controlled environments and it's a great flight sim to boot, which strikes a great balance between hardcore realism and playability. The sense of presence and connection to the in game environment is downright spooky at times. If you are a flightsim fan and don't have VR yet this is one worth getting it for!Here's my first look playthrough of the first two training missions in which I take to the air for the first time, like some sort of boss (I imagine :P)https://youtu.be/_EWbWSscVV4"

Let me tell you that i already have Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog and Saitek pro rudders and i was a little sceptic about using HTC Vive controllers as hotas, i was wrong. Controls are absolutely brilliant.Graphics are basic but good enough to play in VR and as a result no frame rate drops or jittter. You might still get motion sickness unless you have already spent some time to get over it and rewired your brain, no guaranties here but intuitive controls, high frame rate and immersion will help you a lot in this game.Is it as advanced as DCS world or even IL-2?  No. But challenging enough for me.Is it worth the full price even in early access? My answer is yes.

No bloody way!!Seeing the video's and the overall response it was getting I knew I would not regret it anyway but diving into the game . . .WOW! Simply put it, the dev has done something that I and I know plenty others have graved. The fact that you can interact with the cockpit with the Vive controllers is the reason why this game is going places.I really hope it keeps getting updated, I'd even push the dev to think about making this into more than just a VTOL game.Bigger planes and airports etc would be epic, that refuel plane would be amazing in the cockpit :)Keep it going man you are insane and when this goes to full game ask for £30 upwards!"

It has a simple cockpit that reminds me a lot of the a-10 Warthog, but only have the basics and most important functionality when it comes to controlling the aircraft. So the game places itself in the middle ground of a full sim and casual, but is it fun? Hell-yes it is!I have tried playing DCS in VR but struggled a lot with the keyboard controls and the sensor placement for the VR headset. VTOL VR feels so much more intuitive. No more taking the headset off juts to find the keyboard key or trying to find where the mouse is. You dont have to set up your joystick or having it on your desk anymore, you just put the VR headset on, grab the motion controllers and you are done."

I've shied away from flight sims where I actually have to turn the engines on, but after a few glorious wrecks I am pulling ace combat level manuevers.

Landing in vertical mode takes a ton of practice, be patient, it is worth it.And for the love of Spock, sit your butt in a chair before you fly the first time. When I first got airborne I got a little dizzy, mainly because I didnt do the tutorials before my first flight and takeoff was a bit rough, but the motion takes some getting used to.The graphics are ok on this game, but the mechanics and the interaction in the cockpit are fantastic. The one major improvement I could see is actual joystick support although that would get tricky since you need both motion controllers to flip switches and interact with the control panels.Overall I give this a solid 6/10 for what it is right now, however, this game has the potential to be astounding."
,Recommended,667970,35221219,Posted: 26 September,all,Gompasta,"This is the closest I will ever get to flying a real aircraft.TL;DR Holy Bajeesus, this game is amazing.Firstly, the cons.* Only one area to fly in* Tutorial is unfinished* Can only start on carrer in free mode* Very difficult for players who have never done any kind of flight simulation.* As of now, only one aircraft choice, but there is another in the works* No checkpoints in missions. You die, you start from beginning. They are usually fairly short missions, but this can get irritating.However, I anticipate all these problems to be solved by release.The actual simulation aspect is heavily simplified, this is to keep it accessible for all players, not just simulation enthusiasts. This is a good thing even if you are a regular flight sim player, as if you end up getting shot down, you don't really want to go through a 30min pre flight procedure every time you die. There are still plenty of buttons to play around with however, so it doesn't feel too arcadey.The aircraft handles exactly how I would imagine it would, and it is very easy to keep control as long as you make deliberate movements, even with flight assist off. It is a lot of fun to switch between conventional and VTOL flight in the middle of combat situations.Speaking of which, combat is realistic. You dont have a health pool that drains into a game over, one missile hit and you are down. Gun damage seems to be a little weak against you, but I have not really stuck around in the middle of gunfire to see how long it takes to take you down. Your weapons are very powerful, and typically take down targets with no issue. It seems a little difficult to shake off missiles, even when deploying countermeasures, but I am not a combat pilot IRL, and there is no missile evasion tutorial yet so it is probably me doing something wrong.While the campaign and Free flight modes are a lot of fun, I would hope to see some generated dynamic missions that can play out for a number of rearms for replayability value.While flying around, especially on longer flights it does get a bit dull. There is a built in MP3 player in the aircraft, because why not, but some ambient radio would be nice.I expect to play a lot more of this, especially as it is still in development with regular new content."

I was able to fly and land the VTOL on my first try and it is enjoyable.The game has quite a steep learning curve since there is lack of tutorials (it is still early access) that teaches all the controls of the aircraft but it is still playable if you try out all the buttons yourself in the cockpit.While Ultrawings is on the more arcade and relaxing side, this one more leans to simulation side.

No additional HOTAS, rudder pedals, or controllers required other than Vive controllers.  Excellent tutorial.  Easy to learn and understand how to fly in first 10-20 minutes of gameplay. Took me about 1-3 hours to get good at completing missions. Highly recommend to flight sim enthusiasts.  If you are shocked by the experience IL2 in VR for WW2 you will enjoy the same experience from this flght simulator but, with the look and feel of modern combat.Gameplay feels similar to Lunar Lander VR when flying in to pickup and drop off troops.  It takes a bit to master but, the heading, altitude, and hover autopilot features can help you stabalize the aircraft to help guide it in.Cockpit flight experience is similar to how I felt when flying IL2 VR for first time. I was totally shocked.ProsWorking MFDs, all buttons, panels, and switches work.Working radio to play music.

Flicking the switches and operating the MFD's is awesome. I'd say the flying itself is just a bit more awkward than with an actual HOTAS, but the way you use the targeting and weapons system entirely makes up for that.Graphics are basic but hey, framerate and clarity is good, no problems at all with text readability. I look forward to exploring every little detail and system this vehicle this has to offer :)"

I have never played a game like this and I have never learned how to fly in video games before. But do to the cruel learning curve I cannot recommend it to newer pilots like myself. But the one time I could actually get into the air I had a blast (Until I crashed straight into a mountain) so I definitely recommend this to people who have experience in games like these. There is no joystick support which was very surprising. So I recommend it to people who know how to fly and do not recommend it to players like myself who have never really played a flight game this realistic before.

There's no turbulence and the plane feels too nimble.I play X-plane 11 so controlling the little switches isn't new to me.  But that one is real so there's motivation to learn it.  I had to go online and read actual Garmin navigator manuals and sure enough it works the same way in the game.Worth a shot if you already have X-plane 11 and want to learn to fly fictional airplane that's a bit unpredictable.This is early access so it may get better but needs way more tutorials to ease people into it."

The VTOL flight physics are pretty darn interesting ...it took me a couple of tries to get any measure of finesse at vertical takeoff transition and landings - but I eventually managed to drop off the troops, rescue some crash survivors, deliver them to the hospital with bingo fuel, and RTB like a boss.Needless to say, pickup/dropoff missions, Close Air Support, and all manner of missions could make this into a very dynamic game with varied things to do.  It's EA, so everything isn't there, yet.  My only real complaint so far is that the terrain leaves a LOT to be desired, as well as transitions into cities.  (Hopefully the map will get a lot of attention at some point).  However, for now, and for the price, the flight mechanics alone are probably worthwhile, though I kind of wish the aircraft systems had a touch more complexity (fuel lines, radio comms, etc.)...but I'll be patient :-)"

Its very nicely optimized for VR with simplified graphichs and big bright bold text that is easy to read (unlike DCS gages). Those who have played DCS will recognise simmilar cockpit systems and controls. The simulated hotas actually feels really good, and i enjoy it just as much as my TM Warthog. I only hope that DCS someday gets full simulated controls like this, as flipping the switches in the cockpit using VR hands is so much more immersive.I will say that the learning curve is a little steep though, since the Traning missions are still WIP. That said, the controls are intuitive enough, and I was able to do a Vertical takeoff and landing on the first try, and also figured out how to do a catapult launch from the carrier without too much difficulty.

I still have trouble hovering, but I'm getting better.This game makes me get so exited, it is so tense trying to hover and complete these very long and taxing missions. The actual simulation is very light, but it's enough to make flying need a light touch and a lot of patience. There is still a startup sequence, carrier landings, all you would expect with a simulation, just not as intense. After many failures on the first mission I finally made it to the last parts. Landing on top of the hospital on the first mission was the first true test, with very little area to hover-land. Many butt cheek clenching moments were had.I've toiled a bit with combat and it is equaly satisying. The real test will be how much the developer keeps up with adding content and fine tuning in early access and into release. Right now, as it, this is a must have in your VR library if you enjoy flying at all."

But it never really clicked for me or took to much effort or learning curve to figure out. This game goddamn amazing in that regard it's still a simulator but more casual with alot less of learning curve. And you get fly a fricking VTOL. It's jet/helicopter craft all in one. Why need anything else?! There is'nt much of a manual/tutorial right now but it took me 30 min to able to start up and fly vertically and horizantally with even low passes through buildings!. Within 2 hours I figured out some of weapons systems. Was able to take out tanks and infantry. with no tutorial at all! And theres much more to learn and its really fun to do so. I have a full hotas setup but I would not even use it if this game supported it. It's so much better able to adjust your throttle/flight stick ingame. And then rest your vive controllers on side of your seat/chair or even your legs and you can tilt/rudder with precision!. While still able to press cockpit buttons on the fly!. Amazing.I have not tried the campaing but this is alot of fun and there seems alot of things to do so far."

,Recommended,667970,34025239,Posted: 4 August,all,Gryphon,"Most of this has been said allready, but I should say something because I *really* like this game.It's not a hardcore simulation. VTOL VR is made from the ground up to work with VR, which means that some sacrifices have to be made - the cockpit feels big and chunky so that everything can be seen easily (Something that other flight sims fail horribly at doing) and everything can be manipulated by controller -throttle, joystick, MFD buttons, starter switches, master arm switches, ejection seat handle, helmet visor (to stop glare and use head-tracked missles) and even a handle on the right hand side to hold onto during catapult launches.Right now there's not a huge amount of content, but what is there feels polished. Some more voice acting would be nice - hearing the developer talking to himself during the campaign is somewhat distracting. But beyond that I'm just waiting for new content. I've played all the missions and while there is some replayability, a mission editor or random mission generator would be nice too.Of course, it goes without saying that all of the vehicles in this game are fictional. If that's an issue for you then this certainly ain't your game.It's my game though- and it stands in a postion to (with just a bit more content) become my favourate flight sim game of all time. Seriously, everything in the ""Planned features"" section makes me unreasonably excited.Oh and for the love of god add more music to the radio. If I hear that rock track one more time I'm going to crash this thing into the ocean.EDIT: The radio can now use custom music from a folder, so I retract my final point."

,Recommended,667970,34247888,Posted: 14 August,all,CAMMO100,"This game has made it clear to me that the future of VR flight simulation is in ""made for VR"" titles like this. There is such a fundamental difference in the overall user experience when playing this game vs. X-Plane 11 w/ FlyInside. The ability to fluidly transition from controls to buttons/switches while in flight is pretty awesome.That being said, my biggest complaint about this game is the experience flying without any tactile feedback. I find it extremely difficult to fly by hand when there is no physical reference for where a control is. Obviously there isn't much the developer could do to fix this, apart from perhaps experimenting with the way the flight controls respond to make them a little more forgiving.My last gripe is that this game could definitely use a major graphics overhaul (but considering that we are still in alpha this isn't a big deal)."
,Recommended,667970,34262085,Posted: 15 August,all,ArcliteTank,"I really love this game. Having played everything from War Thunder to DCS, this brings a bit of the DCS realism while still remaining accessible to all.The game is is great shape for an early access title and offers many voiced and fun missions. The tutorials are enough to get you off the ground and the weapon systems are relatively easy to figure out until the tutorials for those are released.I was worried about flying with touch controllers, but have had no difficulties after the first 10 minutes and have acutally become quite good at it. I would like to use rudder pedals, but they dont seem essential and the twist rudder works just fine for now.My only complaint is that there is no checkpoint system for missions, which leaves you replaying the ~5 minute scenes before you enter combat. The missions show off things like refueling and the other aircraft in the game, but after watching a fighter jet refuel 5 times before playing 2 mins of combat and being shot down, it gets old.I'm on oculus rift."

It's a new way of controlling an aircraft in a sim, without a doubt, but it doesn't take long to get comfortable with. It IS a slightly more challenging method, than a physical control-setup, but my initial reaction to it is that it's something you'll get normalized to rather quickly. It doesn't feel like a less precise or less capable way of controlling things, and over time it may even become a method that is preferred over a physical HOTAS (I have only just finished my first hour in the sim, but I like the method a lot already)The only thing I noticed that was worse (It's not a big issue though), is that it is impossible to rest your hands or fingers with this method, so it will get a bit more fatiguing over time than with a physical HOTAS.Visually it's pleasing. The sky is really nice :) The ground is very simple.Mid-air refuel was quite the experience. Very cool :)Overall my initial impression of this sim is that it is very capable.I hope it doesn't get bloated over time so framerates drop (I normally fly P3D in VR, which is HEAVY on my system and does cause less than optimal framerates)The game felt self-explanatory most of the time, although I couldn't figure out how to apply brakes while taxiing or after landing (Only the park-brake)It's not for arcade-pilots... you really need to be into simming. Thrust-control, for example, is brilliantly done, which may throw arcade-pilots off.As it stands, the game is great. I recommend it.JEL"

I've just played around with the flight model and the cockpit experience is really good. Graphics are currently good enough to get the feel of the game. Flying can be a mixed bag. I DO like it overall but things can go all crashy in a blink of an eye. Touch controls work well but I am not crazy about how yaw works. Same twist motion for those with that joystick option but with the touch free floating you find yourself putting in a lot of unwanted inputs and need to keep an eye on your centering/yaw motion box as they phiscal centering with a joystick is not there. Not really a knock on the game at all. Just a fact of life using the touch. Looking to see if I can remap that to the right stick. Well worth the price IMO. While I play a ton of sims with TrackIR and a few with the vibe and rift I do get that uneasy feeling now and again in other flight sims. That just does not happen in this game. At all. Well done. I hope this takes off and allows for different game modes. Easy to get into it and DCS every button does something and you need to do it in the right order level of play. Very nice work guys.

There's also many autopilot modes to help you fly if you prefer to make it a bit easier for yourself. If you (like me) prefer to fly with direct control, the HUD also shows you the input of your joystick so you can quickly adapt and learn how to best control your aircraft.Finding the balance betweeen yaw and roll was a bit difficult for me to start with and the HUD really helped me out in finding the sweet spots for the smoothest possible flight.With the planned features being added I see this game becoming a beacon of hope for the future of VR games."
,Recommended,667970,35442535,Posted: 3 October,all,︻☭═⇒⇀ Bear,Very nice little sim game for VR. Although there are several issues I hope developers will fix:- Frame drops even on very powerful GPU.- It looks like helmet is not connected to player's head but moved on each frame on update. It results in a little noticeable delay in helmet movement. Should be easy to fix.- When in game there is no way to reset helmet position (the button on left hand disappears). Because all the menus are closer to user then actual aircraft controls it may result in situation when player can't press a button on a vr board because it is blocked in real world. Should be able to reset position in VR or menus should be further way to represent actual distance to controls in the game.- Instructions react on events not on actual state. For instance during introduction to flight controls if I grab and hold joystick before instruction says me to do so the app waits until I release and grab it again. Had the same issue with landing - I've missed last checkpoint but landed aircraft anyway - the app was still waiting for me to cross last checkpoint. This logic should be more adaptive.
