,Recommended,668630,35097240,Posted: 20 September,all,Shin,I am always a fan of visual novel and i did not expect Tricolour  Lovestory to be this cheap and still offer good visual art and romance storyline that include achievement and trading cards. The game is in chinese but it offer english subtitle as well.  Cannot complain some character's voice that does not match the subtitle and some error in the subtitle when it is already that cheap. Well done!! I totally enjoyed it!Edit: The developer is active to read the reviews and check for errors found in the game and fixed it . GOOD WORK !

I'm not fond of Chinese voice acting but the characters voices are very nice regardless.HOWEVER, the terrible english translation makes it very hard for me to enjoy this VN. It's very off-putting for me to have to sort out the word order in my head as I read but I'm trying to put it off as the VN seems very well made and the artwork is spot on.Creators of this game, I will correct the english for free if you want me to! I find it to be it's only downside. If you can get past it, like I'm going to try and do, great game. Looking forward for what awaits me."
,Recommended,668630,35207588,Posted: 25 September,all,mura,"This game puts Sakura series to shame.First of all, I just need to say that, YES this game has atrocious translation. HOWEVER, it is still easily understandable. Minor grammar issue and all, please stop whining about it. Yes, it could've been better, but really, if you pass on this one, you're missing out on good stuff.Now, let's get started.I bought this game instantly when I saw the artstyle, or primarily the price. I'm the kind of guy who judge books by its cover. However, we will talk about the price later.The arts are solid, the background are nice and pretty, the characters drawn in the style that I fancy enough, but seriously. Why the hell are we talking about the arstyle. This is a Visual Novel, godammit.The most important thing in a Visual Novel is the story, and yes, this game has it. It's really solid, everything is paced really nicely, keeping you on the edge of your seat because it's that interesting.I played this game late at night, left it to sleep and woke up to only continue playing this the whole day. What I found surprising is, how much they offered in a such low low price. It has a quite long story, in which by the time I'm writing this, I've only reached chapter 3. It has full voiced characters, which I find quite good. I'm no Chinese so I can't really judge much. It has branching path, and even, uploads your choice to later be accumulated and statistically presented.I feel quite bad for not paying full price, 40% discount for this already really cheap game that offered so much. Please accept my forgiveness dev team.If you haven't grabbed this one yet, take it. It's worth your money, heck, they should've charge more. I cannot say more to what they have offered.However, though. I do have some criticisms as well. Probably has some spoilers, be warned.- Need more Daisy.- Better English translation pls.- Daisy.- The progression for Violet seems a bit dull, as the only thing that keeps it going is""They're the same""and that's it.- The usage of flashbacks are quite weird too, for example that time whenDaisy wins the competition. It could've been told linearly like (cause->result->aftermath) but it was shown more like (cause->aftermath->result) -- it might make the storytelling a little bit more interesting, but meeh. it keeps being repeated.- Daisy.- The branching options also seems a bit dullAs I'm still currently playing this game, I'll take back what I said if there's something wrong in my review. Thank you devs for making this wonderful world that I will never experience in my life. Please keep making more quality content. As well as quality translation, PLEASE.I rate it Daisy/10."

Cannot say I was expecting much for the price, but currently the translation is syntactically unreadable.  I am fairly confident the devs necromanced Shakespeare to do the preliminary translation.  Then they handed the script to Yoda to write out the final text. The resulting translation is time consuming and painful to read.  I recommend to wait on this game for now. Some brave souls are working on a fan translation.  I will gladly give this game a second chance if/when that is completed."

I was launching it from the desktop shortcut. I never launch games straight from Steam, so if you try launching it from a desktop shortcut it will automatically default to the Chinese version.

It features protagonist with serious family problems, who is trying to overcome his problems and anxieties with help of his chindhood friend and new genius transfer student ... who are both in love with him. Yes, high school love-drama only in chinese version this time. Even tho protagonist's family situation is so desperate, i coudnt even imagine what it would be like in his shoes. It kind of makes it hard to connect if you know what i mean.Translation is really bad, its not machine translation, someone actualy made effort to translate it, but its just ..... not english. Even then, text is still understandable, if you make the effort.What suprises me most is price for this VN, i mean i bought it for 1,2€ with release discount ... for that price you get VN that could easily sell for 20 - 30 € (if the translation was good). Its only first 3 chapters of the story (rest should be added later as DLC?) but its still over 20 hours worth of reading material.If i bought it for 30€ i would whine about translation and gave it negative review but for 1,2€ there is really nothing to complain about.So final verdict. I like this VN and i have enjoyed reading it despite bad translation."
76561197990750512,Recommended,668630,35146946,Posted: 23 September,all,omaha54,"If you're someone who likes this sort of thing, it has a good plot with very addicting Anime Characters.  The CG does well to set the tone where you would have dialogue in a normal novel as well.  Calling this a ""Game"" feels a bit far fetched, but if you want a good story and characters to care about, this visual novel is absolutely wonderful at setting that up for you.  I will say that for English based individuals, the translations from Chinese, (I think it's chinese based right?) to English does leave a bit to be desired, but if you're interested in cultures other than your own, it's actually a nice little something I actually like.  Instead of the developers giving a story that conforms to your own speech patterns, they give you a story that stays true to the roots of where it as made, so it has a sort of ""peek,"" into others culture.  If that doesn't interest you, and you need everything to sound like normal English standards, I wouldn't recommend it.  (honestly it's 4am where I live, so I don't know if I'm writing on the level of ""Normal English Standards,"" myself lol.)HOWEVER, if you are looking for a story, and can forgive the non-English friendly translations, then buy it.  It's cheaper than heck, and you get way more than you should for the small price you pay.  So far, I have been extremely happy with the story, and I can't wait to read more."

I love what they've done with backgrounds and CG's. Voice acting is nice although old mans yapping = skip. We've got some intriguing background flash back story and then it starts with us coming to school after summer break. Translation is good, pacing of the story, small nice jokes, fun characters.Yeah I just see no reason to not promote it right away (except no resolution change). I am interested how this game will progress. I doubt that my opinion is gonna change, so I can clearly recommend Tricolour Lovestory already for it's price. After all I saw in many VN's. This is exceptionaly elegant game."

So far I have only finished the first chapter, and I can't wait to see what will happen next. This game has the best character design, best plot design, best cg, and best bgm. I've only played Mandarin version, and the rhetorics and literary style in dialogues in this game (especially the monologue of the main guy and his inner world) are amzing. Though I doubt the English version can be as good as the Mandarin one because of the complexity of translation.I sincerely recommand you this game if you speak Mandarin and you like love story. It will worth much more than $1."

I have spent 8 hours digging through the story line so far, and definitely look forward to finishing up what's left.... no matter how long it takes.The anime artwork is top notch --- some of the better stuff I have seen so far --- though I have to be up front.... if you are looking for Japan-a-ponn, you're not gonna find it here.So.... just what is here?   A high school story of rebellion and friendship.   Of betrayal and loss.   All seen through the eyes of an Asian perspective.   It is not all that common (as it is in America) for teens to openly defy their parents.   So the very beginning of the story sets you up for a shock... and then gives you the foundation for what is to follow.  I don't want to say to much... because it really is worth reading through.The English is a bit off.... there are words that even I had to look up (Sequelae ?????)  but for the most part it's understandable.   I would say that the English really does need to be re-worked overall though, if they really want to reach the American market.  A bit more explanation of the Asian school system, some better word choices, clearer indication of when Ashley is thinking.... or talking.... that sort of thing.   But for the price, it's still worth getting.On a 10 star rating system, I would give this a 6 star rating for sure (above average).  The artwork is a 7 (Greatly above average).  and if I do find that later on in the game there are interactive portions to the story... I will definitely raise my ratings.For the price of $2.... it's worth it."

The character design looks really good, the main reason why i bought this game is because on how good the art looks. BG is nice to look at and the CGs is quite beautiful.Sound: As i dont really speak Chinese, i cant really rate this one, i think i would say its okay, but nothing special since i dont know who does who for the voices. A good seiyuus/VA can make a good VN imo.Music is pretty generic SOL/Romance type, i would say its quite weak since i've played VN that has music far more memorable than this one.Translation: Probably the weakest part and a huge turn off of this game. The English translation were AWFUL. English is also not my first language, so understanding everything is really hard for me.Conclusion: A VN with fantastic visuals for such a incredibly low price, unfortunately got ruined by the bad translation (unless you can read Chinese). If this is your first time trying to get into the genre, put this on hold and play some top classic/mainstream VNs first, if not, get it for the very low price. You wont regret it."

76561198370256353,Recommended,668630,35235517,Posted: 26 September,all,萌萌小燕子,"I finished this game for about 10 hours in 3 days.  I have to say it is a wonderful galgame.As you see it is a pure love visual novel. Maybe it is about love triangle, and this theme is not fresh for us ,such asWhite Album2. But,Tricolour lovestoryhappens in China in 2005.That's not similar to Japan or other countries.12 years ago, most Chinese parents and teachers were strict to students, and students need a high score in tests. after a 3-year hard-working ,students need to attend NCEE (the National College Entrance Examinations). (There are other ways to enroll students for colleges but the quota is limited and the requirement is not easy to meet. Most students are admitted from NCEE) Generally speaking, NCEE is a fairest way to choose the excellent students. And a high degree from a good college is a guarantee of your ability .So that the NCEE is important and competitive. That is also the reason why most parents require their children to study hard. Even there exists a phenomenon that some parents think spending time on art or anything else is a waste of time and money because they are ""useless"" in study and work. InTricolour Lovestory, Ashley's parents are just like that. This phenomenon is rare now because more and more people understand that it is harmful to children. But 12 years ago or earlier, many parents did not realize that.The voice performance is in high level. The paintings and BGM are also satisfying. The game with this quality is worth more than the price in Steam. If you are interested in visual novel about lovestory ,tricolour lovestoryis a good game for you.By the way, there are homages and catchwords inTricolour Lovestory.You could find when you are playing. There is an interesting thing I have to explain for you. That is something about episode related. It is not important for the whole story but if you want to enjoy the game well, you can read the hidden information after finishing the first chapter.Green Luo takes charge of the commentator of the E-Sports(Here is playing WarⅢ). In the last round between Daisy and Ashley, Green thinks Ashley is going to win and he judged that Daisy can never beat Ashley in that round. We could call the situation “Destoryers Ride On Her Face”. However, Ashley lost the match finally. This part is a homage to a StarCraftⅡ game between Toodming and Alicia. (WCS 2014 America Group F). Toodming is at an advantage in the round 2, and he has a lot of mutalisks. (Mutalisks Ride On One’s Face). And the rebroadcast of this game in China is commentated by Xudong Huang. He judged the situation that Toodming is going to win. The details are as fellows.“TooDming has 180 supplies with mutalisks, easy to win Alicia.Alicia dares go out, his 3rd base is still building.180 supplies with mutalisks confront 120 supplies how to lose, tell me.Hitting his face can win, failure is impossibleJust having base trade is going to win, hitting his face also win, how to lose, impossible, Impossible to lose.……Rush rush rush rush ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuush！！！！Let's see what is a professional commentator .Mutalisks ride on Alicia's face, what is mutalisks ride on your face?Appropriate Force field brings no help.“Well, Toodming finally lost the game.Now you can know the commentator ,XuDong Huang ,from the new broadcaster SCBOYS in StarCraftⅡ .He is a professional commentator. However, there are many times when he judged by professional analyzing situation, the match became uncertain, and even the situation changed at once. So that Xudong get a nickname” Xudong, the jinxer, Huang”(Just a joke. He is professional enough but it seems that players always perform as his expectation…)Then each time he is sure about something and judge, people may think that event will be uncertain even be contrary to his judgement. (Only joking)Intricolour lovestory,you may see Green is a a jinxer. When he is certain about something, that thing usually does not happen as his expectation."
