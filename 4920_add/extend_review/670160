Anything said in this review is not to be insulting, but rather for constructive critisiscm. With that said, let's get started.I was browsing the early access games, looking for an interesting game. The cover for this game looked rather interesting, so I read the description and reviews. Seeing all the positive reviews, this game sounded great. I bought the game, and when seeing the menu for the first time, I was very confused. Apparently, this game hasn't been updated since Christmas. So it is still on the Christmas update, even after August.I decided to play on. I some what enjoyed the opening. However, playing this at 800 x 600 annoyed the ever living **** out of me. Only few minutes in, and we already were hitting the horror, which I guess is alright, since some people might want to cut right into the action. Once the story part is over, you get thrown in a room with a flashlight, where you have to find and collect keys to unlock doors before you get killed by what I assume is zombie ponies. You know whats great? Going to the bathroom and getting a key, and having these zombie ponies corner you and kill you instantly. I honestly wouldn't mind this, as I'm not one to give up, but with the death screen being annoying, and somewhat long, then having to navigate to find your save, I'm just not having it with all of that, just to get insta killed by a zombie pony.This is all I've managed to playthrough here. This could be a really good game if some of this stuff was fixed. Like the death screen. It's just something annoying I find about the game."

,Recommended,670160,34563411,Posted: 28 August,all,♥ Aryanne Hoofler ♥,I really enjoyed this game. I love the dark feeling and really? It's a pony game which is very rare. I feel this game has great potential and cant wait to see where it goes! Gos from a 0 to 10 instantly and only grows from there. Keep it up and here's to hoping Hasbro does not attempt to drop the mighty copyright hammer on you.Prosinteresting StoryColorful cast of charactersIt delivers on the horror experience.It's a pony game that has not been shot down by Hasbro.Has a lot of secrets to keep you playing and attempting to findOnly two dollars!Great old school graphicsConsSomewhat bad Pathfinding but bearableThe game is fairly short around an hour if you're trying to get from point A to B(Which these should be fixed in the future hopefully)
,Recommended,670160,34583548,Posted: 29 August,all,21BlackJack,"For $1.59 (on sale), this game has turned out to be entertaining. I like how it holds more of a creepy feel rather than focusing on jumpscares like a lot of other modern horror games. I actually felt the tension in this game, though if there was volume control, it would be very nice, since I play with headphones that try to deafen me whenever I play this game.Overall, though, this was pretty good for an Early Access for the price.I would also recommend to the developers making the shooter controls the default instead of the classic, aling with that volume control in the options menu. For anyone buying this game, I'd say to switch the controls to shooter to make it a lot easier to figure out and play."

,Recommended,670160,34508522,Posted: 26 August,all,Polite People,"While not very technologically advanced, this game has very charming pixel art graphics, highly customizable controls (I suggest you turn on the Shooter mode and use WASD keys to walk around), funny jokes (put on a scarf if you're freezing!) and a truly creepy atmosphere.The game costs so little, so it's definitelly worth the purchase!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Очаровательная графика в стиле пискель-арт, удобно настраиваемое управление (рекомендую переключиться в режим Shooter и бегать клавишами WASD), забавные шутки (надо было надеть шарфик, чтобы не было холодно!) и поразительно криповая атмосфера.За такие копейки игру однозначно рекомендую!"

Well, not anymore!Now it´s english, you have new Skills and you understand everything! Still, the Write Art from this Game is not always easy to read. And, it´s (who guessed?) Buggy. But, that doesn´t stop this Game to be awesome! So if you want a good Game for ca 2 hours, with some gore, Key searching and Demon Pony Killing Stuff, you came to the right Place! Totally worth the Money, would buy again. And for the Language, if you need some help, i can translate in German^^"

,Recommended,670160,34537607,Posted: 27 August,all,MadDoggyca,"UPDATEDFor the 2$ ish is basscilly a complete game with no techinical issues,,, Beat the entire game in under 4 hours but could be beaten 1st time around in less then 3 or even in 2 hours if useing the ""Shooter"" controls...so ya for 2$ its worth it. but don't expect too much...Decent game with a lot of movment fustration via Classic and rpg controls. Shooter controls are the only setup I suggest, The AI/Players track paterent is just bad when useing Classic, or RPG controls. Great old school graphics, awesome sounds/music., easy to follow menu."

76561198034698785,Recommended,670160,34515180,Posted: 26 August,all,Sir Gaylord Speckle,okay the game was very creepy and had a good atmosphere up to the point i played it however there are no tutorials. maybe i'm just lazy but i'm not going to look through control lists to know how to do stuff devs just need to ad a segemnt where we are introduced to how things work. another problem is the resolution and font is painful to look at but the game did just come out so im expecting to be inproved apon. my final problem is movement its sluggish why not move character is arrows or wsad and use the cursor like a point and click game? really thats all i have a problem with so far ill come back to the game when there is a tutorial but until then its shown enough to get a recommendation
