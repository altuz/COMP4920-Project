,Recommended,670900,34911566,Posted: 12 September,all,Cr8zy 8z,"If you want to have a fun, competitve NASCAR or Racing game, here ya go. If you think this is just like Heat Evolution, instead of trying to persuade you into thinking it is or isn't, let me note the differences between the two...1.Stages, and Overtime2.Kinda Paint booth3.Very different Career, you have to jump into random trucks, and try and get rides.4.Physics, if you hit the apron you get loose, just like you would in iRacing or even in real life, but your car doesn't just immedetley whip around like in Evolution..5.All 3 series6. Completley new soundtrack, and background, which is actually pretty cool7. There is Split screen, and not just for console but also PC8. You can have Cautions again in multiplayer9. You can have AI fill all the empty spots in online10.NO RUBBERBANDING AI!!!!11. Rivals, if you continue to hit and crash into people in Career, they will slowly get mad at you.12. Momentum, if you continue to do well in Career, with a full-time ride, you can upgrade/fix parts faster, and stuff like that.13.The AI are improved, they don't crash in the triovals, and they usually know that you are there instead of just wrecking you.14. No fake drivers, all real drivers whom started Daytona15. Built-in DLC, almost at least 1 or 2 extra paint schemes for most drivers, not just Toyotas either.16. Drafting, at plate tracks, and even any other track, you can sidedraft, just draft, or bump draft, and it actually will make you and the car whom your bump drafting/drafting go faster.17. You can drive custom cars on online and in single player18. Damamge model is much more realistic, the car with have the hood caved way in, or bent all the way up. Hard to describe, but it is greatley increased.19. Not as twitchy when turning, the car is pretty stable, heavier, and more in control.20. Brakes are ten times better, your not drifting in every corner.21. Driver models of most real drivers22. Victory music, if you win a race, online or offline, a song/tune in which you can choose plays, for all too hear.23. Victory lane celebration, just a little scene of you, your car, and your team, and your trophy.That's all I can think of, but there is certainly more.What I wish they could fix/add:1. Cautions, they come out better for a crash, but still if you crash by yourself, the caution usually doesn't come out...2. Weird REV bug, where there is a weird random loud rev in the background that gets quiet, and then loud. Just a minor bug in which they could fix.3. Crash physics, you still usually go flying into the air, not as bad, but you still usually get airborne, at least a little, and if you hit the wall diagloney, you spin out.4. AI always crashing in turns 1 and two at Texas.5.Private online races, like NASCAR The Game series, where you have only people that you want or invite6. Random bug I found, I was in a race, and all of a sudden, it said I was in posistion zero, zero miles an hour, rpms, etc. I could change stuff like the leaderboard, but.....Only happened once though..7.Would like victory burnouts8. Would like a track map, especially for all the new road courses...9. Would like it so you don't have to switch from leaderboard, to laps, to fuel, to damage, to water temp. NASCAR '15 had the track map, fuel gage, temperature, and a small leaderboard, all neatley on the screen.Off the top of my head, that is all I can think of. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the best, I would rate this game at probably a 7.3/10. NASCAR Heat Evolution would probably be a 3.1/10, and NASCAR '15 would be a 7/10, but if they fixed the broken AI and all the stupid glitches, it would probably be a 9/10. All in all, this is a very fun, exciting, competitive, enjoyable fun NASCAR Game. I don't think that it should cost $50, I would have to say probably about $35 or so, which it will fall to $25 in a few months, so that won't matter. Not everything is the way it should be, and not everything that was complained about in NHE was fixed, but about 85% of it was, and they even added several new features and things."
,Recommended,670900,34907401,Posted: 12 September,all,Sir Shanks,"This is a huge improvement over the previous game. The AI are aggressive, but not too aggresive, the tracks look good day and night, and the inclusion of xfinity and camping world trucks is a nice bonus. So far I've raced a couple different races with all 3 stages and the AI race harder at the end of a stage and on the last couple laps. Have not tried career yet but it looks promising.Wheel support is there, and its good. I have a G29 w/ shifter and it works like a charm after running the config tool. It does take some time to get it how you want it as I have not quite got it set up how I need it yet. Feedback feels good and there are options for deadzones and sensitivites in the config.Overall if you're a Nascar fan this game will do you well even if it is an arcade style game. I love sim racing but I will have plenty of fun with this. Is it worth $50? I say yes if you love the sport and plan to race career or at least online with a buddy. Otherwise wait for a sale."

,Recommended,670900,34907820,Posted: 12 September,all,racer8848,Coming from someone who hated Heat Evolution with a passion this game is a step in the right direction. It still is not perfect but isn't bad either. I've ran in all three series and they all feel distinct and the dirt physics are pretty decent. Tracks have character you can feel the bumps in them and if you do not learn your breaking points the game will punish you for it. All and all though a very decent NASCAR game probably the best one in quite some time.

The AI is good, the won't take you out like in '15. The career mode is a blast, nothing like starting at the bottom and working your way up. I recommend it, give it a try."

Clippz,"Just to hop right into it, the game is not like all of the older papyrus games or some of the other beloved games, but it is a LARGE improvement from NHE. No doubt about it. If you are looking for a Simcade type of game, NH2 is at that point. With around 11 hours cashed in, the game feels great and enjoyable. The AI are amazing, especially with no rubber-banding, and the tracks feel much better compared to NHE (You can use the apron too). I would definetely recommend the game to the simcade guys. Since, I do compete in iRacing, I use this game to just kind of mess with. and have some relaxed fun."

I played Nascar back on the PS1 with Nascar Heat and Nascar Thunder 2004. I have heard the negative feedback regarding the previous release and held off on buying a newer Nascar title until this release. All I can say is I really enjoy this game. Boogity boogity boogity lets go racing drivers!

If anyone has ever played the older NASCAR games, they'd understand. The physics aren't meant to be sim, trust me. I just love having a NASCAR game I can sit on the couch and play with a friend on a projector or large TV. Graphics are much better, AI was good but now it's great. I'm still against the idea of paying for paint schemes but the content is here. All 3 series have a unique feel. Eldora is fun. Online with AI and friends is pretty cool. I play NR2003 when I'm in the super serious mode, and then I play this when I want the all around NASCAR experience offline with all the rules in the hands of a controller. I'm looking forward to an even BETTER NASCAR Heat 3."

I didn't play NASCAR Heat Evolution because my wheel wouldn't work with it, and it also had a ton of bad reviews, so I just saved my money on that one. This game is extremely fun to play so far though. Multiplayer is chaotic, but is a ton of fun, and the single player quick races are great too. The game lacks a good car customizer, but I assume that will come out in future games. I play iRacing casually, so I have an idea of how a nascar game that is a simulator feels. No this isn't a simulator, yes, it's an arcade game, but if you take it for what it is, it's a ton of fun to play. One thing I hated was how hard it was to set up my wheel. After a few HOURS of tinkering, I finally got it to work correctly. I would 100% recommend this game if you want something fun, yet slightly challenging to play!"
76561197998013976,Recommended,670900,34963526,Posted: 14 September,all,nomadrider,"A great improvement over NHE. Still plenty of room for improvement. I knew going in that this wasn't a hardcore sim. Knowing that I accept this as what it is. NH2 is a console port. I didn't bother to plug in my G29. This is a gamepad game.  Nascar in an arcade package.  I'm enjoying it for what it is. That being said, multiplayer is dead! 1 server running atm on superspeedways with 7 players and a bunch of AI cars. If you want a Nascar game that is very playable with a small learning curve here it is. If you are looking for a true Sim experience you are looking in the wrong place.  I'm giving it a positive rating because of how much better it is than last years effort.Someday maybe we'll get a Nascar title better than Nascar Racing 2003 by Papyrus. (I refuse to rent I-racing) This is not that game nor does it try to be. This is more of a true successor to the old Nascar Heat series which is what you might expect by the name.  Buy it if you are willing to accept it for the game it is.Now that I've got some time into the game. The AI are not that bad once you get them adjusted to the proper speed to be competetive with you. It takes some tweaking and time. They seem to get more agressive at the end of stages and the end of the race which is good. They don't have a good grasp on pit strategy however. I'm running a championship with 25% distance races and tried increasing to 2x tire wear and fuel consumption. The AI had no clue that they needed to pit following the stages and instead started pitting a few laps into the second stage. After stage 2 they would also stay on track resulting in a green flag stop in stage 3 unless a caution came out.  I ended up changing the fuel and tire wear back to 1x because of this. I just ran the 1st Michigan Cup series race of the season and after stage 1 I pitted and for whatever reason the free pass car was Martin Truex Jr. No idea why or how he was lapped. I decided to follow him through traffic for a few laps. He quickly worked us back into the top 20 before I turned under him on the backstretch to try for a top 10 on the stage. At the end of the stage we were 8th and 10th. which having pitted and not needing fuel put us 1 and 2 on the restart.  I took off and the pack quickly started working us over after a few laps and we fell back into the top 10. I decided to hook back up begind him and started bump drafting down the back stretch to get us back out front. We had a 2 second gap over 3rd when he dropped to pitroad. they can and will race you hard if you have them set right.  I'm hanging out 3rd in points with a couple of wins and a decent chance of making it to the final round at Homestead. I don't want it to be easy.The AI don't seem to suffer as badly as I do when they get aero damage,(watched helplessly as badly wrecked cars drove right by me at Daytona) that needs addressed. Also the pit strategy needs a lot of work. Cautions are not realistic at all but a major crash brings one out. Some times you'll have no idea what caused a caution. Also theres some rules that need to be implemented like the double yellow lines at Daytona and Talledega have no meaning at all other than marking the bottom of the track in the game.Over all though this game aint bad for singleplayer once you find a challenging set of options for you.  I've still not tried setting up my G-29 This is a gamepad game and that's how I'm playing it. Leave stability on an drive it with a controller and it's fine. I don't want to dominate the feild with a tweaked out setup. This game isn't made for that. It's console Nascar racing with a reasonable challenge. I feel that my wheel might be too much for this one.Thought about picking up Project Cars 2 since it comes with a few decent Ovals but then learned that it has 0 oval track style rules and no full feild cautions."

I did have to go into the software for my Thrustmaster Ferrari wheel and change my pedals to a single axis to get the game to see my pedals.  After that everything works great.  Had one crash going from qualifying to race, which sucked but not a game ender.I started with Papyrus Nascar 1 with Hawaii to connect for online play.  This isn't bad."

This is not a sim and quite frankly it's not trying to be.  This is a game.  And more importantly, it is FUN!  I love iRacing and play it all the time but sometimes I just want to have some fun playing a NASCAR game against some AI and not be screamed at by my fellow competitors or have to worry about my safety rating.  Really dont understand the criticisms of the wheel support as my G29 and TH8A work like a charm.  This game is far better than I was expecting.   It is better than NASCAR Heat Evolution to an almost shocking degree.  It's also far better than any of the crap ETX produced or the last couple of NASCAR games EA put out after they started mailing it in.  The game has improved in almost every conceivable area.  Yes, there is still a lot of room for improvement but this is a very solid NASCAR game.  The fact that a patch has come out just several days after launch tells me the devs are listening to the community.   Thank you 704 Games for making the game this aging NASCAR gamer has been waiting for for well over 10 years.  Can't wait to see what future iterations in the series are like."

,Not Recommended,670900,34982086,Posted: 15 September,all,BoneyHead95,"NASCAR Heat 2 Review: Caution Needed!Game Engine:UnityGame Type:Racing / SimcadeNASCAR 08 (PS2)was the last NASCAR game I played and loved. Ten years later, hungry for a racing game of this kind I thought I would give this one a try. Now being developed by different developers I was a little taken back by what Heat 2 lacked. Now I never played Heat Evolution but I know enough that it was a bad game. Now Heat 2 isn’t a bad game unlike its predecessor, far from it. It’s pretty good but not fantastic and nothing like what came before during the time of EA version of NASCAR games. Still the graphics are pretty awesome on PC and I love the core gameplay itself.But why is the game lacking so many basic things. Why can’t I look back? Why do I have to press Y or triangle every race to get the behind view HUD to appear? Why did my game crash just as I had only three laps left? How did I survive that pile-up? Now this game does have its issues but it is starting to grow on me. It tries to add depth towards its career mode by having rivals, tweets and video messages from other drivers on the field. You can now earn your way through the different series and it feels just like the previous games in the past which feels good! You can even customise a base car already given to you from any of the three series and use it in career mode once you’ve got a contract from one of the teams.But I can’t recommended this game, at least not until a sale. This game has too many issues and I hope a patch can fix most of them. If the issues are fixed I will change this review to a recommend. But I feel it will take a few more attempts before they get the perfect formulae right. Monster Games have worked hard and there is care put into this game but I have a feeling using a different engine (Unreal Engine) and focusing on some much needed features would benefit the next Heat game. This will do me for now and maybe I might change this review later on, but a part of me still thinks this game could have been so much better.Final Score: 6.8Pros•	Includes NASCAR National Series: Monster Energy, Xfinity, and Camping World Trucks.•	Basic Paint Booth for your car which can be used in career mode.•	Custom Winning Anthems which plays after you win a race.•	Great Music•	Great Menu•	Great Gameplay•	Improving cars depends on how well you do in each race for your team.

NH2 is not perfect but its better than the last versions of NASCAR we have had here on Steam. If you are looking to replace NR2k3, this isnt it... but  this is actually a  fun casual game. The addition of the top 3 touring series is nice. The cars/trucks handle differently as well.  I know that I would have like to have seen  a more sim oriented approach, but for an arcade game its fun... Case in point, I hooked the apron in Richmond and had it half spun but nothing happened... the car snapped back straight.Graphically its ok - not the best but not the worst.   Maxed out on my system it looks ok -  but not what we should have for 2017. The vsync issue isnt one if you know how to use nVidia Nspector... just lock it there and you wont need to worry about it.The pros are that its a massive improvement, and its actually fun  - not nearly as frustrating to deal with as the last few titles... and for that alone its worth a look.  The 3 touring series, the career mode, are nice to have too. The challenges bring me back to the old school Nascar Heat from 2000/01 ish, and are enjoyable.Another thing I do enjoy about this version  - the REAL cars... none of those fake schemes.. or lower tier drivers in cars they never drove. Plus if you verify your age you get the beer cars... not a major deal to some but its a nice touch.The cons for me at this point are the sound (isnt close to being what the real thing sounds like), the lack of pace car/manual caution laps, and the handling... its just too arcade for me. That said, I mainly got it to split screen with friends who are casual players, and its already been a big hit.Id also like to have received the #41 Daytona winner post race car that console users got.Id like a more robust replay system but its not a deal breaker at this point."

This one: not so much. Incredibly lazy effort by developers:First off:  The main reason for paying for this is the online-play.This is marred by ""Failed to connect to servers"", ""Authentication failed"" etc.Not Good Enough.- How would you like it if my payment was only avaliable to you some of the time?As for the rest of the game:  Appaling few adjustments. Car setup: No. A simple things as online race-chat: Of course not.Graphics that are generations behind the likes of Project Cars, Assetto Corsa etc.This might be ok if it was a 5dollar game.

76561198042784353,Not Recommended,670900,34943397,Posted: 13 September,all,Deckard,"How much you enjoy this game probably depends a lot on if you can get it working acceptably. First up, my Thrustmaster wheel wasn't recognised, so over to Xbox controller. Game starts in a fullscreen window and has no in game way of setting an exclusive fullscreen, so unless you use an Aero desktop on W7 you will have broken vsync. Had more than a few crashes to desktop after launch with an ""oops.."" dialog box.There are no problems with a tiny interface like Assetto Corsa here, the UI is so big it can be seen from space. Unfortunately, I experienced a horrible frameskipping that occurs momentarily every few seconds. No amount of fiddling with nvidia inspector could fix it even though CPU, GPU and memory were far below being maxed out (the GPU working at a pedestrian 30%). UI graphics are OKish, but rather low res, in game graphics are simple, clean and quite nice except for some very intrusive shadow draw-in which occurs right in front of your car at a static distance.  The views are terrible for sim racers. The bonnet camera is set very high and it's really a roof camera, the behind car view is OK for arcade racing but the in car view is so far back you may as well be sitting in the back seat. The view outside the car is a paltry third of the screen. There is no seat adjustment or FOV control to speak of.  There is also, other than the mirror, no look back view, which is a rather mystifying omission.Pit crew animations are really good. Music is not. When you fire up Project Cars you're greeted with a tune that conjures up feelings of driving back from the opera in your BMW. Well, the music here will remind you of waking up covered in your own vomit in the toilet of a seedy bar. ""Chemical Weapon"" song? Seriously.Overall, there maybe a fun racer in there if I could get past all the broken bits. Not everyone seems to suffer the framerate/vsync issues but many do if you read the discussion threads.  Unfortunately the game ends up more Buddy Bretherton than Cole Trickle. On the positive side, I don't live next to the guy that selected the soundtrack."

Oh where do I begin.AI are still glued to the track. I went full throttle in to a car and they simply slid and continued at full speed. I spun out and was pummled. While not nearly as bad as the previous title, the same impact that does nothing to the AI will send you spinning. I have spent an entire straightaway steering in to another drivers quarter panel, only for that to result in them straightening the car with zero issue and leave me spinning.AI can run stupidly unrealistic lines, holding the inside line (as in, the yellow or white line at the bottom of the track above the apron and sometimes the border between grass and the rest of the track) the entire way around the track andstillcarry more speed off the corner than you.Dooring the AI out of their racing line does nothing, they continue on at the exact same speed that they would have on the bottom. On the bottom? Pffft. They can go lower than your car can ever hope to go, with more speed.Cautions are completley broken and you can drive backwards on the track with none coming out. Massive pileups rarely trigger cautions, yet sometimes cars simply sliding do.AI will randomly change finishing order at the end of stages and at the end of a race. That guy you just had a hard race against for third? Naaah the game decides he'll be 14th.I have seen drivers that normally don't even complete ten laps in real life win four races in a row in career mode.AI will *never* gain or lose positions on pit road, unless those positions are lost to cars that did not pit. Following that, AI seem to all follow the same strategy of ""Take just enough gas to make it and never take tires"" leading me to think that only the player is impacted whatsoever by tire wear.Damage? Laughable. I can deal with a subpar visual model, I'd rather have strong gameplay mechanics than a pretty scene. Only the AI can sustain enough damage to finish the race. Anything else, the player can fix and not lose any speed when all is said and done. Do so under a caution and fast forward through it, and any amount of damage can be fixed without losing a lap on the track.The career mode features a new contract based system as opposed to the ""build up a team"" career mode in, well, every NASCAR game since the 2000's. I like the innovation, but I do miss the owner driver aspect of the older games. Particularly when you earn money at the end of every race in this gamethat has absolutley zero in game function.Hope you don't enjoy qualifying well, because the AI recieve a massive speed bost during qualifiing. I'm talking that I have started dead last by several seconds in a race that I was able to get to the leadwithin eight laps, lead every lap past that, and lap the field.Not that it impacts PC players, however the console players have no way of changing their button layout on their controller. Speaking of controlls, the default sensitivites for steering and braking are appalling. If you do buy this game, prepare to spend time getting them to a comfortable level.A paint booth was actually added to the game! Unfortunately there are only a handful of templates available, and the same four car numbers that were available last year. With zero font options.Yet again, you cannot create a name for you racer in game. It is constantly tied to your Steam name.Edit 1: Eldora is a FANTASTIC addition! However, it is unfortunately ruined by a complete lack of multi grove racing (The high lane at Eldora being half a second slower? Huh?) and the AI running the same two groves, straight as an arrow, lap after lap.Oh how I wish I hadn't put this much time in to this game before I realized these, that way I could at least get my money back. To top it all off:Day 1 paid DLC."

Few things to note: I tried this with an old XBox 360 wired controller and the handling was awful. Very sensitive and uncomfortable. A brand new wired Xbox One controller (bought for another game I had recently purchased the same day) and the handling is much much better. I don't know the specifics to why this is since I dont use gamepads often but keep this in mind I guess.The AI at 105% with the default setups are too fast in qualifying but only fast in the top 10 during the race so most of your races without car setup adjustments will consist of you starting last and having to cut through the field. Using custom setups however, I get either pole or top 5 consistantly and completely destroy the field in race with the same setup, often by half a lap after about 10 laps. For the best experience in quickplay I'd suggest making a Q setup (old NHE ones from last year still work fine) but sticking to default race setup.Another note is that most of my practice races were at Atlanta which currently has very worn racing surface. Despite this, the track behaves like its from 1997-2002 being freshly paved in other words very little tire fall off. Granted, I was running sprint races with 1x wear but even after 15 laps on 1x you should lost at least half a second. This isn't gamebreaking but just keep in mind the cars/tracks are simplified thus the tracks lack some personality.IN SHORT: the game exceeds where it needs to. Hardcore players will always prefer iRacing and NR2003, but for console gamers or sim racers who just want a laid back offline experience with a solid career mode, much improved AI, the game does just fine. Don't bother with DLC skins of course, just buy the base game, you can just edit and create your own skins with UABE anyway like any other sim. I don't mind DLC and would consider buying some but they need to provide more things than just skins.8/10 final score from me"

Nascar Heat 2 has massively improved from Nascar Heat Evolution. The engines sound a BIT better but they could've made them sound better. They sould like they are from the Nascar Thunder games. Of course the addition of Xfinity and Truck Series is a MAJOR plus. If we could get the Modified series in Heat 3 that would be amazing, but if not, I'm perfectly happy with the 3 series we have. Graphics are pretty much the same from the first game. I usually don't grade a game based on it's graphics but this looks like it's on Xbox 360 or PS3. The cars handle really well, the AI is pretty good and sometimes I have a blast just racing against one car for a couple of laps. Only complaint is that all the AI does is follow the ""Inside Line."" There is no ""Outside Line"" AI in this game. Unless your at Homestead. I'm not sure if it's a glitch but when I race on Homestead ALL of the cars/trucks race on the outside line near the barrier. Otrherwise, this game is pretty great for a Nascar game.7.5/10What I would like to see in future Nascar Heat 2 Updates/Nascar Heat 3-A minimap in the lower left hand corner. (NASCAR 98 HAD A MINIMAP)-Maybe the Modified Series in Heat 3?-Better Graphics (Doesn't really matter to me that much but it would be nice.)-Even better Engine sounds.-More Variety in the AI's track patterns.-Better looking UI. (On the Track) (Main Menus are great, keep them).-More in Depth Paint Booth. (Something like NASCAR 15's but with a little bit more freedom.)-FIX THE CAUTIONS.Anyways I'm really enjoying this game.

HOWEVER it takes several steps back as well.Such as no track map, not 360 view of car when racing (that I could find), and a few crashing bugs. That being said let me say this.The developers seemed to listen the the community but they only have so much to work with right now, Their $30 ""Hot pass"" is overpriced imo but they have to make money where they can and if people buy it then you can't really blame them. I don't think the expansion and hot passes were really a great idea.. Kinda seems like someone is milking it.

I'm a diehard iracing fan, and my biggest gripe with last years was that the cars just felt off and didn't seem to handle right.  They never felt like you couldn't control the car but the physics especially going into turns made the cars feel looser than they were but instead of needing to apply the brake letting off of the gas just a tad suddenly made the cars tight to where you could unnaturally corner at higher speeds than you could in most.  That's not the case with 2, the brake actually serves a purpose and you will be overtook more time than not if you do not time braking and cornering.Last years, had very little visable cosmetic damage, this year you can see body damage.  I've not noticed a whole lot of scratches in the paint but I've only ran about 5 career races and haven't went out of my way to see if the paint shows contact damage.  I was just content with seeing hood damage and body damage.  I think that was one of the big things that got me into oval racing was the need to minimize damage but also how cool your car looks after turning 100 laps.I'm more of a sim racer but I really really have enjoyed the small amount of time I've spent with nascar heat and definitely can not wait to play more."

I can't remember.), that alone is making the game enjoyable for me.Now, one of the things I'm kinda dissapointed by is the damage, Nascar 2011 (the last Nascar I played not including Heat 1), had super realistic damage and crash physics, for example spin a car out and he hits the wall, you'll see small pieces fly off the hood and it crumple like a tin can.

I can use the steering wheel in a very basic setup with gas/brake pedals (not able to use clutch), paddle shifting (not able to use H-Shifter), and steering/button usage.  The force feedback seems non-existant on this at the moment, which can make racing two or three wide a little slippery BUT I'm thankful that I can still play at the moment.  It's just very odd that I can use the steering wheel's basic functions to race but the software does not recognize that the wheel is connected for a more robust experience.  This lack of current support is the game's biggest drawback at the moment.Otherwise, it has been pretty good.  I'm not very far into my career mode - starting with the Camping World Truck series as a hot seat driver and I have only raced a couple races for other teams temporarily.  AI doesn't seem as bad as some previous NASCAR games I have played specifically in restarts but it does seem like I can jump off the line compared to them so watch out for that first turn if you are agressive.I have not tried this with my Xbox 360 controller so I do not know how that feels but if they fix the wheel support to allow me to use a fairly common wheel then this game will be solid.  For now, I'll give it a thumbs up just because I can still play at the moment but if it was possible on steam I would give this game a so-so, indifferent review.

The sound is ""Okay"" it woul've been nice if each series had its own sounds like in dirt to daytona.The physics are surprisingly good you can actually catch the car for once without stability help, and each series' car handles unique. The only problem in the physics department is without stability help if you tag the apron you're done for.The one gripe I have with the game is the AI they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ especially on plate tracks if you go 3 wide on the outside on daytona your relationship with the wall will be intimate. They occasionally decide to brake check you (mainly restarts) much like how they would in the old nascar thunder games. They'll also come down on you even though you are clearly beside them. Not to mention they WILL run your♥♥♥♥♥off the track.The career mode is pretty fun, you start out being a back up driver if someone can't race you may recieve an offer to replace them. After that if you impress the teams you'll get a full time contract. If you do good you get momentum and that'll help in the pitstop department.Multiplayer actually has players for once and it doesn't seem to boot you out of a race like last year. The cautions are nice but are really slow to happen.If you liked the Heat Evolution soundtrack then you will love this one.The graphics are great they look better than last year by a lot. Only problem here is even with vsync turned on or off the game is choppy not game breaking but can be annoying.The customization options are minimum but better than nothing I do not like the idea of sponsors being added as dlc which is unforunately gonna happen.All in all the game is good it's no sim so don't try to compare it to nr2003 or iracing cause it's not even remotely close in that catagory.

I've since deleted it and spent a couple hours with the game.I have been sim racing, simcade racing, and arcade racing since the late 90's. I've played just about every racing title released on PC. Over the years there have been some really good games. When talking Nascar games Papyrus was always the top dog in sim racing. We had Nascar Racing 2 and 3 that were awesome for their time, and then came the original Nascar Heat released around 2000. That was a fun game! It wasn't Papy, but it was just plain fun!That's what I've had to tell myself and give Nascar Heat 2 another shot.It's not NR2003, iRacing, or even Nascar Heat of yesteryear, but it's the best attempt at a Nascar game that we've had for a long time. It's not perfect, there are some handling issues, and poor AA. If you go into it just looking to have fun you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a true sim, this isn't it, and it never really tries to be.Nascar Heat 2 isn't really what I was hoping it would be, but its fun, and I will happily support any developer that's willing to produce a Nascar game.

It is just like all the other NASCAR games before it. It is very arcady. The downside is the spotters are too repetitive in their sayings, as in every other games in the series, but easily adjusted in the settings. Controls can be a bit sluggish and the AI will get random bursts of speed out of nowhere, as well as rivalries are very easily earned. The first couple days I just went out wreckinh everyone to win, as I am sure we all have done at some point. That gets boring fast!!! Toned it down and started drafting and diving into corners. Turn up the AI and have fun, it gets wild out there."

As someone who's very familiar with those games, I'm genuinely impressed with this one. Obviously it is not the super-realistic sim that either one of those are, but man is it nice to finally have an up-to-date NASCAR game with what seems to be a great career mode and just overall fun gameplay.**EDITED**I have a Driving Force GT and the configuration took a few minutes, with an error, but it eventually was sorted out. I'm surprised that you have to turn the steering sensitivity down, but other than that seems to be no issues there.The career mode seems like a climb like some of the older games, scratching and clawing for top20's and 15's initially with lower-tier rides. I really like that, brings back NASCAR Thunder 2003/D2D type of feeling. I wish career mode had more stats in it, but seems to be a step up with the addition of all the series from last year.Perhaps an upgrade for next year could be more of an emphasis of adding in grooves at different tracks, since early on at Auto Club, Atlanta, Charlotte seem like perennial bottom feeders.I know this isn't important to many people, but the soundtrack is actually pretty cool for this game. Been 2005 Chase for the Cup since I really loved a NASCAR soundtrack, and this game seems to have a good variety of some relatively unheard of songs that are quite good.I definitely have some hours ahead of me on this game, very surprised after hearing how poor Heat Evolution was."

While it still has its flaws, you won't wreck when you barely touch someone and you can drive a little on the apron without spinning out. Split screen is great for the kids and Eldora in the trucks is a blast. Love the rivalaries in career mode. NASCAR Heat 2 is getting NASCAR gaming back on track for us fans (or at least me!)"

,Recommended,670900,34911046,Posted: 12 September,all,M@tt,"The career mode is honestly my favorite part of this game and the main reason I picked it up. The hot seat races for truck in your first season is a fantastic way to show where you belong and it's fun trying to prove yourself to a potential team. I happened to get a top 5 in a hot seat and had some great offers at the end of the season which has lead to me being in a competitive truck (#8.) The AI feels overall pretty great and fun to race against, they'll do a few odd things (I got my top 5, because most of the trucks pitted for fuel 2 laps before the end of the race because they didn't pit at the end of the second stage.) I'm currently still in my first season (13% races / hard / all flags / hard) and I have a win and two top 5's after my hot seat of struggling to stay within the top 15 in slow trucks, but I can't explain how nice the progression from a 3/5 truck to a 5/5 truck feels."

This is a fun casual NASCAR game that great improved from NASCAR Heat Evolution. It includes the top 3 series Trucks, Xfinity, and Monster Energy. It has a much improved more in-depth career mode where you start in the truck series and work your way up. The graphics are nice the physics are good audio is decent could be better, but overall happy with the purchase. It's a good casual NASCAR game for those of us who don't want to play a hardcore sim like iRacing."

The controller config tool is complete garbage. Asks all the right questions but does not reconize my Thrustmaster TH8A shifter in game, Despite it setting up fine in the config tool and even asking if its a seperate usb like a standalone shifter it still doesnt work. Papyrus was able to do multi input support 14 years ago with NR2003 so whats the excuse here. Also the vsync doesnt work right and its description is a bit confusing. Instead of a simple yes or no it says vsync every bank or every bank and even with it one every bank which I would think would be on im getting 112 fps on high. Really dont feel like cooking my video card. Really hope that a patch comes out for some of these matters in the next 14 days or I will be requesting a refund. Totally not recommended."

The dont move or anything. It is an improvement over the previous game but come on. All these massive open world games with so much going on and we cant get a real looking crowd on a racing game that literally only has to render a track, infield, 30 other cars, and thats basically it. But i do understand, this is a smaller development company. And this is the launch day. But would really like to see a more immersive environment when racing. The cars dont even sound like a real nascar race car. Anyone who has ever been to a race will know that. Dont think thats too hard to get right. Would also like to see a ""radar"" like in previous nascar games. The spotters are good but a simple radar like in Nascar: The Game 2013 would be great. Granted its not as realistic but it could be made optional in settings. Love the overall theme and feel when navigating menus. Overall I am a huge nascar fan and have been waiting since basically 2013 to have another good nascar game. Looking forward to future updates to see where the developers take this. Biggest issue is engine sounds. Make them sound like a damn NASCAR. Thanks."

Bad textures, bad vegetation, unnatural coloring, anti-aliasing doesn't work.The steering wheel (TMX) calibration is just weird and gives no feedback that the settings work. The button prompts on the screen do not correspond to those on the wheel, so B and A on the wheel don't do anything. Just guess which keys on the keyboard you need to press and have fun.The force feedback is more like resistance, and doesn't work in the pits apparently, so it's free-wheelin' until you reach a certain speed. Once you reach the maximum lock, the steering wheel keeps turning and the force feedback fades, so it feels really bad.No proper graphics options, no FOV adjustment, no seat adjustment.The mouse doesn't work anywhere, menus, car setup, or elsewhere.The game has lots of content and extra liveries as DLC if you want to waste even more money.Junk."

,Recommended,670900,35482810,Posted: 4 October,all,tacosandcookies,"Heat 2 is a huge imrpovement over the last title, and the work the devs have put into the game really shows.First the cons:-Physics could use some work. The car seems to get loose too easily, but maybe that's because I'm used to more of the sims rather than using a controller and arcade like physics.-AI pit strategy could use some work.-AI could be a little more difficult to race against-Limited camera anglesPros:+ The latest update made cautions more sensitive, a feature many requested in the community, and it feels good.+ Career mode is excellent. It takes time to progress, and it feels well though out. However, earning money is totally useless and should either be removed, or should be put to use somehow.+ Plate racing has improved dramatically. Now I can qualify decently, and race in a pack around Daytona.+ Limited paintbooth allows for some car customization, which is great considering last year there was nothing.+Rivalries make racing harder, and teaches you not to be a turn 1 hero. The update also allowed rivalries to go away if you race clean, adding incentive to not drive like Kevin Lepage.Overall the experience is a lot better than last years title, and for any casual NASCAR or racing fan, the game is a buy. If you enjoy sim racing, you may find this less enjoyable in that aspect, but it is nice to have a solid arcade racing title to just have fun in every once in a while. I look forward to seeing what the devs can do with this title going forward."

You can add all the eye candy and racing series you want but once you go to race this game is totally sub par. I do understand it is a arcade game, but there is 0 feel of the car. I have A gaming pc with a g27 wheel and  there is no feel in the game. If they cant get the on track stuff right it does not matter if it has all 3 series. The graphics again leave alot to be desired, the sounds are painful to listen to. Maybe they should of spent less time putting music in the game and focused on the handling of the cars on track, cause that is why ppl race nascar 2k3 still to this day onlnie. I hope they can get patches out that help the game but honestly soon as a pc gamer fires up the game and see console comands on screen it shows its a cheap port from console, 50 bucks and they couldnt be bothered to fix presentation or car handling"
