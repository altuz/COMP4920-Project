I had a lot of fun while playing throught the game. It has a story filled with humor, the gameplay is full of action, especially during championships and i laughed my♥♥♥♥♥♥off during the cutscenes. The game is said to be partially translated into other languages and as a russian speaker and experienced gamer I found the gameplay to be very intuitive and easy to understand.Totally a must have for those who dont take jokes too seriously. 10/10!Looking forward collecting steam cards!"

It has a different feel than other management games. I like the pop ups where you can shoot stuff, it keeps gameplay interesting.Also, story is pretty damn funny and relevant to whats going on with NK right now lol."

,Recommended,671170,34335297,Posted: 18 August,all,Scruff,Really funny and entertaining sort of cartoon eSports team manager sim. In the vein of other management sims but with a funny storyline and devs constantly working and improving the game. Definitely worth the buy!

I cant pinpoint exactly what it is - but it's awesome. Funny, engaging, addicting, and the artwork is great.This game is the reason Kim called off the nuclear strike. He's too busy beating himself at this game."

If you have a spare few hours and feel like finishing a game then its worth the whole £6ish they are asking for.Wish I knew to 3 star everything before the end, but it does kind of let you do it after the ending (no spoilers!).If you like tycoon/management/comedy then its worth a go. 6/10."

So far so good! Now I'm just waiting to beat down Kim."
,Recommended,671170,34318676,Posted: 17 August,all,[DNR] Kinichie,"Quite a fun little management game. Though some serious tweaks to UI and Gameplay could be made to increase the fun of this game;>It is very difficult to know where your little people are, when you highlight them. When you click their portrait in the bottom left, you only get their stats and not what they are currently doing, at least it is not immediately clear what they are doing. Maybe a little arrow above that persons head, or a highlight of some sort. Whilst the colours of the shirts are somewhat unique, it gets pretty difficult when you got 8+ little people who have similar shirts (white with black sleeves, or white with brown sleeves) to know where they are. Especially since some of the most unique features about them are often blocked by an activity they are doing (hair covered by VR headsets, or shirts covered by back of chairs when streaming).>The Mini-Games are extremely easy. However sometimes my clicks don't register properly. Often the cursor changes when you are highlighting the correct area, yet you still get the ""MISS!"" message come up after clicking. This is mostly prominant in the Fighting Mini-Game where you have to hit the head. Whilst the Glove does get a white outline when you're mousing over the right part, upon click you still get ""MISS!"". The other Mini-Game I get this issue is the FPS, especially when the target is in a corner and covered by a blue target. Even still pressing the part of the Red Target you can see with the Green Crosshair cursor appearing sometimes comes up as a ""MISS!"".>The hardest part of this game I found was the grind after the 2nd Championship (If you count the Tutorial one as the first). As all the areas in Southern Europe and Asia require some pretty high stats. Almost every single one of these required some grinding, and even then I was only able to complete some of them after beating the championship that they are meant to represent first. Perhaps the events on the world that get unlocked could be a little more tailored for the skill range you are currently at, rather than you complete a Championship and then ignore the new place you unlock until you beat that Championship. Logically it should be that either completing a Championship should unlock the next tier of events for you to attempt (rather than they being two tiers above you, I found) or you get the next regions Championship, and once you complete it, that region unlocks. For instance, currently if you complete Africa, you unlock the events in South Europe and the Middle East along with that Championship. The events in New Delhi etc were pretty difficult to even get the 1 star on with my current team, and required me to complete the rest of the Africa ones first before even trying to attempt the next tier. And by the time I was ready to attempt that tier, I could go and complete the championship anyway since I had completed enough events to do it.>It is not immediately clear you can 'Evict' or 'Fire' your gamers by dropping them in the Trash in the bottom right. If I missed this in the tutorial, please feel free to ignore this point. I spent a large majority of the game with some sub-standard people who only did Scrims until I realised I could fire them.>Scrims appear far too often. It's a constant bombardment of them. It wouldn't be a pain if the latter game didn't require you to have to grind skills and manage Ego so much, but the consistant messages of ""CLAN XYZ WANTS TO SCRIM"" and the Fame penalty of declining or having to find some space in your build (FYI, there is little space towards the end of the game if you fill your rooms) and then find some people who you don't know what they are doing (See Point #1) is utterly frustrating. Eventually I lost 200 fame because I was just trying to raise my gamers points, which would have taken so much longer if I accepted every single one of these Scrims.Aside from that, it's actually quite a nice game to just sit back, enjoy the humour, recognise some YouTubers who have been put in (AntiSepticEye for instance) and listen to an Imperial rendition of ""Still Alive"" (or at least it sounds like ""Still Alive"") from Portal during the Championships. I bought for £6.49 or so, and it probably will last me another hour or two before I complete it. I don't feel there is going to be much replayability unless there is a New Game+ mode added or something similar. The jokes don't really change much per tournament, so the humour is a one-time only affair. Maybe a little variety on the humour would make people enjoy coming back to tournaments."
,Recommended,671170,34312478,Posted: 17 August,all,Troublehalf,"Enjoyable game for a few hours. You manage a team of gamers, playing mini-games and balancing skills and stats. Thrown in with some humour and satire and it's a fun little game. Sadly I cannot complete it as the final (I assume final) battle requires doing dozens of the mini-games in a time limit and sadly I do not possess the full health required to do this (hand shakes due to injuries and medication yadda yadda, I could do the other ones but this is much harder). So apart from that, it's a fun game and if you're good at controlling your mouse (unlike me!) then it's worth a few hours."

It's detailed retro art, mixed with sports manager gameplay, and modern satire -- and I like it.Between the humor, and 'bounce-around' gameplay style, this game keeps it in a good place...if you were born in the 80's or 90's, your going to have a good time."

You actually have to be a good gamer with awesome twitch gaming skillz to finish the game.  And lets just say the reason I'm playing a sports manager game isn't because I have awesome twitch gaming skills.  The worst part is, unless you win, you're stuck in the game just trying (and failing) over and over again.  I had to use the task manager to force quit the game.  If you're clumsy and slow like me, stay away from this one.  It hurts me right in the OCD that I played through the whole thing and couldn't finish."

Game starts off simple and becomes much more challenging the longer you play. I'm a big fan of these strategic/management/build-on type of games, so it gives me all the confirmation I need to call myself a brilliant multi-tasking goddess. There's plenty to keep track of as far as growing your team goes, and tons of great humor to keep you entertained along the way....And, well, considering all of the recent excitement within N.K., a comical relieving game like this one couldn't have come at a better time. Thanks for cheering us up, Fedora Collective (lol)!"

Fun, unique, and addicting are all words that come to mind when reviewing this game. GeM is worth buying and playing with the limited time we all have until nuclear war destroys us. From the ashes of a post-nuclear winter, GeM will rise and lead our future mutant-human desendents back to humanity. I rate this game 9/10 giant baby world leaders."

,Recommended,671170,34278887,Posted: 16 August,all,Hemmingjay,I've played the game for 45 minutes and it's pretty great. It's not super deep but it combines the best aspects of an idle RPG with a strategy/management game. It's a wonderful casual+ game. It won't frustrate you in the first hour(maybe later) but it will keep you addicted.Just one more match. Just train one more new recruit to max skill in FPS games. Just have to make it to the next major tournament and then I'll shut it off for the night.Yeah right!  Great fun if you like the above mentioned style games.Note: I forgot the wonderful humor and excellent stylized art. Retro/Lo-Fi game art has been done to death but these guys breathe fresh life into it. It works well.
