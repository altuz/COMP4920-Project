,Recommended,671620,34445529,Posted: 23 August,all,✦Mr.Pie✦,"This game is really fun and silly too. Its great that its not only about fighting but also other modes such as soccer which i really like. The animals and dinosaurs right now are cool and I like the idea of giving them gear. Turrets are great. One problem is i want to move the camera when im placing units down. Controlling a unit is a bit weird. I imagine that there are going to be more animals, dinosaurs and other stuff. Overall a really fun game to play right now.Okay so they just updated the game. Controlling a turret is now working better and they added a Tank now! That tank is really OP. I like how you can still give a tank gear. That's just weird but cool at the same time xD.But I want more animals and dinosaurs than other stuff. I don't really mind other stuff though :PNow we got snakes, sharks and megalodon.And the reward for getting all gold stars in the challenges is MegaMegalodon and he is SO BIG.I like them. I don't have much anything else to say :v"

,Recommended,671620,34455192,Posted: 24 August,all,libertytoast,"Spent the better part of an hour playing this with my wife last night, and we loved it! Took turns building or improving our armies, and whichever army of beasts won remained the same, while the other got improved. Will definitely break this out when we have friends over, as this could easily become a fun drinking game.The fact that it's early access shines through a bit in terms of polish. I wish we could copy and paste beasts, or highlight and apply batch changes. As is, if I put in 20 kangaroos and want to put lasers on each, I have to go through and add them one by one. Not sure if there's a way to remove tech without removing the beast and starting from scratch, and I don't think there's a way to move them around on the map once they're placed.The soccer mode is fun, especially when all of the beasts end up crashing into a wall in a giant, bloody pile-up. It'd be nice if each side could choose colors, instead of just black and white, as it's somewhat hard to tell which side is which at times."

This game is so basic but brilliant. I’ll cut to the chase.The objective of the game is to engage in a full-blown war using animals or dinosaurs. Select 5 T-Rex’s and give them some flame throwers and make them fight against 50 seagulls.The sandbox mode gives you the freedom to do whatever you want whilst the challenge mode puts you in different battles with a set budget and/or time, the latter is more strategic but just as fun.Surprisingly I didn’t come across many flaws apart from a few physics and loading issues though this is expected with any alpha/test release.10/10 for fun with the potential to grow even bigger,"

76561198088729424,Recommended,671620,34705471,Posted: 3 September,all,Skarekrow,"Because I'm delightfully pessi-mystical, let me kick things off with the NEGATIVE:It's still pretty barebones. There's meat, but I can still reach out and tickle it's tibia. Also, the physics need work. Sometimes it looks decent and realistic, other times Goat Simulator looks on with pity, quietly wondering if this game has some form of disorder....That's honestly it! Yeah! Those are really the only negatives to speak of so far! And while they seem like biggies, they're actually not, because you can see that this game is in it's early stages, only having been recently released, IN EARLY ACCESS mind you, and as of now, since it's release (not even two weeks ago), there have been TWO updates with promises of more to come. So to truly judge it for what it is now would be like judging a baby for giving you meaningful advice about your crappy 9-to-5 job by blowing a spit bubble and tipping over it's bowl of Spaghetti-O's. And to be fair, it's the same advice I'd give you under the same circumstances. You're not my problem to solve, Craig!!! *ahem* Sorry about that...Anyway, on to the POSITIVE! There are a decent number of animals, a good handful of settings, a few weapons and objects, fun challenges and even a little option to switch the team colors from black and white to red and blue. Little details like that sometimes offer that little extra nudge in the right direction. I like the soccer gametype, as well as the foresight to put in multiple sizes of soccer field too! I think most of the fun a friend and I have had was in setting up our soccer teams and watching the results! Now, just to throw it out there, don't go into this game thinking you're getting anything near 'Shadowrun: Hong Kong' levels of immersion. This game is a novelty, and one that I feel is worth the money I paid for it.Finally, here are some suggestions, should the folks at DOG HOGGLER decide to give this a read. Did you folks get lost on your way to a legit reviewer, why stop at mine? I can't even promise you that I'm not intoxicated right now! Well, if you wanna read the results of my madly slapping a keyboard I suppose I can't stop you... Anyway, let's start with the most predictable suggestion in the universe and get it out of the way:-More thingies!!! Animals, dinos, weapons, objects... y'know... THINGIES! There we go. That's done with, then.-More unlockables, possibly some achievements here and there. Now, maybe there are others, but I've found one unlockable (which I won't mention the name or how I got it, just in case that's considered a spoiler) and I'd personally like to see more of that. People love collecting stuff. They have a whole TV show about it, it's called 'Hoarders' where the people can't stop collecting everything of some particular theme they come across. There's a version for kids too called 'Pokemon'. Anyway, yeah, more unlockable things would be great... THINGIES!-More team colors and the ability to choose them individually rather than as a set would be good! A small detail, but one that would be appreciated nonetheless.-And if more colors become available, maybe more than two teams per fight? I dunno, just throwing mud at the wall at this point.-More arenas with environmental effects. A volcanic area with lava pits maybe, stuff like that.-The ability to adjust the damage on things like explosive barrels might be worth toying with too!-As mentioned before, the physics DO need some work. From wonky movements, creatures randomly exploding or getting caught on each other to weapons with less long-range accuracy than Mr Magoo with a pepperbox, there have been a few matches where I've seen the laws of physics make more sense in the Eye of Terror.-The gore needs work. Maybe more bone and organ than just random rounded red meat blobs, a bit more wound refinement, some blood spill... Wow, reading that back to myself, maybe I'M the one who needs improvement!So those are just a few suggestions from me. Anyway, keep on keeping on, DOG HOGGLER, you're looking good so far, keep up the good work, stay on top of those updates and keep doing what you enjoy and you'll definitely have a customer in me that gives you that second look when I see new titles from you! Have a wonderful day! ...THINGIES!"

It is missing vital game mechanics, such as the ability to swivel the camera when placing troops and an option to place troops facing in any direction other than straight forward.Beyond simple, inexcusable and inexistent game mechanics that simply need to be present in this type of game, it is poorly optimized. My system is by no means a killer, but it's plenty capable and runs the Total War games at high settings. Placing more than 40 or so troops in this game bogs things down to only a handful of frames per second, and putting out the amount of animals I truly wanted to see do battle made the game crash entirely.Pros:- Fun idea for fans of the genre- Decent animal and dinosaur selection- Concept of weapons/equipment is cool- Fairly wide selection of playable mapsCons:- Poorly optimized to the point of being unplayable- Lacking essential game mechanics, again rendering the game unplayable- Animations and physics are remarkably poorThis game is basically the hollow shell of what could have been a decent little time-waster. For now, it is absolutely not worth the money (or any money, really).If, like me, you're stoned and thought this looked entertaining enough for a test drive, it's not. Spend the $9 on snacks instead.

It really has lots of cool combinations, I love how you can put guns and other weapons on an animal or dino. This game could cost around $15-$20 and be worth it! If you like the game Totally Accurate Battle Simulator (TABS) Then I know you'd love this game! I surely reccomend it."

You can take control (you do not have command execpt attack and weapon attack and ofcourse ""normal"" walking)What is DOES have is challenges and an soccer mode wich both are fun.The Devs are active and update frequently, not everyday of so but about 6 to 10 days they add something. Wich in the long run would be a lot of animals and/or maps/challenges/other modesI paide on a sale 8,99€ and I am happy I did. The community is active and if you search look trough them everyday ust once there are quite some fun ideas in there.And if you want to wait when it is on full realese, you probably have to pay more, then it is now. So, you want an battle simulator you are not going to play a lot in a short time but just to♥♥♥♥♥♥around every couple of days and in the end having more and more hours into it. It is good.Also, the challenge. You get something for completing them all and when you get  gold star for them all. Want to know what?Not gonna tell :) would be a spoiler for the people who are going to buy it"

,Recommended,671620,34514697,Posted: 26 August,all,Filthy Frog,"This game is amazing, the fact that the animals flail into battle is the best part, watching animals battle to the death is somewhat satisfying when they explode. The only downside is you really can't make huge wars, only medium battles will work in this game. It would be cool to see more mechanical things, like robots or something like that, frogs would also be the best thing in existance for this game. Seeing seagulls carrying mini nukes in there little feet would be amazing too. More levels would be cool too, and seeing props to place would also be neato to see. Watching a swarm of penguins vaporise a elephant is the 2nd best thing in this game. More sandbox maps would be amazing, and also commands you can tell your beasts in battle, and maybe multiplayer would be very cool too, also a thing that allows you to resize your beasts in sandbox mode. Im looking forward to the furture of this game, keep up the good work."

76561198149896129,Recommended,671620,34534701,Posted: 27 August,all,Megumeme,"The game is very good except there isn't enough challenges considering how fast you can complete them all. I know this game is early access. There should be more challenges added, and the maps could possibly be a bit more like UEBS. The maps didn't feel unique at all. The only maps which felt different from the others were the soccer ones because they were a gamemode. All the other maps honestly felt just like reskins of eachother and I never saw anything cool happen in different ones. Also, quite a few of the units felt very unused. I could pass through the challenges using only a certain selection of units. The devs should go back to some of the original units and give them their own effects. Using the Finback made quite a lot of the levels much easier, same with Pteranodons. Infact, I rarely even used the regular animals in the challenges. Only when required and I had a tiny bit of money left which I couldn't afford anything else with. Using the Gear felt really nice and same with the Turrets.*Spoilers here*Also, having a King Penguin show up in one of the challenges is a fun little ""boss battle"". It's a bit more surprising to find out that you suddenly unlock it without expecting it when you complete all the challenges."

No.  Is a pack of wolves backed up by sauropod with a flamethrower?  Yes.Is this a gaming classic?  No.  Is it worth nine bucks?  Absolutely.  A reasonable multiplayer/social mode of some from would allow a lot of replay value, which is pretty limited now.  Could turn out to be really neat with some added match styles, but still amusing enough to justify itself as-is IMO."

You can simply screw in the sandbox mode to find out what happens in each scenario. You want an army of penguins to fight against a mecha Triceratops? You got it. It never gets old watching stuff explode into millions of bloody pieces.

I hope the developers continue to improve this, but already now looks nice. The ""models"" look quite good and the fights are of course fun, quite a lot of animals already including few dinos. 30 challenges now and then the sandbox mode. Music was a nice surprise, there are at least what I've heard, a few themes and they sound all nice, though can get repetitive but quality is not bad at all. Hopefully there will be more themes added later.  The short clips on store page what you can see, are pretty much the same what you can see in game atm. which is good of course to have an idea before you buy.For 10e, for a working early access game (which is not always so with other titles), I recommend. One update so far, a tank. Hopefully more later and/or even steam workshop..PS. I like the gore you can get even with only few fighters on screen and the football (or soccer...) is great fun so far at least (playing time perhaps 2 hours for me). More dinos more dinos please! :) Then this will be perfect heh.Cheers..."

Though still in an early stage with only one update (when i got it), there was still enough content to keep me playing. If you've tryed played Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator on a desktop laptop computer but it lags like hell, this game runs smoothly(unless you start doing 400vs400). If you have something (reasonable) you want in the game just put it in the new features discussion."
