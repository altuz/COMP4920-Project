,Not Recommended,671760,34022901,Posted: 4 August,all,Papercoolcat,"This game is... interesting...So, the voice acting is kind of bad, and just the way it controls is terrible. The ""Story"" really isn't anything more than random events where you can do 2 things, 1 of which you die and instantly be brought back to the options to choose the other one. It is like a bad interactive 360 view video. The animations are bad, and it just isn't enjoyable as of right now. And it is really loud, yet you can't turn it down. There are no setting options except game quality and dark or lighter. I may come back to this when it is out of early access, because as of right now it is hard to play."
,Recommended,671760,34511234,Posted: 26 August,all,ParchedEntree,"Far Space Review.Pros:Cons:Very Inexpensive.Extremely short.(30 minutes of gameplay)Impressive scenes.Lacks a dedicated plot.No replayability.LoreFar Space is an interactive movie with elements of a shooter. As the individual descends into the game, their objective is to repair the orbital station damaged by extraterrestrials. The individual will be forced to make decisions, which might determine not only their life but millions of others too.GameplayThe gameplay is very straightforward. While the individual is able to observe the scenery, it has very limited accessibility and absolutely prohibits anyone from moving freely. Multiple times throughout the game, hordes of never-ending enemies will pursue the player. Furthermore, the player is tasked with eliminating all the enemies that stand in their path until, eventually, they reach the next objective.AudioOverall, the game offers an interesting dialog, with suspenseful music. (Far Space doesn’t, however, offer you the option to adjust your volume levels accordingly — an option I certainly prefer).SummaryFar Space is an interesting title, providing approximately 30 minutes of gameplay, no replayability, and lacking a dedicated plot. While the gameplay is simplistic, I found the game to be a rather relaxing experience. Far Space is far from perfection, however, for the inexpensive price of 0.99$ I was certainly entertained.General: 5/10"

The other half of the game is an odd space dragon shooting sequence inbetween the first person levels which do the game a huge disservice and break the rhythm and immersion of the first person sequences with shoddy-looking enemies and extremely repetitive enemy patterns.For its meager asking price of 1.00$, you're paying for a mostly first-person Choose Your Own Adventure style, trial and error sequence which boils down to little more than triggering the next cutscene to progress the story along its overall linear path, by hovering your mouse cursor over one of several UI options until a meter fills. There is no player interactivity beyond pointing your mouse / view at HUD / UI options that pop up. For example, you may be presented with 3 options (i.e. Close the Hatch, Help Him, Pull Out) but if you select all but the one needed to progress past an alien barring a door or whatever, you'll just see a brief cutscene where your poorly voice-acted narrator lethargically says brilliant lines such as ""That's a big monster."" with all the enthusiasm of Microsoft Sam before being pinched to death by an alien, resulting in a game over and you having to reload and see the same sequences to select from the remaining options until you pick the one the game needs to progress the overall interactive cutscene.Sometimes the player is presented with only one option to choose from, such as Apologize (to another astronaut) which the game will then just wait forever until you obligatorily hover your mouse over that option until the meter fills to trigger the subsequent cutscene. Where other games have been lambasted for this kind of mandatory player triggering of a cutscene (i.e. ""Press X to pay respects"" on Advanced Warfare) its use and ""illusion of player interaction / choice"" is no different here. When only giving the player one option and the game won't progress until they comply with the action, the game is the equivalent of consenting to hit ""play"" on a DVD to just watch what happens next.There are strange, on-rails flight sequences inbetween levels as a space... dragon... thing fending off orange enemies which look quite nondescript and the gameplay again consists of just pointing/hovering your aim with your mouse over the same repeating pattern of enemies until they explode from your constantly-firing laser. Although the trailer may depict that there is some freedom in how you fly during these sections, they are on-rails with you always drifting ahead. You can rotate your view to line up the mouse cursor on enemies, but there is no interactivity beyond again pointing the mouse at stuff, you don't even have to click to fire. The enemies don't seem to have any variety to their attacks. such as bullets or missiles to dodge and instead just fly toward the player. This wouldn't be too bad if it were a brief experience, but then you're tasked to just hover your aim over the same pattern of enemies until they explode nearly 30 times over and over and over and OVER until you make it as far enough ahead as the game has mercifully determined for the sequence to end and get back to the better first person sequences. *EDIT: On Level 4 (of the 5) the automatically-firing, point your laser to defend from wave after wave after wave of generic orange enemy is now present in the first person sequences as well, and just as monotonous, leaning me more toward not recommending this game at all*The first person sections of the game can be immersive / enjoyable to experience if you don't mind the game basically being point your face to ""choose the right cutscene"" (much like a Choose Your Own Adventure) but the dragon sequences between the first person areas do very little to add to the game, are an eyesore and a bland chore to slog through, and the thought of going through any more of them is very off-putting."

I bit the bullet with Far Space though. Being stranded in wrecked space station orbiting earth, maneuvering in zero g, all with stunning visuals. These last two really sum up my experience. I really wanted this game to be great, but it falls short on anything some accounts. The plot is rather non-existent, and I never really felt compelled to uncover the backstory behind the catastrophe that struck the station, since all the information that is feed to the player is not engaging in any way, and so are the silent characters. I'm still willing to recommend you give it a try if you're interested in those VR gameplay mechanics. I don't own such a headset yet since they're still overpriced."

I will change my recommendation if I see development.The voice actings is pretty bad and the ""fighting"" scenes are repetitive and boring. Other than that if this game was fully fleshed out with more choices, story, better acting, much longer game play then I'd recommend buying it. ( I finished about 30 mins) etcWait to buy the game unless you want to support the devs. For 59 cents it's not horibble, it makes me think of it as a demo game to show off a vr headset. At least they are coming out with trading cards."

The the 1st one is used in all 5, 5 minute chapters,  the 2nd is used in the last 4 chapters.  It was so repetitive I had a hard time finishing it.P.S.  all of the things thatt you kill are the same thing (except the fellow astronauts you have to kill as part of the story [Which is linear.  It pretends to give you a choice of what you do, but all except 1 answer will kill you])."

A nice five levels for this early access and it's showing great potential; However, I really hope that you will not always have to fight before leaving levels as I did find this act somewhat tedious. I will add to this review as the game becomes more developed and I strongly suggest you invest in this early access version.  Please note that there are TWO VERSIONS - One is for VR and this version is obviously NOT VR.  Please also try to see past the negative comments for this game and see this game for what it may become and what it is now..(EARLY ACCESS)  This game has the potential to be somewhat vast in nature and exploration!  So for the pricely sum of .79p it is of my opinion well worth the risk and I assure you that you will NOT be disappointed!"
