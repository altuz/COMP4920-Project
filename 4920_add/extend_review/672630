76561198073124542,Recommended,672630,34821759,Posted: 8 September,all,Virtendo,"Academia is a nice game about running your own school. It's nothing too special though. I feel it could do so much more, like relationships between students, being able to address students and teachers personally, being able to adjust more exact stuff like curriculum, times, classes, etc. What I'm trying to say is it could use a LOT more micromanagement. The macromanagement is solid. Its nice to build a school and cater to your student's needs for a while. I feel like there isn't much more to do once you've built yourself a complete school, though. Nothing special happens on any given day (except the time 178 of my 194 students were sick) and any normal schoolday just basically runs itself. The game could use a lot more in-depth content and interaction, but the basics are solid. I don't recommend it at this time given the price tag, but its in early access and the devs ask you what parts you'd like to see implemented in the game next, so I'm sure it will get more content along the way. Then it'll be worth the investment."
,Not Recommended,672630,34926677,Posted: 13 September,all,Zetangi,"Great game with lots of potential, but unfortunately I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone at the moment. Too many bugs that need to be hammered out and I would like to see more features added, much like Prison Architecture. I would like to be able to set school schedules, issue quizzes and tests, train my teachers, set tutor hours, have afterschool, have specific clubs and not just a room that says club. Football club, basketball club, soccer club, etc... I want the clubs to compete against other clubs for local championships and nationwide championships, I want to have school rivalries, school dances. I want to be able to set the quality of lunches, set holidays, have my guidance councilors guide my bright eyed students to the right path. If we're going to have delinquents, I'd like to be able to punish them in anyway I want whether it be suspension, detention, expulsion, or even sending them to a center. SO much that can be added. Expand the staff list by adding security guards, hall monitors, guidance councilors, gym coach, club leaders, librarian, and principal. Have the students fall in love with their peers. Allow us to plan school dances, pep rallies, half days, set school goals(pressuring the teachers by having them focus on one subject for a week), and field trips, of course all of these will end up costing the school a lot. Oh and give me some natural disasters."
,Recommended,672630,34818899,Posted: 8 September,all,n3penthe,"Academia has all the ingredients to become an excellent tycoon game, but right now there's not much to do, so you should know that before you buy the game.The game itself was very stable and I didn't encounter many bugs. The UI was ok for an early access game.I built everything there is to built during my first hour including a working classroom for all the student tiers. After that it was just letting the money roll in. There wasn't any challenge.My only fear is that I hope the devs know how to make this game a lot more challenging and diverse. I think a lot of that has to do with personalities:  staff and students need things like traits and more diverse needs. Like a teacher with a drinking habit would miss classes or be late from school often. But maybe he's still an awesome person and the kids love him and when you fire him you anger the kids etc.Bad  behaviour and bullying are pretty common problems that could and should be implemented. Kids today sure love their mobile devices, so maybe including policies that ban all those would make the kids more angrier but eventually lead to more concentration on the classes. You get the idea, there's a lot of possibilites to make the gameplay more diverse and challenging.I will give this a recommended for know because of the huge potential the game has."
76561198056085546,Recommended,672630,34912191,Posted: 12 September,all,King Helmkraft,"In the first couple hours I've played so far, Academia still feels very much like a blank canvas. The basics are all there, but not much else. I was done building all the rooms and achieving the grants in all of two hours.I can tell though that the game has so much potential. Right now, I'd say it's about 98% incomplete of what it could be. There's a chance we could have an excellent spin-off of a Prison Architect like game if the developers listen to the community and continue adding quality updates at a good pace.If you have the patience and want to play the game as it develops, I'd say buy it. However, if you don't want to buy an ""incomplete"" game right now, wait a couple years (or so) and hopefully, you'll have a very immersive game to get into after that time.Will recommend solely because I can see the early elements of what could be an amazing game by the time it's all finished."

It's something I'd hoped would be attempted at some point.A few pointers:*This is an Early Access Game, so of course there are bugs and a lack of features. Ignore the idiots who are berating it for those reasons.*Yes, it looks like Prison Architect. That would be because one of the PA artists has released it.This isn't a bad thing, however.

I made a huge school, finished all the grants, made all the rooms available how I wanted, and ran it in the positive on my first attempt.Obviously this is their first release, so cut them some slack for that, but this has definite potential and I'm excited to see where the devs take it."
76561197992108067,Recommended,672630,34914257,Posted: 12 September,all,Persimmons,"This game has a lot of potential, but as is, it's definitely in the very early stages of early access.  Since a lot of people have mentioned Prison Architect, I will agree it has a very similar vibe but is very, very simplified even from fairly early stages of Prison Architect's Alpha phases.  I don't think the game is so complex that a tutorial is in any way neccessary right now.  If you're familiar with other sim games, you'll figure out how to get started and going fairly easy, and like Prison Architect Alpha it has a to-do list as the basis of some guidance.  The only thing that was less than intuitive with the GUI was how to set boys and girls bathrooms.  If you go to edit zone for the most part the only option is to remove the zone rather than actually make any changes to it, but it also gives you the option to change the bathroom gender and grade level for classes.  Other than that, the game is pretty simple and intuitive for those familiar with the genre.That said, I'm only recommending it if you're interested in supporting the developers.  If you're hoping for a game as enjoyable as mid to late stages of Prison Architect alpha testing, you're going to want to wait a while.  Currently, there is absolutely no problems to manage in the game.  You start with ample funds to have students in small class sizes with the best teachers no problems.  There is no conflict that arises aside from frequently sick students due to a dirty school, but I'm not 100% sure why that's happening aside from my janitors being slackers, and there are no consequences for it.Long term, things that would likely improve the game are adding objectives/failure clauses such as ways to measure the student body as a whole's learning (though that might be a result of trauma from the American Education system, aha), more effort in attracting parents to transfer students to your school through meeting academic or musical/athletic goals with your students such as competitions you send specific students to and making more money possible only after reaching certain objectives.  The introduction of delinquents is a start on making the game more whole, but there's a long way to go to add depth.Also, A+ for using the Prison Architect artist.  His/Her art is so cute <3"
76561197990573379,Recommended,672630,34851686,Posted: 9 September,all,LifetSavert911,"Intro:So far so good! I absolutely love this game! If it keeps going well, this will be one of my top favorite of all time games. I subscribed to the subreddit, email, twitter and the youtube channel so I don’t miss a single thing. If you liked or loved Prison Architect, you will feel the same way or stronger about Academia. It takes on a very similar gameplay and artwork to that game. I messaged the Dev on Twitter and sure enough, the artist from PA is on this game and he is working in a small group to make Academia. This is his own project and he is passionate about it. I expect great things from this game and I bought 2 copies right when I could on launch day.Summary so far:You start out with a blank slate in an open canvas as you prepare to make your school. You have 3 zones already that you can of course change. You have deliveries, garbage, and an area for your workers. At this point, there are no scenarios or tutorials implemented yet but that should change over time. To get a sort of tutorial now, you can just take on a grant, finish the grant, then move to the next. In this way, you will get the idea and progress. I haven’t played until end game or anything yet but I can see how it will progress based on what I’ve done so far. The gameplay is similar enough to PA to know what to do intuitively but it is a different game still. You can hire at this point: janitors; teachers; workers; cooks and nurses. This game is based on a high school so there is freshman through senior classroom zones to make. There is even the ability to have a bathroom for men or women. This game looks, feels, and sounds great. It’s a very positive experience so far. I would definitely recommend this game to add to your collection.Pros:•	Great art•	Great music•	Great UI experience•	Intuitive menus for building and management tasks•	Sandbox mode for just playing around or experimenting•	Great communication with players and perspective players•	A team that can be trusted in early access to deliver and not abandon the project•	Tasks don’t take too long to get done by workers•	Being able to vote on the next game project for the devsCons:•	Some editing tasks can be tedious such as having to bulldoze grass if you lay down grass and want to change it to something else like concrete tiles•	Not enough tile and wall pieces yet•	Lack of campaign so far•	Lack of proper tutorial so far•	Slow loading to start the gameVerdict:I won’t give a game that released practically a second ago a numerical value or something of the like. I can say that the issues with the game so far will most likely be fixed over time. I don’t see my cons as permanent problems. I simply added them because they are there. If I were to recommend the game or not, I would always recommend it. This is a great start to what will become a great game. I say go for it!Still not sure:I can blame you if you don’t know if you should get it or not. I recommend checking out the dev logs and gameplay videos on Youtube. I would also check out the site. That should help you decide for sure. Some games in early access are simply not worth getting yet until they fix and add more content. I think this is one game worth getting and enjoying the journey over time."
,Recommended,672630,34821927,Posted: 8 September,all,Aaron Tuckwell,"So the usual caveat of “It’s an Early Access Game” applies here. You take that on board when you buy the game so early. You can definitely tell that it has roots from Prison Architect as it has that same charm, look and feel about it – just without the gritty nature. It’s fairly easy to pick up and play without instruction, even if it does seem a little daunting at first: But if you’ve played the likes of Prison Architect, Sim Airport, Another Brick In the Mall etc then you will be fine with this. I’ve clocked up an hour on the game and enjoyed that hour – There’s not much to do in the game at the moment, other than a few classes, cafeteria and support functions; which you’ll master all of that in no time at all - so an hour is pretty much all you need **RIGHT NOW** but that’s OK. It all runs as you expect it, was stable enough and never once did I think “Oh God, I’d rather play something else” before I felt like I was done.Right now, it’s not an addictive game like Prison Architect, Another Brick or Sim Airport is.. but that’s purely due to the size of the game right now and not because of the quality of what has been released so far. If this game ends up being anything like these other games are, then you’re on to an epic early backer."

This is obviously still a game that needs a lot of work, but to me it looks like the foundations are there for something special. If this reaches its potential, I can see it taking up a lot of my spare time."

It is only in Alpha and it is a good game, but their can be a lot to improve and more stuff to add. I think they should add sports team, I just think it would be a cool aspect to have your school have sports teams. There are also some bugs in the game. Like even if I have concrete tiles on the floor coming into the school and even though the students don't go through grass or mud it is still dirty. This game could be very good and they should also had relationships with the students and bullies."
,Recommended,672630,35354472,Posted: 30 September,all,KawaSeadrake,"This is an odd one.  I recommend this game to support it, but it's honestly not worth playing.  Not yet.The foundation of a fun game really is there.  As are most of the basic rooms and functions.  But it's also about as early access as you can get.You set up a school.  Classrooms, bathrooms, lunchroom, faculty, free time and that's basically it.So long as your students are healthy and happy, they go from year to year with a minimum of fuss.  Sure there's a few strange bugs and the AI gets questionable, but it's never really enough to get in your way.There's no fights, no drama, no dropouts, no sports, no prestige, no head-start, no parents, no politics, no cheating, no strikes, etc. etc. etc.  Play it for 2 hours and you've seen everything.So why the thumbs up?  Because let's be honest, there's A LOT of potential here, and I want to see this become as good as (or even better than) Prison Architect, whose artist is also working on this.  If you want to support it, pay the 20 bucks.  If you want to actually play it and have fun, wait a year or two."

76561198082464617,Recommended,672630,35249691,Posted: 27 September,all,Vanguard,It's very good in the current state and I believe the game shows potential.It's still very early to say too much about the game but here goes:1. The game is a good idea. Ever since Prison Architect I've always wanted a game like this one based in creating and maintaining a school.2. The execution is good. When creating the school you really feel like you're making an impact. Having a toilet two rooms away from a classroom could be the difference between a complete failure of a school or an amazing one.3. Gameplay is decent. I still feel like it has lots to work on but in the current state it is already worth the price.TL;DR: Buy this game if you enjoy making your own school.

Played prison architect for quite awhile, and found out that the same artist that made that game, did this as well. I was very pleased.  Upon turning it on, it felt like prison architect, just rather then building a prison for adults, instead you are building what kids deem as prison. So the same concept still applies.I built up my first school pretty easily without any issues. Only issues i had were that my kids were all getting sick, but that was my fault for not having many janitors in the building in order to accomidate a school of 100+ students.In this being an early access, the only bug i encountered was a crash during building. However i can not soley blame the developers as it may have just been a standard crash that you can random encounter during playing any game.Overall, i recommend this to anyone that likes builders and manager style games, especially fans of prison architect!"

Mechanics wise again there are very similar features to PA including the basics of logistical supply (food, cooks, meals, etc.).Definitely early on in development so don't currently expect features such as a tutorial and very in depth mechanics. Yep, there's a few bugs but I'm sure they will get ironed out after all it is Early Access - keep sending the developers feedback!!I'm looking forward to watching this game develop over the next few months."

,Not Recommended,672630,34907716,Posted: 12 September,all,Aaron552™,"Firstly, let me say that I loved Prison Architect. I just saw Academia today and bought it for 20% off and gave it a try. Loved how I could make my own school emblem with a motto. However, upon starting the game I quit there. There wasn't a tutorial on how to do anything. Granted, there was a To-Do List, but not a How To Do the To-Do List List.Currently I do not have the time to re-learn everything I did from Prison Architect on my own. If there were a tutorial then maybe. It'd refresh my memory faster. Thus, I must not recommend the game just yet. This is, of course, my own opinion but I'm going to keep this. :)Conclusion?I don't recommend this currently as there isn't any basic tutorial or How-To. I added Academia to my Followed list and will keep an eye on the updates. Hopefully things will quickly change and be added. Loved Prison Architect. I tried getting back into it but without doing the tutorial again it was just too complicated to remember.Until then, I do not recommend. I will change my review as things are changed, added or removed."

I can see that this game could develop into something very interesting. However, I have not played the game for an hour yet,  & I already feel that I have ran out of new things to discover/ do. I have requested a refund, but will most probably purchase again, when the developers have added more depth/ content to it"

,Not Recommended,672630,35225523,Posted: 26 September,all,Creeper1841,i would not recommend this game.- Rip off of Prison Architect.- Tons of bugs/glitches.- NOT WORTH 20 EURO!- Builders are very slow and they go on like pause for like a second when they done finishing building.don't buy this rip off.

If you like games such as Prison Architect, Sim Airport and others game like them you would want to buy this game as it is just as a addictive as all of them. I won't lie this game has some bugs but it is in early access so what can you expect. I would give this game a solid 9/10 rating. I will also say this game can become very difficult but thats what makes it fun."

Games not up to par just yet where cooks won't cook, delivered food isn't taken to the fridges, and workers getting stuck in the delivered items and a few other things here and there.  On the other hand, there is a lot of potential just give it some time."
