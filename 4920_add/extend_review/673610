That being said this is nothing like prison architect, or SimAirport, for a number of very good reasons.Pro's*********UI : The UI is excellent, a great level of logical analysis has been applied to this title and it shows.**Graphics : OK this is 2D but it is very tidy and neat and highly polished, you can look at your creation and say ""Nice!"".**Controls : Again well thought out and has enhanced previous norms making this a huge improvement over competitors.**Realism : This is not a sim it is more Simcade but a very authentic and realistic interpretation of it.Attention to Detail : Not just graphically (ver good) but content, options, settings, controls... just brilliant.**Fun Factor : This is awesome great fun to play!**Price : Very reasonable with the price increasing over time as features are added (this is EA).Cons*********Possibly the amount of longevity is limited, once you have built Airport and got it running what is there to do??**To be fair it will take you a few hours to get anywhere near that and of course this is EA with much more to come (runway, second floor....who knows what else!).**Really there are not any...it is EA and there are some typos, naming conflicts and minor bugs but for an EA it is extremely accomplished.Must buy don't delay grab it now is my advice!https://youtu.be/SSgJa16GO10"

There are very obvious places where this game will grow to expand upon it's current concepts.  With its alpha release, AirportCEO has been immediately updated multiple times to address multiple expected alpha bugs, most of which can be resolved with a save/load.  The game does lack expansive replayability as an airport franchise can't be explanded outside of one save.  My #1 improvement would be to add an overarching 'grant' system that gave players long term goals to help shape and reward airport development in addition to the tutorial system.  Beyond that, being able to 'sell' your airport and start a new one with greater funds would foster rewarding replayability.Pros:-In depth look at airport management-stable alpha (contradictory, I know)-rich in aviation detail-a strong foundation on which to build-active devsCons:-alpha bugs-early end game/minimal replayability-steep learning curve lacking adequate tutorials/guides"

Active in Discord and their own forums as well.Now in terms of the gameplay, the learning curve is there.

76561198007761167,Not Recommended,673610,35434025,Posted: 2 October,all,geozero,"First, I get that this is Early Access Alpha.  What is there now shows nice graphics compared to that other ""airport"" game.It seems to me that there is no easy way to start ANY airport. In other words, unlike other sim games where you can start with something small and grow, I don't see that's the case here.  Certainly this game has a lot of similarities with Prison Tycoon and even Another Brick In The Wall.  But what this game lacks is no clear way to build up.  You have to build EVERYTHING at the same time... like RIGHT NOW.You have to lay the runway, the taxiways, the stands, the roads, and then the other type of roads - the service roads, but not before you separate them with that guard rail security shack thing, and you need a tower which doesn't appear to do anything, and then don't forget to add the bus stop and car dropoffs, and hire people, and the executive staff which unlocks contracts which you need to build the fuel, because without fuel nothing you built previously is going to make any difference, and of course the terminal with endless other check ins, info, you get it the picture.This all devolves into building everything at once, hiring everyone, checking all contracts, etc.  In other words there is no natural progression of the game as a tycoon game, once it's all unlocked because IT IS ALL NEEDED there is no tycoon game left.  You're left with a sandbox.Sure you get to schedule airlines, and stuff, but for the most part by the time you have a working airport, the simulation is DONE!IMO, the game would have been vastly better to allow a working airport sooner with less cumbersome need for every aspect.  It could start as a small airstrip that allows private planes into a small terminal with minimal or no need for baggage handling, a smaller and simpler fueling system, and just less stress of running baggage from checkin to the baggage bay and then back to a carousel (which you have to build yourself out of more conveyor belts).There is no ""growing"" experience in the game.  You don't get to discover things along the way.  Everything is sort of thrown at you in a sandbox fashion and you have to build and unlock everything right away just to get to the ""airport"" part of the sim.If the DEVS had spent time understanding how to ""build"" the anticipation of a true tycoon sim game this would be an awesome game, but it seems that everything is required or you have nothing... it's all or nothing sandbox.  It's boring after a couple of hours. And that brings my last point...A successful sim game is one that engages the player not just for a short time but for a long time with small rewards along the way, with finding what works and what doesn't, customizing things (floors and seat colors are about the only thing you can customize).  A good sim game allows the player's fun and anticipation to grow as the game grows.  AIRPORT CEO does none of that IMO.Lastly, I understand there is still work being done on the game and it is not fninshed.  I cannot imagine what else they could add to the game to keep my interest in playing it.  What additional items can be added to cusomize the airport or to grow it or make it vastly different.  I think most airports will end up looking pretty generic as there are limited items and ways to add pieces that make it work.Due to it's very limited replayability - at this time based on what is available - and the fact that you have no growing curve in the true tycoon sim game style and have to build everything, I DO NOT recommend the game at this time.  Without a fully vetted sim ""growth"" the game is completed early on and just becomes repetitive.  I wish that the DEVs address what is planned in terms of making the game replayable such as:  procedurally generated terrain and starting points, ability to grow airports differently (without requiring all items at the beginning), some way to connect airports to other player created airports, more parts lilke glass walls, different types of restaurants or eating areas, etc."
,Recommended,673610,35330010,Posted: 30 September,all,Gibbs-19,"It's a good game already with the possibility of getting great in the future. In this phase the game already includes a great variety of things. The game really has some depth in it. Even in Alpha phase its really time consuming (in the good way). First you build your terminal building and connect check in desks, boarding desks and place security. You can place shops and food corners (not prefab but really placing counters etc.). Then you continue with laying out the roadwork (normal roads and service roads) and continue with placing the aircraft stands. Next thing is placing runways,taxiways and manually placing aircraft paths over your places taxiways.Employees have to be hired via the special menu and you can sign contracts for builders, fuel delivery and aviation partners. You can choose the members of your board and unlock the buying of vehicles (fuel truck, service truck, etc.). So like I said, a really in depth game. Also with a good user interfaceBugs where to be expected, but the devs are doing a great job solving them. For an alpha game there aren't that many bugs in it.  Game updates are pushed out regularly. It's a prime example of devs listening to the community."
,Recommended,673610,35279196,Posted: 28 September,all,WhiskeySim,"Review: Airport CEO for the PC.*Early Access Review*This is somewhat cool. In fact, it's so cool that if you put this game in the kitchen people would start opening it up looking for a can of Coke or something. Why is this game the digital equivalent of an iceberg, you ask? Well, it's deep, it's smart and it's downright sexy, that's why.You already know what to expect from Airport CEO I mean after all, it is an Airport simulation title. With the early access release there's some new stuff, some irratiting bugs have been ironed out, and now running your own little airport has never been better.Airport CEO tries to seperate itself from the pack with interesting and complex features. One of the great things about Airport CEO is that you get to make real choices along your way through the complex simulation. It really affects the game in a subtle, mature and nuanced way, like whether or not you end the game by going bankrupt and living with your parents and your angry pregnant wife.Employees, Facilities & Buildings oh my! Airport CEO is beautifully complex. I mean airports are complex mega-structures anyway! It say's it right here on the back of the box! You have the control, currently in Early Access you have access to many of the normal facilities you would see at an airport; Control Towers, Aprons, Taxiways, Catering and fuel and much more. The employee system is also great. Sometimes you get tired of the old, his name is greg and he does things. Airport CEO goes into this a little more in-depth. From Airport Staff to Janitors, Ramp Works to mechanics. Employees interact with passengers, it's your duty to make sure you have skilled people managing and have stress resistance.Performance is great and I haven't hit any points where I have hit a slow down in the simulation speed. I honestly can't wait to see what else Apoapsis Studios can do with Airport CEO. It is really turning out to be a fantastic little tycoon and management game.Overall Score: 8 / 10Review by WhiskeySim - Professional breaker of things"

Seats need one tile in front of them so people can get up. if you have 2 rows of chairs facing eachother, HAVE 2 TILES BETWEEN THEM. Passengerswillget stuck.2. When incorperating depot tanks for JetA1 fuel, do so IN THE NIGHT. if you do it during the day, and you have some commercial airplanes, at least one will bug out and be frozen there. Make sure to also turn on the JetA1 refueling service in the operations panel on too during the night.3. Report bugs! If ya see one, take a couple of screenshots, click ""Report A Game Bug!""

Happy days, and thank you devs :)I have to say, this is one of my favourite genres of game to play.  I picked up Sim Airport a while back that scratched this itch- but something about this game makes me think ""it's the one"".I haven't had much time to work my way through the in's and out's, but I'm learning.  Hopefully you decide to pick this one up.  If you do, just bear in mind that there is a fairly decent learning curve!  There are already fairly detailed tutorials that help.From hat I've played, I know that the level of detail is spot on and that the framework is here for something really special.  I'd imagine it will take a while to iron out all of the bugs, open up to modding and deliver some more features- but this is what early access is all about.Looking forward to this journey!"

Right now it actually has a decent amount of content for this style game and most of the mechanics already in place and functioning, this alone sets it apart from most early access releases. It does however suffer from bugs like almost all do.The game has depth and so far runs smoothly. It is pretty much airport sim getting the prison architect treatment so you know what to expect. I like the graphics, there a bit better done then prison architect and rimworld imo.This said, after playing a few times and building a couple of airports, I am going to hold out and wait for some more patches before I get stuck in, I think it would be frustrating to build a huge complex airport currently and you would probably make it due ot bugs or strange ai behaviour.This will be a good game of that I am sure."

Then I only stopped as it was 3am and my eye lids were closing.It is truly what I was hoping for. Here's why,+ Real airport feel, weather, delays, flight board with status.+ Good scaling between vehicles, people, planes.+ Two levels of squares, finer for person sized objects, and larger for apron and road planning.+ Good level of content considering it is early early release.+ Tutorials even though it is early release.+ Not many bugs considering how early release.+ Customisable colours of objects, allowing colourful or grey airports, up to you.+ Enough systems and easy to place objects, but gives you plenty of freedom to design how you want.+ People in the airport already have needs, such as tiredness, toilet, hunger.+ Customisable road vehicles, not just air side!+ Great price.The negatives. Honestly, none at this stage, as long as you realise it is a Beta early access, so will have bugs, and is limited in content.Worth buying yet. If you get it on first week sale and happy with early access sure.If you want a full game, ready to challenge you, maybe wait until release, or closer to.

But instead of prisons, it's airports.I have never played Sim Airport but when it came out i watched everyone on Youtube play it and it was pretty good i guess but this is so much better. Its very complex which makes it have a steap learning curve - I found that the discord community was very helpful in helping me with my issues so that was good :DIt is actually very realistic in terms of how quickly people get through security and right down to the queue sizes.I do love the UI, Its modern and is rather easy to get used to after a while.The graphics arn't bad, they are similar to Prison Architects.It is buggy at the time of reviewing this but the devs are taking feedback and have already but forward several updates to improve the game. Of course its still in early access so bugs are to be expected.It is also rather limiting on what you can build, but still more than Sim Airport, i would imagine this is because its in early access and they are going to add more - who knows what? - multiple floors etc?Overall, Im sure its going to be worth while. The devs seem very active and im sure they will add more to it. I sure think £11.99 is a reasonable price as most games along the lines of this are more."

This game has much more detail and flexibility while constructing and managing the airport. Contract system is awesome. However ther is a long way for developers for debugging.Here are the development need to be done;*Conveyor system should be improved. It falls short like SimAirport. Please consider Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 Rail building system which was developed many years before 3d strategy games were released but it has a perfect 3d construction mentality.*Bugs are everywhere. This is an early access game I know. But developers should test the game again and again. For instance, luggage charts stuck and become a part of concrete after I bulldoze the baggage hub. Also security checkpoint did not worked for a long time and I figured out that 4 security were needed to operate it after a long time.

,Recommended,673610,35273459,Posted: 28 September,all,Dr. Strangelove,"I've been a great fan of airports since I was little and I will never forget my first airport tycoon game - the venerable Airport Inc. It was amazing for my younger self, with so many plane types, so many different contracts that included airlines, shops, fuel, turnover etc. etc. I loved negotiating, avoiding incidents, and so many different spots for your airport to be based in.This game is much better. I've been following it for a long, long time, and it really amazed me. It's only Early Access now, but it offers you a lot more freedom than Airport Inc., has much better, really gorgeous graphics, involves the process of hiring your employees including construction workers, offers a lot more possibilities when it comes to directing flights and planning your stands (you can decide which ones will operate GA planes and which commercial ones), and it is more fun to plan your airport here. Sure, one might say that it doesn't have that many furniture types yet, and your terminals might seem a bit empty, but it is still EA, new stuff will come soon. They seem like a very decent studio that delivers what it promised, judging by the quality so far, and I'm convinced that this will be improved over time and will become truly amazing. It's great right now, and can only get better. There are not even that many bugs right now, which is pretty uncommon for EA titles.What works1. The architect part. It's really fun to design your airport, although things like baggage claims should be available from the start. Those are one of the most basic things an airport needs.2. Hiring employees. This really makes you feel like a CEO, especially hiring your directors who are essential.3. Flight planner. A great feature that makes you really feel like a person in charge of an airport.4.  Graphics. Simply gorgeous. Especially the menus. This looks better than RimWorld and Prison Architect in my opinion.5. Intuitive GUI - it is easy to find everything, connect deks to your stands and set up queues.6. It's quite bug-free for an EA titles. So far, mainly some issues with not being able to click something, works well after restarting the game. No big deal, nothing game-breaking.7. In-game manuals are really helpful and contain a lot of information in a way that never seems overwhelming.What doesn't work1. I guess I would like to see a historical mode like the one present in Airport Inc where you started in 1970 and experienced all the changes throughout the years from turboprops to modern airliners. But overall, it's just a nitpick.SummaryIt's really cheap for what it offers and I truly believe that this studio seems serious and this won't become another abandonware, as sadly is the case with a lot of EA titles.

There are a few bugs but the game is playable and most bugs can be sorted out by reloading the save. I love the art to the game and the gameplay is driving and interesting. The game lags occasionally when there is a lot going on but pausing or keeping the time at regular speed usually solves this problem. I like the options of design. I hope to see more variety including windows, shops, decor, and other options for flooring and seating.

You do need to keep track and manage a lot of things. Flight planning and trying to prevent delay is fun. Also expanding the airport is sometimes a challange and feels great when you have a bunch of flights landing and taking off.There are however quite many bugs but, that is to be expected from alpha. Would love see more options added, bigger runway, heavier aircraft, delays due to weather and overcorwding of Airport. I think there is lack penalty in the game since you do not get penalised ofr delays and lack of cleanliness.. Also, the game becomes choppy if your Airport expands and becomes big. There are issues with taxiways too if you have multiple Runways. Learning curve is steep but not long.Its fun game to play but fun dies when you expand your Airport and things start breaking up."

I am impressed with the speed in which the developers are churning out patches and updates to fix bugs in this early access game.Were this initial bugs that stifled playability? Yes, the most frustrating was a traffic bug that kept materials, contractors etc. from getting to the job site, effectively ending the current project after a lot of time was put into laying out my first few airports. However, after one of the first few updates, this issue was resolved.There was also a steep learning curve, with limited tutorial / manuals. However, I may be different than the casual gamer, but with this kind of game, I actually enjoyed experimenting around, and trying and fixing things to get my airport running smoothly.I am excited about the direction this game is going, and about what is up next as new features are incorporated."

Since it doesn't have Steam achievements, you have no goal to reach (for example; depart 100 planes, build a 2nd terminal, destroy 200 contraband items, etc). Bought the game at $14.39 during the launch week sale, I personally think $15.99 is a steep price for the non-replayability aspect.I did how ever spent hours playing this game, so the fun and joy of building your own Airport is there unlike some Airport simulator games. It is a very in-depth (complex) Airport simulator game, ranging from managing the flight planner to repairing the runways.Building an Airport is pretty basic right now. You can't do any curved/angled taxiways or roads. It's very limited and filled with minor bugs.----Edit:1) I used sandbox mode to push the game to see how far you need to go in order for the games FPS to reach 10 FPS. You will need a large Airport or a lot of passengers in your terminal for it to lag. At the moment, your best bet is to create a medium/small Airport (if you don't have an above average PC)."

If you are expecting a polished product, then don't buy it right now, but put it on your wish list. Assuming they keep up the good work, I bet this game will be really great 6 months or a year from now. I am sure they have a long list of improvements and they seem to be hard at work making things better.Here is an example of why I will give this game some time before I play again. They haven't implemented one way roads. Watching 40 foot buses and trucks making u-turns on a narrow two lane street is imersion breaking and can cause really stupid traffic problems. While it is not likely a big programming priority, imo this is very fundimental game mechanic. There are quite a few other things that need improvement. Issues with worker AI and baggage are almost game breaking and very frustrating. There is very little obvious feedback as to why something isn't working. Baggage conveyors can switch directions when you build an adjacent conveyor and if you don't notice, the whole system won't work. My ramp workers wouldn't go to the baggage bay. Can't get to Job. Why? After a half hour of building sidewalks, I finally figured out they wouldn't go through the security zone to get back out to a non-secure zone. Huh? Ok, whatever. If you are having problems, restarting a save can help and there is a F10 debug screen to help flush out issues.Even though I have been mostly negative, I happily give this game a thumbs up. The game looks good. You can tell they are putting in the extra effort and caring that could lead to a really good experience, if they get it right. That extra effort comes with the cost of a lot more work for them. If you want some frustating, figuring out fun, or you want to support the developer then defiantely buy it. I did and I don't regret it at all."

,Recommended,673610,35341053,Posted: 30 September,all,baumi,"Advance warning: This is not a finished game yet, so don't expect it to be balanced, bug free, or feature complete.For Early Access, though, this is not bad (and IMHO much better than the other airport simulation currently in Early Access.) Still, I list the pros and cons I can think of, so that everyone can decide for themselves.Pros:It's been a mostly bug-free experience for me. Things that are implemented generally seem to work as intended.Developers are very responsive and act transparently.Processes are modeled in great detail – if they can keep this up with new features, it'll become a complex sim.Cons:Interface is far too cluttered and un-intuitive right now. Devs have acknowledged this.Not all game mechanics are fun. E.g., the whole spam mechanic just doesn't add anything to the game.Incomplete documentation. Sometimes hard to figure out what requirements you ned to have in order to allow functionality.Lack of depth. It won't take you long to unlock everything. As mentioned above, the promise of depth is there, but right now it's just a promise.Performance hungry. There hasn't been much optimization yet, I assume.Some graphics look a bit amateurish.Like I said, for me this is perfectly okay for an Alpha version. Especially because the devs seem to have been good at catching game breaking bugs before release. The main question is whether they'll be able to come up with a game design that is both fun and challenging enough to keep the player engaged in the long run. It's too early to tell, yet, but based on the current state of the game I'm willing to take that gamble.If you like seeing Early Access software grow and improve, go ahead and come in, if you rather want to have a polished game experience right from the start, you might want to wait a bit to see it mature."

Great to sink and few hours in to and I'm very much excited for the content that is to come."
,Recommended,673610,35314627,Posted: 29 September,all,GuardingGuards,"Airport CEO is a complex game. Its systems, even at this early juncture, are deep and sincere in their attempt to model real world airport operations and management. Like Prison Architect, its quirky graphical style belies a serious simulation of its subject matter.While the depth and accuracy are great, they also make this arguably more of a niche game than Prison Architect. Airports are not prisons, and the air travel industry is a lot more obtuse than locking people up for murder. An example of this is how you construct your airport: you don't just hire a bunch of workers directly. You have to sign a contract with a construction firm and actually call them to summon a number of contractors to your airport. Want shops and restaurants in your airport? You'll need to build them in the terminal and then sign a lease with a franchise to operate each one. And don't even get me started on the baggage system (easily the most complex system of them all). But when it does all work, it's really a sight to behold.For all the superficial similarity to Prison Architect and its ilk, this game right now, a day into Early Access, looks and plays like Prison Architect did after a year or two. And if it's that good now, imagine how good it'll be a year from now. The developers are committed and highly responsive. There have been multiple patches in the last 24 hours alone based on community feedback and bug reports. And to top it all off, it's less than $15. This is a no-brainer for anyone who falls into this niche (you will know it if you do), and for those who aren't sure, you probably should buy it anyway.

The learning curve is steep, and the tutorials aren't exactly helpful. A lot of the learning process will have to happen through trial and error.And yes, it's early access, so there are plenty of bugs. Sometimes you'll need to save and reload your game because traffic has clogged up somewhere (all sorts of traffic, whether it's foot traffic, buses and delivery trucks, fuel trucks and luggage carts, or planes stuck on the taxiways). But bugs are to be expected, and I expect they will get cleared out in later patches.And even with the wonderful complexity already in this game, it is also obvious that the developers are aiming to implement a lot more further down the line.This is one of those games that will be a lot of fun to pay attention to over time, as development conitnues."

It was only released on Thursday and I’ve spent most of my weekend playing it. It is fantastic and will only get better and more complicated. The devs are amazing and have released at least 10 patches since it was released.If you like sim/management games and airports: BUY THIS GAME. When you aren’t playing it you will be thinking about it and designing airports and improving the one you are building and working out how to get more flights.I leave you with just one piece of advice: hire lots of ramp agents. Otherwise the aircraft will not have baggage unloaded or loaded and will not be inspected which leads to delays and if you have a full flight plan it has a knock on effect which makes for unhappy passengers and airlines. Just like a real airport I guess.So I’m summary, amazing game and it will continue to develop and be amazing and hire lots of ramp agents.UPDATE: I have read some of the negative reviews for this game, and yes the game has bugs and it is complex and takes a while to figue out how to make the airport streamlined and cost effective. But this is part of the fun, I do not want the game to spoon feed me but to have simple controls that allows me to construct an airport easily but makes me figure out the best way to do that. This is where the replayability comes in - you will not make the best airport on the first try, you need to build a fe to make the best one you can and even then you will keep tweaking it as you are never satisifed.The negative reviews say the game lacks replayability and does not have many features, but it is in early access and was released all of 6 days ago.

Also there are only 2 of them and I am sure that they are literally spending all their free time to make this game amazing which is probably too much! More features will come."

I personally dont like the soft edges in that game versus the gritty building in this one.  I havent played SimAirport as much, because I feel this game is just much deeper and enjoyable game with more potential.  There are major lags when you get your airport above 500 passangers in it at a time.  The game has much to improve on, but is still playable by just not doing high speed at larger sizes.  This game has a much higher learning curve and you will need to read the discussions/guides on baggage and taxiways after your first attempt.  But if you like games that require some thought in the tycoon genre, this one is shaping up well."

Unsurprisingly, there's a metric crap-ton of bugs at the moment (I believe the game was released 11 hours ago as I write this) - but that's to be expected when you unleash your game to the unsuspecting public.Main drawbacks (all related to Early Access Alpha):- Tutorial/Manuals require a lot of reading and can be confusing, but you can pick up most of the basics within three hours- No click-and-drag for building things- A lot of small quirks related to unit pathing and secure areas that weren't spelled out in the tutorial and need to be learnedI expect great things for this game, especially once they get a week or two to iron out all of the weird stuff people are seeing. I expect even more if the devs actually get time to write out a tutorial - but the online community is pretty good about figuring things out, too."

The fact that it was in pre-alpha for 2 years really shows the dedication this two man dev team has towards perfecting their product. Hell, they even postponed the release date to fix numerous bugs, despite the fact that most of us would forgive that since it isnt a finished product. I love it when developers love their games, because thats when you get something special, just ask Shigeru Miyamoto about his design philosophy (he was the creator of Donkey Kong, Mario, The Legend of Zelda, etc.). I cant wait to see what the future holds for this game and Apoapsis Studios (awesome name btw).If youre trying to decide between this and SimAirport (as I was at one point), I reccommend ACEO. Its cheaper, the devs are really involved with the community, and it feels more like a simulation than a cartoony tycoon game.If you like management, engineering, and aviation, this game is for you."

Yes, there were bugs and there still are, and I haven't been able to complete an airport due to them, but it is the first day of pre-alpha early access, and if the bugs weren't there, and the performance was optimised more (performance is very bad at the moment) it would have no flaws.I'm looking forward to the full release, when this game will  have truly lived up to its potential, but for now, even with the small problems, it is still heaps of fun and I sincerely reccommend it, but wait off a few days so all the major bugs are fixed and you'll hav a great experience."
,Recommended,673610,35306081,Posted: 29 September,all,Aaron Tuckwell,"Right then. Let’s be clear from the start, based on a good 8 hours in the first 2 days of release:The tutorials in this game suck and really need some workThe complexity of being able to make a running airport is massiveThe lack of tutorials and the complexity create a learning curve that almost makes the game unplayableThe game is still riddled with bugs – some game breakingIt’s frustrating that the game doesn’t tell you what’s wrong when your airport isn’t functioningIt’s quite “admin-y” – everything requires contracts, endless menu pressesThe graphic style is simplisticIt’s quite hard and daunting to find your way around the game if you don’t know how airports work. It’s not your “pick up and just play” game like Sim Airport is.And that’s exactly it… if you want the opposite to this list, then go play Sim Airport, but if you want an extremely well thought out, deeper-than-perhaps-even-the-game-knows simulation game that has so much potential to be amazing.Now, this sounds like a negative review. But actually, this game has something captivating about it. I got drawn into play and in spite of some extreme frustrations, it’s generally a great play. What makes this a positive review for me is the dev team. They’re all over the forums, releasing fixes etc. Iron out some of the above issues and this game is going to be up there with the best tycoon games. And hey, it’s Early Access.. it’s not MEANT to be perfect yet."

,Recommended,673610,35434003,Posted: 2 October,all,Mr. Wonderful,"This game at it's current state (0.21.10) is playable, but, as expected from early access, has some bugs. However, the two man team of developers, who to my knowledge have never released a game before, have been very active. On release weekend, they were pushing bug fixes for the game multiple times a day. I believe they have built an excelent platform for an indepth, realistic sim game, for future.The game so far features some of the basic features that one would expect in an airport sim. For example, you can buld your passenger terminal complete with check-in desks, security stations, toilets, baggage carosels, boarding desks, shops and restraunts, just to name a few core features.You can then place down your taxiways, your runway, an ATC tower, and few plane stands, and you have completed the basics of your airport. In addition, you can go further, and add fueling services to your airport, as well as a baggage system, that can become very complex if you want it to be.You sign some contracts with a contracting company to build the airport, a fuel supplier, some shops, and a few airlines, and the airport is fully functional.This game's competition, Sim Airport, in my opinion, not as good as this game, as it feels a bit lacking in game features. My opinion, is that anyone looking to buy a game in this genre, doesn't have to look any further, as this game is also cheaper than Sim Airport.There are still a few problems with this game, I have to admit. There are some optimization issues as the moment, but you have to remember that this game came out four days ago when I was writing this review. Currently, there seems to be an issue with how the game deals with rendering the airport terminal. This means that when you have the terminal on your screen, even if it's empty, the game will lag. This doesn't seem to be too bad on smaller airports, but once you get to building airports with multiple (about 6 for me) large gates, the game begins to have some FPS problems. These problems will get ironed out eventually, im sure, but for now it is an issue that is causing me some problems.I know that the devs have a lot of plans for this game, and that they intend to bring this game out of early access sometime in the future. I really look forward to seeing what this game has to offer, and would definately reccomend purchacing this game.TD;LR:-Good, playable, game right now, with more features to come.-Has a few bugs, along with some optimizaition problems, but will get better in the future.-Better than Sim Airport.I'll try to keep this as updated as possible as updates come out."

I'm a stickler for detail when it comes to simulation, but even I have my limits and you really have to build the airport from the ground up in the minutist of detail. For me, this is where the fun starts turning into monotony. Firstly, I had no idea of scale. You have to build a terminal to begin with and I had no idea how big to make it other than pure guesswork. Later on during construction I discovered that I hadn't made the terminal anywhere near big enough when I initially thought I'd made it huge. I think this is where the game would benefit from some pre planned blueprints that can selected, small, medium or large, or maybe even the ability to hire a designer to suggest airport layouts etc., as I don't want to spend too much time on these things. I understand some people do, but I think it should be optional. My only other complaint is that my system spec meets the recommended requirements yet the framerate is slightly lagging straight away, and I can only imagine it will lag even more as I expand the airport. Hopefully this is an issue that will be fixed as the game is developed. But aside from the complaints, it does look like it's going to be a good simulation when I eventually get a flight schedule going, but looks like that could be a while yet. For the price, I would recommend it, especially if you're into micro management."

System building and interaction being the primary.  This is intricate, at the beginning, as the systems are not explained well enough in the tutorials.  The UI doesn't help you much either - it is not intuitive to me.BUT .. when you finally (4th attempt) get the luggage systems working.  When you finally, destroy the gun-toting bags that the peeps try to smuggle on the planes.  When you optimise the landing of 4 seperate airline companies across 5 gates using  a single baggage hall feeding 5 different baggage claim areas.  When the taxiways don't get clogged up (again) with the aircraft following simple rules that I, as the architect didn't understand.  When you done all that, my son, you can call yourself a Airport ARCHITECT.This game is Airport Architect - every single bit and piece you need/want to build you do it yourself - by hand.   I don't think it is Airport CEO so much.  Perhaps it's the lack of strategic decisions that a CEO would make that is the problem for me?  I don't see any CEO deciding where a rubbish bin should go in the entrance hall (2 squares or 3 squares away from the door)!.  No, I only know one CEO, in my real life - my boss, and he would not be doing this, but he would be asking me, as his senior architect, to draw up the building plans and ensure they follow standards and rules.  Building regs, Aviation rules, that sort of thing.  The CEO I know would likely be in some strip club while I was drawing those plans up for him, not standing over my shoulder clicking the mouse to position some sidewalk.Perhap the depth of CEO'ing will come later in patches/releases?  I confess I haven't seen the roadmap at all.  But, if they fix the crankiness - which they will in this early access release feedback - people are not slow in coming forward when they hit problems and the devs are responding quickly too it seems with bug-fixes.  Perhaps it was that bug-fix they did yesterday that finally allowed my airport baggage system to work exactly as I had planned it?   I like to think I overcame the difficulties the devs have added to this game, with their poor instructions and lack-lustre UI, with my smarts though.Yeah, Airport Architect, is scratching that itch quite nicely.  Hope it keeps developing in a positive way.Mods!!  I want to see mods.  Now, where's that roadmap?  :)"

,Not Recommended,673610,35269541,Posted: 28 September,all,groovybluedog,"This game has one of the worst tutorial systems out there. Doesn't really guide you, or give you recommendations, nor is it interactive. It's a text/image based set of instructions which can be unclear, confusing, and you're forced to follow it step by step to unlock the next section with no way of seeing ahead. Also no recommendations, like when it tells you about putting foundation down, it doesn't give you a good size to start with... so you either build it too small or too big! Tutorial system needs a lot of work; this game is difficult to play even for a tycoon expert! A WiKi or YouTube guide would have been a better idea. I have faith with the updates that this game will become better, and I'll change my review when it does, but for now I can't recommand buying. This is an Early Access title that was only opened due to pressure as they were late, not because the game is complete. Wait it out."

This game actually gives you FAKE EMAIL SPAM.Yes you heard that right.The game has a built in fake ""email"" system for storing old game messages. The idea is sort of clever but... In that email folder you will actually get random spam emails that do nothing.its literally spam. I am not kidding. There is an upgrade to get anti-spam so that spammers no longer email you, but you have to work toward it. Why would any game developer put this in any game?? First time i've ever seen anything like this. Seriously what were they thinking?Why this is in the game? I HAVE NO IDEA! Its nothing but additional frustration and completely pointless. For this reason alone I can not recommend this game to somebody. its totally bizarre.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review:Hopefully this game continues to get way more smoothed out.Its pretty rough at the moment.Yeah everything seems to work decently fine but what a confusing headache this game is. Do not underestimate it. The game basically drops a jigsaw puzzle n your lap and its up to you to piece it all together. There are some tutorials and hints but nothing adequate enough for a game this complicated.You have to hire people to unlock certain things and then you need certain things to get other certain things and etc. but the game tells you none of this.It does remind me a lot of Prison Architect. But more complicated with a lot more potential and depth.Its not really how overly complicated Airport CEO is, its just that the learning curve is so steep you will do nothing for your first few hours except struggle immensely. and probably because you laid out your first airport terribly you'll have to start a new game. Because the game give you absolutely no direction on where you should put things. Which is the worse part.Half the time you don't know if your doing something wrong or if the game is glitching out on you. could be either one. Thats how buggy and complicated this game is LOLThis game frustrates everyone who plays it. Don't believe me? Go watch any Let's Play on this game and listen to the frustration in their voice.This game is probably fun, I just haven't been able to learn enough to actually be able to enjoy it yet. This game is meant to be played in a very specific way... the developers way. but they don't give you much guidance or when you should do things.Not to mention in the first few hours I ran into some pretty bad bugs. Workers getting stuck in door ways. vehicles getting stuck outside the map. I had a traffic jam near my fuel depot that would NOT work itself out despite doing everything possible.Little things like this that just frustrate all the fun I tried to have out of this game. Now hopefully thats where Early Access comes into play. As long as they continue to smooth things out and improve performance I think this has a real chance of being great. Right now sad to say, its a glitchy, super steep learning curve, frustrating, management simulator that I have yet to been able to fully enjoy.Honestly I would probably refund it if I hadn't already went way past the two hour mark just trying to figure this dang game out.My recommendation:wait awhile for this game to be polished. In the meantime play Rimworld or Prison architect"

The developers postponed the realase date several times due to bug fixing. That may have been necessary but there are many obvious bugs left in the game that make it difficult to love. Don't get me wrong, it really has potential. But I do follow the development process for over a year now and I am dissapointed about the remaining bugs:- The Learning Platform which provides toturials is nice but a bit broken. Sometimes the tutorials don't show, you need to tab out and open it through the button in the panel to see it again. Also the tutorials don't quiet teach you enough. There's so much text and the pictures in the tutorials don't explain them selves. I've had a hard time getting through them. Some game mechanics aren't even covered here (e.g. to hire an procurement manager you need to make this position available through the staff menu. But it's not explained, I figured it out randomly.). The tutorials need much more work and less text.- There are also many typos, missing text or right out sentences that don't make any sense.- Placing Bus Stops or Car Drop Offs is a pain because those arrows pointing the way in/out aren't discribed anywhere in the tutorial. What do they mean? How are they supposed to be placed? The road construction is also very mysterious. In order to make a road you need 2x2 squares. How'd you know that? Try it, the tutorial doesn't explain it. (And that's why I created a deadlock for construction busses because I placed a loading side on a 1x1 road and the bus could come in but couldn't find it's way out).- The first screen you see when loading a new game up is a cluster f*ck. There's way too much information on one screen. Also I'd wish you could change the keybindings because the key ""E"" is mostly used to interact with objects, but here it's used to rotate the map (which caused me to rotate the map more often than I wanted it to).There's much more that I could say about the things I don't like but I'll stop here. The game has potential and I really do hope the devs are going to put much more work into it. I for once have to say that I am dissapointed about the current state of the game because of all those little bugs. I've followed the dev process for a long time and postponing the game to kill bugs and than there a still those little, easy to see, bugs left annoys me."

It's up to the devs to determine if they want a game to have 22,000 positive reviews (Prison Architect) and simplify their game or have a couple hundred and keep it overly complex.Right now, I can't recommend this game. It's micromanaging hell. All games have a learning curve, this one is a wall. It establishes that in the beginning when you literally have 40 menu buttons on the gui, and a notification button to tell you that you have an email to tell you that a tutorial is avaliable so you must find that tutorial screen - it's a maze. And it's not inviting at all.I was expecting a mix between the old Airport Tycoon games and Prison Architect, where you manage things that are actually fun to manage.

The delays were earmarked with ""bug fixing"", and I fully admit that I said at the time that I wished they hadn't delayed it, but put it out with bugs in early access.I'd like to take the opportunity to revoke that statement. I have been proven wrong. At the time, I was under the impression that the bugs that were being referred to were reasonably minor: after all, after 2 years in development, we were all excited for something new, different to SimAirport, say.In its current form, I find this game to be completely unplayable. The baggage system is completely broken beyond belief - I have baggage going round on invisible carousels forever because their passengers have already left. Pathfinding is a mess - planes crash into each other, people walk in the middle of roads, construction workers refuse to enter certain areas of the airport. Sprites turn incorrectly, or not at all. Planes sit on the runway, unable to find a gate, despite three being available. People stand outside security exits, unable to move. Virtually no tutorial, especially if you start the game in sandbox mode. The list goes on, and on, and on.Now, if this game is playable for you, great! All the best with it, I hope you find it great fun. I'm fairly sure I speak for many people in this community, however, who feel extremely let down by this release. I held off on buying SimAirport to wait for this release, but I think I'm going to take the plunge now, because this simply hasn't worked out.In a few months to a year, this could be a great game.

,Not Recommended,673610,35475560,Posted: 4 October,all,Lerc,"The level of micromanaging absolutely killed this for me. To say there is a learning curve is an understatement. It's more like a wall, and a bloody tall one at that. If it werent for the guide I was reading: I would not have achieved ANYTHING!You have to do, literally, everything you could possible imagine and more.When you start the game your first job is to fill 6 very different positions with members of staff just to unlock all the menu's you require to proceed, which is a laborious task in itself.Want to build something? First you have to put down the blue prints, simple, right? Oh no, next you have to hire a construction firm through the contracts menu. Then you need to deploy a number of workers (from another menu) that you require for the job. Each worker costs money so you don't want to use too many and then when they're done with the job you need to remember to dismiss them otherwise they 'll be a contstant drain. This is probably the simplest task you could do...Every action envols a number of clicks to navigate through a series of menus and tabs which became teadious, very quickly.If, like me, you think this will be like Prison Architect: you're wrong. It's beyond convoluted."
,Not Recommended,673610,35308074,Posted: 29 September,all,Immigrant,"A lot of potential, but it doesn't deliver right now. Too many things are frustrating. Very little useful feedback and tutorials seem to skip over the basics. The UI is terrible, things aren't where you would expect to find them, and the process to find all the things you must click to make things work makes this a frustrating experience.I don't doubt they will work on it, and it will be good, but it will now sit in my library for 6 months while I wait for the whole experience to work itself out, and after I've let the other many playtesters get frustrated trying to connect this gate to this stand and to connect this taxiway to that gate and so an and so forth.Personally, I say don't waste your money right now. Wait. It will come good, but it isn't there now. If I hadn't tried to frustratingly work it out for the last 5 hours I'd be requesting a refund."

There is no help for hiring and maintaining employees. And problem icons keep popping up with no explaination of why.Do not by this game if you want to play more than 20 minutes.

You shouldn't have short term contracts for flights it should just be continuous. If this part doesn't change this game will be unplayable.

,Not Recommended,673610,35308679,Posted: 29 September,all,Hyperion,"Well... So far, not so good.There has been a big hype about Airport CEO and I think that the release has not met my expectations. I am not going to say this is a bad game. Concept is good, game design and art is very nice and has lots of potential. But man, too many annoying bugs. I mean very simple bugs here and there. Let me give few examples: Ramp agents not attending planes they can not find paths, luggage of the arriving passengers stuck on the baggage way. Things like that. Not game breaking bugs but annoying litte things that come together and make the game unplayable. I think these simple bugs could have been easily ironed out beforehand.The game manual is also a weakness of the game. I had been stuck on many occasions on what to do to keep things working and find the solution by trial and error. A proper tutorial could be helpful.And do not expect a very optimized performance from this game. My mid-end rig which performs satisfactorily in manygames suffers fps drops frequently. I think the game is not optimized well, yet.And the good things: The Dev is very active and already pushed some updates in less than 24 hours to clean out some bugs. A very nice community is growing and many things are to be implemented in game. It has the potential to be the best airport management game.Give it a little time, follow the uptades. If the Dev sorts the game out, then go for it.And then I will happily update my review, as well."

But the program should be more intuitive and make it easier for the player to run the game.Issues with road check point - constant flashing wrenches.Issues with baggage - took hours and online blogs to figure out.Issues with scheduling flights - commercial flights enabled at stand - still couldn't schedule.Your game requires the user to meet and enable certain paramaters to function. Make those intuitive to the user not a user problem.

But there is one bug so annoying i stopped playing right after i discovered it. Passengers. (And Workmen) walks right trough walls. Worst part is the Passenger who comes out of the plane, and just walks a straight line trough walls. The whole idea building a Airport kinda dissapears when people just walk in a straight line trough everything.Besides that, there are many small issues where clicking somehow doesnt work and other minor details like that.But i must say i enjoyed making the Airport, and seeing the passengers show up and the planes! BUT! The wall glitch have to get fixed. It just have to! I can't give it thumps up before that's fixed!"
,Not Recommended,673610,35274528,Posted: 28 September,all,Bock,"This game has a TON of potential, and as a forewarning/acknowledgement: it is in Alpha.That being said...It is an in depth game and there is fun to be had in exploring all the different posibilites, BUT it can also be very intimidating. There is currently no form of tutorial outside of a few blurry images and text walls. On top of that, it's kind of scary doing too much because in just 4 hours of playing, I have had numerous game breaking bugs. True, the devs are pretty transparent and quick to release a patch, but it's just disappointing that this is even an issue after all the delays this game had just to get into Alpha.I will most likely change this review once this game is where I expect it to be. I understand it is in alpha, but even alpha games (especially ones that were delayed multiple times) need to have standards. Despite all the mechanics and possiblities in ACEO, it still falls just short due to game-breaking bugs and lack of direction/tutorials."

I eventually figured out you had to go to the manuals so went thereStill super confusing and long for a game like this. The problem with this is most people are assuming it will be like prison architect. But its not. They tried to do a simulator approach with extremely indepth menus and indepth systems within the game. Which suprised me. In a good way. And this game was looking good. Just not what I was expecting. Which for some people would put them off. This is not a sandbox game such as prision architect and you cannot play for 10 hours and complete it. It takes a long time to do anything. So be warned and get ready to expect a very hard. And indepth simulator.I played for a while and then went to save and thats where the reason for this negetive review come from....I could not save the game :\And the fact this game takes 2 hours to even start opperating the airport. A save feature that works would be good :)The save menus are all in. But it did not allow me to actually save the game.I would wait for a few months for them to iron out the game breaking bugs.

They will make sure your discussion thread is locked and censored.  Only positive feedback is encouraged.And as for the discussion board - wow, lot's of hive mind mentality going on there and people refusing to recognize the issues.The standard answer they give for everything that is broken?  It's an alpha, what do you expect?Take your money elsewhere and steer clear of this Airport Construction Utility - we can't even call this a game, because there is no campaign, no scenarios, and nothing that resembles gameplay.Longer review:The graphics are extremely well done.  The animations are great.Currently, the game lacks, well, the sense of being a game.  There is no direction since the tutorials are extremely poor.  And yes, I know some are going to counter with ""go watch a Youtube video"", but here's the thing.  Why should someone have to do homework to play a game?  Why should the expectation be for a person who purchases a game to then spend time going through forums and watching Youtube videos in order to understand the mechanics and game concepts?Go to the Discussions portion for this game, and you will currently see (after only one day of release) page after page after page of players who are at a complete loss of what to do.  Non-functional tutorial is the root of this problem.It is extremely slow paced, and with so many functions going on, it is easy to quickly get overwhelmed, and again, the lack of a functional tutorial (and no, I don't believe the in-game email/manual system works well at all) prohibits development and understanding.I tracked this game for months...the community pushed for a release...we should have waited.

Plus the delayed the game for bug testing???? what do you call this!!

Of course the game is very buggy (its early access), however I am yet to find a bug which isnt fixed with a simple restart of the save. Even though it has just come out the game is rich in content, and it seems like there is still a lot to come. And as another plus the devs are extremely active, releases multiple patches a day.Obviously many people will be comparing this to Sim Airport, and I would actually say they are quite different. SimAiport is very casual and laid back, and simple, which will suit some but not others. Airport CEO has a lot more of the managing and realism aspect, with the plays 'tablet' containing hiring and managing individual staff, the board, procurements, operations, contracts, construction operations, economy, wages, shifts, weather, flight timetables etc. This game is a lot more hands on, whilst Sim Airport is more laid-back-and-watch-the-pretty-planes-move. Personally I love the hands on aspect of Airport CEO, and would recommend it massively to anyone who enjoys that sort of thing.Of course the game is incomplete and buggy, but £10 is a damn good price for this early access and remember you will be buying in to what looks to be a very promising future game."

76561198109727734,Recommended,673610,35427954,Posted: 2 October,all,kris140301,"Brilliant game!!It gives a very detailed insight into what it is like to set up and manage your very own airport. Without sounding peculiar... it is a game I look forward too very much when I get home from school to the point I have a build up homework.The game has a quality 2D feel about it and though it does have its minor technical difficulties, as would be expected in Alpha development stage, they do not make this game unplayable.I find that the game lacks depth in that once you've built an airport that is it. It is then self sufficient and you end up moving onto your next airport without then looking back.Overall the game is a great game and a must get. You might not even enjoy it in its current state but it has tonnes of potential and will only get better from this strong foundation."

,Recommended,673610,35433821,Posted: 2 October,all,R05340728,"This is an Early Access title to watch (or buy) especially if you like building\management type games, or if you liked Airline Tycoon but always wanted to run the airport vs the airlines.  Being Early Access, of course its under active development, but it already shows a lot of promise.  They are still adding features, but Ive already put in over 40 hours, and its been great fun so far.  Yes, there is a bit of a learning curve, and the devs are working on that even in Alpha state, but once you know how everything works its a non-issue.After the initial release day patches the game runs well, all existing implemented functions work, and they are now working on performance improvements and patching any outstanding show-stopper bugs.  The developers seem pretty receptive and post weekly dev updates, and seem to patch reproduceable bugs pretty quickly, especially considering the size of the team.  Its definitely a promising title, and if you are on the fence, I feel like its worth purchasing."

There's a lot to do just to get a basic single small airport running, but I can definitely see that the dev has a space to add a lot more: night ops, de-icing, food service, larger runways, large stands, maintenance, hangers, etc. If they really follow through this will be one of the greats."

,Recommended,673610,35458380,Posted: 3 October,all,Bulltank,"Really enjoying this game so far. I cant wait for more features to come out along with optimization. Game gets really laggy as soon as you go big.Still missing some critical features, like assigning certain security check points to certain stands. Right now, they are all assigned to one. Also, would like to be able to have raised and lowered baggage belts that can overlap each other. Right now they cant, and it makes it really difficult to plan baggage bays for large airports.Overall though, this is an incredibly amazing game for such an early stage. I can't wait for more patches. Highly recommend it even at this stage, just don't expect to be able to build such a massive airport."
76561198022338786,Recommended,673610,35475461,Posted: 4 October,all,Biggles.12,"Short Story:This game has a lot of depth and provides a good challenge. If you are looking for something mindless, this isn't for you.Early Access:Obviously, this game is in early access right now. This means that bugs and issues arise that have the potential to limit a persons ability to play the game. Keep in mind that if you do buy this in early access, you are accepting this possibility. In comparison to other early access releases on Steam, I would say that ACEO has had one of the best early access releases I have ever seen. The developers worked hard throughout the release weekend to eliminate critical bugs and bring the game to a state where it can actually be enjoyed in early access. With that being said, sometimes seemingly small issues create big problems so remember to be patient.Gameplay:ACEO does a great job at giving us an airport management sim that has depth and a high level of detail. Even in the early stages of the game, it is apparent that the developers desire a game that encompasses every aspect of managing an airport. I would say it feels similar to Prison Architect. I read in a devlog that the tutorial is lacking for new players and I can definitely see that, however the game can still be learned without external influence. The thing I found hardest to learn would be how to schedule flights after accepting a contract, so do yourself a favor and open the flight planner in the bottom right after you read this."

I really like the logistics and management aspect of it. However, so far I couldn't see a real ""punishment"" for ignoring security aspects as you would get in PA. So I hope the developers will add more challenging aspects that work against you.Other than that: many details; I love the realistic atmosphere.It's early access, so don't expect a polished game! It has some bugs, but nothing game breaking (at least so far).Cheers"

,Recommended,673610,35505055,Posted: 5 October,all,BinaryEX4,"This is a very promising game with a lot of potential, however it has performance issues. FPS drops to 6-7 on a moderately sized airport. Made with the Unity engine optimization potential is very low, with limited tweaks that can be done.  I hope for improvement in this area but don't hold my breath.  If you dream of building a huge airport with 10's and 10's of planes coming and going constantly, sadly..... i do not think this game is up to that, rather engine not game i mean.Game play  is good, however.............. its TOO easy to make money, and once you have unlocked everything and have a profitable airport the playability drops off as its not longer a challenge, so you are only left with the option of tweaking your airport here and there making it more efficient perhaps, but if your airport is already making millions, whats the point.However, great game, not really a long game though."

,Recommended,673610,35490467,Posted: 5 October,all,embecmom,"nice little game .. for EA its got good level of detail so far.. as a flightsim and citiesskylines freak this is right up my street.. it is easy to get into (just needs a little bit of patience and read the manuals which they provide in game) ..been some comments that its just sandbox and no feeling of growth and expanding for a tycoon style game (i.e you need to do everything at once)...I agree to a point on this ... initially you do need to build 90% of the required airport to have a functioning game... you can build a small provincial one but ultimately you still need security checks/check in desk/runway/taxiway/fuel etc.. but there is not really a feeling of accomplishment via growth that you have gone from small GA or commercial props to large jets because you can just build it from the start if thats what you wish...So my impression is that its a sandbox airport creator and management sim not a tycoon game ... atm ...from the off I like 90% of it..as its EA it obviously requires some improvements and additions (such as expanding on the items placeable in the airport (tables /chairs all that sort of stuff) and from laying my first taxiways it needs work on proper holding areas for the planes as they seem to get mixed up between whose landing, whose holding and whose taxing....graphics wise its not really my thing as I prefer more realistic graphics but its not heavy on any hardware and not unpleasant..overall good game but not quite sure that its a tycoon game (which it may not be trying to be). . once you have built your airport  got it ticking over there is not particularly much left after that... soooo longevity may be an issue."

Very transparent with a solid game plan and realstic understanding of their skills and current progress.That being said the game is currently in a fairly decent place as is. Being early access it is not fleshed out completely but there are placeholders already in place for future additons which shows foresight.I found it to be rather enjoyable so far.My only complaint would be a steep learing curve due to multiple UI elements nested within each other.
