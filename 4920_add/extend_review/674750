,Recommended,674750,34508492,Posted: 26 August,all,Motoroach,"6/10Devs put in minimal extra work, but there is new content nonetheless. Fun and cheap game, price is only $2 more than original, so it's easy to sparePros:-New Enemies-One new character-Improved Graphics-75% off for YAZD owners-To be released Workshop integrationCons:-Gameplay is exactly the same-Items are exactly the same-Same exact mapSo far, the reviews saying it's ""improved gameplay"" aren't sure what they're talking about, but neither do the people who say it's the same game.Previous owners of the non-HD version get the game for $1, very cool of the dev to do.Everyone who says there is nothing new apparently has not gotten past round 3/4 when Ghouls start showing up, and a few rounds after Werewolves(?). Did not see the name pop up. Not sure how many new enemies there are total, as I haven't gotten past there yet.That is about all that is new apart from the HD textures and the Doctor character, so don't expect anything else. It will be the same experience for the most part, albeit with the tougher new enemies.Another thing most people haven't read is that they are going to have Workshop integration.Supposedly it would be at launch, but it seems to be delayed. At least, last I checked there was no workshop for it.The News update from launch I missed states Workshop is planned to be added within the next week, as well as the much-wanted trading cards. That will definitely extend the life of the game, but if you ask me the devs should have put in more work for new content made by themselves.Would recommend this over the first one, it is only $4 for newcomers and $1 for veterans. This isn't some big budget AAA game or a $30 survival game, it's the price of a cup of coffee for a game that'll give at least some hours of fun with friends, and that is all there is to it."

Host will buy himself a laser and just give you a chainsaw.- Enemies don't even act like they're being hit, they just spew blood but like even when getting shot by a laser they are just like meh im normal and the laser just goes through them, no sign its doing any damage- Electro barricades stop like 100 zombies.. lolwot- Lamp post is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, just add a circle of light in the middle for the darkness.- You don't know if someone has said something in chat unless u check it by pressing enter- Enemies are still retarde-d, will attack barricades not even close to you just randomly- Some noises like when someone spams asking for a weapon is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, and the notification of them asking is really short.- LAGGY AFIf the game fixes its cons and they support the game, will maybe think about changing it to positive."

Its a shame they didnt add new weapons/defences or even a map.

The flame thrower doesn't burn anything, it's basically just a machine gun with yellow smoke instead of bullets. Horribly underwhelming.The gameplay itself sucks balls. When you join an online game here's what you can do: nothing. You can't buy barricades, turrets or whatever. You can't place them if there's some in store, you can't buy any weapon either, you also can't buy ammo for the weapons. There is literally 0 thing you can do. The host does everything. And of course he does it wrong. He buys all the stuff, he places all the stuff and all the weapons/ammo he buys goes into some sort of invisible shared pool for everyone. So let's say you ask nicely to get a shotgun, now there's 2 people who can try to switch weapons faster than you and obtain the shotgun. The host then has to buy 4 shotguns. But will he? No. Of course not.Basically the host plays the game and you're just a bot. You're one more ""auto turret"" hiding behind the cover except I guess you can press G to toss a grenade or two if the big boss thought of buying you one."

,Recommended,674750,35192640,Posted: 24 September,all,Twistor,"Briefly:Yet Another Zombie Defense HDis a good tower defense / survival shooter hybrid. It's an updated version ofthis game.Since Microsoft XNA got dumped, so did the devs of originalYAZDdump it and adaptUnity. Hence, this remastered game. I'm going for comparisons review - if you wish to read my comprehensive review of the old game (going a bit more into detail),it's here.What's new?The game was built from ground up onUnitybut it has all the same features of oldYAZDand slightly more:New enemy types(in regards to above)Lot more challenging Survival modeOne newcharacter modelWorkshop support(promised but pending)Slightly better graphicsA couple of more new amusing, challengingachievementsto huntIt frankly isn't much. It wasn't free upgrade either, but devs were kind enough to give out -75% coupons for previous purchasers.Most exciting of the above were the new enemy types. The new enemies, like ghouls and hellhounds really freaked me up the first time they appeared, which is cool.Modding (through Steam Workshop) might make it all the more exciting but it's not in the game yet, as of writing.What's old?OtherwiseYAZD HDis the same fine top-down tactics shooter / defender as before but more challenging. Zombies get tougher faster, and new enemy types are really just alternative models with different (usually larger) health, damage and speed.Co-op has been reworked, allowing three different modes of money-spending in the Survival mode. InYAZDonly host could buy stuff, but this can be altered in the HD version.The new challenge rating shows adequately: I beat the originalYAZDachievements in 2.5 hours, while it took me over 5 hours to do the same in the HD remake right after seasoning myself in the original.ConclusionsYAZD HDis still a good game. If you didn't play the original one, you should get this HD version instead, even if it's a bit pricier."

The one major addition of content that I can see are the new enemy types, whereas the original only had the plain zombies. And yes, the assets look nicer, the animations are smoother. Everything is a bit more polished. Does that make it worth the double price tag (compared to the first game)? Not really, no. Like the original, this is still a good game for a quick laugh and the base building is surprisingly satisfying, once you scrape together some cash. But I'd wait for a discount anyway.

Also people that already own the old game before this came out got a 75% off code, which then it only cost them 1$.If you never tried this game, its not to bad.

The zombies are much faster in this version and cannot be kited as easily. For instance, in the original game I got the achievement where you don't buy anything for the first 6 rounds. In this version, by the 3rd round I could not outrun the zombies and I could not subdue them with only a pistol. I also noticed the flood of zombies increases much more quickly in this version. Overall, this version just isn't as fun as the original. The graphical improvements are nice, however. I'll recommend the game only because multiplayer is still fun.

If one player is hogging the good weapons, you'll all die.The ""LAN"" thing from up top.The game encourages a balance between base building and collecting. If you stay in your base, you'll get no money and die. If you have no base, you'll be surrounded and die.Neutral:The change to unity seems promising, though there isn't too much to show it now.Cons:Some players buy the expensive weapons too early, stunting the growth of the base and other things.The purchasing is up to one player, which basically leaves the fate of that lobby to that one player.Difficulty ramps up too fast."

But I think,it's important that the players can upload own maps.The gray stoned map is very boring after some time,just a map with some stone around it, water.. environment, what do I know;I mean a little bit variety would be cool, for example in current version there'sa new character: the doc :DWeapon amount is okay for the moment. I think it's more important to change themain overview of the buying- & selling menu.Sometimes I don't want to skip each item finally I got it,add for example an item-search field, that would be cool too.At all, I very recommend you this game, the experience is very funny especially with friends, try it out, it's also very cheap :D+- funny with friends, easy server selecting / creating  system- cheap- item amount- weapon effects- sounds- level up system-- Server administration is very bad at the moment. U can't give a friend for example the permission, to place all the items and buildings.- Item selection is sometimes annoying, better selection or search field would be better- for the price it's okay that there is only one ground, but I hope the workshop integration cause that peoplecan upload grounds or resource packs (would be cool)Server player balance is okay, community is relaxed - no problems so far.Also the -75% coupon was a great idea by developers - thanks for that!_______________________________________hint:  no voice chat isn't a problem for a low priced game like this, but it would be a cool feature, but also very annoying for some players - I think it's better without it, especially because this game is too much non-cooperative - see: host is the only one with permission to do sth at day time, other players could ask, but getting nothing back in thing of creating by themselves--- .For now, there are HD graphics and new monsters at night, and there is a doctor character,more isn't it in this newer edition so far; but I like it to see the new coming features.

,Recommended,674750,34486804,Posted: 25 August,all,Puck,"Awesome remake! I put a bunch of hours into the original game, which was really fun itself, but this HD version really takes the cake... honestly the title ""HD"" is misleading, this is more than a simply repolished version.On top of the new awesome visuals which really make the game come alive (ba-dum-tsss), they added several new enemies and a couple new entities such as Propane Tank Spikes, which are really cool. Oh, and remember how annoying it weas in the original to finish every second round to get to the perk screen, and not be able to reach that sweet, sweet cash sitting near you that you couldn't get to in time? Yeah, they totally fixed that.For $4, this took and already-rad game and made it even better. If you're like me, a year from now you'll find yourself coming back to it for the simple-but-addictive fun of it. Excited to see what the workshop has in store for it."

,Recommended,674750,34805865,Posted: 7 September,all,Strifer4233,"Random crashes aside, this game is worth the price. It's a fun and challenging Zombie defense game, using modern graphics. The online community is rather sparse, but it works well if you have friends that play this game as well. The UI leaves a lot to be desired. Overall, no ragrets."

,Recommended,674750,34542672,Posted: 27 August,all,Unknown,"This is a very good game for what I bought with the coupon ($1.00). It is personally better than the first one. The other thing I like about this game is that the zombies have a higher speed towards them and there were new zombies instead of the same old ones, which is a great feature! Only a few weapons added which is okay. The graphics are good too but it may lag for some people depending what type of computer you have.The only thing I think should be added are Trading Cards and new maps to play from.The thing that needs to be fixed are the achievement. There are some achievements broken (I think) and there are some that the host can only get like Lumber achievement. I had to be the host to recieve that when I used the chainsaw for a while and no other weapon.This is a great mutiplayer came and great when you use a controller for the game, it does run smooth. It notifiys you too when you get damaged/hit by vibrating."

76561198113092770,Recommended,674750,34486139,Posted: 25 August,all,Him,"Alllllllrightyyyyyyy so Yet Another Zombie Defense H D  Q U A L I T Y  is you guessed it a zombie defense game, where you try to survive a spooky horde of zombies and other weird stuff trying to kill you, and the way you do that is you have to buy/build defenses (you can also buy weapons) to defend your self with. One problem would be that the map is pretty boring, it's just a gray floor with a  light post. Another one would be that there is really no difference between the non hd version and the H D  Q U A L I T Y  one, so you're just buying this version to make it look pretty.So overall it's still a pretty fun game to play with friends, so it would be a 6/10 if i was playing solo but with friends i would give it a 8/10."
