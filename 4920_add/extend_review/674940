,Recommended,674940,35269624,Posted: 28 September,all,Skiptrace Starbound,"Well, I found this game kind of randomly. I think I saw the trailer for it because I had the april fools day Totally Accurate Battle Zombilator or something like that. And, I'm gonna rate it just like all of my other reviews! 1 to 10 scale!Graphics: 9/10: The graphics in this game are crisp and smooth. Though, explosions aren't quite optimized, and i'd love to see some sort of extra distinguishing marks like maybe hats or something similar added later. And certainly a Colorblind Mode for those gamers who can't see certain colors!Audio: 10/10: The Music and Sounds for this game are a mix of funky techno and awesome gunshot noises. Though I'd have loved to hear an AWP noise from CS:GO for the Sniper Rifle.Gameplay: 9.5/10: I will certainly get hundreds of hours out of this with friends. The gameplay is like an older PS3 game a friend had where you could Twin Stick and you had a Punch, Kick, and Energy button setup. And there were random weapons that would spawn. I would like the ability to go into a Training Room with each of the weapons to learn how they play, and some sort of Health Meter would be nice, but not required.Maps: 9/10: The maps are great and fun to play, But i'd love to see some sort of Map Creator linked to the Steam Workshop Mods system. This would help to keep the game alive unlike other similar and still fun Indie titles like Screencheat, where the game is great, but the small map pool killed the game's potential to purely a few hours and then moving on with my life.Overall: 9/10: People might say that I am being harsh on a brand new Indie title, but these are valid criticisms, and I do only have a few minutes into the game at the time of this review, but I will certainly be racking up the hours as the weeks go by and I need something to put my frustrations into! I highly recommend this game as a fun Party game. Controllers are required and I highly recommend learning how to use the Twin Stick fighting style!"

,Recommended,674940,35322876,Posted: 29 September,all,MattBatt56,"I bought this game simply because it reminded me of those old stick man fighting animation videos on YouTube. So far, the gameplay is similar to Duck Game, where you jump around killing your friends with whatever you can get your hands on. The concept is amazing and leaves a lot of replayability due to the mass amount of levels and weapons. The demo video above is a very accurate representation of how the game plays, and is 100% worth it for the price listed. I've only played with my friends online, but for the people without friends, there was the option to play online with randoms. There's also local multiplayer for those people looking to have some social ""IRL"" interaction. Hopefully we get some more levels and weapons in the future or some Steam Workshop integration for the posibility to create our own levels.Edit: Snakes"

Obama had just been elected, Breaking Benjamin were on tour, and every other YouTube video was a stick fight animation using their music.

There are a few kinks, but the developers are alreay working on ironing those out- and it's been out for less than a week at the time of writing. For five dollars, there's really no reason not to buy it. Hell- buy a few copies for your friends.TL;DRMy friend Katie's laughter and my screams of ""JESUS CHRIST JESUS CHRIST THE SNAKES ARE INSIDE ME CHRIST"" scored me a noise complaint, and someone next door who hadn't even seen any gameplay purchased it immediately."
,Recommended,674940,35340434,Posted: 30 September,all,Lt. Apfel-Jouse,"Stick Fight: The GameStick Fight intrigued me. I had been a follower of Landfall's previous games and projects. They had a unique, simplistic art style fitted with a bundle of content. And when I saw this in my email one day at school, I knew Ihadto buy it. Me and my friend both loved stick animation since we were as young as 9, and we love party games.So, what about the game itself?Pros ✓The gameplay:The gameplay is one of my favourite aspects. Being Landfall, they are bound to have satisfyingly floppy animations, and they deliver. Backflips, frontflips, diving, Naruto running, and so much more is available to do in the world. Me and my friend even RP as different people from different countries thanks to the wide variety of guns and environments. Even though the fighting commences in a closed box, it is the perfect amount of space needed for long range, medium range and melee battling to take place.GraphicsNot much is to really be said here, one graphics option on a dropdown menu and resolution options. I play at a low resolution, and it's good to know they optimised it well, just like T.A.B.S. It's kind of a shame they didn't allow for particle options, however, as one of the laser levels cuts my framerate to pieces.ServersThe servers are, for the most part, consistent and steady. However, I would like for there to be more options. I won't babble on too much about this, because the game is only 2 days old, but there is only one mode. Deathmatch. I would like a variety of modes like being able to team up with friends, a gamemode similar to the conveyor belt box level, where you jump and evade boxes or lasers while running. However, the game is only two days old, as I've mentioned. It's subject to development, and they have a huge update coming soon.DevelopersA little side note here, the developers do not have this as their main priority at the moment. It is currently T.A.B.S, and this game is what they have done in their free time. So, if there are no updates for a few months, it's nothing to rally on about. Just be patient and they'll give updates and more content further on.MusicI really like the music in this game. It fits the tone of messy brawls and speedy jolts, but the music does repeat itself over the course of time, and you will hear the same tune played again after a while. My friend likes to play this game with no music but rather the punching audio, maybe you'll do the same.Cons ✗Well, this is going to sound rather preachy, but there are basically no major cons that I can give to the game. Two minor ones I have previously mentioned are the graphics limitations and servers sometimes lagging a tad, but there's basically nothing bad about this game. Maybe the price is something to go against, but a game is a game.TL:DRThis game is utterly fantastic. I recommend buying this game if you need something to play with friends, love fast-paced action or brutal beatdowns. This game does remind me of Gang Beasts, a game I have reviewed negatively in the past, but this is the Gang Beasts everyone wanted. Laughs, beatdowns and difficulty.This is a great game to have in your library. Over the course of some updates, you might find yourself crawling back to it.Have fun!"

Stumbled across Stick Fight: The Game and thought that it looked like fun. Got the game. Played for two hours with my brother and we were laughing and having fun the whole time. It's a great game so far. I only have two hours in playtime as of writing this review, but I think I will be playing the game a lot more. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the game, for instance, there is no tutorial, and supposedly the online multiplayer has issues, but other than a few small, minor problems, I really like this game. I see a lot of potential as long as the developers are willing to put some more work into this game, improving it and making it all the more enjoyable. It is great fun."

Stick Fight: The Game is a fast pace 2-D stick man brawler featuring up to 2-4 players, Guns, Multiple style Maps, Edge sitting game play and even snakes.How ever the game still has quite alot of bugs and glitches from spawning under the map or being able to fly upwards with two guns. and it can be quite difficult to do multiplayer alot of the time, having to wait 10 minites to half an hour waiting for someone else to join (unless your playing with friends) and there is no single player.there are a few features that i and some other players do want, like having workshop for maps or guns and a map creator sort of like duck game or maybe even a single player mode with AI of even just a target practice room.anyway i highly recomend this game for its low price and fun gameplay, but dont buy this (Yet) unless you are pacient and dont mind waiting on other players to join."

Really simple, yes, but heap fast-paced action with nice humor lying in the ragdoll physics. The gameplay is purely multiplayer, online or local, which means the more players the better!I recommend this just as much as any other, and as stated before, the more players, the better!"
,Recommended,674940,35273257,Posted: 28 September,all,Glue Stick,"Been following this game since what feels like forever! The Dev team are such a lovely bunch they talk to the community dailey and go out of their way to answer question. The game is a exelent game if you have 30 min to spare it is well woth the price and can be played for 5 min or a hour and each round feels fun. The main menu system is really inovtive and fun to use. I purchesed two copies one for me and one for my SDO and we both love it. Can honestly see myself playing this game for a long tiime to come.One recommend ation i would have for this game would be a single player mode and a level editor as i feel they would expand the lifespan of the game by tenfold. This will allow the game to carry on even if most of its player base dies, with mods and bots you can have limitless fun: Case in point original star wars battlefront 2 a game i still mod and play today."

,Recommended,674940,35364813,Posted: 30 September,all,Cantankerous Comrade,"So I nabbed this on a whim, thinking back to those old flash animations of stick figures duking it out. This is that, this is multiplayer. This is awesome. Simple, fast paced, and easy to get a hang of. Easily worth the five bucks-- told my friends about it, they each nabbed a copy and within minutes we were wreaing havoc on eachother's dignity by absolutely destroying one another.It's worth noting that while everything I said stands, there are some issues to consider. Seeing as this game came outtwo days agothree days ago since I played this past midnight, I'm not too surprised it has a couple of bugs. Some levels with physics objects-- such as breakable ice or falling crates-- will have some of those elements carry over into the next match. This did not show up for the host. Similarly, some maps with moving components only seemed to work for the host, while myself and my other friend were entirely unable to see those components (and entirely unaffected by them, giving us an advantage).Another little hiccup (which I find hilarous) is that when a weapon falls on a corpse, the corpse will sometimes equip it as if the player were still alive. This makes it impossible for living players to obtain the weapon. Not the end of the world, but I figure thatprobablyisn't supposed to happen.I don't like leaving a positive review with more written about the negatives than the positives, but I'm doing that here because the positives really arethat straightforward. Good maps, good weapons,greatphysics,awesomemusic, and these little battles lookawesome. I really do feel nostalgic playing this.I'm sure the few issues I've noticed will be fixed soon enough. Again, itjust came out."

,Recommended,674940,35356702,Posted: 30 September,all,Denz,"Ok, to start i've only played this for 3 hours as of writing this review so i can't speak for every tiny aspect of the game.Firstly i think it's worth pointing out, that to enjoy this game you are going to want to get a few friends on board. The game has no single player and the quick match making obviously displays the premise of the game quite well but it doesn't really make it shine, infact i'd call playing it that way 'boring'. It starts to shine when you have a few people together playing either locally or online. That's when the laughs and hilarity starts.The premise of the game is to kill your friends, you all start off within a level with nothing but your bare hands and a hunger to win, so you begin chasing your (secretly) least favourite friend around the level trying to beat the ever living crap out of them until they flop over or fall of the edge, an AK-47 might drop and you both rush for it, knowing that whoever has that.. is going to rip♥♥♥♥♥♥up. He gets it, you panick then run and hide, hoping that he will waste all of the ammo it had. He clips your head with a single well placed bullet and that's the end of you. Your other friend has been hiding behind a tree this whole time, waiting for the moment to pounce. The AK runs out of ammo and the wielder runs in for the fisty cuffs.Smack, Crash, Wallop, TING, TING, Smack.AK guy slides off of a ledge leaving the sneaky friend waiting, looking.. But wait, weren't there 4 players in this game?The fourth guy appears out of nowhere with a minigun, he pulls the trigger. The pure force of 1000 rounds a minute propels him up into the air, while a barrage of metal destroys everything below. He didn't have a chance. Cue next level and let's get this on all over again!I know i went on a small writing prompt there, but if you can't gather the info you need from the screenshots and video, maybe that will entice you.As for the longevity of this game, it is very short in terms of the amount of levels and you will blast your way through the levels within 30 minutes, however this doesn't hamper the game i don't feel, as weapon drops in certain levels will randomise and chaos will ensue no matter what. I do hope that they begin to add more levels into the game at some point, maybe in a free update or a cheap DLC pack (i'd prefer the free update) to give it an even wider gamut of levels to play through. As well as maybe a few different game modes to spice things up and keep it re-playable.I would whole heartedly recommend this game, it's cheap and the amount of fun you will have with it is insane for the price. It's a very pick up and go kind of game, that will do very well at house parties or LAN parties and it's easy enough that anyone can join in.There are some bugs in this game, such as when playing online some of the levels will have invisible walls for some players but walls that are tangible to others (i have noticed this while playing with friends over the internet). It wouldn't hurt to add some kind of health bar or points system so that you can actually check if you did damage or not, but as it stands i still recommend this.9/10"

It has everything to get you hooked for hours while making them feel like minutes : gameplay is quick, nervous, games quickly succeed one another, you do not have to iterate through multiple servers to find one as the game simply quickly set you up with other players without any further options except hosting, no score is kept so there is no real point in winning or loosing you just play for fun, and fun you'll have for sure.I've never laughted so hard in the first play hour of a game. When you don't yet know what every weapon and every stages are capable of, you'll die in ways you can't possibly imagine for a stick figure game. Yes, sometimes you'll die because of some lags that still make for an hilarious situation, but again, the short lenght of every matches and the play-for-fun point of the game will quickly make it up for those.For 5$, I recommend that game to anyone who like side scrolling fighting games such as Super Smash or even ""survivor takes it all"" games such as PUBG, but even if you dont, give this one a try, you wont regret it."

Which i found really odd. I got used to it after a while. However, at some points my hand will hurt due to the akward contorls. mabye you can add a key board option to cusomize your key commands.

Grab a shotgun to shoot someone but you miss and the recoil shoots you off the map and you die, awesome.2. The game looks BEAUTIFUL. The aesthetics and the way the colors glow as it contrasts with a dark background is pure eye candy. And the music is fantastic too, it has beat to it that fits with the battles.3. ITS JUST $5!

The online has alot of these problems such as a few players survive the Death Lasers, the lag of one person can cause them to literally phase through solid objects, some players lag to the point that you don't see their attacks yet you take the damage and have no way of actually avoiding it, others seem to be able to shoot through solid objects, and of course there is a chance whatever you do to actually do damage ultimately means nothing as you some how do nothing to another player and yet you die instead. I have experienced every single one of these problems in the short time that I've been playing so I'll end up sticking to the Local section of the game until it gets fixed, other than these issues this game is alot of fun to play is whacky crazy and unpredictable. Just fix these game breaking issues and it'll be even better. I do recommend it if you want to enjoy it with people at home, but online however iI'd say take your chances."

This game needs dedicated servers if it's gonna survive longer.More often than not when playing online, you get hit by  people not near you or that punches clearly dont connect. When the game is running properly, its an absolute joy. Combat is satisfying and fun. The game definitely feels like there's a bit of a skill cap too. But unfortunately, more often than not, you'll be getting hit by things that didnt hit you on your screen. Disappointing. If it gets fixed, then i'd totally recommend,"

It is fast paced, with fluid and smooth animations for the playermodels, and the fighting mechanic works well with the levels. Movement can sometimes be difficult simply due to the fact of the game's fast pace, and small map size. You can also quite easily lose track of where your character is due to this as well. Overall, this game has massive potential and offers great enjoyment for such a low price."

,Recommended,674940,35273936,Posted: 28 September,all,Blumaliscous,"Great game, one of the best 5 dollar purchases I've ever made.There are some glitches, obviously, like random deaths, lag, and some bad spawn points, but none of it takes away from how much fun this game is. And it's not even the spawn points themselves that are bad, but the pose you start out in at that spawn.One map in particular, the one where the ceiling is made of spikes, and it and your own platform (the only one you can really stand on) are held up by chains. The ceiling is, at the start of the level, held up by these temporary blocks, that disappear after something hits them. Anywho, when laying down, or if you were prone at the end of the last match, you sometimes get spawned in between this temp block and the spiky ceiling, resulting in an instant death.Not a fan of that map, for that reason (kept spawning there).One thing I would like to see, would be map playlists, instead of the randomized thing at work now. There are some maps that are really cool, that I want to play more of and get further into, but the matches sometimes don't last long enough to accomodate that, so if I could choose maps, that'd awesome. Maybe it's already there, and I haven't seen it yet (haven't even read the steam page, just recognized it from reddit and bought it).Either way, tons of fun, and I can't wait to play more, by myself and with friends. I definitely recommend this."

,Recommended,674940,35285318,Posted: 29 September,all,PringDing,"This game caught my eye on the front of the steam store and I have to say that I'm glad it did. Aside from all the issues the game has (lag for the most part) theres something that makes me want to play it forever. When I first encountered some of the bugs I thought that I would be refunding it after a couple rounds, but instead I had to actually stop myself from playing more. The game is basically an endless cycle of maps where players duke it out in a 4 player free for all. Weapons drop from the sky randomly and on other maps they are set to spawn. The time between rounds is short and keeps the action going which is very nice in my opinon. Some maps have destructible terrain which can be quite fun and make the round pretty interesting. Keep in mind that the game did just realease so it is no surprise that it is having some issues. Anyways overall I would say this is a must buy, so far I've only played with random people and I can only imagine the fun you could have with a few of your buddies."

There is still few little bugs , like sometimes it will spawn you a bit weird outside the zone, or between spike and some object so you insta die, but the game is so fast paced you are back in game in matter of seconds.

One thing I would like to see is a quick 2 minute tutorial on what the controls are! and all of the people in the game have equal chances of winning due to the simple mechanics and balanced weapons.Graphics: 9.3/10 For a 2D indie game, the graphics of this game meet all requirements. The only flaw is some glitches were the stick figures freak out and teleport through walls. Other than that, great!Sound/Audio 9.1/10 The sound in this game is very diverse and fits the setting! I'd just love it if there where a few more sounds such as the game start clock ticking or the ""you win"" message. Overall the sound is just right!Maps: 8.4/10 The maps in the game are divided into categories, each with unique traits. Boxes that fall, lasers that chase you, snakes that bite! One thing i would like to see is more secret compartments to make the matches slightly longer, kind of like the light saber in the laser map! Then the players have a goal/achievable advantage.Controls: 9.8/10 The controls are easy to learn and basic. Like I said earlier, the controls are basic enough that someone who has mastered then doesn't have any sort of advantage. Sometimes the punches and blocks don't register though.Overall: 9.1/10 This game is amazing and strives in most areas! The 2 things this game needs are longer games/complex maps and custom games! I definetly think this is worth the $5 that you pay. Thanks Landfall for bringing us yet another amazing game!"

The levels are simple while being great fun with the weapon drops spicing it all up. Speaking of weapons; these have to be some of the most fun to shoot! The shotgun is so fun to use on ice levels and everything from a pistol to the mini-gun feels like the best thing in the world.Flaws are there though, had a few matches end when everyone died but the game didn't go on. Turning invisible and not seeing anything kinda sucks while others might be able to. And the bigger gun on the ice maps sure make a lot of work for lesser computers. And there is one level for the moving platforms where it instantly throws  you down (It looks like a square made of platforms, hope that helps)I don't think any of these are deal breakers though, I hope they get fixed while I run around shooting like crazy in this awesome game."

There is always weird things happening with the level or some sick trickshot you got on your friend that creates hillariour moments of laughter and screaming.The game goes endless until you have had enough and you switch to another game.Perfect game to play with friends (or online) in between two other games, or just when waiting for something! ;)"

It's extremely simple, very addictive, and about as casual a fighting game can be.  The footage showcased in the trailer is a very good glimpse into the kind of games you'll actually play.  The clips you see aren't the rare brilliant moments like you might catch once or twice every 100 games.  Virtually every match is as consistently entertaining as the last.  The maps and weapons are varied enough to make each round unique and each game goes by fast.  And it's one of the few games that stays fun to watch for the few seconds a match goes on after you die.  It's as fun as it looks and it's a blast finally getting to play a part in those stick fight Flash animations from the early 2000s.  Stick Fight probably won't hold my attention for hundreds of hours, but it's more than worth the $5 price tag.TL;DR: If you liked Poké Floats and Stick Death and were possibly diagnosed with ADHD as a child, you will like this game."

,Recommended,674940,35484765,Posted: 4 October,all,JumpingJack,"Extremely fun and well made game, me and my friends all played and couldn't stop laughing for like 20 minutes, it was great. The way they made the guns feel and the way your character moves is just really funny. it has a lot to it aswell, rather than just sticks fighting, they have guns, swords, snake rocket launchers, and much more. My favorite has to be the shotty, it launches you so far back but its so good if you can use it. If you're a sweaty tryhard it can also be a good game, with blocking that is pretty rewarding making it so the enemy cant attack for a second. and levels allowing you to do some sick parkour around enemies. I had the most fun with this game than I have had in a long time.The only real cons are the glitches, sometimes you can fall through maps and everyone sees everything differently, one gun spawns laser beams than insta kill you which changes the map as a whole, but everyone usually has different views for them. And major desync can happen, but as of now is like 3 or 4 days after release so its expected, they've also been updating the game already. And desync isn't really their fault, the players get to host off their own connection, so if you play with someone far from you you'll probably get some desync. Maybe in the future they can add their own servers, that would be nice.right now probably about a 7.5/10 or something, if they fix some bugs and improve desync issue it could be near a 10."

76561198133057695,Recommended,674940,35477957,Posted: 4 October,all,kyoya,"I've waited to reach the 5-hour mark to make this review, to be impartial. If you want an honest and comprehensive review of this game, then keep reading. Stick Fight: The Game game is honestly amazing, it's essentially an extensive free for all that ranges from 2 players - 4. The goal of the game is to either kill your opponents or have them fall off the map and be the last man standing. Let me warn you, Stick Fight has no final winner, it goes on forever so people play and leave freely from one round to the other. The game itself is extremely well balanced between standard melee and weapons. The hand to hand itself is more than usable because if you time it right, you are able to deflect your opponent's melee and ranged attacks.  Undoubtedly, makes brawling actually somewhat depend on skill. The game forces you to strategize and act on impulse consistently.Weapons are a game changer, they spawn on the map periodically, forcing you to choose between brawling or blitzing towards the weapons to gain an advantage, often you're even in a situation where you can choose between multiple weapons. As for the weapon types, there are long-range weapons like a machine gun, but also close ranged weapons such as the dagger (which by the way, increases your movement tremendously), or the lightsaber. I cannot stress how creative the devs have been with the weapons.The gameplay can be quite unique from round to round, simply because the maps and weapons are all randomly generated. Which means some weapons can actually be a disadvantage on some maps and an advantage on some other maps. Example: The shotgun is a strong weapon however, it has a gigantic recoil, if you use it on a small map or far too close to the edge, you'll fall off. Some maps can actually be destroyed if damaged enough so you have to be careful where you step.An extremely fun game as of yet, though there's a lot of glitches present. The weapons glitch at some point and some maps can be glitchy not to mention I've encountered a glitch where you fall off and somehow don't lose. Seems, they've been working on fixing all these bugs, quite effectively might I add, as there are some issues I haven't seen in a long time.I would definitely recommend this game and if you're considering buying it, I urge you to do so."

The online play is a bit buggy at the moment - occasionally you won't load in and there's a decent chance that the first match won't be playable due to either frozen/poorly spawned players falling through the map. If you can get past the initial online glitchiness, the game runs incredibly smoothly. A little anecdotal, but I feel it's worth it - I explored all eighty maps with a random player, one on one combat the entire time. It was marvelous, this game has a lot of love in it and I'm crossing my fingers the netcode is fixed soon[Edit] - Net Code was fixed. Sorta - still some minor kinks (one level never works post patch, it just throws all competitors into the ground immediately) but overall the fixes made it worth it! They added new spawn mechanics when playing as host so you can manipulate which weapons people fight with... snake guns all around."

There are a lot of bugs in this game, maybe 1 or 2 are game breaking but the rest are just minor.Also there seems to be no point in winning at the moment. The only goal you have right now is to kill, but there isn't any competition. That and the game itself is kind of empty. Just one game mode, and a few things to control the game, but that's about it.

There is also no singleplayer so keep that in mind  if you want to play with A.I.2. Lag is an issue.In all of the matches I've played (3.6 hours worth) there has been the omni-present issue of lag. Sometimes there are no problems with my friends, but if a random person joins good luck trying to play. Once again, friends are needed to play the game, lag can be quite annoying.Anyways besides that it's very fun so you should pick it up for $5"

A little desync at times it seems but apart from that amazing game and it might get patched soon I assume. If you have friends get four pack on humble bundle  cheaper and enjoy! :)Level editor/workshop support would be absolutely insane for this, hope it gets there eventually. Price is definitely right here. Great party game, local or online."

Do you like mass destruction? Do you like beating up your friends with ak's, handguns, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, and even snake guns. Yes, you read correctly, SNAKE GUNS. The weird and wacky physics are probably the best part about this game. So gather up your friends, online or local, and get shooting :).There are a few glitches to do with desync stuff and if you want to host an online game, it takes forreeevvveerrr. But those are just minor cons.Overall, this game is probably one of the best $5 games i have ever gotten.Have fun!"

Recommended towards someone who doesnt have a big game budget, so worth it for 5 bucks!!I'm excited to see where this game goes and if they do add a level creator or something for the workshop. Would love to see that!!"

Best thing about it?There's evidence that the devs are hard at work making it better than it is right now!Definitely worth the price!"

Ive made friends just by hitting people in the face and shooting them in the head with a revolver. The graphics are amazing for just sticks. One thing I wish this game had is BLOOD. But i cant blame it. I want to see more guns and levels in the future for im extremely excited."
