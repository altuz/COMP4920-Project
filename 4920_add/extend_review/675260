,Recommended,675260,34337382,Posted: 18 August,all,Rusev,"The first episode felt like The Walking Dead Season 1 Episode 1 all over again.And that's a good thing.You could actually taste the sweat (lots) and tears (flooded) that were poured into that episode, which is something that we haven't seen since TFTB.Graphically, it's as good as Telltale Games get.Gameplay-wise, it's as interactive as Telltale Games get.Story-wise (thus far), it's almost as good as The Walking Dead Season 1 was.And, finally, it's bout' time we got a 2 hour long episode too with somewhat meaningful choices. The introduction of the relationship system also suprisingly makes most conversations feel much more impactful.Whilst Episode 1 might not be worth the 19 quid by itself, if the rest of the episodes are similiar to quality of the first one, then 19 pounds is most definitely the right price tag.Most definitely recommended for people who have finished the first season. Likely won't be disappointed!EDIT: Episode 2 just came out. Let's just say that it has reassured me that Telltale, indeed, still has it."

LG B6 4K OLED/non compressed colors. Input device: Xbox One elite controller wireless.———————————————Longwinded review:I am a fan of interactive movies and games where gameplay change depending on players input. Telltale is one of the companies that does this genre best, even if they usually only give an illusion of that players decisions matter. Loved the first Telltale Walking dead and Wolf among us. Less walking dead S2/extra episodes and the Mine Craft story.Telltales first Batman game was plagued with launch issues that made the game unplayable for people with for example 4K screens. They later patched these issues and some of the controller issues they had even if still the first Telltale Batman is not 100% Xbox controllable compatible. The game was full of stuttering, strange graphics and add to that problem with controllers. It seemed that Telltale didn’t play test any of their games on PC before release and let customers be a huge beta test with the excuse that Steam offers 2 hours refund.Batman S2 have none of these issues. Everything worked out of the box and no performance issues during my play thru of the game.We buy these games for story, not gameplay since its more or less quicktime events. The game starts by importing a save from S1 carrying over the decisions you did or you can create a new save with default decisions. This worked effortless with Telltales cloud saves.Set one year after the events in S1. The decisions you made reflects in NPCs scars and emotional state. Continuing the S1 storyline with Bruce Waynes double persona you start as Bruce Wayne and is facing an old Gotham villain: The Riddler.This is Telltales re imagined Batman world. Everything we know as “truth” about Wayne family, Joker and all other characters are out the windows. That is the fresh spin in these games. We think we know a character, but here Telltale have 100% creative freedom to do what they want. I don't want to spoil the story, so no main plot points will be written. Its a rollercoaster story, with some new gameplay mechanics including limited free roam in Bat cave. Great production values, some detective work, decisions and the usual quicktime action sequences.I really loved this game. Best episode1 from Telltale since Walking dead S1. Lets hope they keep this up and give us a real reimagined Joker. My Bruce Wayne loves Joker and want to join him. Maybe do a wife swap: Harley/Selina or a tag-team?"

This game removes all of first game (or first season I can say) couldn't do good. First of all, they removed letterbox. I hate that damn thing. But they should've make an option to using it if anyone likes it besides me. Gameplay became for useful. Now you can choose between 2 attacks before you attack an enemy which is cool (those aren't choices, just actions). First season had FPS issues from the start. Even now it's fixed (at least for me) -I finished to play first season yesterday btw- it felt ""capped"" for some reason. I look at my FPS counter and it's 100+ but my eyes were sayin ""dude that's max 45"". This game fixed it very well. Lip animations, choices, graphics even became so much better. If that's the same team behind first season, they learned their lesson and moving onto a great direction. I can't wait to see other episodes as well. This game really teaches you that you can't save everyone, you can't be friends with everyone. You have to make choices. Choices that will shape you."

The jump in quality is so noticable, it's difficult to believe that both games were developed by the same company.That said, there's only one episode out so far. But comparing this to the first episode if the previous season, it's clear that Telltale is trying much harder this time around. It's not just the plethora of meaningful choices I've had to make so far, but also the improvement in visual quality.So far, I absolutely recommend this game. Hopefully, the quality will stay consintent."

The game also keeps the same mechanic to solve crime scenes in the first season plus a twist with the riddles! So definitely had a nice time and I'm eager to continue the adventure.

,Recommended,675260,34198692,Posted: 12 August,all,fuwafoowa,"*Clap clap clap*I normally wait to purchase and review Telltale games until all 5 episodes are out. However, the people who worked on this REALLY knew what they were doing. I'm honestly stumped. The animation is - without question - the best I've seen from Telltale. Visiually I loved the style and aesthetic. In terms of performance... I wouldn't know. My computer can run almost anyhting. Make sure to do your research just in case. The story, characters, writing are good for now... I'm aware how sour things can turn in the wrong hands. Selina Kyle is NOT in the first episode sadly. Bruce does say a reassuring line  about her to put the player at ease. Combat is the best it's been from Telltale. Normally their QTE style is the one thing that is lacking. However, this time around the ""Linking"" mechanic from Season 1 (in regards to fighting) has been changed to act as multiple-choice QTEs. Which I can honestly say is a lot of fun. Other interactions have been altered too. I'm glad the company is putting a bigger focus on innovation. After The Walking Dead: A New Frontier, Telltale are no longer what they used to be. But they're trying and that's all that counts."
76561198117226705,Recommended,675260,34133209,Posted: 9 August,all,SongOfDepletion,"The first episode was one hell of a Batman story, even if it does toss aside many of the familiar elements of Batman's world.  This is actually a good thing for the most part, as a formidable Riddler is a welcome change from hilarious futility of the same character in the Arkham-verse (which I also loved).  I think Telltale has to take these kinds of risks with its version of Batman, as strict adherence to source material would probably make for an anemic world where only small characters can be killed off, either as an unchangeable story point or as the result of decision you make as the player.  It's also noteworthy that Troy Baker's take on Bruce Wayne is far more human and emotional than most other versions of Batman.  I'll always regard Conroy as the best Batman overall, but Telltale's Bruce Wayne/Batman benefits from a less stoic, more emotionally-invested personality.Visually, the game is definitely looks better than its predecessor, and is otherwise exactly what you would expect from a Telltale game.  My only gripe - and this extends to every Telltale game that uses Direct-X 11 - is the lack of an option to use MSAA instead of whichever form of post-FX anti-aliasing that the game currently uses.  The jaggies can be downright pervasive in scenes with a lot of straight-line geometry (buildings, railings, cage bars, etc.).  It didn't kill my enjoyment of the game, but based on my experience of forcing MSAA in ""The Wolf Among Us"", this and all other Telltale games would benefit from the option.So far, I love this season.  I look forward to the next episode."

Yes, and No, let me explain;the telltale games aren't best known for their gameplay, walk around, look at stuff, talk to people, right? this game while it does have the same gameplay, it also has quicktime events, but with a little extra detail, while not being much it usually asks you if you want to tie someone up or shock them, telling gordon how to approach a hostage situation etc, but keep in mind, these games aren't known for their gameplay.Why Play it?-this game is more of a movie, but you choose the dialog and how the story shifts, yes not all choices are THAT meaningful, but if you care about the characters and story you'll care about what your batman is going to say-if you're a batman fan, play this game, while no one is sure if there's going to be another batman game (specifically from rocksteady), this will surely entertain the right people that enjoy this type of game.-is the story good? so far, imo, yes, while do keep in mind this batman's villains aren't like the comics or the rocksteady games, and if you played the first season you know this batman's backstory is somewhat different, first episode's main threat is the riddler, this season is going to introduce more villains (teases it at least) and more characters, as i said again, this game lets you shift your own batman, based on dialog, are you a kevin conroy batman, or are you an emotional selfish batman, are you going to side with gordon, or the new character.this game's message is more of a ""be your own batman"" than ""be the batman"". but if you look at it in general this game's choices don't affect much gameplay wise and ending-wise, other than the relationship with other characters, will they hate you, or will they be on your side.overall : i recommend this game."
,Recommended,675260,34356834,Posted: 19 August,all,Konj,"The only thing that could make this game better would be better cutscene action. Pressing E and Q constantly for the last 5 telltale games has been very boring, I miss the harder aspects that involved clicking and dragging the mouse in quick sucession, not just roessing keys on the keyboard to do everything, literally everything. Other than that, the story is very intriguing, very worth it. Quality is better than ever before in the detail of texture and visuals. And first episode had a plethera of different things to make it interesting, I can't wait to see what they do with the series."

76561198029155314,Recommended,675260,34120551,Posted: 9 August,all,VillageIdiot,"So I played the first season and despite it's strange bugs, I was obviously hooked by it's story telling and the genuine fact that I am indeed a fan of Batman. So just imagine season two being a fixed/updated game and continues it's delightful story-telling.THE GAMEPLAY:First thing's first, they've changed a lot, or added something to what we are familiar with from the first season. Rather than lean right towards Batman's technical strategy, the fighting has become more fast paced and added some new controls to react to moments to the point they really give you a wake up call. Some may argue they wish they had more time to choose between a round house kick or a body slam, but I assure you either execution is done with super brutality.Going back to the controls, they have added a few new ways to interact with the game while season one was pretty much slow with only having to press A, S, D, E with the occassional SHIFT key. This episode which involves The Riddler's puzzles surely gives you the opportunity to get a good feel of it.One big complaint that I agreed with is that TellTale's famous use of the butterfly effect didn't seem as decisive as previous games made it out to be. Most choices didn't cause a lot of damage or anything. Season two however puts you right in the corner, even for choices you made WAY back in season one.I really like how the characters also react to your choices compared to season two. Not only does the game make you think twice, but TellTale gives you ""status updates"" on your relationship with a character which pretty much expands their use of the butterfly effect.THE STORY:I don't want to exaggerate and say season two's story is even bigger, but I can't ignore how much of an impact episode one left me wherever it was a part of the story made out of my choice or not. So many surprises that leave you excited or shocked. The Riddler (nicely voiced by Robin Atkin Downes) obtained bit of a background to his character, while still keeping in touch with his mystery for this villain has always been rather elusive to me.Besides The Riddler, a whole cast of characters in quantities is just thrown at you or noticable on the side-lines (for now). TellTale stays true to characters we know and admire that come from across the DC Universe in my book, with their own little twists for the sake of the story from time to time, such as The Joker's new appearance in the Batman franchise as ""John Doe"".I can't wait to see more!"

If you want a game that is going to make you cry, go back and play the Walking Dead Season 1. If you want Telltale's newer titles to be written better, try inciting a boycott in the forums. If you want a DLC that expands upon XCOM - Enemy Unknown's features, campaign, and level design, you should probably looking at the other ""Enemy Within"" title on the Steam store. If you want to pretend to be Batman for 2 hours every other month for the next year, Batman: The Enemy Within is for you.I make my reviews based on whether or not I regret making my purchase. So far, I can say that I do not regret buying this game.Ep. 1:If I could sum this episode up into one expressive sound, it would be ""meh"".I do like how this season has much better optimization, so I am not constantly pulled out of the story by stuttering. Gameplay is certainly more interesting; getting to choose what takedown you want to perform on the fly does add a bit of spice to clicking random buttons whenever a prompt shows up like a trained monkey.The story is what made this episode less than stellar. Because, at least 3 ""twists"" during the episode can be seen coming from a mile away. Without giving any spoilers, it's very clear that the writers had to ignore agapingglaring plothole in order to make one of the ""twists"" work and to move the plot forward.Although, I did like a relationship between Batman/Bruce Wayne and another character that they included and played around with throughout the episode. I do enjoy seeing how characters act differently to the superhero and their alter-ego, and I have to say that those interactions with that character were probably the highlight of this episode."

Even if you're not a fan of batman, i highly recommend you thisSince only 1ep is out, its hard to say whether the rest will be this good or if telltale will pull another game of thrones where your choices make literally 0 impact, so this review might change, but so far your choices in the first ep already have repercussions in the same episode. I replayed it and made different choices and THERE IS an impact, which is good because i feared this would be like the walking dead where literally 0 of your choices actually matter. doesn't seem to be the case here so far.

I was not disappointed. Episode one lasts almost 3 hours which I think is great for a telltale episode, seeing as other series have seen their episodes becoming shorter and shorter.Season two builds on the strenghts of the first season.

I did find myself getting angry at the fact I as a fan obviously knew who Edward Nigma was and how Batman never actually tried to figure that out and the change from ARGUS to The Agency but I let it slide. This version of Amanda Waller is very simmilar to how I think of her in the comics, a huge ♥♥♥♥♥ who I want dead but who I also love. My biggest problem was the llack of explination of the new system involvingg how characters feel towards you, it was never explained and it didn't really tell you how they felt towards you (well more obvious ways) until the end, leaving me puzzles until the end, Also John Doe was suprisingly enjoyablle and is clearly without a doubt the seasons big bad as you can see him in two of the silllouetes for episodes and his line to Bruce is the title of Episode 5. 'Same Thread'.Pros:* Amanda Waller* John Doe was suprsingly enjoyable* Troy Baker as Batman is always welcome* Anything with Dave Fennoy especiallly as Lucius Fox* The Riddler was suprisingly fun...* Harley Quinn tease at the end and we see from episode two that it will involve Harley, Baine and Mr Freeze* So far the story is goodCons:* He coulld get boring quite quickly and I'm still unsure of his voice actor* Controls* This is a TelllTale game is your choices will usually still have the same result, but wish their was a way to avoid Lucius Fox's deathh especiallly because I love the character and actor.

However this time it's not as bad as the previous Batman Telltale season. You don't get black bars on all 4 sides, instead you see black bars only on two sides, like how you do on a Youtube video.The story was gripping and couldn't really expect any better, right when I thought I was getting bored of Telltale Games.. Excellent beginning episode. It has a lot of slow moments just like in the previous season, but the interesting bits more than make up for it.

Then of course there are the choices you get to make along the way and while we have yet to see how they actually affect the season as a whole, they really do feel like the impact they leave will be lasting.We are only one episode into Batman: The Enemy Within but it feels like we are going to be off to some very exciting places in the future and I am left feeling as though the result could be wildly different from anything I could have predicted.Overall an excellent way to turn an alright series with serious technical issues into an amazing journey I want to see through till the end."

76561198062132234,Not Recommended,675260,34128418,Posted: 9 August,all,Rowan Berry,"So... I watched my brother play this and was planning on having my go next. We loved the first season and we were both hyped for this!Just like the first season, the writing of the story and characters, and the voice acting is fantastic. They've improved upon the UI, how fluid the controls are and how much your choices affect the story. You are forced to make some very cruel decisions right off the bat and character relationships seem to be more varied now. That's all great and this is probably going to be even better than the first season... As a game.However... What I loved the most about the first season was how well Harvey Dent, Selina Kyle, Oswald Cobblepot and evenVickiwere written. They all had plenty of room in the story with their subplots, character development and varied, important roles to play in the overall story.I was over the moon to see my favorite villain, Riddler, in the trailer.The reason I am marking my review as negative and won't be playing this game isthat I was ""only in it for the Riddler"", so to say. He is this game's Carmine Falcone... The ""tiny villain"" whose only role is to be a plot device to lead you to the actual villain of the story.The Riddler is by far my favorite supervillain and really, every second he spent on the screen was pure pleasure. I would've tolerated him being used as a ""tiny villain"" who is put in Arkham and then ignored for the rest of the story. But turns out he is, despite being presented as a genious, somehow manipulated and killed by the true big bad... The Joker. Yet again. Yaaaay.Even worse, it looks like Harley Quinn, Bane, Mr Freeze and Selina will all be showing up in the remaining four chapters. The Joker has already been established as the big bad of this story so there will certainly be not enough time to develop the rest of the villains into interesting characters. They may have potential like the Riddler, but I doubt there will be enough development for them to be satisfying characters.The first episode introduces us a lot of new characters already as it is, which only makes me more worried about this season being overcrowded and most characters remaining hollow. The two agenst in the first episode, for example, are relatively meaningless by the time one of them is killed off depending on your choices. There isn't enough to the characters to care about their death.Lucius' death early on was impactful, but since the Riddler is killed in the blink of an eye it also renders him killing Lucius rather pointless. We can not have a satisfying storyline here, since there will never be ""justice"" concerning Lucius' death. And why make Riddler such a personal villain in the first place if it actually doesn't mean much for the story?I don't know. The first episode is already too crowded with different characters, there is more death than in the first season combined, my favorite character's role appears to be rather meaningless and I am not interested in facing off with the Joker again. I know it was to be expected that he'd show up, but I expected that we'd be given a variety of different villains like in the first season. This time everyone seems to be somehow just an extension of the Joker."
,Not Recommended,675260,34521709,Posted: 26 August,all,zedaxis,"I cannot currently recommend this game, as a streamer, the bugs in this game make it unplayable beyond an hour before a bug crashes the game, and affects XSplit. In fact, Xsplit works fine until the game crashes. The controls, also, need more work, too. Especially in the water tower puzzle trying to get to the safe, the game stutters, and makes solving it virtually impossible. A game that looks good, is not good until those details are addressed."

I don't know the situation in other languages, but the Chinese in Telltale's games is just unbelievable (both in Simplified and Traditional)."

The graphics are probably the best out of all telltale games and the port seems much better.

,Recommended,675260,34284813,Posted: 16 August,all,[52ndNY]DavidXlongshot,"Batman: TEW Review (In Progress)First of all, I wanted to say that I have indeed played the original Batman TTG game and I enjoyed it and thought it was a good Batman story but I knew deep down it could of been better. And by god does season blow season 1 out of the water!Episode 1:Gameplay: To sum it up, it really does play like a TellTale game with quick time events. So if you're expecting anything NEW then you come to the wrong game. However TellTale HAS done some new ideas with more keys to press and mouse things to do.But really nothing much has changed.Audio: I will always say that TellTale does amazing audio work and this game is no exception! They completely understand the tone of a Batman experience. It's dark, moody and dramatic. The use of sound effects is always on point and the voice acting is incredible. My favourite has to Alfred's because of his geniuness and witts.Graphics: Remember the last one? Poor optimisation which lead to a poor looking experience? Fear not! TT has actually put the time and effort into improving! The game finally correctly runs based on your settings. I can clearly tell that the animations are much, much better! The movement of the characters feel more natural and the facial animation is better in my opinion. It brings thing into life more.PC port: When I first started playing episode 1, I realised something. The game was running MUCH BETTER! It LOOKED BETTER! My PC is pretty decent expect for my old FM2 but the last season wasn't developed enough to have a good optimisation for you PC. However TellTale has corrected their mistakes and fixed most things! I saw a few slow downs but MUCH LESS. This is a massive improvement!Story: Welcome back to Gotham! Or your first time? That doesn't matter, not really in a sense. If you're a new player, the good news is you don't HAVE to play the first game in order to understand. But playing it and making your choices will be much better for how YOUR story goes in your head. You can make choices at the start of the game.For returning players, welcome back to Gotham once again, however, if you thought the last visit was brutal or not even close. You've come to a much darker and more brutal story than the last. The game right off the bat (no pun intended) presents Season 2 is more serious by gruesome scenes and heart pounding choices.Without spoiling, I personally believe this story in Season 2 is much better than the first because a greater focus on the plot. The writers knew what the game is from start to finish and writing brilliant characters that make this game a TellTale game. What I personally liked is a small change in how things could be done, for example.The Original had you visit a man as either Bruce Wayne or Batman, but in this version, you could go see 2 different people but they have Bruce for Woman 1 and Batman for Woman 2. It's not a BIG thing but I loved to see something different.Overall, I personally enjoyed this episode more so than Season 1 of the original TTG Batman. Yes, it's that much better. Highly recommend!"

They don't really look awkward anymore and fast paced action scenes no longer pause or stutter.As for some mechanical differences, you can actually have an affect on your relationships with others. The action scenes are also better in that you actually feel pretty badass, and instead of planning choices before hand when taking out a room of foes, you choose in the moment.The story is definitely a lot more interesting and doesn't have as many boring elements to it and characters are better developed.Overall I'm really excited to see where this game is going, which is not something I could say about the first game only one episode in."
