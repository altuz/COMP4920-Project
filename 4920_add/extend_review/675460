,Not Recommended,675460,33863421,Posted: 28 July,all,ppleater,I bought this just to leave a negative review.
,Not Recommended,675460,33863961,Posted: 28 July,all,ThatOneEnder,"I refuse.I refuse to care anymore.I got 700 achievements in 12 minutes. That's...insane. This is just pure garbage. You can lirteally just start the game and move right and then go to different tab and then eventually you get everything. The trailer shows giltches, the camera doesn't move when its supposed to for the one cutscene (even though the trailer says otherewise...) and just so much in this is just...broken. Don't buy this game. If you do though, only buy it for ironic purposes and then get a refund. Probably the crazist part about this is that there is a BUNDLE of horrible games, and if you play them all long enough you get a insane 22 achievements. Which means you can lirteally buy a bunch of jpeg images. Again, don't buy this, and stay away from this game.Also, shoutouts to Jim Sterning."

,Not Recommended,675460,33937815,Posted: 31 July,all,Blade,This game is garbage. It's not even a game. You load up the title screen and achievements start popping. Valve should stop these achievement spam games.

(AFK)","Steam allowed this to exist.Im not even mad at the dev, im mad that greenlights removal meant nothing. This exists, this is a title we can own.I cant think of a single positive thing to say. We did it though, as a community, we taught people it is ok to release these poor quality and in most cases non-interactive titles.Bought simply for the handout achievements, like the many before it."
,Not Recommended,675460,33998579,Posted: 3 August,all,Rattlesnake8,Would have been better if there was an actual game attached to this achievement spam. The terrible sound will make you want to idle the game for achievements instead of trying to play it.

,Not Recommended,675460,34130235,Posted: 9 August,all,Orge Lambart,"What can you say about this *ahem* game,, the first thing is it's not a game at all, just a way to add 5000+ achievements to your profile..   I suppose I'm part of the problem because I bought this game.. and idled it long enough to get all 5000+ achievements...The achievements tend to be broken or require extensive work to actually get all of them to unlock..  The slew of achievement hunting games on steam lately is kind of sad, it wouldn't be so bad if these games were atleast games with the gimmick of having lots of achievements added,,, they aren't..This is a poorly thrown together shooter, which has no real reason to exist.. other than to give steam enough meat (I guess) to actually view this as a game and not a scam..Buy it for 5000 achievements, then delete it.. If an achievement unlocks itself without any work from the end user is it really an achievement..  meh... who knows.."

,Not Recommended,675460,34548847,Posted: 28 August,all,Crowley,It just doesn't feel right getting all of the Achievements just by letting the game run in the Background...I'd honestly rather do at least something to get them.

,Not Recommended,675460,34943092,Posted: 13 September,all,Intelligence,"Why do I buy these? :/I'm disappointed in even myself but at least I can share with people my experience with each and everyone of these games. Those games being:Achievement Hunter: BeginsAchievement Hunter: CromulentAchievement Hunter: DarknessAchievement Hunter: Darkness 2Achievement Hunter: OverdoseAchievement Hunter: PharaohAchievement Hunter: Spinner EditionAchievement Hunter: WizardZen vs Zombie (Achievment Hunter)As well as at the time of writing this, the following upcoming games will no doubt be the same:Achievement Hunter: DoggerAchievement Hunter: FoxyAchievement Hunter: KilborgAchievement Hunter: OffensiveAchievement Hunter: Urban 2These games are all the same, with the exceptions perhaps being Spinner Edition and Zen vs Zombie. But alas, the rest are pretty much identical aside from the way they're skinned, a mindless barrage of crap flying towards you while you try and shoot at them with your supplied weapon of defence at snail pace. They're pretty much impossible to play because no effort at all has been put into them, they're without a doubt an asset pack that's just being used over and over again.Now given the name of these games, you're probably not interested in playing the actual game. You just want the 5000+ achievements in each one of these games right? Well enjoy gaining around 99% of them each time because their always seems to be atleast 1 or 2 broken achievements in which the developer just refuses to fix, therefore you'll never achieve a perfect game.I'm beginning to wonder if ""putilin_industries"" is in fact another one of Zonitron Productions/Silicon Echo's sock puppet accounts. Do we really need this trash on Steam? Steam Direct is a total failure, I've yet to see an actual decent game come through the system due to endless supply of garbage being thrown up. Oh, how I miss Greenlight.TL/DR: Don't buy this crap. I mean fair play if you want easy achievements but the more people buy these poor excuses for games. The longer it'll take for Valve to take action against it and hopefully scrap Steam Direct. Report these games and buy something decent with your hard earned cash. Besides, what does having 100K+ worthless achievements actually achieve? Nothing."

Go look at their profile, and look up this game in particular. See anything? They 100% the game. If they were so upset about this obvious achievement spam game, why 100% it? Hmm? You and I both know why, they want the achievements, but at the same time they want to give the impression that they are taking the moral high ground by leaving a negative review for this evil, evil game. HA!For me, I don't care if achievement spam games are on Steam. I get an achievement pad and a 100% Game Completion pad. Doesn't bother me. Hell, I'm telling you straight to your face without being a hypocrite.Want a simple 100% Game Completion pad? Buy this.Want to pad your achievement count with ease? Buy this."
,Not Recommended,675460,34387491,Posted: 20 August,all,TitanSmash,Poorly put together achievement spam game. Unlike 2 or the 4 games so far from this series. This game gets achievements with the game being in the background.

Just mute your headset or speakers and go do something else for a while. I don't regret getting the game since it was practically a steal at $0.59.

Its not subtle either like other games (@Zup1,2,3,4,5,0) Instead with this game theres even a ""game mode"" on the title screen which allows you to do nothing while being spammed with achievements. Then again I have to assume anyone playing this is basically looking for that. ( as was I) However I did expect something to do."
