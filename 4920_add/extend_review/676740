There are two maps, both have terrain yet i fall through the world constantly because you ride on a flat plain regardless of the worlds. I am stunned that this made it onto steam. the total 9 achievements available in the game are earned as soon as you load into a level and you dont even spin the fidget spinner... the one thing this simulator had to do was simulate fidget spinning and im very very very disappointed that it is stuck to your hand by horrifiic textures.

76561198019205444,Not Recommended,676740,34328326,Posted: 18 August,all,sitebender,"Fidget Spinner is a first person experience for lack of a better word that has you hovering on a hover board and tumbling downhill all while holding onto your trusty fidget spinner and some sort of aerosol spray can. I gave this a fair try and expected the worst so the game could wow and dazzle me with anything over my expectations.To summarize what's in Fidget Spinner Simulator, it consists of two play areas. There is a tranquil landscape of grass and luscious fauna and a second area with what appears to be a generic racetrack hovering and spiraling above water. There is a third area in multiplayer that seems to located atop a dam.  To the game's credit, the green hill zone is well done to a questionable degree. Great grass, trees plopped down with soothing music in the background. Its a place I want to be. A few trees hover here and there, plus when you go into water the water disappears. With that said the hills run out and the terrain drops into the water, but with invisible walls surrounding the island, you'll never fall off. The other area is devoid of life since its a metal track. I assume you can have the thrill of racing in one of the most mundane and vacant places I've seen since looking into the developer's eyes.As you can tell from the trailer there is no animation here in Fidget Spinner Simulator. You know what you're getting into and you can make your own choices to buy this.One thing that the trailer fails to show is how easy it is to fall over and end up on your back in the hilly green area. Hover boards were never made to go uphill like that. So you flop over. On screen at all times is the fact that you can press R to reset. Yeah, but the problem with that is resetting the board on an area that made you flop over, will make you fall again. When you're on your back or your face, you can still move backward as if hovering into the air before gravity kicks in and you plop back down. If you like laughing at things like that, this game might be for you.You're forced to use WSAD like a lot of games, but in most games A & D strafe you left and right, but here in Fidget Spinner Simulator, A & D rotate you like a tank as if this is 1994 PC gaming. The mouse controls where you look, but movement is independent. It would be better if the mouse cursor went away until you call up the menu. Oh but what key controls the fidget spinner you may ask? I almost forgot what I was playing as the fidget spinner ends up forgotten as it will be in six months. The space bar controls the lackluster spinner. In a game devoid of animation... it spins as if it were a pinwheel stapled to your hand. Its sad that ""R to reset"" has to be on screen at all times while you're never told how to fidget your spinner.As for the other thing the character is playing I have no idea what it is. Some sort of lighter fluid escaping into the air. An aerosol spray that escapes up rather than forward like a bug bomb would? The character could be huffing and this is his magical place to spin fidgets and float on a hover board across hills.With multiplayer, the lobby system seems to be out of place for the look and style of this game. Its clean, looks good, but at the time when I tried there were no servers opened. Could I be too late and I missed the fidget spinner trend. It did let me play a multiplayer game alone to get the achievement and well control two characters at once.There are achievements and the majority of them get unlocked the instant you start Fidget Spinner Simulator. The others I had no interest to unlock or ""achieve."" The other achievements are play for 3,000 hours or at least have it open for that amount of time. Is it worth your time to spend more time in game than the developer spent making the game? One of the achievements can only be unlocked if you purchase the $50 DLC. While everything goes on sale, $50 is a bit much.Something else to take note of is the fact that somehow, some way the game's file size is 666 MB. This is a fact and that alone for this particular game is a spectacular coincidence. As if it was either dumb luck or effort got put into the game to make it 666 MB.In the end, its up to you to decide if Fidget Spinner Simulator is a joke, a dull and empty game or is it something different?"

After starting an leaving it idle I needed to refresh the page and my text was gone. The game is not worth writing my review again, but I still want it to have one more negative review.Honestly not even the dev will care since he has to know that his product is not what you think of when you her the word 'game'.Don`t play it for the cheevos, one forces you to play 3k hours, one forces you to buy the DLC that isn´t even out. It´s just scam to add achievements like this after release."
76561198043948445,Not Recommended,676740,33917087,Posted: 30 July,all,Esculd,"The very first moments in this game were quite confusing. With the mouse sensitivity so intense that turning around would start to hurt my own neck as well, I ventured onward my greatest journey yet. On a hoverboard mind you,The controls are quite simple, W to instantly accelerate forward, S to back down from the mindblowing experience you had by pressing W, A and D to perform some sickass tricks on the hoverboard like never before.Let us not forget about the space bar, which upon pressing will make you question your very existence and the actions you've commited so far in your life that made you buy this game.The gameplay may wary for others, but here it is how it went for me: It all started with me being confused as a newborn that just saw the light of the day for the very first time. The static model of your character, the blur and the lens flare effects were absolutely mesmerizing. But even with all that going on I found the courage to proceed forward.Well, that is until I fell of the map shortly after and realized that the longer you fall, the more your character starts to relinquish from it's mortality and starts to ascend to godhood.Needless to say, the following moments included me throwing up and crying in the bathroom for 2 hours straight.Do I recommend it? Sure, if you want to willingly leave a permanent scar on your soul."

The dev has a history of being terrible at making games and often making trash to then never fix. This is a cash-out meme game that came out too late.

,Not Recommended,676740,33929813,Posted: 31 July,all,Sanji Himura,"The following is a 1080 Review of Fidget Spinner Simulator.First our Tale of the Tape:Title: Fidget Spinner SimuatorDeveloper: RedSquare StudiosGenre: Adventure, Indie, SimulationPrice: $.99Copy Purchased.Review comes after 11 minutes of gameplayLet's cut to the chase.  As another reviewer pointed out, this game is developed by known asset flipper Berdyev, who has gone under a host of different development and publisher names including bcInteractive and Dissident Interactive.  He has also worked with Elusive Team on three other games.Berdyev is also known to censor critique by way of deleting comments, hence why I am likely to eat a ban after publication of this review, knowing that he can't straight up delete it without the help of Valve.As for the game itself, the game exhibits its usual low quality affair, with your character in a fixed position on a electric scooter thing trying to ride around two maps.The first map, a forest themed map, is very small if you decide to stay inbounds.  The map allows you to go under the map at a fixed elevation at one area of the map.The other map that is provided is supposed to be a race track themed map, but if you go any further from the starting line (I think that the distance is random), then clones of the player character will come after you.  If one hits you, then kiss your♥♥♥♥♥goodbye on staying on the map.Overall, this game encourages and tests your limits as to how far you may want to push that refund button.  This obviously broken game isn't worth your time or money, even if it is $.99.Videos:Gameplay with no sound:https://youtu.be/U-mUXbP32j0The 1080 Review on Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqWoKR9uk_Q"

This is helped via the fidget spinner (helping you stay focused on the objective), the vape which stimulates the creativity within the mind and finally the hoverboard, with the hoverboard the person is able to move in a pace that is unexpected and is beyond human capability. With all of this in mind, this game has a wonderfull story-mode which promotes a sequal coming out soon and/or a possible trilogy in this wonderfull game. Another aspect that give this game a boost is how it is pro-feminist. Overall I give this game an 11/10 and I am looking forward to what the developer is willing to take further and I for sure will preorder the ultimate edition to support this wonderfull company."

There is so much more depth to this game than what people are making it out to be. There is an entire forest level that has so much exploration to it that it rivals The Witcher 3. But the dev didn't just stop there. There is also an entire racing track for you to try out! Old men will race after you on their hoverboards, making it honestly better than every single Need for Speed game. The ""dank mod"" your character will be vaping is honestly a little weak, and I would much rather have it be a juul, but that can be looked past. The fidget spinner itself has some of the most realistic motion physics, and model designing, I'm suprised this isn't coming from a AAA developer. Countless hours can be put into this game, and I may have to start skipping classes and work just so I can fidget some more. And all of this for only $1??!

,Recommended,676740,34207291,Posted: 12 August,all,bang,"Fidget Spinner Simulator places you in the eyes of a swagged out hipster who rides the gnarliest hoverboard and spins the thiccest fidget spinner. The second the game is loaded up you see a dialog box to customize your settings, so this game excels in customizations. After about a minute of curating the settings to your liking, the game loads up with a lovely UI and a beautiful menu. Most of the menu items don't work, but that doesn't matter because the second you load up the game you never want to leave (you also can't because the leave game button doesn't actually work). The second you plop in on a hoverboard you can either spin your fidget or start rolling towards the end game on the segway. The approximate speed of the segway is between 0 MPH to 9000 MPH, but there is no official confirmation. The graphics are beautiful and physics are flawless. I can't find one flaw about this game, as it is perfect. Multiplayer is fun, single player is even better. I can't recommend the game enough. In fact, I bought it for two friends!The bottom line:If you are a fan of fun and good times, this game is for you. It will leave you with vertigo but will also make you realize that this game is game of the year worthy. The achievements are simple to earn, and the game itself provides an open world experience with great graphics.Overall, 5/7."

,Recommended,676740,34067890,Posted: 6 August,all,retarded_robot,"The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about gangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his ""innocence"" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends."

Also this is the only game that comes close to Keemstars Fidget Spinner game on the playstore.The GoodGraphics: 9.5/10 i can count the polygons.Soundtrack: 8.5/10 includes about 2 amazing tracks for you to rock out to while spinning your fidget spinner.Achievements: 10/10 lots of fun, challenging and satisfying achievements to get.GamePlay: 10/10 lots to do, from things like multiplayer and racing.MoreInfo: Talking about multiplayer this is a great game to play with your girlfriend on a first date. After me and my girlfriend finished playing it i put my hand down her pants and it felt like i was feeding a horse.The BadCustomization: No customization what so ever. Going into this game i thought i could get a triple ended dild0 fidget spinner but that was not the case. Im hoping something like this would come in a later update.No Steam Cards: I was looking forward to having fidget spinner backgrounds and E-motesFinal Thoughts: This game definitely has the potential of being the best of the year. If you had any doubts of getting it please don't. Final verdict 9/10 would spin my c00ck again.Update #1: Player models are great and have hitboxes that work better than CS:GO"

I know that this game is supposed to be for fun and, how the cool kids would say ""for the lols""  but me, as a hardcore gamer am not really impressed by this. If you work up the graphics so that it can compete with other populat games on the market right now, add VR, animate the MC boddy, add flares, day and nighttime, would be nice. The multiplayer could have more interaction such as Voicechat and the ability to spinn each others spinner.

When he became a adult his bad luck followed him. He lost his kids, his wife left him, and he's the most hated person in the city. To run away from depression he bought a fidget spinner from a local thrift store and ordered a used hoverboard and he went to the forest. He then got on his board and when he began going forward. He was free. He began to continue. He could feel the breeze of the wind and could see the face of god. He then started spinning his spinner. He didn't care what was happening.

One day I decided that I was going to end it all. I had went through enough. However, as I opened up steam for the last time, I noticed a new game had recently come out. At that point I didn't care about my money, so I  thought ""why not give it a try, after all, I'm not going to be around for much longer."" When the game downloaded in 0.01 seconds, I was ever so excited to try it out. I pressed the play button and was greeted with a stunning main menu screen. With no avail, i hopped in game as quick as possible. ""Yes"", I said, as I realized that this had been the best decision that I was ever to make. It was glorious, even perfect. My jaw dropped instantly. Tears poured from within my eyes. I couldn't stop crying from the shear amount of beauty that was being displayed in front of my very eyes. I kept playing. I never wanted to stop. As the end of the day drew closer and closer, I sat and pondered. The dread had seemed to stop flowing. Joy had entered and replaced it. I'm so greatful I chose to buy this game. It had guided me toward the right direction and brought my life hope, meaning, and prosperity. It had saved me from an inevitable doom. This game had saved me. This game made me want to live. I'm sure it will do the same for you. #SpinningSavesLives"

I fought back in the Gulf War and I saw some pretty messed up stuff that I will never forget, but the second I stepped in and saw that purple hoverboard and purple spinner, it was all gone. It's as if I never fought in the Gulf War. I can now finally go see the 4th of July fireworks with my friends instead of hiding in my basement crying. I no longer get bloodlust when I see an Iraqi. It's almost as if I didn't see my best friend die right infront of my eyes because some sandperson thought it'd help his cause if he shot him. Everything gone, I am free.There's been a couple of great moments in my life, like my 9th child being born but this tops that. This is above my 9th child, this is above my wedding day, this is above the day my mother in law died. With this game, there is no need to play any other games. It's a piece of art, a masterpiece.

Not having too much hope for it, I decided to explore the vast landscape of the beautiful forest. I fell in love with mother nature as I traversed deeper and deeper into her heaven. It felt like it was real; it felt like I was there! I could smell the scent of the flowers seeping through the pixels of my screen. I could feel the rays of the sun scalding my skin. I could touch the sharp blades of the grass that lie beneath me. I was enjoying my time with a fidget spinner in my hand. I felt like I was having a lovely conversation with her, but then, all of a sudden... there was nothing but black.I woke up to find myself lying down, and staring into emptiness--staring into space. My color receptors registered nothing but a tinge of azure. I stood up, only to find myself standing alongside a group of people, and I was startled by the fact that they looked exactly like me. I felt confused for the first time in my life. ""Where am I?"" I asked my self. ""WHERE AM I?!"" I raged at the others. I was met with the response of silence. I proceeded to look around, as there was no hope in asking the dopplegangers that surround me. It looked like... No, it was a race track; A race track in the sky! I realized that this was a race, but there was no one there to tell us when to start, so I decided to win it.I tilted my whole body forward, and my hoverboard compensated for that by propelling me in the same direction. Suddenly, the silent group around me started moving forward toward the finish line. I was so determined on winning, but this determination soon became the end of me. I slipped and fell out of the race track. Fear filled my body as it plunged into a freefall towards what seemed to be the endlessness of the ether.There was nothing to see, and nothing to expect, as I've been falling ever since. There was no drag to counter my increase in speed, and so, it kept on increasing and increasing until I felt like I was ripping through the space-time continuum. I had nothing by my side but my companion: the fidget spinner. I felt a surge of hope as I thought to myself, ""Maybe this was my destiny. Maybe I was meant to fall for eternity. After all, there's a reason for everything."" As my speed increased, as I ripped through the space-time continuum, I felt hopeless but powerful at the same time. It is only a matter of time before I become omnipotent; before I become... god.This game was ok."

It's nothing more than a fast way to collect some achievements & a pretty buggy experience. When you try to walk uphill you'll end inside or below the map. Fortunately you can turn around & move on safe ground again which won't rise the joy of walking around & just starring at your spinner that much. But there is this single point why I like this piece of crap: that medieval-like music in the forest level. It's kinda enjoyable.I'll give it thumbs up just for the enjoyable score but be warned, that this isn't actually some kind of a game. It's bugged & the developer didn't put much work into it.  It's more than obvious that the dev just wants to make a fast coin with this. Even for a discounted prizing you might feel robbed."

,Recommended,676740,33935793,Posted: 31 July,all,MaxKing100,"+ Graphics are nice- Achievements are extremely easy (I got all of them when I joined the world lmao)- You can't actually go somewhere, you stay in 1 circle+ If you don't have a fidget spinner, maybe play this game (if you like spinners)+ Game is cheap. If it was like $3 I wouldn't buy even if the game got better+ You can have a little race with your fidget spinner!Rating - 8/10"
