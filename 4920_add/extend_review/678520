,Recommended,678520,34136679,Posted: 9 August,all,SilentCaay,"If you played GGDP and the thought of playing it in VR blew your mind, you probably smashed the ""Purchase"" button as soon as you saw this game and are just reading reviews while it installs and you probably won't be too disappointed in the purchase...For the more discerning consumer, though, this is *barebones* compared to GGDP. No story, no sisters, no Doki-Doki Mode, no angels, no devils (aside from the mini-demons that afflict girls), no Doki-Doki Mode, no collectible profiles, no Angel Eye Drops, no store, no sidequests, no Doki-Doki Mode...It honestly feels like an Early Access game but it's not marked as one. Like, why is the love gun not modeled at all? It's just a semi-transparent handle. The demon sucker gun is modeled so why isn't the love gun? Second, not having a full story is one thing but the game doesn't even offer a cursory introduction to what's going on so if you didn't play a previous Gal*Gun game, you're going to be confused. It's also weird how aiming is primarily controlled by the motion controller but it's also slightly influenced by the direction you're looking with the headset. In the shooting segments, that's fine, but it's awkward in the menusOverall, if you're a Gal*Gun fan itching to meet the girls in VR, it's probably worth it. If you haven't played any Gal*Gun games, though, I would recommend playing GGDP before playing this one. I really hope they go on to develop a much more polished and feature-complete sequel."

,Recommended,678520,34138735,Posted: 9 August,all,Dr. Blue,"The concept just works a lot better here in VR than in the original game.The original Gal*Gun was a controller based rail-shooter game with no option to switch to mouse and keyboard. And it played like one. This VR version fixes the controller issues by being a VR game where you can point and shoot in six degrees of freedom, and gives a reason for being on a rail as you move forward from a series of room scale environments. Unlike the original, I beat the game and am fairly happy with the gameplay, and will probably try a few of the score challenge achievements.One of the reviews calls this a VR horror experience, and mechanically, they're right. You are being swarmed from all sides with entities that you have to shoot who charge right at you. You will get swarmed by multiple girls during some of the encounters which leads to frantic 'omg omg flail shoot shoot' moments, even though thematically, they're professing that they like you. The arena design is nice and diverse; there's not just different configurations of hallways and various open areas, but non-conventional ones like being on a ledge behind a stairwell where you have to worry primarily about what's above and below you.If this game is for you, you should buy it.That said, it's not flawless. The menu system should be thrown out and redone from scratch. (Why would you ever make the grip button the 'activate menu item' button while making the trigger button the 'cancel back one level' button? I almost abandoned the game, thinking it shipped broken.) The game will drop back to the empty Steam circle loading area for long periods of time between levels. There's problems clipping with objects in the world. In the 'Call' section of the game, where you can invite a girl to your room, the girl isn't placed inside the play area. There are no Steam Trading Cards. Gal*Gun VR feels like it needs a whole lot of polish but this shouldn't deter you from buying it because it's a glimpse into our waifu future."

I'm on the second stage and I figured there would only be 2.And the stages so far are pretty good nicely modelled, you progress through them to different checkpoints.They really nailed anime look and feel.  nice animations and you actually feel  a little bit like a celebrity :)you can crank up the ingame graphics and make it look super sharp.Too bad there doesn't seem to be a story mode.I'll definitely be playing it though to the end to see what the other stages look like."

In Gal*Gun VR, you play as a young man who suddenly became the most popular guy around, and you must fend off a rush of girls with your trusty Pheromone Shot by giving them euphoria!It is fun, isn't it? I mean, it's not the most amazing shooter in that it only really offers the basics, nor does it do anything really new outside of its wacky  presentation, but at no point did it feel like a chore.After hearing all of the hubbub about it I expected something really strange but instead got a VRl shooter that's just silly.The school may be kind of basic in design and decor, but you're right about the girls. They feature way more detail than I would have expected. Their eyes are really expressive. I also love the little details like the cellphone chatter between chapters or when you zoom in on a girl and her clothes turn lightly translucent giving you a glimpse of her underwear. It all adds to what is a charming, breezy, and silly VR shooter that honestly wasn't a whole lot of fun. At least, it wasn't on beginner.Conclusion:Enjoyable game, eventhough short. This game is what I need to play after going back from school. Replaying is so much fun. it is much more enjoyable on HTC vive VR headset than using the controller. Mght as well get this game when there is a deep discount and for my first playthrough, i have finish the game around 1+hour 8 stage total."

Shooting controls work well and are easy to come to grips with and the game is simple on the surface but mastering the levels and getting the best score requires skill and clever aim.Not worth getting a VR headset for and even if you own one, the price is a little bit high considering the amount of content, but there are definitely worse ways to spend your money.Full video review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj5zVY6g26g"
,Recommended,678520,34140947,Posted: 10 August,all,arnoldstrife,"This is pretty hilarious. It's a fairly scaled down version from the non-VR version it seems, but it's pretty funny and the anime theme is spot on. With the ""Lovestruck"" mechanics it adds a bit of extra ""Skill"" to keep it from being a boring wave shooter. There's also a ""path"" you go through so theres that too.Pros:*Adds a few extra mechanics to keep it from being just a wave shooter*Forward progression in a map.*Super clean Anime Look. Also runs really smooth in general*The ""motions"" and ""animation"" is very fluid and in general better than some of the other low budget VR games.Cons:*Wierd menu controls (fine in the actual game) The trigger is back and the grip is select for some reason.*More basic version of the non-vr game (to be fair it is also cheaper than the non-vr version)*Game is now listed in your Steam Library for all (you choose) to see.Whelp now that this is out I just need a Senran Kagura VR with a floating camera and a Super Sonico VR and thus all the important goals of VR have been achieved."

I bought it and played for 9 hours straight with my friend. Waifus will be claimed, euphoria will be given, and erections will occur. Trust me, if you're going to and from buying this gaming (like I was for about a month) do it. If you want to live the reality of having a harem of anime waifus, then this is it for you. And as for the developers, this game is very pollished. I was expecting a bit of a low quality anime game with a few levels and little depth, but I was surprised. The textures are BEAUTIFUL the environment and character models are impeccable, I was incredibly impressed with the resolution of the character models; even at a few inches away, they really look like they're there. Not to mention the voice acting, AI, secrets, camera functionality (*cough* panty shots *cough*), everyting is just... Well done. Give yourself a pat on the back, Inti, you have made a man very, very happy. P.S. Expand the game please; I would 100% pay for more levels, girls, or game mechanics."

It takes about 1.5 hours to complete on a single run (There are multiple routes in the game in different levels). There isn't really a story to this game, but there is enough content in the game to make you come back for more. There are various secrets, girls, panties, and more in the game. You can call girls to your classroom or YOUR room :^). There are some parts of the game when you're near the ground though that clips out and make every go blank until you come back up, which wastes a little bit of time, but it's more annoying than anything else. Other than that, it's a solid fun game that you (or your weeb friends) can play mutiple times and compare scores on the leaderboards in the game. 9/10 - Because of some technical issues near the ground like I mentioned before and some really difficult panty shots of the same calibur.

,Recommended,678520,34197655,Posted: 12 August,all,Seradhe,"Let's be honest, we all know why you bought this game: because even with a VR rig, it's a lot cheaper than GGDP with all the DLC.I'm surprised at how intuitive the controls are. Easily the first Arcade style shooter I've played where there wasn't a steep learning curve for aiming. After a few minutes I was a pro at balancing the gun and the vacuum. By and far the best way to play Gal Gun is in VR.Content-wise, it's about what you expect from VR gaming right now. More Tech demo than content. Though if it keeps this polished I would love to see future updates adding more gameplay for the cost."

,Not Recommended,678520,35162962,Posted: 23 September,all,Shadow,"Edited Review on 9/27/17https://youtu.be/EuAKzn1T-lMWelcome to your very own ecchi harem anime!Gal Gun VR does an amazing job of putting you inside an anime. I loved the look and feel of the environments and the characters. The voices were great.The novelty of being an unrestrained pervert was amusing but lets be honest, that's just a novelty. If we really wanted to get perverted in VR there are better outlets... Not that I have any first hand experience mind you... Seriously. Stop looking at me like that...Once you get past the ""Oooh, pretty"" and the ""lol, wtf Japan"" you're pretty much left with a wave shooter. There really isn't any deeper gameplay mechanic to the game that I could find. Shoot the demons, shoot the girls, wash rinse repeat and move to the next position.Couple that with the headache the game was to get started... The game would launch but nothing would show up. I'd see the game try to launch in the HMD. The loading screen would be visible for about 30 seconds and then it would boot me to a blank white, generic Vive environment with no information as to what happened.Oh, and the game would still be running so to fix the issue I had to close and reopen Steam...The ultimate resolution was to put the .exe into compatibility mode for windows 7 (not sure if this is required or not) and to disable my antivirus.A $30 game shouldn't require you to turn your antivirus software off to run. This above all really hurts the games score for me. The first 2 hours of this game were nothing but failure to start, googling, getting nothing and trying random things. Several times I threw my hands up and said screw it, the games not worth it...It's cute. It's funny. It's just not worth $30 for a wave shooter on top of the setup issues.If you're a big ecchi anime buff it may be worth it. If not, you'll probably want to pass on this one."

,Recommended,678520,34766992,Posted: 5 September,all,pH. Jin_D3vil,"This is one of the best FPS VR experiences you can buy as far as I am concerned. It's got tons of plot and depth as far as the eye can see. The future it now!!Jokes aside the game is a lot of fun in VR, the HTC Vive (what I played it on)  makes it so easy to play and gives a really surreal Anime world experiance. It's a little jarring to be inside a classroom and feeling like you could sit at a chair and interact like it's all physical. The games simple to play and really enjoyable shooting game that will really suit anime fans that don't mind a little ecchi promiscuity. It is all in an amusing vain 'game experiance' and has a lot of charm to it that I bet a lot of people will enjoy in VR especially.The game however makes me wish there was other VR games where you could interact with your favourite anime cast and visit some of the locales. Be awesome to walk around Tokyo from Durarara and watching the scenes unfold live in front of you. This is a great first step into seeing the Anime world like never before."
,Recommended,678520,34140057,Posted: 9 August,all,STARPAUSE,I wish there was a config option to shoot out the front of your controllers rather than the bottom... I realized you're supposed to be holding it like a gun handle but feels awkward... maybe even more awkward than the premise. The menu system buttons are a mess but it's worth figuring out so you can call the girls you've encountered. I hope there's routes there? I'm new to the series. Amazing that a game like this got localized and it's way less menu to figure out than any other Japanese game I've played so infinite out of finite stars!
76561198089908810,Recommended,678520,34245091,Posted: 14 August,all,Menendez,"I bought this game because I have Gal*Gun Double Peace, or GGDP as some other people refer to it,  for PS4 and thought this would be fun. I was right. Its a fun and unique VR shooter that translates the fun of GGDP to VR, but Gal*Gun VR does lack an overarching story like GGDP, and doki-doki mode which some people are upset about. I think it was worth the money since I have and like GGDP; however, if you have not tried GGDP I would  hesitate on buying this since it is a bit pricey unless you like the franchise because it is kind of short but does have a lot of replayability in my opinion. Hopefully the devs make an update or ten to give it a full story and/or add more levels. (HINT HINT DEVS PLEASE I'M BEGGING YOU!) or create a whole new VR game with a full story and multiple routes like GGDP. Overall, I think it's a fun, guilty-pleasure, shooter  that could use some more content but doesn't feel like letdown of the Gal*Gun franchise."
,Recommended,678520,34741719,Posted: 4 September,all,Pantsu Hunter,"Lets start from negative part of this review. It feels like Inti Creates is getting more lazy with every single GalGun game they release. First one was quite unique, with a lot of nice game mechanics and every boss fight was different. Double Peace was pretty much same game, just new story and was taking place 1 year later so it means that 66% of girls were same as in first game. Boss fights were pretty much joke comparing to first game since all of them looked same no matter what route you choose. And now we come to new VR version. It offers same girls as in 2nd game (without MC's), same maps (different routes on them), no bosses, no doki doki mode and no story at all. There are 2 new game mechanics. Suction gun that is used to suck in mini demons for extra points and changed ""bomb"" system from previous game. this time to turn girl into bomb we need to look in her eyes for few seconds. Sadly suction gun is really boring addition to this game while new bomb mechanic is quite useless since its charging to slow. I don't know if developers simply were greedy and decided to earn some cash at minimal effort or if they though that light novel part might not work in VR. I think it's actually first option since Project Lux already proven that its possible to make good LN game in VR. Last but not least there is possibility to call in any girl, like in previous games where you could go into doki doki mode or simply watch 3D models, In this case there is nothing to do she will just stand and say a few lines, or react to suction gun just like on regular stages.Now lets get to good parts.It's still f**** GalGun. So if you are into anime possy full pedo mode then it's game for you. If this dont convince you, then nothing will.I guess that for people who didn't play previous game all negatives I mentioned wont matter, however long time GalGun players might be a lil bit disappointed just like it was with Double Peace."

Initial thoughts are very good game with an interface thats not intuitive - buttons don't make sense in my opinion. It takes time to work out how to play the game (about 30mins for me) but once you get going the gameplay is a huge amount of fun. I was impressed with the detail of the characters and their reactions. I'd like to see more of these types of games because they are very suited to Virtual Reality. The feeling of presence and being involved enhances the experience. For example, being high up while shooting the girls really enhances the feeling of height. I'd like to see more dialogue while conversing with the girls in the bedroom and classroom.  Some of it is repetitive and plays mildly (dark and light) with the mind. Overall very good."
