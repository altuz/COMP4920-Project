,Not Recommended,680320,34180147,Posted: 11 August,all,Vodoka,"Let's get the positive out of the way first. I like Alice's design, she's pretty cute.Then the usual. Compared to previous SakuraGame releases, the translation is even worse. I can't stress this enough, trying to make out what everything means is painful, as opposed to Dark Elf or Material Girl where it was really badly translated and goofy at points.Also, the localization has actually broken the game. We'll get back to that later.So, what else? Like Dark Elf, you have pretty generic JRPG system, that is easy as ♥♥♥♥. Even if you continiously select basic attack while fighting normal enemies, it is impossible to lose, since they do so little damage, and gaining levels heals you completely, which you do fast enough to negate any damage that you might get. The only challenge seems to be in boss fights, where you either find out the weakness for fast kill, or heal yourself every few turns. It really is easy as ♥♥♥♥, and makes you wonder why there even is combat here.How about porn? Good news is that unlike Dark Elf, you don't need to lose to get sex-scenes here, it seems to be based on player choices in the story. Bad news is that some of them crash the game. I'm not even joking, this is what happened to me during the first sex-scene of the game.https://puu.sh/x7Qb3/1df918a006.jpgAnd really, the whole game is the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but even more annoying to read through compared to previous releases, so I'm not really planning to play any more.If you absolutely need RPG Maker porn, play something else. Even Dark Elf would be better choice, but I strongly advice looking for something else, not released by SakuraGame."

76561198015478750,Not Recommended,680320,34484846,Posted: 25 August,all,Lenonium,"*Ahem*ONEONE1 is known for making good Ero-RPGs.SakuraGame is known for making the worst translations in recorded modern history.When combined, sadly not even the quality of ONEONE1's handicraft can save their own game, because the translation ruins everything. The game works, but the language is so bad that you more often than not have to actually guess what's being said. It's frustrating and takes quite a toll on the player. This is because SakuraGame relies entirely on machine translation, and most likely doesn't even know English language themselves. When a language is directly translated, as machine translation do, it often doesn't make very much sense because idioms and sentence structure isn't the same in different languages. You need human skills and intelligence to make sense of it all, and make it into something that relays the same message.SakuraGame doesn't do that, and ONEONE1 knows, but they still asked them to translate the game instead of someone with actual translation skills. Why? Who knows, maybe ONEONE1 doesn't really care much for gaijins, but still want our money, and SakuraGame works cheap and fast? It's hard to say. No matter, the fact still remains that ""The Heiress"" has language that's so bad that it completely destroys what's good about the game.EDIT: The in-battle H-attacks doesn't work in the Steam version. It's probably broken because of the translation work, and it's still not fixed. This game just might become the first Steam game that makes me ever want to ask for a refund.ONEONE1: Please choose a better translator in the future, or go away from Steam and never come back."

76561198031522420,Recommended,680320,34269872,Posted: 15 August,all,Castiel Angelos,"Buy this if you have a lot of patience with the translation, or if you're decently fluent in reading Japanese with a decent grasp of understanding it when you hear it.The gameplay is less of a goal to get porked, and more of a goal to be ""What if a normal JRPG had consequences where sometimes the enemy takes your hoo-hah if you lose."" So it's more than some internet pronz game, less than a well polished JRPG.The Japanese version makes a LOT more sense. But again, you might not understand it. I do, so I enjoy it.Mechanics-wise the battles are very easy if you fight decently. I've found that I level up even without fighting too much. The combat really isn't the bread and butter of the game.What IS, is the H-System. Each smexy times action that successfully happens to your character builds up a system. If things happen enough times your character developes certain attitude adjustments. She starts off an honorable uptight warrior of justice but if enough things happen to her she developes to enjoy or not enjoy certain things. Not something I was expecting to happen.Unfortunately the English translation is so terrible that I only recommend it if you're willing to skip that, or if you can understand a bit of Japanese."
,Not Recommended,680320,34512844,Posted: 26 August,all,Ishman,"Interesting game from Oneone1, saddled with a machine translation by a lazy Chinese company.I'm conflicted on recommending it because I'd love to see more stuff coming to the west, but no right-minded person should support such an abyssmal effort.Incidentally the game is riddled with bugs due to the machine translation altering much of the triggers from firing due to flipping slashes around in the script files.And no, you can't fix it because Oneone1 encrypt's his scripts.Edit: The people responsible for the 'translation' forgot to reencrypt the script files, so you CAN fix them. Have at it. Extracting the original japanese to more easily effect a real translation would require breaking the encryption on the non-steam release however."
,Not Recommended,680320,34263496,Posted: 15 August,all,SuperFluffyCouchSnake,The game overall has terrible translations and a boring quest system with story that barely passes as interesting. I'd LIKE to say the H-scenes are nice but in truth I just ended up feeling bad for the character and fights are a complete joke in this game. I've never felt so bored in even the most text book of RPG's but this one FINALLY bored me so much I couldn't handle it.

,Recommended,680320,34324677,Posted: 18 August,all,lord999,"Ok, besides the norms for the game, here are a couple of matters that you want to know.1.  To hide this game from other users, the following instructions from IGN are recommended (work safe):http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/you-can-now-hide-embarrassing-games-from-your-steam-libraryHiding games doesn't forbid you from playing them, you can access by clicking in Your Library, then Games, and then at the botton, you will see your filter for hidden games that you can call up in the menu.2.  You should visit the Discussions page and check for the latest patches.  Steam has a policy regarding certain content, and while the game is perfectly fine as sold in the store, there's some value-added content that you may want to install that is obviously posted as a sticky in the Discussions.While the developer probably does not speak English as a native language, he/she is very enthusiastic about support, and seems to have someone translating into the native language for support.As for the game, it fulfills every expectation that you would have for this genre.  The plain game is probably rated R, the extra content puts this game in other territory.I bought this game fair and square, I did NOT receive a promotional copy, I want to see more of these games on Steam in the future.  There is a dark humor to be had with all of these games, and as such, YMMV on the content, but the game is good for the genre."

(plus the game is 40% on sale).I recommend getting it for the free game or if u dont want it, w8 till the translations get fixed.Ah, also there is a nude patch if u search the news or w/e so it is a +1 honor."
,Recommended,680320,35210295,Posted: 25 September,all,Scythia,"It's a mediocre eroge.  One can play almost without any H elements, treating it as a normal rpg.  Grinding has the dual advantage of increasing character power and earning more of the money you need each chapter to avoid a bad route.  If you're looking for H elements, they come online once the character is no longer a virgin, so losing a boss fight will speed that along.As pointed out by other reviews, the translation is very poor.  At times dialogue is comlpetely unclear, and it is nowhere more amusing than during H scenes.  Particularly sound effects.  ""Poof! Poof! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!"" is an actual text panel in some scenes, presumably to represent grunting or other sound effects.  I laughed more than once. On the other hand, surrender all hope of understanding much more than the most basic brushstrokes of the story."
