,Recommended,680980,35461348,Posted: 3 October,all,Napostriouf,"This is a very good game where you play a headliner for a local journal where your decision can make a lot of changes.PRO- The choice to side journalist, propagandist or being balanced- The side family's side story- The graphics that don't try to be too much- Price- The subtleties that can lead to different endingsCON- Musics that we already heard in many games- The overreacting people on a local press (the game should have more step before masses react like this)- The length of a game is too short- As this is a journalistic based game, the game should be multilanguage which is not right now and may hurts its marketability."

,Recommended,680980,35461913,Posted: 3 October,all,◓_◓,"A nice short game about the difficult decisions that go into curating news. In this world of polarized views and everything being a with-or-against tug-of-war, it can be really hard to make the right choices, especially when conflicting aspects need to find balance.My only complaint with it is that the input is a bit unnecessarily keyboard-and-mouse; it would be nice if there were full keyboard access for the game, and it would also be nice if mouse-only play had some amount of pathfinding in the city view."
,Recommended,680980,35460292,Posted: 3 October,all,Gameon5,"Headliner is a timely, quick and enjoyable adventure through the world of controlling the news media and how it effects your life and the lives of those who consume your news.  In the era of social media and claims of fake news this is a prescient take on a topic we're all too familiar with and shows you that it may not be as easy as you think to have so much power over a population that can be swayed by the headlines of the day.  You can play through the game in one sitting but replay value is very high given the different outcomes based on the stories you decide to run."

,Recommended,680980,35463982,Posted: 3 October,all,Sotamakkara,"HEADLINER is an interesting and fresh game where you play as a headliner. Every day you have to approve or reject articles that will go to the press and reach the area. Your choices decide how the game develops. I'll leave you with this, go enjoy this experience, and see what kind of news you would publish!"
76561198142756789,Recommended,680980,35484090,Posted: 4 October,all,brownmarshmallow,"This game definitely made me think about where I stand on certain social issues and how much I value my own integrity over my loved one's well-being. I felt it was very appropriate for the current times. The game itself was engaging and easy to play, and also fairly quick. It also allows for multiple replays, and I'm curious to see how different choices will affect the ending. Highly recommended!"

,Recommended,680980,35459495,Posted: 3 October,all,Nameless Voice,"A simple yet thought-provoking game that is reminiscent of Papers, Please.As a headliner, you have to weigh your choices against different competing goals: try to stay unbiased, or promote one side or the other of an argument to get better ratings?  Approve a story that will benefit your daughter at the cost of being able to run another that will help your spouse?  Share letters and stories that report facts but will incite hatred and violence?  These are all choices that you have to make.Every evening after work, you can walk through the streets of the city and see how the stories you've been publishing are affecting the world around you.  You can overhear people talking about how much they love the news, or find yourself stopped by checkpoints or stepping around crime scenes as violence stirred up by your news escalates.The graphics are simple yet attractive, and the controls feel intuitive and fluid."
,Recommended,680980,35459289,Posted: 3 October,all,Mr.Fishy,"Ran through about one play through in an hour. Was able to get probably one of the best endings from what I could tell. It was fun and brought a lot of interesting topics. Certainly topical to current politics.Fairly honest though, the writing is a bit strange. It's more there for skimming rather than fully investigating. Not a ton of things to dig into a read. For around 3 dollars it's certainly worth the price and your time."
,Recommended,680980,35477683,Posted: 4 October,all,riotsquad,"This is funny as hell, I never go for being bad normally but in this game I'll go ""full speed, t-bone accident, burn everything"" bad...mostly... (I am a bit friendly with my loving husband occassionally...the unmodified can burn in hell though, with our neighbouring country!)It's hard to write a review of this game as it's hard to explain who it is for and why it is for that group since all those would be thinking ""this is exactly how they do it and therefore it's not for me"".If you read the news and believe everything this will show you some truths about how things are.If you read the news and think it's all lies then this is for you to show you some truths about how things are.The reality of everything in news is that it is all biased and a basis of a story will be twisted into something that benefits the side the reporter/magazine/conglomerate is on by either promoting the incident as something ""we've done"" or proclaim as bad due to it being ""something they've done"".News is propaganda, propaganda is what rules the average person and their opinions.This game really captures how media forms public opinion rather than reports the public's opinion."
,Recommended,680980,35480213,Posted: 4 October,all,[E] Karl The Pagan,"If you've never been wrong; if you think you understand the world; if you know how the world works without question... then play this game at least 2 or 3 times.Unbound Creations has a story for you about truth, politics, and media. You may be forced to choose between family loyalties, personal identity, justice, and security.The only lesson to learn here is that we must protect our media. This ""fourth estate"" - a power for truth independent of government, religion, and popular culture - is our only defense against politics that will destroy our humanity.---FTC - I have participated in Unbound Creations promotional activites but have not been compensated for this review."
,Recommended,680980,35487630,Posted: 4 October,all,Ozymil,"Giving the player choice in a narrative game is a tricky thing. Give them too much and they quickly get lost in a sea of text, wondering how much weight their choices really have. Give them too little and they feel like they haven't left any impact on the world. HEADLINER strives for somewhere in the middle and it gets pretty dang close to the mark.Due to the short nature of the game, its story is clear, focused, and predictable. You, as The Headliner, determine what news gets published. There are a few event threads the game follows, from refugees crossing the border to the unrest surrounding a genetically unmodified minority. Naturally, there will be consequences depending on the stories you choose to publish. Riots take place, buildings burn down, and tensions grips the city. You must deal with the outcomes of your decisions and navigate both you and your family safely through the chaos.The best aspect of HEADLINER is the way it implements player choice. You make a myriad of small choices that add up to affect the world that you and your family live in. In a stroke of poetic genius, you as the player create the narrative of someone who creates their own narrative. Your decisions affect the way you and your character experience the world of the game. There are direct choices like choosing which news to publish, but there are more nuanced ones like how you met your spouse. Through a mix of creating the story as well as the world in which it takes place, HEADLINER gives the player a unique sense of agency.One of my favorite parts of HEADLINER is how it allows the player to explore a multitude of perspectives. My first playthrough I pursued a biased, aggressively anti-minority narrative. The irony of this was that it allowed me to see the kind of mindset and motivations that would cause this behavior.  I'd be interested to see this manner of systemic narrative development in a longer story.Until then, HEADLINER is an excellent experiment into melding player choice and nuanced writing."
76561198326953474,Recommended,680980,35475537,Posted: 4 October,all,SakSak,"The headliner is a short adventure/rpg game, with extremely simple but functional mechanic: Approve or reject given articles for publication, and then deal with the consequences both on the streets and at home. Do you try to keep your family happy? Do you follow your stance on an issue? Or do you publish whatever causes the most controversy, chasing for high ratings?Headliner also tackles some important questions regarding our sources of information and ability to read the media. Just how much are our opinions formed by news outlets chasing after big headlines? How much are we ourselves influenced by people like the Headliner, who select what is published and what is not? And with the flood of all the big attention grabbing news out there, how much do we ignore the less visible informative articles that are less unbiased by political views?Unsurprisingly, the game doesn't give answers, it offers us perspectives; mirrors by which we can examine our own thoughts regarding these topics.The game isn't particularly long, a single playthrough lasted less than an hour. Yet all the elements of a good game are present, refined to a crystal clear package that knows how to end without becoming overly long or padded with meaningless content. From functional mechanics, a complete storyline, believeable characterizations and visible effects of player actions, this is a complete package that knows what it wants to achieve and ends when it has done so. It is game design done right.Headliner is simple to pick up, fast to complete, and yet entices you to come back for a new quick playthrough by being more fun and thought provoking than dozens of titles out there.With its multiple endings, engrossing story, functional mechanics and cheap price, I find the game well worth my money."

,Recommended,680980,35458851,Posted: 3 October,all,Pyrian,Thoughtful and extensively branching narrative gives this 1-hour game a lot of replay value. Fun to experiment with the different things you can try and the different outcomes that result.
,Recommended,680980,35459460,Posted: 3 October,all,Sudden_Stop,"Headliner puts you in the shoes of an up and coming news editor in a country facing political strife, potential war, and civil unrest around the few citizens who haven't been genetically modified. Drive up ratings to get the big raise, but risk kicking off a riot. Try to calm the populace and show a balanced view of things, but risk being censored by the government. Balance the impact of your work on the country, your career, and your spouse and child.A fun narrative that packs a lot into the 45-60 minutes it takes to get through it (Played through it at Seattle Indies Expo pre-launch), with mulitple endings and a hell of a lot of depth to the decisions you are making. Absolutely worth it, I will be playing through at least a few times to get the endings I heard about but didn't see."
76561198194316846,Recommended,680980,35481748,Posted: 4 October,all,Vatican Ball Ze Fifth,"Somewhat interesting but the game is only 1 hour long. Also you can tell that there was very little effort put into the character design at times. Like lets say the riot, the rioters looked the exact same and beat the police to death in melee with molotovs? Overall i wouldnt say its worth 2 dollars but if you just want a quick refundable game, this is for you.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dyXj00GZ2M&t=7sgo here to see some gameplay"

,Recommended,680980,35467683,Posted: 4 October,all,[LEC]bustatunez,"This game delivers exactly what it promises, but what's surprising is how real the consequences of the player's actions are, and how engaged I became with the characters - I actually cared about my decisions and their effect on society and my character's loved ones. A setting like this runs the risk of appearing contrived or one-sided, but instead, Headliner shows players a glimpse into the difficulty of being a responsible journalist within a politically-charged society.Highly recommended for a quick play, and for multiple replays to see different outcomes."
76561198010735987,Recommended,680980,35472138,Posted: 4 October,all,Boxy_Snail,"Even as a version 0.9 game I aready love it. It's short, but meant to be played repeatedly, with different results each playthrough. While not directly naming current controversies, it's definitely a fun sort of menta sandbox to think over current events, especially in terms of how the media influences them.I would recommend this game for players who like ""choices matter"" and ""multiple ending"" games that make you think, in the tradition of Papers, Please."

I've been watching the updates prior to release and the game is exactly what I'd hoped for.The choices about what articles you publish really make a difference to the ending and the life with the family adds a good dynamic to the game which makes you really think about the articles you want to publish.
