,Recommended,681390,34335616,Posted: 18 August,all,Dr.Unfähig,"I honestly didn't expect a lot when I saw the game costs only 9,99€ (currently 5,99€ in sale) and got suprised by how good it actually is and how much it has to offer for this price tag!Currently there is a tutorial and three maps to play on. You have to fight multiple waves and a boss at the end. At the end of every wave you can purchase new ammo, guns or unlock skills. A lot of guns need a higher level to unlock so you need a bit of time to unlock them all.The game has some great features like the possibility to hit zombies with the stock of your gun. Also melee weapons will do more damage the harder you hit the zombies with your motion controller!When you manage to get some consecutive critical hits the game will be in slow motion for a while which is really satisfying as there is a lot of blood and splatter. I also have to mention the loud and powerful gun sounds.ZomDay looks quite good (for a VR game) and also runs really smooth with 1.5x supersampling on high end hardware even when there's a lot of blood and splatter on the screen.The only things I can complain about is that there is only teleport movement at the moment which also makes it quite easy to beat bosses. Also you can't manually reload guns which I always loved in other VR games.All in all ZomDay is a satisfying wave shooter with quite a good amount of progression and content for the price!I can recommend it to all HMD owners who like games like Killing Floor or COD Zombies."

Yes it's Zombies and yes it has waves but it also has a loot system, co-op play, perks, upgrade of weapons and intense fun gameplay. It is teleport but have not  checked options for other movement options but will do.I'm jumping all over the place thank ♥♥♥♥ I got a Tpcast as I think I would have pulled the lead out a few times. Zombies are actually pretty good looking like Hollywood at 3 am on a Thursday morning better than AS zombies more like DE2 zombies. It's like the game Hordez should have been and satisfying when you get bonuses, perks, and accessories as you blow the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them. The holsters are actually in a good place as most games have them to near the body this has them right where I want them.Not to long ago we were paying 20 to 30 dollars for a game like this, if this progresses along it could be the Zombie multiplayer game in VR that we're after. Graphics are pretty good, the weapons take a little to get used to and reload is a little strange but it is more arcade feel.Been a good VR week with this game and Operation warcade.Buy now if in Aus, get on MP so I can find someone under 9999 ping! it's well worth the money."

It feels overall polished with good graphics, nice gameply and an extensive exp mechanic.For now there is only teleportation. But I would say it fits the gameplay fine. Maybe one day they might add Onward locomotion. But even without it is great fun. Price is also very fair. I feels finished and has this kind of Resident Evil 6 MP atmosphere. If you like this you will love the game.I would say a MUST-HAVE in your VR library."

The game itself is very challenging and imo one of the best VR games on the market, it has* great intense action* fantastic options menu ( one of the best ive seen ) you can  change so  much!* has all the setups you  could need for pretty much any VR configuration* it has a tonne of weapons* and a very active and great set of developers that are constantly updating the gameI think give it another 6 months this could become a masterpiece, at the moment i think it just lacks bigger maps but in saying that the smaller more compact arena maps are by no means a bad thing. I think it would be totally fantastic to see a single player campaign mode but given the amount of work that would require i totally wouldnt expect it nore would i be disapointed.A great VR game if you have VR buy it! its on par with robo recall if not better especially if you prefer the zombie scene"

The game runs perfectly on an Oculus Rift(the hands are awkwardly aligned, but the guns and melee weapons are perfectly fine as-is). If you run the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode, you can avoid the spawning in the ground glitch that occurs on Oculus.Overall though, for $5, get this ♥♥♥♥ing game. It's simply too much value to pass up at this price. To be honest, I've had more fun with this game than Killing Floor: Incursion or Arizona Sunshine already. And it costs 5 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars.Seriously, if you're not throwing money at the screen right now and playing this game, you're doing yourself a disservice. It runs good. It looks amazing. It's challenging! It has decent gunplay mechanics, good weapon variety, a level up and loot system, and online co-op."

,Recommended,681390,34373838,Posted: 20 August,all,GreenFireToast,"fun, cheap, worth itIts wave-based on three maps with a boss for each. You have character progression through exp and skills, as well as weapon progression in terms of them getting better as you use them. There's also a lot of difficutly choices though I've only tried hte easiest 'normal' so far. I've tried two of the bosses so far, pretty good though the second one got a bit tedious in terms of how much raw damage it takes. But still good and provides structure to the game that would otherwise just be endless waves.Feels a lot like COD Zombies in VR, with some notable changes. Hope to see more people in co-op!Would like the co-op to be improved a bit - player avatars seemed really twitchy, though that could be ping I only had two rounds with other players so far. If you play co-op and someone joins mid-way through your game, you need to buy them weapons or theyll probably just die straight away. If you can share/coordinate its not a problem, but if one player just eats up all the ammo drops and cash then the other will be in a tough spot. I can't tell if there's VOIP, if not there should be. And it would be nice if you could bank cash between maps/games, seems you either use it during that map and its gone. And lastly the game needs a menu/option to quit the game.All that said, its good and worth the price. Hope the devs make some updates to make it even better"

At the sale price of $5.99 (current price as of this review), it's an absolute steal! I don't write many reviews even though I'm roughly around 100 VR games between steam and Oculus rift homestore but this game absolutely sticks out when it comes to the satisfaction of killing zombies in slo mo.. a.k.a Bullet time. The graphics are great for this pricepoint, the mobility (teleportation system) is very fast and in my opinion, sets the standard for any teleportation games in terms of the speed at which you can teleport and in a game like this, that's an essential trait.Upgrade to better weapons, buy more ammo in addition to ammo drops while playing, gun power up drops, character perks and boss battles (cool looking bosses btw) and as the rounds go by, the pace gets frantic!Well done.

,Recommended,681390,34417036,Posted: 22 August,all,[EQRG]SoanoS,"For €5.99 this is a bargain. I played this for a bit, and this seems quite promising.The gun-play is pretty much spot on as in everything works like they should.weapon sights are clear and popping heads of zombies is easy.They have also introduced something that I wish all the VR game devs added in their games:Pistol-whipping and rifle butt-smashing mechanics!This makes the game a joy to play when you are not completely helpless with an empty gun whena zombie drools all over your face and shoes and begins to slowly gnaw away your health.Weapons are pretty varied and look like their real-life counterparts from wrenches to sniper rifles.Reloading happens by ejecting a mag with menu button and then bringing the weapon close to your body.This works for all but the shotgun (mash menu button while holding the weapon close to body).This works pretty well and makes it a bit more challengingMovement is short-range teleporting only.The game consists of missions which have 6 waves + boss.Occasionally there is a supply drop that drops experience, money and ammuunition or a powerup.The powerups drop at random and there are at least a few I have seen. Double damage, infinite ammunition, damage resistance to mention the ones I remember right away.The enemeis are your typical undead, except for some special enemies,all of which have their special attacks.So, the usual set of slow zombie, fast zombie, screaming zombie, clawed zombie,exploding fat zombie, exploding fat zombie with healing effect on enemies and so on,and a boss at the end of each level.The only negative thing I could say is that it still has some bugs likesound disappearing all of the sudden, requiring a game restart.But so far this game has been promsiing and I'd say this is worth the €5.99 price tag at the moment. I'd buy early. (Was on special promo sale when writing this)UPDATE:The sound issue has been found, apparently an app focus issue.A minor annoyance but I can live with it.Also, the developers have been very active and engaging the community which is great to see."

,Recommended,681390,34493917,Posted: 25 August,all,Seth BOOT,"To me, this is one of those must have games for VR. It's a lot of fun, the combat's good, the enemies look good and there's clearly been a lot of time and effort put into them, there's a lot of variety in weapons, a decent amount of replay value, and there's still more comming from early access? Sure, there are some problems with it, my biggest gripes right now that you can't quit out of games, it's awkward to pause, automatic reloading, and the perks being lackluster at the moment. However, at $10 this game is absolutly worth it, even if it wasn't in early access I would still reccomend it. The cons don't come close to outweiging the pros, and the value for your money is rediculous, especially with this being a VR title."

It's kind of funny that Killing Floor Incursion came out as a more campaign driven horror game at $40, but then this $10 game comes out of nowhere and does a better job as a traditional Killing Floor than Incursion. Great visuals, addictive character and weapon progression, and just overall amazingly fun gameplay that is intense."

You like different maps? You like teleportation?Play this game. It's at good price and is arcadey fun. A lot more forgiving than other zombie shooters I've played in that you can let them nom on you for a while while you fumble around with your reloading or your teleporting or your panicing.For vive, the pistols feel satisfying to me, the haptics and the sound effects give the illusion of a pistol firing.  I had a hard time figuring out how to drop guns into the middle/back slot after training.The axes feel like their hitboxes are too small.The guns are more satisfying to melee with than the actual melee weapons.

76561198013020097,Recommended,681390,34425090,Posted: 22 August,all,The Orange Rams,"ZomDay is an awsome Zombie-Arena/Wave-Shooter! Controls are teleport only and the arena is two stories with multiple rooms and different layouts in each level. You need to survive several waves/rounds until a boss appears and in between there are randomly some mini-bosses. Careful aiming and not wasting ammo by spraying around is key to survival. Between each round you can buy additional ammo and weapons. After each round some boxes with ammo, money and exp are dropped but they have to be opened until the next round starts otherwise they disappear. So you need to focus on what to do between the rounds (I usually first buy necessary ammo and weapons and the collect the loot drops). Like in real life, the more you practice a certain weapon, the better you are with it (increased damage and capacity). The game tracks your level for each weapon. For me key to defeating the boss of level 2 was to get better at my favorite guns and to figure out the weak spot of the boss. These twists (the game rewards practicing, ammo/money/weapon managment is necessary and figuring out the weak spots of enemies) are what makes this game really great! I hope the developers keep up their good work and add some more levels to the final game."

I know some folks don't like the teleportation mechanic, but I appreciate it (most of the current alternative movement systems don't work for me and cause nausea).Some folks look down on wave based shooters and so they might give this a miss but those of us who enjoy them may have some fun with it.I do not like the grip mechanic to pick stuff up but that's not really the developers' fault as they are using the grip on the controller but it's clunky on the Vive wands (looking forward to the knuckles when they finally go into mass production).If you're on the fence, give it a go . . . the price is low and it delivers and is worth more than the price, delivering a solid fun experience.Here's my video thingie . . .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F01kXSnCkzc"

Animations are a bit lacking, but he guns and enviroments are great. The gameplay is a bit tedious though. Might just be a low level thing (there are many perks and catagories to level), but zombies are stupidly spongy, taking many headshots to drop. The game devolves pretty quickly into kiting around a mass of slow moving unthreatening mobs while your overpriced ammo dwindles. Ammo is stupid expensive. 200 rounds costs as much as a gun, and with how much it takes to drop the horde it becomes a nagging annoyance. Time between waves is too short, I'd give the players a trigger for the next wave, or at least increase the time between by like 50%. Gave up on the 4th wave of the second level out of boredom. Still, worth 7 bucks anyway. Will probably come back to it at some point."

Now i do not know if this is a game related issue or if it was due to my set up. The fact that i was recording and playing at the same time might have something to do with it.Overall i think this can be a great game especially if you got a mate to play it with and 10$ is not too much for something like this."

Have we all not had our fill of this dated mechanic that is pumped out at the first chance of a quick buck. Apparently INTO GAMES thinks not, and I would have to agree with them.Waves of countless zombies, endless coins, power ups, perks, pistols you name it, this games got it. And it not only has the lot, it's found a way to blend them all together into one game you will find hard to put down. Sure it's still a little rough round the edges but nothing game breaking or to deter you from having fun. With a 40% discount to get you onboard under the title Early Access is more than fair and makes up for a few short comings like mic support.The game is based around survival, as waves of zombies enter your allocated area your forced to defend or die. After a few rounds you're rewarded with a end of level boss to defeat and a new area to defend. With a total of only 4 levels in current state and more on the way you will find yourself neck deep in zombie guts before you know it. The zombies look great and are varied quite a bit with the promise of more. Perks and gun purchases keep you coming back for one more round. It's all so well put together. It's just great arcade fun. You would be missing out on a real gem if you didn't grab it at the discounted price. But don't trust me trust the other 90plus positive reviews.Hope to see you all in the game!"
,Recommended,681390,34810552,Posted: 8 September,all,Steelax,"TLDR: If you have a VR headset and contollers and like killing floor, Skip 1 supersized Bigmac Meal and buy this insteadI read 1 thing about this game before i picked it up 'Killing Floor VR' and whilst i know KF has a new VR game i have read that whilst the gunplay great it isnt Killing Floor in its EssenceThis however Is a killingfloor clone, and that is not a bad thing, the graphics are well polished, especially to say there are only 5 devs, the maps are much smaller than KF maps but thats not a big issue as its easier to get lost with VR (IMO) the gunplay is on point, (ADS is viable if you choose), the melee combat is satisfying but can be a little buggy at times but not enough for me to cry about it.Playing it on a Rift, my quarms with most games is that its teleport movement which i understand is to avoid VR sickness or whatever they call it nowerdays but this game give you the uption of Teleporting or 'Trackpad Locomotion' so you can move around as though you are using a controller with the analogue sticks. i havnt tried Co op yet but as a single player it is fun enough.The price is great, the amount of £15 ($20) games that i have purchased for VR that were 1 hour of fun then roll credits is very high, this game is under £7 and has replay value as is coop.If you appreciate the game for what it is, Zombie Wave Shooter with a boss on final wave, with the occasional secondary objective and you look at the price how can you be negative about it."

Text is an eye-straining barrage of Chinglish on signs which are too close to your face to read. Even the countdown before a level starts.. counts up!I nearly gave this a thumbs up because it's so hilarious- as a piece of software satire. If it does turn out that this title is a spoof, it will be most definitely getting that thumbs up.Essentially, don't expect a Robo Recall here. It's extremely poor. Weirdly, it runs very smoothly and a lot of the environments look decent. Many of the problems are content problems (animation, specular mapping, proofreading, ui placement etc.). Employing a native English speaker to tidy up the text, and a competent modeller and animator to sort out the assets would get it most of the way there."

After yesterday's update it also natively supports the oculus rift + the touch controllers. You may have to try the 360 degree experimental setup for the oculus sensors as this game currently has no way to rotate via the controllers so you physically have to turn around sometimes (minor gripe imo, hopefully devs will eventually add this feature). The Boss fights are also very challenging and the game as a whole is fast paced even on the easiest difficulty setting. I found the gun play to be very satisfying and melee killing zombies in slo-mo is awesome. For the price as of the time of writing this review ($5.99 in the US) I would certainly recommend it.UPDATE: Zomday now has a rotate feature and it now supports locomotion along with teleportation so both options are there, the developers have been churning out updates and plan to add more content in the near future, I wholeheartedly recommend you pick this game up for the price!"

,Not Recommended,681390,34872264,Posted: 10 September,all,Barometic,"This game could be good, I tried really hard to see past the negatives and enjoy it, but I'm just not having as much fun with it as I should be.Overall, it did have some good attributes:Decent gun selectionGuns are satisfying to shootGood variety of enemiesThe game doesn't look bad, not amazing, but not badGood price pointBut my biggest con for the game is that it's just too damn difficult even on the lowest setting. The most basic zombies are bullet sponges, not to mention the higher level enemies. Add to that the fact that there are massive numbers of them, too many for the fairly small maps to hold, so they tend to move in tightly packed clusters of anywhere from 5-6 to 20+ zombies. This isn't a huge deal on the levels where you can just run away from them as you shoot, but once you get to the ""defend the gate"" stage it can literally turn into a dogpile that builds faster than you can kill.Ammo is fairly scarce, even with copious use of melee weapons, the only real way to get a usable amount of it is to purchase it from the shop in between rounds, but they barely give you enough time. And finally the bosses, they're basically invincible, I get they're supposed to be stong and all, but they have no mechanics, you just kite them around and dump clip after clip after clip into them, and melee weapons are not viable, meaning if you managed your ammo poorly you have zero options.It's not expensive, and it is pretty fun, but these issues are frustrating. overall if there were more difficulty options I would definitely recommend it, but in it's current state its not really worth playing in my opinion."

Now it's rather difficult.3.I couldn't understand the tutorial very well, still haven't figured out how to drop a weapon, sometimes the reloading doesn't work too, which makes me die more often.4.This is not a problem I'd say, just something to improve. When you launch the game, the lobby looks bad, it's just a plain black screen with a few options on top to choose to start the game. You can make it better by for example adding zombies in the lobby that are just wandering around. So I was kind of disappointed by that.I would say not to buy this game in it's current state, but I've seen a lot of positive reviews that say otherwise so just experience it for youself if you want!"
