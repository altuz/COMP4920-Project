But you can find all you need on the internet so that's not a huge problem.If you don't have experience in coding in JavaScript I advice you to make a discord.js bot by yourself first."
,Recommended,682130,34637628,Posted: 31 August,all,ム TGTGamer ム,"This system is perfect for users who either are brand new to bot creation or want to speed up the process. It not only saves time when making your bots, but also is capable of much more then most people say.Honestly, if you want to build a new discord bot, this is the place to start...P.s. Check out my tutorial:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1124268077"
,Not Recommended,682130,34402122,Posted: 21 August,all,MakoSipper,"Disclaimer: This review was published when this app was first released. I asked for refund and no longer have a need for a discord bot, so I won't buy it again. As I previously stated, the dev seems to care a lot about this product, and it seems that they've released an update that fixed a few of the issues I listed here, so this review might not represent the app as it is now.WARNING: If you don't know anything at all about coding, this is NOT for you.If you're a noob, you'll probably struggle a lot. I know a little bit and was quickly frustrated.It's probably too complicated for people who need it, and too simple and limited for those who don't.The lack of tutorials and documentation makes it very frustrating for noobs. The fact that, being someone who knows very basic JS, found it easier to tweak a preexistingpythonbot than using this says something.I see a lot of potential here, and, on their discord server, the owner of the bot seemed dedicated to helping others, but he can only do so much.A few things it could use:* Tutorial and documentation* A better way of handling variables (like easily recovering them with predictive text and being able to see a list of used vars)* Easier way of inputting variables in the middle of the text for some basic stuff, like inputting the name of the message author without having to (figuring out and) manually typing the $tempVars stuff* ""Jump to action #"" should remember the action, not the number, so it gets edited when you move it around or create more actions.Right now, as it is, I cannot recommend DMB. I really hope this gets more user-friendly and more ""for dummies"" so I can repurchase it and make good use of it.Is it easier than creating a bot from scratch? Well, yes, by a mile. But who pays $10 to get a bot done for them, instead of learning how to code? People who don't want to learn how to code. And this still requires some coding knowledge which you have to look up for yourself."

,Recommended,682130,34956794,Posted: 14 September,all,Jet,Discord Bot Maker...What to say about this.I think it's a pretty solid app that just needs more work and development time.The dev has a good head on their shoulders and I think it'll be a great tool!For my full review check my articleat this link.

Was having some issues and the Dev did get with me and helped with answering my issue and in a fast timely matter, which I very much appreciated."
,Recommended,682130,34472150,Posted: 24 August,all,warbeast,Very good for beginners who just want a plain discord api based bot without all the coding!I would really recommend if you dont know how to code or like me and just want more efficent work!
,Recommended,682130,34726915,Posted: 3 September,all,VapidAnt,"This software does what it set out to do. It provides a nice easy framework for people to create discord bots in with little to no programming knowledge. Missing a couple features like polling and music, hope to see them in future updates. Needs to get commands for word blocking and anti-spam. Hope to also see Voice Support in the future so we can add Music commands. Currency system could be better.  Overall does what it advertises itself to do with little to no difficulty. Pretty simplistic, but anyone getting this software wants that."
,Recommended,682130,34652788,Posted: 31 August,all,Saucey,"Honestly a very good software. Teaches the not so intelligent to use variables and some custom like things. Very easy to use, and fun. It's honestly like a puzzle game. I enjoy it!"
,Recommended,682130,34721990,Posted: 3 September,all,Lasse,This tool is an easy option to create your own discord bot in a very short time and without any knowledge of coding. At the moment there are some bugs and many questions. But all users are welcome to ask their questions ion the official discord server linked in the software. The Discord guild is very active and is better then any email support system! IBut now some negative facts: Users with knowledge of coding only hate this program.  It is using more time to create an action in DBM (Discord Bot Maker) then code it by yourself. That is because the software needs more actions to build one command.Can I recommend this tool? Yes! Join the Discord guild and you won’t have any problems!
,Recommended,682130,34399501,Posted: 21 August,all,Loozers_Beware,"This software is great if you have no idea how to start a bot and want to make one yourself. Although many features are hard to find and you may not see them upon first glance, They probably are there.Things you should note:It builds the bots off of node.jsThe GUI is a slight challenge to get used to but once you get started you would probably have an easier time finding your way aroundThe developer is very professional and does their best to help you understand concerns and takes all criticism into account to make their software better.Although I myself would not purchase this again because i prefer to make the bots myself, it is definitely a good tool for people who don't know how to code bots themselves."

,Recommended,682130,35158481,Posted: 23 September,all,MitchDaGamer,"This app is very easy to use and is awesome! I'd say that you don't need any knowlegde of code at all, and the tutorials online are great! I would definatly buy this app if you want to make a discord bot without knowing code! The devs also really listen to what us (the users) are wanting! There are a lot of commands and they keep adding news one very often."
,Recommended,682130,34732337,Posted: 4 September,all,❤Andrewski❤,I've always wanted to create a discord bot but never thought it was fun be cause it is such a pain to do. This program made it fun and simple in about 30 minutes of playing around I had a working bot in in 30 more minutes I learned command variables and got into the useful and fun stuff. I recommend this to anyone who wants to build a bot for discord but doesn't have the job or can't code! 10/10!

,Recommended,682130,34425585,Posted: 22 August,all,SirTyrent,"A simple but powerful program for making discord bots.It is aimed at people like me who don't wan't to learn the full code required, but still gives us powerful tools as well as full access to the code if we decide to learn it later.You can run the bot outside of the program as well using node.js.Certainly worth $10 in my eyes."

,Not Recommended,682130,34411408,Posted: 22 August,all,『 』,"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to make a more advanced bot.This is purely for people who dont give a damn about how hard it is to properly code a bot and just want to make a bot for support in their small guild. This program definitly wont be smth that will give you the ability to make the next Mee6 or anything like that.The 10bucks and minutes of clicking helplessly are better spend learning JavaScript and coding a bot yourself.The code that comes out of it is bloated with everything that you wouldnt really need.2/10 and that would only improve if tutorials for it release, if the price goes down drastically and cleaner code being generated."

But one night, it just broke. I had this huge project and when I load it in, it loads in but no actions appear. When I go to add an action it's all broken, too. This happens to all the other projects, too.I would like it if there was a way to fix it, and if there is, I'd be glad having an answer."
