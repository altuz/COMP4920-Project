No graphic settings make it frustrating as heck to configure. No UI scaling means I would have to manually change my desktop size every time I want to boot it up. The other improvements are negligable.If you have the other original Roller Coaster Tycoon titles already, don't bother with this."
,Not Recommended,683900,35270391,Posted: 28 September,all,ζeh Matt,"I'm not sure its worth the 20 bucks, the better alternative remains to be OpenRCT2 in combination with RCT1 and RCT2. If you buy ""RollerCoaster Tycoon®: Deluxe"" + ""RollerCoaster Tycoon® 2: Triple Thrill Pack"" you will also get out cheaper. OpenRCT2 also provides a variaty of new features and is constantly evolving since the development is still heavily active. The only reason I did not refund this game is to show my support towards the original author Chris Sawyer for making one of the best games one could play as a child."
,Not Recommended,683900,35277284,Posted: 28 September,all,EnnuiBo,"Sadly I cant recomend this in it's current state.The game lacks a scaling option for the UI, so anything 1080p and above makes it near impossible to read without being inches away from your screen. The lack of a resolution option in the options menu means that you need to manually change your resolution on your desktop, so you sacrifice quality for the ability to read.And the new UI is a complete mess, you now cant automatically open rides by clicking and holding down to select between closed, test and open. Now its a double click to do so, which forces most rides into test mode before opening.  Not to mention that the games interface now makes it much more disorganized and feels like a lot of detail was left out of it.All respect to Origin8 and Chris Sawyer, but this PC to Mobile to PC port is severely lacking. Anyone interested in buying this game should look into getting RCT Deluxe and RCT 2 on steam from this and using OpenRCT2 to enable many of the features that should have been in this 'remaster'"

Everything an original RCT fan, or a new one, could want is here in this package. Sure, its a port of a PC game to Mobile back to PC, and it shows only when the in game tutorial asks you to ""tap"" a menu, but other than that, I wouldnt be able to tell, nor do I care. Its so minor compared to some other mobile ports that I dont feel it matters in this case. The Interface is fresh and more modern feeling. Simple additions like scroll zoom, and time controls are welcome.My only complaints, and they're minor at best, would be as follows:The addition of proper audio sliders if possible.The Ability to delete save games from within the application.Lack of Steam Workshop integration."

76561198070614337,Not Recommended,683900,35415955,Posted: 2 October,all,Envx,"I don't think this version of the game deserves to be called a remaster.The game has a very poor options menu, containing no video options, making the game very difficulty (if possible) to configure. Even the original games had video options.A huge opportunity was missed with this game to add workshop support, which would've been a very large addition from the original game. Fingers crossed they consider adding it in a future update, if there ever is one.My main pc experienced a bug where the game was running at a faster pace than normal (even on the main menu) making the game unplayable. The game wouldn't even open on a second computer.The updated UI is very nice, if the that makes the price tag worth it for you, you're okay with the lack of video options, and it works for you, then this is wonderful game. Otherwise, I would suggest OpenRCT2 for Roller Coaster Tycoon 2.I hope to see this version of the game improved by the modding community as I personally really like the updated UI."

I'm having no such problem. Although it is true that the UI doesn't scale. So if you're running a giant screen set up for your gaming that may be a problem. Im on a regular 15"" laptop screen and its perfectly legible- FAST FORWARD BUTTONOMFG I have wanted one of these forever. And finally it is here.- LOTS OF LEVELSIm on the fence about this one right now because they are grouped into sets of 10 levels and I'm not sure if I have to finish an entire set before I get to unlock another one, but I see some of my favorites in there like Micro Park, Dinky park, Coastertopia etc...Cons:New Keybindings- you'll have to learn some new keybindings for when youre building underground/ need to make ride supports disapear- no volume levels within the game - you'll have to use your hardware volume controlsOtherwise its a true and honest remaster of the original RCT. Some people are unhappy about the price, but that's based on personal opinion. The game itself is very good!"

There isn't even a 'Quit' button on the Mac version.While the resolution has been upped to modern standards, the game sprites have simply been scaled; resulting in a HD resolution pixel-pizza with an ill-fitting, anti-aliased UI over the top.I'll keep it, in the hope that Chris Sawyer will rediscover his original TTD and RCT inspirations and make improvements."

Why are there no new rides, pre-designed rides, or official scenarios?Overall, I really am enjoying this release. The issues I'm having are very minor, and overall I am happy that the legacy of RollerCoaster Tycoon continues."

Even though I have been playing RCT games all my life, even I needed half an hour to adjust. None the less, those reviews are likely from the percentile of people expecting instant fun upon downloading the game.I rank RCT2 as my favourite game of all time, do not listen to the negative reviews. This game has EVERYTHING RCT2 had, as well as features people begged for. The game is the literal definition of a remaster: fixing minor flaws in a game without killing the plot, this game does it.I highly recommend this game to anyone wishing to have fun, so many scenarios with so much potential for fun. If the price is too high, I get it, but if you don't want to pay the full $20, then get it on sale. Its an amazing deal and a better game altogether."

It's smoothed out a lot of the annoying technical issues I had playing the original releases of these games on modern machines. Everything feels a lot cleaner and more intuitive even than it was, and it's a real joy having all the scenarios from 1 and 2 plus the expansions of both in one place. There have been a few changes to some scenarios, which irks me since I liked them as they were, but these are minor. It's also a little annoying that, despite all the other modernizations, there is no option to switch to WASD scrolling.All in all you probably don't need to buy this if you have the originals, but I'm not in the least sorry I did."

Hundreds of guests ""got lost"" in my park because they walked up and down the same road (nothing blocked them) and it tanked my rating. And the employees will randomly wander in to queue lines instead of doing their job.I would also really like a sandbox mode where I can play a giant empy park and gradually unlock every ride in the game.

All works perfectly fine, the game plays like a charm and is very well done.Only main con is lack of settings for graphics, UI and keymapping doesn't cover all so you can't set wasd to move and stuck with left, up, down, right arrow keys which aren't in the optimal place for when playing if you are used to wasd.Overall, if you don't have the originals then I highly recommened this otherwise if you have originals theres nothing much extra here so not much point."

The scenario selection seems huge, allowing for full enjoyment of the old levels with ease.  Not a ton of new features, but having all the classic RTC content in one place is pretty awesome in my opinion. I'd recommend buying this game if you are like me and enjoy having classic games like this in your archive.  It was nice to see Chris Sawyer involved with this."
,Recommended,683900,35478371,Posted: 4 October,all,KnexPäerdz,"It's a delicate process to update and remaster a game as beloved as RCT 1 and 2. It's so easy to just ruin it, but then, sometimes, the nail can be hit right on the head. As someone who grew up on the RCT franchise, this remastered build combining RCT1 and RCT2 surpasses the original.The updated ui is easy to get used to and sometimes easier to find things than the original. The customization from RCT2 combined with the scenarios from RCT1 make it easier to create and imagine. The enhanced camera features give better control over viewing an area and studying a coaster.The charm is still there. The genius of Chris Sawyer's masterpiece is still present. The fun and addictiveness of the original is surpassed. This game is the best multi-platform coaster sim available, and I couldn't recommend it more.Unlike the original builds of the first two games on Steam (which are only on Windows,) this build actually runs trouble free; and uses almost no computer resources at that.In conclusion, this release surpasses the original two, and for the experience of not only a classic coaster sim, but any coaster sim, this is one of the best. It's stood the test of time this long, and it's only welcoming a new generation of people to the masterpiece that is RollerCoaster Tycoon."
,Recommended,683900,35434067,Posted: 2 October,all,Dragon Loli,"ReviewI remember playing this game on my windows 98 PC, it was nice. It still is nice, sure, the game is not graphically stunning, but that is because it's more or less a rerelease of a game from 1999,  and only changed to work on modern setups. Solid game, that still plays well despite more than a decade of since the orginal game release.FeedbackThe admission price should not be locked on some maps( and have paid rides), and on others open to change( and have free rides) , it should be modifiable for all maps (woth paid rides). The reason for me is simple , money, as in the orginal version of the game, park admissions counted for alot of the profit. Sure it does not stop you from doing well, it just makes the beginning and the middle parts of the park construction longer than it should be."

Those that are giving negative reviews for things like graphics, are really nit-picking. I was a lttle hesitant with buying it for $20 but I gave it a chance and I definitely feel I got my money’s worth. I am a fairly casual gamer but I had high expectations for this game and I am thoroughly impressed after putting a couple hours into the game. The first RCT with expansions plus classic feel with original maps, rides, and features but with a modern layout. The functionality has been seamless between the original game and the new RCT Classic. The best part of it all is it is available on Mac. I was a little concerned playing it on my 2014 11 inch MacBook Air with not meeting the minimum system requirements with my current processor, but the gameplay is smooth and enjoying. I look forward to continue playing many more hours."

I like the new feaures like the ability to zoom in and out and how the scenarios are grouped. Same game as before just no CD-Rom needed. My new computer doesnt support CD-Rom so it was sad to not be able to use my copies luckily this version makes up for it. I love the scenarios and how challenging it is to make money however in this Franchise i notice you make money faster than on Planet coaster haha i know its not the same game but money makes a difference with game play. I love that the cheats work and just overall satisfied with this buy.

I have spent more time playing the RCT series than any other series. I love this game, but this version disappoints me.I'm recommending this game because it is perfect. The base game is here, it's solid, it runs amazing, and still looks fantastic. The UI looks nicer, but I am so used to the old style I couldn't find a few things. I did skip out of the tutorial, but UI shouldn't need to be explained. I also felt it was a lot easier than the original, at least from memory.But I have 1 huge issue. Innovation.I have bought every game in this series multiple times. The last time anything felt new was in 2004 when RCT 3 was released. And that was really only the 3D models. I don't consider the new rollercoaster tycoon world game on steam to be in the series.If you don't already know, Open RCT is a free, open source project of the original RCT 2, but with innovation. It has multiplayer. I can't repeat that enough. It was multiplayer. People working for free can set that up, but the actual company can't. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I hate that this is only the base game. Its not '96 anymore. Every single RCT game is already on steam, and mostly run fine.This game is good, but its potential is massive. It is the best simulation game I have ever played, back then and right now. If only Atari could actually see the potential in innovating this classic game, keeping it a pixelized isometric classic but with new ways of playing and interacting with it, it would be the best game ever. Graphics, water physics, and a day and night cycle are not what will innovate a game.This game is still good, if the old UI bothered you, this is all you need. That being said, I will probably never play this version again, because there is a free alternative that is better in almost every way."

You don't have to use cracks / hacks / opensource ports / whatever to get the game to run. They changed the interface a bit, but if you can get used to that, then there are no problems whatsoever.
