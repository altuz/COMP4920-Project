It's an absolutely *incredible* game. If you've played Kerbal Space Program, you'll know what I mean when I say how much more fun it is to play a game where you learn interesting new concepts while you play. This is like the KSP of computers. I'd say it starts a little dry, but stick with it. Once you get to the point where you're beginning to build a working processor, it'll blow your mind.Learned how to build a working computer processor.10/10 would build again."

,Recommended,684270,35092217,Posted: 20 September,all,amchap,"If you like programming puzzle games like TIS-100 and Human Resource Machine, then you'll almost certainly like this. How this one differs is that instead of writing a program in assembler, you are building a machine that will execute assembler. So you are given a program, and a set of test data, and you have to wire together components (adders, registers, selectors, readers, writers, ...) so that the program will run and generate the goal state of the test data.The puzzles start slow as they introduce you to each component, but quickly move on to be much more challenging. And just when you've built your first general purpose CPU and think you've got the hang of things, a whole new timing concept is introduced for the next set of levels providing all new challenges.The drag-drop and plugging together mechanics for building machines is very satisfying. And there's a lot more levels than I originally thought, including a whole set that opens up after you complete the main story. On top of that you can go back and optimize earlier machines for additional replay value."

76561198281312715,Recommended,684270,35055318,Posted: 18 September,all,CometShine,"Okay so, I've never played any programming games before and this is all totally new to me. But I decided to give this game a try since it looked kinda fun and had a free demo for me to try out. So I gave the demo a go and found it was actually pretty alright once I understood how each module worked. It's all a matter of figuring out how to organize them to satisfy the objective. Demo hooked me so I bought the game and now I'm slowly making my way through each puzzle, some being harder than others and once in a while the game will introduce new modules. I kinda had to play with some of the modules to figure out how they worked, but once you get it you'll be good to go.  It's also nice how most of the time you have a choice between which puzzle you want to tackle first in case you want to take a break from one and try another. There may be some puzzles you'll have to sit through thinking out how to solve for a while (currently I'm stuck on this one normal puzzle that I can't figure out for the life of me for some reason), but once you finally figure it out it feels so satisfying and you actually learn through the process which will help you solve even harder puzzles. I'd recommend to anyone who likes to challenge themselves or if you just love puzzles in general. If you're unsure on if you'd like it or not, you should definitely give the demo a try!Pros:- lots of fun and challenging puzzles- I'm sure anyone can pick this up and have a good time- progression of difficulty seems pretty good- have a choice for which puzzles to do- Puzzles save your work if you decide to exit out or work on a different puzzle- soundtrack is pretty good and adds to the game- Simple story but adds some context to the puzzlesNeutrals:- could add more hints? that's just my personal preference since sometimes I get stuck for hours on a puzzle and just need a little push in the right direction, but its not nessesary.Cons:- Sometimes the game introduces to you a new module and you don't fully understand how it works until you play around with it- maybe lacks in replayability? Not sure I haven't finished the game but unless something's added like a workshop or mod capability, you'd finish all the puzzles the game has to offer and that would be it"

A few moments of joy I had so far:Me: ""Cool an input selector, that's totally a mux.""Next Level: ""Yup that was totally a mux""Me: ""I knew it!""Me: ""Wow I could do this so easily if I had part x and y from a few levels ago""Game: ""Yup, that's why you won't be getting those parts here.  GLHF""Me: ""HAHA, a cunning strategy I will need to create""Me: ""There got that level in x parts.""Game: ""Cool, We know you can do it better though, Best case is x-1""Me: ""Hmm, how best to make every part count...""Me: ""As a Zachtronics player always knows: ‘Save your first working solution, then branch off to get better’”Game: “Sure, you could do that, but I will just autosave the last successful run for you, or you could save it to your clip board.”Me: “… I have always wanted that”Just watching the movement of data… I love those little cycles spinning.Will you like this?I don’t know.  It’s a bit higher level than a game about logic gates, a bit lower than others.All I know is I like it."

There is a lot in the theme of this game that reminds of the super fulfilling puzzles that Zach had been creating over the years. These type of games, which allow building complex systems through a set of a few simple rules that are quite well defined, are my cup of tea. I also love the mystery of trying out new parts of the system as they are introduced, some defined, some not -- and those that are not, are left for you to discover.The style of puzzles and testing system is quite similar to Zach's game, and those familiar with the ""cram it in the least cycles and least parts as possible challange"" will feel right at home here. The story is kind of meh, though to be fair , while Zach's story telling is much more intriguing than Silicon Zero's, I don't really play these games for the story, IYKWIM.Those with some background with logic components (eg. Latches, Registers, CPUs, ALUs, Muxes, Demuxes, etc), will immediately recognize many of the parts available in the base game. But the best part is -- you don't need to know how these actually work to play!So give the game a go, I think it's quite fun and challenging! Thanks for a great game, guys!"

I would agree with some of the points raised below; some of the more complex modules could do with a short demo to show how they work, but then again, it is also fun just playing with them until you suss it out.I have had the game for about two days, and I have almost completed it now, which does make me think the conent is a bit limited.  Hopefully they will add more content and/or allow community sourced problems to solve.A slight niggle is that sometimes the AI could be better in terms of not overlapping wiring unless absolutley nessecary, but it's a minor gripe."

,Recommended,684270,35057812,Posted: 18 September,all,Devcon,"This game hits the perfect balance of challenge and personality. It deserves more press than what it is getting. The game feels polished (although I wish first time launch was fullscreened). The UI feels natural and is beautiful for a technical indie game. The palette system is excelent, It allows you to save designs for future use. The puzzles, although I've only just started the 'The CPU' blackboard of puzzles, I feel like the mechanics scale well. My bigest complaint of this game is the same complaint I have with most puzzle games, The puzzles are stupid easy then you hit one that blocks your progress because you can't figure it out. This is compounded by the fact that there are no hints (There is a small snipet that you get to help you understand the problem, or things to try but no examples) and no guides / wiki / help doc exists to ease this issue. I think this could be solved by offering a partial solution through the palette system somehow. The characters are more personable than in similar games like Shenzen I/O, the puzzle mechanics feel less restrictive as well. Your not restricted by workbench size or line count, but are restricted by what parts you can use.All in all an excellent game with great character, beautiful UX and difficult challenges well worth the money."

I love puzzle games that challenge you and allow you to learn at the same time. I've designed and coded small software and this is exactly that, this is how I see things when I code, working with numbers constantly and it's really really good. I don't want this game to end.I hope that there will be modding capabilities for this, with extended challenges (I can see potential for Objects, Databases, Hacking) if there is not already.9/10 - No game is perfect.

76561197978638448,Recommended,684270,35058515,Posted: 18 September,all,Soup,"Pros:+++ Fun puzzle game about CPU design. I wish we had more of these.+ I really like how they represented signal propagation delay. It's quite approachable and yet actually realistic.Cons:-- Many of the puzzles are artificially constrained in what parts you can use, especially in later levels. Why is subtract so rare? Where are my bitwise operations? Test-if-greater with only add and equals, /really?/- The game should probably have more hints. As an example, register forwarding is an obvious concept for us engineers who've taken an entry-level computer architecture class, but I think most people would have trouble with it. A one or two line ""note"" from Dana for each of the more complex puzzles could help a lot.- The story. Every male character is an offensive stereotype: you've got the A-type sexual-assault-waiting-to-happen, the effeminate-and-ineffectual beta and the eccentric space cadet. It's really heavy handed and obnoxious. How is this better than every female character being a damsel in distress?Neutral:* I wish the wire colors had been picked a little more carefully. It would also be great if the wires were spaced out a little more instead of all following the same paths.Overall:It's an enjoyable puzzle game, though some of the later puzzles dip into the aforementioned why-am-I-wearing-boxing-gloves territory with artificial part constraints. Skip the story."

Already had my fair share of super satisfying ""aha"" moments that are half the appeal of these sorts of logic based games.I have 3 ""boards"" unlocked, plus an asides board, each board filled with puzzles.  Each puzzle is given a star rating system, 1 and 2 stars were for me were generally a breeze, maybe just a bit of poking around to better understand how a new tool works.  3 stars take some doing and a few have stumped me (temporarily, hopefully.  the ""Androids"" level in manufactoria crushed me and my soul and I'm hoping to avoid having to seek outside hints).  The 4 stars look like they'll be lots of fun once I get around to them too.  YMMV with difficulty, I've poked around games like TIS-100, Manufactoria, and Human Resources Machine prior to this and I think some of the skills transfer.Anyway, there's a demo, so go out and try it!  If you like it, you can copy profile0 from the demo folder to the steam folder and avoid repeating levels (Do at your own risk I guess...worked fine for me though)."

It shows you new building blocks, just to then lock them in later levels to artificially make it more difficult for you. This wouldn't be that bad, if it wasn't EVERY LEVEL.This makes it unnecessarily difficult to get a feeling for how things are supposed to work, and results in levels having only one correct answer."

If you've enjoyed any of those, particularly Shenzhen I/O, you'll almost certainly get something out of this. Many of the puzzles have quite tricky restrictions - how *do* you build a multiplier without using subtract? - and finding a solution that meets the ideal (or better!) is always a fun challenge.The harder puzzles get really hard, but there's plenty to do even if like me you're not at that level.

,Recommended,684270,35233812,Posted: 26 September,all,Jackeea,"So I caved in and bought the game 3 hours ago... [mild spoilers?]...And I've already finished the main storyline. Don't get me wrong, some of the challenge puzzles like Multiply, and the bonus chapter at the end, seem pretty fun and challenging, but I bought the game at midnight and half-idly managed to just finish it off now at 2:30 AM. Granted, I do play a LOT of these types of games and some of the puzzles just naturally clicked with me, but the ""main"" part seemed a tad short.The game itself was pretty fun, don't get me wrong! I loved the design and gameplay (Really Shenzhen I/O-esque), and I only really didn't know what I was doing during the start (The input selector was just thrown at you with little to no explanation... and I had no idea what to do at that point. I pretty much guessed my way through it). After that though, the game was a breeze and was an absolute delight to play. I had to get rid of some of my old habits - not being able to connect outputs ""together"" in a T junction was AWFUL, and having some of the modules locked was understandable but a bit... iffy.One thing I really didn't like was how it seemed that a lot of the ""levels"" were tutorials (perfectly fine, nothing wrong with getting people to learn by doing things), or repeats of earlier puzzles with a small amount tacked on (Basic CPU -> Arith CPU, Fast Two -> Delay CPU). This can be done brilliantly where there's a tiny little alteration which makes the whole level different - the first 2 levels of the bonus chapter have really grabbed me because of that! However, a lot of the levels seemed... redundant? I liked the little ones that make you think outside of the box or taught you useful facts like FastCount and Dragging, but besides that, it just felt like a lot of the levels were filler.The story was neat - it wasn't in-depth enough that it detracted from the gameplay, but it got a laugh or two out of me, and the main story ending was pretty nice! A tad predictable but it was still a nice relief. However, beating the game did leave me with a ""Was that it?!"" feeling; just overstepping the 2 hour Steam refund mark was a bad feeling. Fortunately, the bonus chapter gave me a bit of relief that I'd not just paid £10 for a 2 hour long game.Overall, this has been a pretty fun and solid game that I'm hopefully going to be enjoying for a while!"
