,Not Recommended,685950,34284179,Posted: 16 August,all,EwaZor,"Just... What?Why did Valve look at this and actually put it on Steam? The entire game is basically shouting ""Please sue us, Hasbro!"" There are 252 achievements and you get all of them for doing the exact same thing. It's also worth noting that every single achievement is just called ""Pony"". I'm positive that this is just a port of some flash game burried at the bottom of the internet. Don't buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ironically, it isn't worth your time or money. It isn't entertaining in the slightest.(02/10/17) Edit:The Achievements were removed for stolen artwork, yet Valve still hasn't pulled the game. It's only a matter of time before Hasbro takes action."

,Not Recommended,685950,34302202,Posted: 17 August,all,FatalThornz⛄,"Even if you try ""REALLY HARD"" to look at this game as a ""GAME"", and even ignoring the elephant in the room. This basicly is a take care of this like a tomagachi pet, but the meters drain so fast, not to mention this look oddly familiar to a mobile port of a game with the same name.  It's bland, looks like flash (which isn't inherently bad), and my god the realistic crying, has achievement spam, mixed with creepy lines, and it attempting to be a clicker game in that same wind with the mine (without autoclicker, or a built-in one mind you) just adds to the reasons why you should just tuck away your wallet further in a vault, and keep it away from this.Please go treat yourself to something better."

,Not Recommended,685950,34424662,Posted: 22 August,all,SirKwyjibo,"$2 gets you an extremely shallow, bland, and boring ""game"" that can net you some completely worthless achievements in under 20 minutes. You can experience the entire game in less than 15 minutes, and expects you to create more ponies, and keep on taking care of your current abominations in the same, repetitious ways. Don't buy this, even for your children."

More like Screw You, I'm gonna go make 30k in a few minutes, buy some children, and then shove you all in the corner so I can collect your poop and then laugh as I stack it on top of you.But seriously, this game is screaming ""SUE US HASBRO!"" as was said by another reviewer. I bought this game for the laughs, and the screams of the children certainly did not make me laugh. They only made me question my sanity as I listened to their ungodly giggling and pondered what evil satanic rituals they are committing.For all the deaths of each of the ponies I slammed together, hoping their screams would be forgetten, I felt no remorse as their ghosts ascended into heaven (but lets be honest, do theyreallybelong up there?Buy the game if you're an autist who loves their MLP-themed achievements.Don't buy the game if you are old enough to have a stem account.Did you know that this application blocks out it's own name?KYS If you put 304 hours into this game.Here's looking at you, Spacelight.Fap to this game if you have an e-621 accountAnd finally; question your sanity for even taking the time to review this garbage.Here's looking at you, Amberly.P.S. I made a tower of foals and overheard them chanting cursed demon languages as their cries acted as lubricant so they may fit together like lego and rule the world. I only hoped I could control them, but my pleads were in vain as they proceeded to anally insert their devilish giggles into my urethra with much joy."

You take care about an ugly pet in an ugly world, get lots of achievements (every with the same name) for doing exact one thing all over again and listen to really annoying crying. Avoid it."

,Recommended,685950,34866427,Posted: 10 September,all,Queenie,"If this game appeals to you, on any level, then it's pretty decent for what it is. I'm quite impressed at how the developer put in consequences for blatantly neglecting your child. You can actually beat the baby ponies to death, though it isn't as fun as it sounds, it's actually guilt racking and depressing to watch but I appreciate it being an option.Working for money is tedius as all hell, it's a bloody clicker game of all things! >.<If you want to be a good Brony-adoptive mum then you'll love this game.If you hate ponies and want to punish them, then you'll also love this game.If you are neither of these people, then you won't have anything to like about this game.That's about as simple as I can put it really."
,Not Recommended,685950,34315744,Posted: 17 August,all,💤Dashi💤,"God forgive me...But seriously it's ""really"" good game for relax at evening or if you always wanted to spend some time with little baby... i mean pony, so this game is just for you! If you like ponies of course. You can use your skills to create your own amazing ponies! Or just generate them randomly. You can finally feel what they feel! Or just ignore it. Game most based on achievements so why not buy it just for 3€? Meh, if you want more check out more negative reviews. =) This review is also joke lol.Who don't like poniiies?http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1114047694Give back achievements ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s."
