,Recommended,686180,34594465,Posted: 29 August,all,zerox102,"At first I was gonna thumb this down, because you torture a catgirl, but then I saw it's just a mask and you're just torturing a normal girl which makes it fine.However, this game does show how cancer steam's censoring policy is because apparently you can't show nudity or h-scenes in games like Nekopara on steam but you can show straight up clearly non-consensual asphyxiation, whipping and ""waterboarding"" abuse as long as you draw some rabbit over the genitals of the girl.Seriously, isn't it time to bring some consistency to this bullsh*t? I can't even meme about it because it's legit cancer. I wanna see loving catgirl sex but I can't, but I can see a girl pleading for mercy as her air supply is cut off because a skin tight latex piece is not a nude body and a bleeding and whipped back is not a nipple.Was this game even reviewed? I know VR games get flushed straight through any quality control, but VNs too? Because you'd think they would have noticed the literal sexual abuse, the crying and pleading of the girl being tortured, or at least the horrible f*cking English translation and the fact that you could program a better game in the original Game Maker.I'm thumbing this game up because it's a 60 cent piece that shows that on steam, anything goes, as long as you don't show nips. Get your sh*t together and get this trash of steam, or give me uncensored Nekopara. Thanks."

You may have to lower your volume down by half of your normal listening volume.Nudityis censored here and it doesn't seem like there is any patch for it. The VN also has some choices which can either lead to a good or bad ending.However, the English translation is rather poor and hopefully there's a better translation as the majority of the text has gramatical errors, typos, and just broken English in general. Aside from that, there's constant error pop-ups that can just be closed.So why am I recommending it?Well...obviously not for the story.Small Note: Steam Overlay doesn't seem to work= No Screenshots :c"

If they release an uncensor patch, it might be playable without laughing your a** off during the ero scenes, tho the translation might give you some chuckle."
,Not Recommended,686180,34637123,Posted: 31 August,all,jme,"there's a nude patch now so it's pretty good if you want a cheap meat beat, but the game itself is kinda buggy, the english translation is aids and there's still no trading cards yet"
,Recommended,686180,34964880,Posted: 14 September,all,Erxkum,"Disclaimer: This review concerns the game with the uncensor patch.Cat Girl is an Eroge Visual Novel heavily  featuring BDSM themes, the game has 3 endings to see, I don't recommend anyone buying this game unless you're into non-vanilla or Extreme H-Content.The story is average but what really hurts the title is the awful english translation.At the price, I think you get what you pay for, hoping for Steam Trading Cards though as the Art is the redeeming factor."
,Not Recommended,686180,34753608,Posted: 5 September,all,☠️ lainverse,"The only “good” part of the game is the pictures, but they are censored.In case you got it somehow and want to play then I'd recommend paying a visit to discussions page for an uncensored patch, apply it, run the game, hit the gallery (or scenes if you want to watch them with voice acting), close the game and never run it again.In case you haven't bought it game yet then don't. Unless you want cards and backgrounds... which are not available yet. According to the developer they will become available when number of sold copies will reach some specific threshold (Steam policy)."

As my good friend Dwight  Schrute would say...False!You play a rich girl that dresses up in latex and steals stuff.  How can you screw up your own product's description that badly?  Though who am I kidding?  I didn't even read that.  It's was 50 cents last week so I bought it.  I've got almost 1000 games in my library.  If I see a game for that cheap I don't own I tend to just add it to the cart and look at it later.If the regular price was $10 I was going to give it a thumbs down, but at $1?  May as well recommend it.  Though, who gave it the ""adventure"" tag?  Really?  Someone thinks this is an adventure?  This is a visual novel, and if you need another tag try ""bad translation"" to go along with it."

76561197968304707,Not Recommended,686180,34744162,Posted: 4 September,all,faustie,"the novel portion of the visual novel is really poorly translated.  Skipping all of the dialog will net you a total of 5 trigger choices you need to make in the game ,which seems really low.  I'm not a VN afficianado, but that seems like a pretty poor use of the platform.  BUT the price is appropriate!"

This game features: Sexual assault, Sex Slavery and Torture. This has terrified me and I am scared of the depths of the human mind. £0.79 is way too much for this trash. It deserves to be in the bin. It has made me lose my faith in humanity and has allowed me to realise how deranged all of humanity is. As I said, this is all masochistic, disgusting, vile filth."
