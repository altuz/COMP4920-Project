76561197991546378,Not Recommended,688480,35341069,Posted: 30 September,all,dykmoby,"Short version: the transition from a VR-only game to a non-VR game still needs a lot of work.While it is admirable that CCP attempted to revamp Eve: Valkyrie to make it more accessible to those who don’t have the gear, the game suffers from an incomplete transition. A gorgeous game, play is still hampered by the original design based on VR – players situational awareness is derived from looking around and that is lost when played on a 2d screen.Ignoring the frustrating menu issues (a mix of grid and “lazy susan” navigation which don’t work together with a single control scheme, at the moment) which can be addressed short term, the key failing is giving non-VR players the situational awareness required for this sort of game.Being unable to change from a fixed-forward field of vision, having a HUD that supplies information about what is happening around the player is key. The HUD as currently implemented leaves a lot to be desired.The “radar” at the moment shows coloured triangles: no distance or relative position indications are anywhere to be found. Designs for a 3D degree radar have been solved over many games over many years so I am at a loss as to why this particular design wasn’t enhanced for 2D screens. As it is, it just takes up screen real-estate and doesn’t provide much in terms of information to the player.Which leaves the HUD as the primary means the player must identify both friendly and enemy position and bearing and that falls woefully short. The off-screen indicators (triangles at the edge of a circle in the HUD) does provide a direction and even how far behind a player ship is (by the number of triangles used) but does nothing to indicate distance: you could see five enemy fighters are outside of your field of vision, get an idea if they are above or directly behind you, but no indication how far or near they are.When a ship enters the field of view, they are too easily lost on the screen: the triangle disappears and is replaced by … a dot. Sure, if the ship is close enough you can see the ship but with the various objects and colours in the arena, they can be easily lost.The third necessity is knowing if and when you are being hit and an attempt is made to use audio cues (although some ships specifically do this silently) to do this. However, the sound design of being hit is indistinguishable in the barrage of tones being played for things like target lock, missile lock, etc and the direction fire is coming from is only indicted by flashing arrows if the ship is off screen. Again, being locked into the forward view prevents the player from doing the shoulder checks that can be done with VR.The game does have some potential. The variety of games modes are fun, the number and diversity of ships allows players to experiment with different ships and find a playstyle they like and the game does look absolutely gorgeous.But without the ability to look around using other means besides a full VR rig combined with the lackluster HUD and audio cues the potential for the game (and for keeping a player base) is lost. I will be keeping an eye on what CCP does with EVE: Valkyrie as I do think the issues I have with it are solvable (and in many cases have already been solved in other titles). In the meantime, I’ll just stay in my clone vat."
,Recommended,688480,35230442,Posted: 26 September,all,D.Va,"It's a great dog fighting game. However it is made to be played with a controller of some sorts. I wouldn't recommend playing with a keyboard and mouse.This game does take a bit of getting used to but once you get used to it, it's an overall fun game to hunt down your enemy and blap them in the face. Valkyrie has a good selection of drones. All with their own learning curve, along with learning how to pilot the drones. The ship tree adds a nice touch allowing you upgrade your ship with exp that you get from matches. Be warned most upgrades come at a cost to something, let that be less shield but more rate of fire.Loot boxes are a nice touch, really no pay to win aspect, other then getting some implants to boost your exp gain in order to upgrade the ships further fast then getting exp from a match.The map selection and overall game modes are fun. You get put into a lobby and the game mode that you grt each time is different then before. Games can range from 5 minutes to bed 10 minutes depending if you are playing extraction or carrier attack.All in all I would recommend this game. Just remember that it's not really keyboard and mouse friendly, it is possible but I would recommend a x box controller or really any controller."
,Not Recommended,688480,35246970,Posted: 27 September,all,Subsparx,"I am a huge fanboy of EVE with tens of thousands of hours played, as well as space sims in general. Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen, House of the Dying Sun, you name it I probably have it. I also have a fairly high end system. I have a Thrustmaster Warthog stick and throttle, I have pedals, I have multiple ultrawide monitors, TrackIR and Eye Tracking. These things all add to the experience when playing the games I enjoy. The difference between Elite, Star Citizen, and any other space sim between playing it the normal way and playing it at 7680x1080 with head tracking and HOTAS is huge.So imagine my surprise when I get a game that, for all intents and purposes, should match its competition, or at least the games where it's going to be attracting players from, and it falls completely short. I want a game like EVE: Valkyrie. I want to be able to just sit down, hop in a dogfighting match, and then be able to stop at any point to go deal with real life. EVE Online doesn't support this well, and neither does Elite Dangerous (RIP CQC). Star Citizen does with Arena Commander though.As a warning to anyone expecting what every other space sim out there supports. There is not just no Eyefinity/Surround support, there is no 21:9 support. Huge amounts of text are just completely off screen if you play in 21:9. It does the Overwatch FOV thing, except the entire UI gets zoomed in on. It's terrible. There is no good joystick support. If you have a HOTAS, or heaven forbid a HOTAS + pedals, good luck getting it to recognize more than one device at a time. It doesn't. Also don't expect any kind of non-VR head tracking. This one is almost the most disappointing to me. If the game supports VR head tracking, why wouldn't it support TrackIR or the Tobii Eye Tracker. Those are far cheaper alternatives to VR head tracking for those of us like myself that also don't want to be strapped in to a headset, but this actually puts everyone without VR at a disadvantage because there is no way to look around the same way.I can't recommend this game right now. There are huge features missing that should be included nowadays. The menus are incredibly difficult to navigate, especially with mouse and keyboard. I hate to use the trope so many fall back on but, the game feels like a console port, designed for console controllers, brought to a PC ecosystem where the most diehard of spacesim fans are going to find all their favorite hardware rendered useless.If you're looking for a dogfighting simulator that has those things (multimon, ultrawide, head tracking and joystick support), despite all the bugs and the alpha state, Star Citizen is further along in this regard, and overall feels like a more polished product. Needless to say I am highly disappointed that a game with inconsistent frame rates, desktop crashing bugs and other various issues feels like a more finished product than one that's actually released, especially from CCP, who I've supported for so long."

What it is: what I imagine every dogfight my fighters have when they are launched from my carrier.This game is not super deep; there are no space politics here, no massive campaign, etc..  You log in, fly in super fast, frenetic, dogfights and log out.  I like the new customization options/trees for each shift, the plethora of skins, and the simple PVE modes for when you want a fix of the awesome combat with no strings attached.  Ship customizations are definitely a huge step up from what I played in the past.I look forward to seeing what else comes in the future; for the price, you just can't go wrong here because it feels so good and it's casual and just plain fun.  But don't expect a ton: I didn't, and now I can't put it down.  It's just really fun space combat and it runs and looks glorious.  Believe me: I can't wait for Star Citizen and I play Elite Dangerous.  But sometimes, I just want COD in space.  This is it and for cheap."
76561198092678368,Recommended,688480,35278065,Posted: 28 September,all,ptdean82,"Much improved, and tons of fun!I write this from the perspective of a veteran of the original Eve Valkyrie who got frustrated with the game, set it aside, and now have returned.For context, I'll first review my complaints about the original version, and the extent to which they have been addressed in the new:1. Squad creation - In the old version, you could invite your Steam friends to squad, but there was no way to determine in game whether they were online. That meant you had to talk to them on steam or discord, agree to play together, then hunt them down in the list in Valkyrie and invite them.Otherwise, you could go down your list of frowns and send them all invites, hoping a few night happen to be playing right now and join your squad.Now, your list of friends highlights the ones who are currently playing the game, which makes it MUCH easier to connect.2. Squad function - In the old version you couldn't really communicate with your squad, but they were highlighted in yellow and you also had floating tags on your periphery to indicate their direction, if you weren't facing them. Communication limited to selection of canned messages (help me, or join up for an attack run, I need healing, etc), but those were clunky to use. It's become routine to use Discord for voice come, but that needs to be pre-arranged.Now, the helpful floating tags on the periphery have been removed (why!?), but the canned messages are much easier to use (but still unlikely to use in the middle of an intense dogfight when you need them most). Not sure if this was in the original, but the canned messages also tag you to your mates so they can easily find you. Discord still works for voice coms and adds a LOT to squad effectiveness and to the general experience of the game. Still no way in game to tell teammates to join you on a discord channel - if CCP can't deliver this functionality in - game, they should allow you to create a canned message with a link to a private discord voice channel so you can  more easily get your squad or teammates into that work around.3. Ship selection - In the old version you unlocked new ships and new capabilities for ships as you earned XP. Kind of annoying if you couldn't put tons of hours into the game, especially since some ships seemed seriously OP. Ship differentiation was ok, with three major functions of ship that made interesting dynamics in game.Now, this is where the Warzone update really shines, because all ships are unlocked (and each has to be individually leveled up with its own upgrade tree). Upgrades are mice enough to be noticeable but not OP, so far. And the variety of ships! Sniper ships. Healer ships. Ships that can cloak. Ships that can find the cloaked ships. Missile ships that pack a punch but are made of paper. Ships that are basically tanks. A variety of fighters for different combat styles. This is now Overwatch in space, and it is awesome!Better visibility into ship features while you're actually selecting one (in a mission, when you're trying to address a problem) and the option to delay launch in order to do so would be great. I love the dramatic presentation of ship abilities in the pre-mission hangar, but give us something in between during matches so we can quickly hunt down a counter strategy in-game."
,Recommended,688480,35231391,Posted: 26 September,all,Nashan,"The game itself is a fun concept, the gameplay is interesting.Although I haven't played it too long and cant give a full review, I have to say the menu system is absolutely awful.You have to scroll multiple times to move a menu item instead of it just being once, some people would call this 'heavy'. You also have to click the small text 'Next, Back, Confirm' etc instead of a simple button. Its annoying and extremely un-intuitive.I tried the little lost/fallen story thing and its really sweet, I hope that it is expanded upon and more assets/content is added. The multiplayer is a bit lackluster it feels like a standard deathmatch and has little progression, although the carrier assault is sweet. More arcad'y modes would be sweet, rounds are a little short and the carriers weak spots are not clearly illustrated.The HUD that shows teammates and objectives needs to be improved, it would be cool to see party members way more clearly so you can support them.The sheer scale of things is incredible, as a EVE Online player its really sweet being this tiny little fighter and watching the ships you know and love fly around :)Overall:I think its a great game with potential, things to do is lacking and a more in depth progression system is a must, the main menu needs some serious work. It is clear that it was designed as a VR game first and as such the menu and more needs work.Knowing CCP this game will be continuously improved with features and gameplay, I look forward to seeing what comes! This game will truly thrive with its creativity. You can truly appreciate what passion the developers have put into it so far, it just needs more work think of it more as a 'alpha'"
,Not Recommended,688480,35251463,Posted: 27 September,all,FenrirHeideran#7118,Thought it'd be alot more polished and enjoyable. The content isnt worth the price tag. The Customisation is pointless as nothing of it is seen other than the ship selection. The graphics and such are nice apart from the textures of the environment. It's not very refined and the menu screens are enough to turn you away from the game. It's a shame as I am a lover of space sim games.
76561197976255832,Recommended,688480,35415496,Posted: 2 October,all,UberDAHnooB,"ATTENTION 2 HOUR REVIEW!This is an ""at first glance"" review.  I went through all the single player things minus the scouting stuff(did 2 missions, great eye candy, but boring), played a bit of multiplayer and this is what I think of it...First and foremost, I do not hate, nor do I dislike it!  I am an avid EVE player.  3000+ hours. Jumping into some of those single player scenarios made me as giddy as a school girl flying next to ships that look so tiny in the main game and it put a smile on my face!  It is so wonderful to see this universe from a new perspective.BUT!  I find this title severly lacking in content.  And the multiplayer is as good or less than that of games that are free to play.  In my honest and unbiased opinion, this title seems like a gimic that cashed in early on the VR craze.  If I had VR I am sure I would find this a lot more fun...or a lot more nausiating.  There is a lot of spinning involved in those dog fights and barf bags should come standard in your ships, or at least an attachment on the VR headset.  Note the time and date of this review in case someone makes that!  My idea!  Mine!So anyways, do I think the title was worth 30 dollars?  No, not really enough content to make it worth the price.  Is there room for this title to improve?  Hell yeah, and I have faith that CCP could get it done!  Do I recommend it?  Steam sale!!!!I would also like to note that my computer is ancient.  AMD Phenom2.  4th core unlocked and o/c to 3ghz.  8bg ddr3 with an ati7870 and this game runs fantastic.  I am still benchmarking, but I am max res and med settings with AA and am still getting no stutters.  So optimization on this game seems like has been done right!I need to play a bit more, I don't know what this wormhole thing is I see on the title screen yet, but I will add more to this review as I see more."

Please learn more from Warthunder, they have a better control settings.  If it can somehow link with EVE online in the future, it might be better."
,Recommended,688480,35232681,Posted: 26 September,all,Sakkle,"Fast paced and fun 1st person space combat. A lot of new content compared to the demo versions I've played previously. The devs claim that they will be putting out free updates going forward, and I have no reason not to trust them. It is already a good game in my opinion, but I think it has the makings of a great one.To adress some of the major conserns people seem to have, I agree that the menus could do with some improvements for non-VR users. Additionally, you will probably want to use a controller to play. It's very sluggish with a mouse, granted I did not put a lot of time into tweaking the mouse settings, but plays just fine with a controller. Finally the microtransactions are either cosmetic or give you a slight boost in XP for a short time. Nothing game breaking there.I'm playing Warzone on a normal PC and am enjoying it so far, but if the earlier demo versions I've tried are anything to go by, it really shines once you put on that VR-headset."

I've only poked around and played through the tutorial stuff here for about an hour, but my initial impressions are going to be heavily influenced by my bittervet-ness.  I don't have VR and have only played with mouse/keyboard so far.  I've got a semi-HOTAS setup that I'll configure later when I'm not being lazy and have had a few less beers. (also I think this is one of my first Steam reviews and am likewise being lazy with the formatting)Pros:* easy to get into and just start flying* flying around in EVE settings (I'll recommend buying to fellow pilots on this alone)* better appreciation for what my drones and fighters have to go through popping rats, especially in beltsCons / could use improvement:* my only serious complaint so far is the overly busy and wonky UI.  I know it was made for VR originally, so maybe that's to blame, but it's already hurting my brain.* Wyvern looks too short and too wide* no ship spinning and space-Barbie mode seems lacking as well* ship upgrades could have more depth and open-endedness instead of the mostly linear progression tree* base ship skins should be the Empire colors or their faction derivatives* I wish it was directly connected with EVESummary:  I know I have more cons than pros, but this is also from the perspective of wanting it to be an organic part of EVE, which it is not.  On its own merits, it seems like a pretty decent fun game and I'd recommend buying if you want some quick space pewpew.  For EVE pilots, I'd also recommend buying on the extra lore/game tie-in alone.  It might also help CCP get their heads out of their WHs and realize we want more EVE content for PC, not just console exclusive stuff."

I have been looking soooo much forward to play this with the mouse and KB but using the mouse its pretty much impossible to fly comfortably. If you want to turn in a direction with the mouse you have to keep picking up the mouse and keep moving it. Other space sims or games like warthunder use a virtual joystick, which means the ship keeps moving in the direction the mouse is placed in.To me this makes eve: Valkyrie completely unplayable. I keep throwing my mouse over my desk and its just not fun."

If the devs look at how Everspace handles the control system for an arcade space game then they would probably retain a lot more players and have better steam reviews.Game only has servers in NA and EU. If you're anywhere else in the world get ready for a laggy frustrating experience.Graphics a big let down after seeing the promotional videos, even on max settings.One dimensional gameplay that bored me very quicklyUI/Menu system is utterly atrocious.

I have a hotas but I felt for something as arcadey and fast paced as this, the accuracy of mouse movement might be a bit better for making sudden, quick moves.I can honestly say I don't understand what the fuss over KB/M is, I had no issues with it. I maxed the sensitivity in the game and I'm able to turn about quickly but still aim precisely when required. I think someone mentioned being unable to stop, but I'm fairly certain that's just a part of this game, the ships don't stop, you slow to a near-halt for hard turns but that's it.Coming from Elite, I was a little jarred by the lack of side-step thrusting, and even now I sometimes press A or D in an attempt to move sideways instinctively, but I'm getting used to it and the controls all work just fine.All in all this is a nice little arcade game for quick, instant-action sessions and I'm pleased with the variety of equipment the different ships have."

I have been playing this game almost non-stop since I brought it, I have loved every minute of it.The gameplay is fast paced an action packed, I never got bored with this game, there was always action after action while you were in game. I was never missing out on a dogfight.I also wanted to make a statement in regards to the negative reviews that amount to ""Keyboard controls suck"" I have been using keyboard and mouse controls from the very begining and have no experienced any issues, Not trying to brag I have been easily coming top of the leaderboard game after game with only keyboard and mouse.There are only 3 issues I have had with this game at all.1. Lack of control customisation for keyboard and mouse, from my prespective the keyboard and mouse controls are tollerable, although I would like some customisation and I am sure the negative reviewers who are unhappy over keyboard and mouse controls would appreciate it to.2. Lack of TrackIR support, VR players have a bit of a compeditive advantage as they have much more situational awareness from easily being able to look around the cockpit and not being locked to facing forward, TrackIR would bridge this gap a lot.3. I feel like the waiting times between matches are a bit too long, 45-60 seconds is plenty imo, but 90 seconds is a bit long! More Action Less Waiting!"

Played it a bit and it was ok but it didnt make me come back for more.Saw it had a makeover and a big update so thought I'd just check it out for 10-15mins on normal screen and see what was happening. Couple of hours later and hooked. Great game so far.I'm terrible at this type of game but soon got used to the controls (using xbox controller), great collection of ships each with a different playstyle.It's basically Overwatch with spaceships...even the orbs you earn from XP are pretty much the same as the cubes in OW They even kinda open the same way. But that's not a bad thing!Seen a few reviews moaning about pay to win, but is it b0llox!From what I have seen u can buy extra orbs (same as in OW u can buy cubes) these contain decals, paintjobs and other cosmetics. If your lucky you can get an XP bonus for a limited time, that seemed to be the ONLY benefit I could see (and that would not be at all cost effective to gain any real advantage).The orbs themselves are easy enough to come by, in a couple of hours of messing about I managed to get 8 .Havent tried VR again yet but i'm really looking forward to that. As for my personal comparison with the original release and its current state; its a completely different game and in a good way. If like me you thought it was  ""meh OK"" give it another go, if your considering buying it, go for it. Another nice addition that anyone can play cross platform is a decent ser base and quick matches. Also means on a hot day I don't have to sweat into a vive to have a quick match.Great job devs, a lot of effort went into that and its appreciated...OK so update VR is pretty iffy atm in the way of  actually working. Its an amazing experience but after each and every individual match u will have to alt f4 and start again or it will leave you on a loading screen listening to the sounds of decisions you should be making.Sure this will be sorted however as developers are actively encouraging bug reports on their site.In short flatscreen works  perfectly and it s a great game..

Mouse and keyboard controls are horrible but controllers such as the Steam controller work just fine.I'd like to see more Eve related content, the only Eve ship that I have seen so far is the Wyvern, and it kind looked like a half-a**ed one at that.CCP does put a lot into their games and it's nice to see them branching out from their core game Eve, so I'm somewhat optimistic that CCP will listen to the feedback and will optimize the game and make it the Eve based game it should be."

As a non-VR game it's awful. This is not meant for keyboard and mouse at all and not many PC gamers like controllers. The menus are extremely busy, poorly designed, and difficult to understand. It took a solid 5 minutes to get through inverting my mouse and setting my graphics (would've been 20 seconds if the menus were legible).As for the game itself, good luck picking a ship. I sure as hell haven't figured out how to tell the difference between how each ship flies without actually taking it out into a match.

There's a (bad) tutorial that gives you practically zero information, and then you are dropped into mulitplayer action after 5 minutes. No explanation on ships, their systems, weapons, or anything.Menu navigation is clumsier than a new-born yak with 3 legs.Correlation to EvE Online?

,Not Recommended,688480,35255301,Posted: 27 September,all,QFAN,"This game is designed for PlayStation 4 VR + GamePad. Not for a PC with flight sim accessories.No TrackIR support.Joystick binding takes really long time because the game's interface is designed for people wearing VR headset who cannot see anything outside of the virtual world, and only has access to a GamePad.Not recommended for now. Maybe 10 patches later."

,Recommended,688480,35398031,Posted: 1 October,all,FakeSwede,"TL;DR: A solid game still not ready for non-VR platforms at this time of writing. Caveat emptor.Tentative thumbs up because I know a lot of cons will be fixed over time. At least, I hope so.Pros:* Runs smoothly on a modern mid-range laptop GPU (GTX 1050) even on high settings. Solid 60 FPS. Good going, CCP.* Gameplay is about what I expected. Depending on your setup it still works well without VR. Your mileage will vary by ship because some of the gameplay is dependent on free look.* CCP's release cadence is generally quite strong and I don't expect them to give up on this game.* If you ignore the microtransactions and don't buy anything for some time, $30 is actually a reasonable asking price.Cons:* Let's get this out of the way first: THE USER INTERFACE WAS NOT AT ALL UPDATED FOR NON-VR PLAYERS. This is the big buyer beware right now. If you are playing without a VR headset you're essentially playing a strong but wonky beta.* The keyboard/mouse settings are impossible to use and impossible to customize. You will need a gamepad whether that be Xbox, Steam, or other 3rd party. In the future, I hope that CCP looks to House of the Dying Sun for a solid mouse/keyboard flight model that just works out of the box.* Even though a gamepad is a necessity, it still can't be fully customized. I'd like the trackpad on my Steam Controller to be bound to free look because I'm not using VR. The game does not allow this.* No traditional main menu UI for non-VR players, yet. I don't know why the game was released like this.* A few bugs with Steam Big Picture Mode that may have been fixed by now."

Yes, the UI is unintuitive, but If you like immersive space dogfights, it's worth the effort to go through and set up a control scheme you can actually work with. there's still a learning curve for sure. but at its heart, this is an incredibly fun game."

Once I got it set up I was having a great time and able to pull off some crazy manuevers. Tried using the mouse in the tutorial and it just wasn't happening so keep that in mind.Mostly have used assault ships so far, and have decided I hate stealth ships. STAY AND FIGHT ME!Really worth a shot for anyone who is looking for an action packed space fighter game. Don't come here looking for a sim like Elite. Also don't play this game if you prefer just reading about games that will never come out like Star Citizen."

,Recommended,688480,35230785,Posted: 26 September,all,Darthun,"Updated Review :I bought this because i wanted to play an eve themed game. At first, i was disappointed by how far the game setting is from the Eve lore. I now decided to keep a positive spirit and contribute to the community. I'm sure it can be helped with time.I think some small renaming, or adding some details in the weapon descriptions would make everything more connected :ex : ' The heal beam is a new version of the old Armor Repairer found in new eden's ship'Overall, the game is great. the fighting is great. I just wish it was a bit more in sync with the eve terminology.It's not really playable with a mouse for me, better get a controller.Joystick support is not the easiest, but i have found workarounds for everything.no TrackIR support (although i'd say it's not that useful if you have a controller..). You can still have TrackIR with mouse emulation mode and a way to toggle the alt button on the keyboard.The menus are not the best in non-VR. Takes a while to get used to.The ship selection screen could be improved, you can't see what each ship does in the lobby. There is a tactical menu that allows you to see it, but bringing the ability icons on the front page would help.Overall i'd give this game a 9/10. Fix joystick support, Fix the names. :)"
76561198386867211,Recommended,688480,35389815,Posted: 1 October,all,RamboX,I think this game is great and worth all the money. This is my first EVE game so I can't compare but from personal experience of playing the game it has achieved what it was aiming for. It's also incredibly addicting (19hrs from Friday to Sunday)Cons--Keyboard and mouse sucks so use controller or joystick-Only a few gamemodes-Doesn't always match teams fairly-Maybe more space for a few more ranks? (I've seen lots of rank 60's already and the game has been out for less than a week)Apart from those 3 things I think it's great and I recommend it to anyone who likes space/action games.

Absolute blast; the same fun ""pick-up game"" vibe as CS:GO, with gorgeous graphics and tight controls. In VR, it's really an unforgettable experience.It's nice to see a title with such replayability in VR, especially one I can play from my desk without having to set up Oculus Touch.If you've got a headset, you need this game.If you don't have a headset but you enjoy 6DOF shooters, you need this game.Otherwise, it's a try-before-you-buy deal.

If you come as a non VR player then you will find that this game is busted. I can't get past the splash screen and the eve support team quit responding to me. Thank you for following up. I got a refund just to get off this ship before CCP divests all together. Their lack of funding good core developers for this piece shows that it's on the back burner. How the heck can you release to non VR and provide no real support. Also, you did nothing to QA the product before release. I am very disappointed. Give these guys some time to fix this before you invest. This will provide motivation to keep Helmar from taking their jobs from an embarassing transition for non vr users."

Played the game at 2560x1440, have a 980ti, game ran smoothly enough and looked to be hitting 60fps without any problems, the lack of controller support is however pretty bad, the game recognised my flightstick model but was unable to use it in actual gameplay, could be a bug, suspect the game is still a work in progress. Will check the game out again at a later date."

Gamepad or Mouse, for a VR game... WTF? Says you can use a joystick and HOTAS but not untill jumping though some hoops using emulators, other methods of control, or configuring the application as a workaround. The linking of accounts, EULA issues, loading / splash screen freezing. I never had to fight game so much just to play it.CCP, I even traveled to Iceland and brought you guys pasteries... the ones you liked!However, once you get past the initial hazing and get a chance to play, the game is absolutely beautiful. It is an excellent execution of VR otherwise. Graphics, environments, sound, UX, all beautiful. I really wish the EVE IP would extend its legs to VR becuase the potential is amazing and they have the creative chops to crush it. Bring it on guys."
