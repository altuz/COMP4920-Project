,Not Recommended,696370,34531827,Posted: 27 August,all,ｐｓｙｃｌｏｐｓ,Utterly boring cluster♥♥♥♥ of assets from the Unity store. All servers are either Russian or Polish so crap latency and there is no roleplaying aspect. Lots of the other players got the key for free and are just testing it and basically RDMing and VDMing. Can't drive cars. All in all it's slow paced and there are no tips or popups on screen to guide you what to do. Will try again and possibly edit my review when (if) this comes out of Early Access.
,Not Recommended,696370,34526448,Posted: 27 August,all,Dozenbeer,"One of the worst games I have played, it doesnt take long to realize it.- super toxic community, there is no roleplaying, you get arrested for nothing, trolls on end, very young annoying kids- only russian and polish servers- the game is incredibly slow paced and awkward to control- you pretty much have to be a criminal, there is a little window to be an honest person, but its so unplayable and unbalanced, you have to be a criminal, even as say a firefighter......- the jobs are super unbalanced, some get way too much money and therefore are overpopulated- its just not fun at all, feels so bare bonesDont get this game ever, very unpolished, toxic community everywhere these days ruins a good idea."
,Recommended,696370,34583871,Posted: 29 August,all,AUS_Black4White,"Its a good game with good bases on Roleplay, now with apartments and helicopters is more interesting but the map is to small and needs to include for ex a car shop, with some characteristics like that you can lock and unlock your car, a trunk for the cars, that the objects that you put in the apartment although only some have a utility like the trunks, in which still can not put anything. Maybe a better UI for the chat, the start menu...Other error is that its so dificult to enter on a friends house, you could add a bell. But its a very entertaining game and i like it, im waiting for the new updates and fixes. I recomend the game."

,Not Recommended,696370,34844649,Posted: 9 September,all,[VX] Starwolf [Owner],Okat so I am going to start off by saying the game has a big future and alot can change. The game's idea was amazing and it could get very popular very fast. As of now this game is in beta and it is horrible. I went into this game thinking it was going to be like Garry's Mod DarkRP but without the little kids screaming curse words into their mic when their parents are out for the night. But it was the complete opposite. Servers get around two people a whole day and there is no server that gets over ten. The graphics although are meant to not be the best but the movements and controls are horrible. The mic volume is so low and only little kids get this game so there is no roleplay what so ever. I have been on different servers and grinded so hard and once I have a bunch of stuff I will either be randomly killed by a little kid with no admins on or an indian hacker will spam chat and arrest everyone. The whole game is just walking around with a bunch of NPC's (Around 300 of them). I am sorry but I wasted my money and I hope you do not do the same.

76561198126266508,Recommended,696370,34680137,Posted: 2 September,all,korterkaks,"the game is still in early acces so glitches may appear, but that doesnt mean its a bad game. Im sure it will be an even better game in the future.An incredibly addicting game. I mean if u think that gta 5 is getting old and its not worth buying for its price anymore, then buy this game. Roleplay, battle royale mode, offline, just name it! it has it all! I just love this game! one of my favourites! Im just tired of these AAA games with their 60$ price and ""high quality graphics"", in this game graphics dont matter, gameplay does (something what AAA games dont care about often). yeah there are some exceptions in AAA titles, but this 5$ game can do much more than an AAA 5$ game (wich there are none because they would suck). definitely worth the price (unlike some AAA games). indie games are the best!"

,Recommended,696370,34525993,Posted: 27 August,all,Firemixer,Since before this game came to steam the dev team and the development since the early alpha days has been absolutely amazing. with many activities and things to do in the game as well as the little survival aspect with food and drink and the new adiction level. i can say this game is a sure win for those wanting to play a game that can run even on low end pc's as well as high ends as well as being able to play online in many different communities already available to join via the online section of the game.

76561198197935481,Recommended,696370,34521144,Posted: 26 August,all,Dan.Of.Dirty,"Good game, has a lot of work to be done on its core however. Melee combat has a few problems. A lot of the time, your hits wont register and wont do damage. AI can hit you when you are down, something players can't do, (And even if you do the hit wont do damage). RNG will cause your character to fall down after being hit, if by an AI, they can hit and kill you very quickly because their hits always hit, and always do damage. A tip, steal the drill from the pawn shop, thats a very, very reliable weapon.Range fighting is bugged as well. Bullets dont always do damage. When the AI shoot, they shoot quickly and more or less accurately. If the player wants to hit their target, they have to shoot slow due to recoil, and often times use more bullets then the 2-3 shot cops. A tip, if your being shot at by cops, use other NPCs as cover, when they get shot they try to kill the cop.To enter stores, you click on a door and it teleports you to the store interior. You cannot see the interior from outside. Meaning players will stand by the door with a shotgun or a chainsaw and murder you the second you load in. If you get past them, use the store keeper as cover, or uncuff them. They usually carry powerful weapons, and its quite hilarious watching people get smashed by the pawn shop owners sledge hammer.Crime is terrible, long cooldowns and hyper aware cops mean you will either be shot at from everywhere, or die starving in an isolated corner of the map. Doesn't matter if there were witnesses. Doesn't matter if you were disguised. They know. They know from miles away. If you want to kill people for money and dont want to worry about cops, train yourself to watch for criminal AI. Cops dont care if you do their job for them.Also, blowing up cars isnt a crime in the game yet, set up a road block, hit a car a ton of times, and watch the ensuing chaos.Right now, its mostly people fighting their way into the gun store, looting it, and becoming the next generation of gun store campers. Most of the good servers went down when this came to steam unfortunately, so you cant really get away from it. When there are good, dedicated servers this game becomes a lot better. There are also updates that are suppossed to lessen the complete chaos that occurs, so it probably wont stay this kill on sight, king of the gunstore type of battle royale. I mean, there used to be this spot at the airport that had all the weapons in it, and that was true, total carnage. So if you don't like it now, it used to be so much worse. I probably wouldn't buy this game if your only here for the rp stuff, watch it instead.Despite the bad sounding mechanics, the game is fun. You can handcuff other players, restrain them from moving, stuff them into a car, yell about sacrafices to Lord Odin, and drive into the ocean. You can fly a helicopter upside down into the prison yard to massacre all the deliquents. You can make cuffed players walk into the bank vault, restrain them, let the door repair itself, and leave them there. You can handcuff store owners, take them out of the store, drive them all to a hidden location, and watch chat as people cant buy anything. I handcuffed an admin, put them into a helicopter, and flew into another helicopter. This is a good game, it will become a great one."

76561198005604689,Recommended,696370,34516677,Posted: 26 August,all,Rosanne Faerwing,"First I would like to say, Ignore the time I have on steam as this will be a review of the game from playing off-steam till steam.I have been playing this game on and off for about 2 months give or take and I do have to say i enjoy how the games has improved and come along. I do enjoy how the game feels, even with the occasional bugs here and there but its definatly nothing gamebreaking in the slightest. I do have to say i cannot spend each day playing this game as sometimes i feel there isn't too much to do at times in its current state.To be clear, the game is still only half way there with many places and jobs still to come *check their site to see the roadmap to get an idea what i mean* but I really do feel its worth checking out atleast.For the many who are complaining about a simple £4 / $5 cost for the game even though it was free before steam, I can say this is easilly a fair price to put towards development of the game. This will help with being able to get more content for the game and pushing it along further with more ease. Those however who wish to wait (though i am not 100% sure on this) the game is suppost to be free upon full release from what I know.Don't just listen to people complain and have a look at videos and screenshots people have put up before you take a jump in, I hope you like what you see and maybe see you inside sometime :)"

76561198065068354,Recommended,696370,34540007,Posted: 27 August,all,Jamie_B,"Ive enjoyed my experience so far. Its fun to play for a couple of hours, Rob some people, get some weapons and gear. Look after your hunger, thirst and addiction levels, Produce/trade/take drugs. Get arrested, break out of jail with the other convicts, repeat. I'm looking forward to playing a little more to see what else this game has to offerI must say though, if you are a die hard role player, i wouldnt get this game just yet. It seems to me so far that there is very little active role playing from the community, only a couple of servers had people playing the game ""Properly"".Lots of bugs in it's current state, but i expected this. I wasnt going into this expecting a polished, full featured city - RPG, i got what i expected, a promising start of what could be a vey enjoyable game in the future. For the price it is absolutely fair, for the same price of a burger and chips i have a game that i can see myself playing a fair amount when i'm taking a break from work, or when i'm feeling bored on a day off with nothing else to do.In summary, if you want a fun, low poly city game to run around commit crimes in, or the opposite and you want to arrest the criminals running rampant around you, then you might as well buy it, it's cheap enough. If you don't like it then you can always get a refund and buy something more to your liking :)But yeah, if you want a serious role playing experience with an enthusiastic community, i would just put this on your followed games list and keep an eye on the developement as it progresses further :)"

Its not super complex, its a bit buggy and really just silly, but fun can be had playing it. Do not expect any real RPing to be had unless you can find a private group thats willing to do it. On public servers its mostly just people running around shooting at each other. Still I find this strangely enjoying. If you are a fan of games that offer up some semblence of an RP experience for 5 dollars this isnt a bad investment.There are enough things here to make this worth the purchase, just know what you are getting going into this. It is what it is."

What caught my eye was the art style and the potential to be an alternative to things like Arma 3 Life. So the controls and such seem alright and the gameplay is simple and fluid. What will make or break the experience is the server you join.ProsSmooth graphics, low stress on a pc.Simple gameplay to get into.In-game voip, a must in a role play enviroment.ConsServerside not optomized, lags once you get some people in.A bad server can ruin the whole experience.Could use a bigger map.My OpinionI think the game has great potential for anyone who enjoys role playing. That being said its totally dependant on if you join a serious server. At this time the server side of things isn't quite ready as I joined a server with 25ish people and it was lagging."
