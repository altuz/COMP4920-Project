,Not Recommended,698720,34866509,Posted: 10 September,all,Queenie,"Basically one of those 'achievement quest' achievement bomb games, the gameplay is boring and stupid and it's amazing that I hate it more than the emojis themselves. The weapons are asset flips, the enemies are limited and hardly ever hit you, when they do hit you, they more or less one hit kill you.The game has a lifespan of three to fifteen minutes before you get bored and the weapon mapping system is utter crap and hinders you at every turn. Majority of weapons are pathetic and other than it being visually acceptable, there's nothing good that I can say about this.Crap game for achievement hoarders, not even funny bad."

Going into detail, though.Pros:Killer SoundtrackYOU CAN SEE YOUR FEET IN AN FPS THOFun GameplayShooting EmojisCons:Some flukes, but hey, it's a Unity game.Please add some explosive weapons, and perhaps make the shotgun act less like a sniper rifle and more like a shotgun."

Good graphics, simple concept, it's just an all around good game. I will say though that I think I would have liked it more if they game more maps (Just some variety) and different difficulty settings. If you want a better idea of it before you try it out, I did a let's play of it for my channel. I'll link to it below. Have a wonderful day.https://youtu.be/cBVx3FMRVXw"

76561198149934885,Recommended,698720,34869201,Posted: 10 September,all,Floosh,"Sooo when I first saw this game it was fun and it turned out to be.. but there were a lot of things I didn't like about this game.. and some things I found out about the game.At the time I dont have many runs ( about 30+ rounds ) and my highest score is around 36.. so yeah.Tips:1. Dont ADS. The only time you should ADS is when you are trying to kill the large emojis from a far distance.2. Shotgun- Best weapon in the game but apperentally it only kills one target and doesn't pierce. 3-4 shots will be able to kill the large emojis3. LMG ( mounted and loaded ) - Devestating to enemies that follow you. If you find a good distance.. use it but I suggest to use the revolver or somewhat of that source if you are trying to shoot floating enemies.4. Powerups. There are powerups ( Health, slow time, Sonic speed).. but they are useless unless you want to get shot to death.5. Jumping. Always Jump. That's just that. Run in a circle path,6. Reloading: This is also a huge con in the game but mainly it's for the revolver which tends to be the most risky item to use in the game but the most reliable to shoot for floating enemies if you can aim. The revolver takes the longest reload time and if you reload  it takes a good 3-ish seconds ( makes sense though ) and you can't switch to something else in the meantime.TDLR: Reload in safe places with the revolvers.------------------------------PROS AND CONSPros:1. It's actually a good-ish game when you get used to it. I'm a fan of these survival games that you can find your path and perfect it.2. It's emojis. Die Die Die.3. Music is nice when playing the game.4. Sliding ( on the revolver slope ) and jumping mechanics are great.5. The one map in the game so far actually has a good terrain and the only thing wrong is the stairs on it which should be fixed overtimeCons:1. Bullet speed & Spread. I think most guns should have faster bullet speed ( especially the revolver ). The revolver has high damage.. useful especially when shooting floating enemies. Missing your 6 shots because the enemies are moving is too punishing for the reload time. Since you and the enemy are always moving it's very difficult to actually land a shot. The shotgun weapon at the moment is the most broken due to the little spread when shooting far distance. It's fine if I can shoot something up close, but I should not be able to shoot a large emoji across the map and land every shot, killing it in 4 shots ( this should be a job of something like a musket ).2. Weaponry- Right now, there are 5 weapons in the game: Pistol, LMG ( Heavy ), Shotgun, Revolver, and an Assult Rifle.Pistol- Decent. I have no concerns about itLMG- Low spread.. but still balanced seeing how the game runs. Usually I use this on following emojis so no problemAssult Rifle- I haven't really had the time to find its position but I feel like it's projectile speed is too low for this kind of gun and with the power it delivers I think bullet speed should be faster.Shotgun- No spread.. Reload time is really fast ( but needed )Revolver- Slow reload, but compensates with power.. Needs to be basically hitscan.I think the game should offer more options by having the black crates respawn different weapons.. Maybe gernades too.3. Powerups- The powerups are good in this game but they are in the middle.. which is chaos once you spend about 3-ish minutes. Basically there is no way for you to heal and the projectiles in the game will kill you because of how many there are.4. Enemies in general- I'm fine with the ones that follow. The ones that shoot projectiles though are too strong. I'm fine with the bosses but the floating ones ( Especially the vomit ones ) are just too strong with a jacked fire rate.5. Lack of Options- Motion blur, sensetivity.. some color palate backgrounds make it difficult to see enemes ( Green and Grey ones )6. Tutorial & grabbing items- It takes about 30 minutes to fully understand how to play the game and learn it.. which for most people can be a turn off about the game. Grabbing items ( mainly guns ) can be a hassle when standing either on or near the weapon crates.----------------------------------Should you get the game?For $2 This game will keep people busy if you like the survival run-and-gun type scenario but the only thing that really sucks is the enemies build up too much for you to handle at the moment. The bullet speed along with motion blur doesn't make the situation better but it is still a fun game once you get the hang of it.I really liked the game and it is a great time killer if anything.I hoped that this information has helped you on your decision to buy the game or not. <3"

I love fun high score run games, and for me that is enough to give me that one more round feeling, but I do wish the developer would give some other kind of progression besides achievements, cause once i get al SIX HUNDRED!!! I don't know if I'll have a reason to come back, and even if I only spent 2 dollars I want to keep playing something i enjoy. I wouldn't mind a paid expansion that unlocked abilities new weapons etc if the dev was down with making it."

,Not Recommended,698720,34877290,Posted: 10 September,all,ShiroOkami,"Hi, Hello, Ciao', and Welcome to my... First Impressions of this Abomination. I would prefer to Kick these Proverbial shoes off with this claim, It is Incomprehensible in the sheer stupidity and lack of creativity that This Thing Delivers to the Demographic It is directed towards... Which is No one, But I digress. It is as simple of an Idea as it sounds Johnny Boy. Just boot it up, Find yourself at the midst of a main menu that has obviously not recieved the care or effort it ""Doesn't"" deserve, and then travel to a colorful but yet Eye straining visual of an arena of some sort, as you then proceed to pick up a weapon and start poppin'. The flaw the overrides the Identity of the combat is the clunkyness in the design of each weapon, the terrible Hitboxes, and Abundance of glitches in the process. The PRIME Blemish is that it pertains to possessing Little to no challenge in It's gameplay, Which is made Completely Transparent after spending less than 20 Minutes In game and Already Obtaining over 100 Achievements! Avoid at all costs unless you have deep hatred for emojis or you are into Ingesting Hallucinogenic Drugs. 2/10"
