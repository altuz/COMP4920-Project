,Not Recommended,704210,34794333,Posted: 7 September,all,[L3GN] Niestrat99,This isn't BLOCK WARRIORS...This is FATAL ERROR SIMULATOR! The BEST GAME OF 2017!No seriously WHAT THE HECK were YOU thinking!?I tried re-installing the game and looking it up for any broken files. I also restarted my PC and hoped it would work but no.This game is BROKEN from the beginning!!I am going to get a refund while you guys are going to fix that Fatal Error crash - does that sound like a good plan? O.K.!I do NOT recommend this game at the moment.

,Not Recommended,704210,34792105,Posted: 7 September,all,Freddy,"Shill :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zktx-EHOnAEHonestly this game is pretty fun, the concept is all there except a few bug with menus and how you literally cannot escape them. The gameplay seems fine, except I couldn't find a way to fist people to death hence having to search for a unlocked car which are few and far between to murder the popo for their guns. Right now the main menu with the mini map is unescapable same with the atm machine menu.Overall I haven't played much of the missions yet so I cannot rate it completely but the ""open world"" aspect is fun and engaging for the short amount of time i've played it. There's still not much to this game yet, it's obviously not fleshed out and I wouldn't be recommending it even at the low price point. I feel like there's little reply value and the basics are not even working. This review may change depending on how the creator decided to update their game and whether they're still working on it.p.s the engrish suxsEdit : How to fix most of the menu issueshttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1129592665Shill :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zktx-EHOnAE"

76561198353781282,Not Recommended,704210,34893089,Posted: 11 September,all,Niggwe,"Well to start this review off the game isnt the worst but it needs a lot more improvements. The first thing i have to say about this game is that the faces on people are very nasty and facial movemets are non existent. Animations are very poor and need a lot more work the game itself has potential but it needs a lot of work. Oh and also the graphics kill your fps, even with an i7-7600K and Gtx 1070 the game is 30-40 fps and the graphics dont even look that great. Some features like running npc when you have a gun or at least screaming would be nice the game has almost no audio except some music and gunshots. Overall they game has potential but its just not enough to slip by. Oh and lastly the combat mechanics arent the best."

,Recommended,704210,34841873,Posted: 9 September,all,dudes45,"So far I can see a lot of potential, unsurprisingly there is also a lot of bugs. I would call this a real Alpha/Early Access title. Many games have a fully working concept and just want feedback on exactly how to shape the game. This is a true alpha, it's got a lot of bugs, lots of spelling mistakes and typos and is generally as you should expect an Alpha.I'd pick it up it's ridiculously cheap at the time of writing £1.59. Buy it now and wait if you're not sure, it has a huge amount of potential I think however we require the devs to deliver to really make that potential worth anything."
76561197967203702,Recommended,704210,34784675,Posted: 6 September,all,spike30001,"A poor man's Gta this is Gta Legoland / Minecraft in the graphics. Not great on the framerate on all set to high but still very playable. Nice Idea and if you added coop or mp experience this could be a good laugh with your mates. As it stands I found it boring compared to other titles it's trying to be. So is it worth the money?  YES  because if you like sp games and can run it fine this is worth what they are asking for it. And its new so they will I am sure be many updates. I couldn't get the map to work so not sure if this is a bug or if I needed to find or buy one nothing mentioned so found it impossibe to find things easily. I am a fan of Early Access, so I do see the bigger picture on this title If handled correctly. Dev's tip is to listen to the players in the forums and create a game the players want not what you want, this always works. So I am giving a thumbs up for now but not for me atm but I will keep an eye on it. But didn't think it deserved a bad review. Oh Devs sort out some better music too but at £1.59 I can't expect the rights to good music I know lol."

,Recommended,704210,34788107,Posted: 6 September,all,Destruction Games,"Not an amazingly extensive game, with a pretty small open world, but it is only $1.99, so I think it's worth it. There is only one story mission, but there is a lot of stuff to do in the open world, you can join a gang, start a buisness, rob stores and banks, and you can buy property. It's pretty fun to manage that stuff.Overall, not an amazing game, but for $1.99 it's worth it."
