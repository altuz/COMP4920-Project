,Recommended,704550,35255823,Posted: 27 September,all,Benson⎝͠҉̭̫͖̗ͅ,"Ya know I really misjudged this game at first.This game is pure gold when it comes to the platforming genre, the simplicity of the levels, characters and overall design and art of the game really makes up for the deaths. Thats another thing also the deaths and challenging aspect of the game is great as its not like a generic annoying platformer that you get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at when you keep dying at one stage and just cant progress. That isnt the case with this game as there is progress and your not just aimlessly wondering around and dying. The checkpoint placements are great as everytime I die it makes me want to keep going.The character of the girl I thought was really unique. A simple mute, but cute character named Hentai. The overall aspect of having very little backstory does add up to the many possibilities and theorys of who this character is and her backstory of why there are flying buzzsaws and weird Mike Wazowski-looking things trying to crush you with pink jellys flying all around the map. It opens up to a whole new world of theorys, it really makes you think when you just stop and think ""Why are we here?"". And why are we collecting these mushrooms? Do they serve some sort of purpose?After completing the game, I emailed the developer and he gave me a dlc key for ""I smoke weed"" beta, this was much more of a challenge and I had to physically wear sunglasses because my eyes started to hurt after a while. I almost completed it but I was just one mushroom off so sadly I had to quit the game because my friend wanted to play CSGO.A short time after that, I got a friend request from the developer and he gave me a JAIL dlc for the game, I noticed how the dlc download was much more bigger than the game. (The game was 8mb, the DLC was about 80mb appox.) I recently just played that and finished that DLC, and to say honestly the ending was really surprising. When you finish the game your character looks over the hedge of the roundly drawn minecraft world, a great ending.It really does suck that some people reported this game for being ""racist"" well not the game itself but the achievements as I did not see how ANY of the achievements were racist in anyway possible. Some of my favorite ones were taken away from my profile and replaced with a sad pepe. :c The achievements for this game are fantastic also, over 150+ achievements are full of memes and just genuinely nice stuff for your profile. Some of the achievements merge up with eachother to make it look like an image, its very nice until someone reported it sadly.The music for this game was great, and shout out to the composer of this game. The piano segments in the main game had a really nice touch and melody that accompanied the platforming characteristic of the game. The Jail DLC music was great as well I couldn't help but sing along to it. The music overall was great however I feel that variety could be chosen within it to be include a variety of different songs so that it doesn't loop. I wouldn't mind hearing more music composed for this game.This game is great overall, and I wanted to thank the developer for making it. It really is a great game, and the developer himself is a nice guy. I wish him and his team good luck for future games!"
