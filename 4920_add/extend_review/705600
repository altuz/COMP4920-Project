,Not Recommended,705600,34946977,Posted: 14 September,all,SystemError514,"I know this is only a ""joke game"", but it's terrible. It runs like crap on a i7-4790k and a GTX 1080 Ti, you can scale ANY mountain just by running and jumping, most enemies can't see you unless you shoot, when you shoot the sky disappears for a bit. There are no controls or control options, figure them out on your own (not hard really).Just don't buy it."

I bought it because of the game title, You don't even get to play as ISIS, So how is it an ISIS Simulator?I guess it worked, They took my money, I don't mind though, There's plenty where that came from =P!I spent my money so you don't have to!

,Recommended,705600,35434081,Posted: 2 October,all,🐈Fluffy Dasher~🐈,"For a ""joke game"" this is pretty bad. I even bought it with a 90% off coupon and paid 30 cents for it, so I don't feel cheated.The enemies tend to scale mountains and cliffs with  utter EASE, and as a result, they flank you at every turnThe lighting in the game is badGraphics looks like CS 1.6 (which I kinda like, but the lighting just makes it atrocious)You don'treally feel like you're a part of Isis. This isn't simulating anything.You're just some random Joe Schmoe with an Uzi mowing people down. Which I admit, is kinda fun.The objects of this game are all black and shaded. You have to shine a flashlight at them to actually see them.What are the pros of this game? Well, it gives you some good mindless action. That's why I feel like i can beat this game. Even though this fails as a ""simulator"", the FPS action is still great, and I recommend it purely on the mind numbing action of it.But if you're looking for a edgy simulator, then lookelse where. Infact, if you don't have a 90% off coupon, don't bother lolThe best thing about this game, though, is that when I first loaded it up, I got messages from literally 20 different people about it. I'm all wow lmao."

Thats through like 8 playthrough when bored.Overwall, for what you are getting, It is not worth 2.99, but to get it on sale its for sure worth it.The Hitscan is pretty spot on honestly. the physics are not horrible. Yea the map is awful and the graphics suck but for what you get. It's not hte worst. I normally speed run through this to get my aim good before playing a different shooting game"

(they can sense the vibrations like a bat.)-the mountains look like my Morning Wood under the blanket.-i press F12 to take a screenshot and for some reason the graphics turned xray.such isis, such simulation.10/10 must grab this game"
