The Walking Dead. The mood we want to capture in Zombie Playground is the feeling that you had as a child when you were completely immersed in your imagination fighting monsters and doing things you thought were cool from your favorite movies, comics, and video games. <br><br>Stealth Studios Inc. has worked long and hard to create a game that delivers on the promise of our original vision. Zombie Playground\u2122 is made with the brains, disease, and puke of all involved - that means heart! We've put everything we have into this development, and we intend to put a lot more.<br><br>Gameplay in Zombie Playground is a hybrid of third person shooter and action RPG mechanics set in a cooperative zombie survival horror arena.
