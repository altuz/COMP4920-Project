Applications will maximize to the size of each split, and Functions like &quot;Move to Next Monitor&quot; will treat each split as a separate monitor. Compensate for ATI and nVidia Bezel Compensation in DisplayFusion to prevent your windows from disappearing behind your bezels.<br>\u00a0<br><strong><u>Monitor Configuration and Profiles</u></strong><br>Use DisplayFusion to set your Monitor Configuration. Configure the resolution, colour depth, refresh rate and orientation. You can even save your configurations as Monitor Profiles that you can load later using a key combination or TitleBar Button.

Create Functions to load Wallpaper or Monitor Profiles, move windows around, change window opacity, toggle DisplayFusion features and much more. Any Function, including custom Functions that you've created, can be assigned to a TitleBar Button for easier access with the mouse, or to a keyboard shortcut for keyboard power users. Functions can also be assigned to the Jump List menus on the DisplayFusion Multi-Monitor Taskbars, allowing them to be run even on applications that are minimized.<br><br><strong><u>Scripted Functions</u></strong><br>Need more options? Use DisplayFusion's Scripted Functions (Macros) to script anything you can imagine. Use C# or <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://VB.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >VB.net</a> inside DisplayFusion to create your own custom scripts.
