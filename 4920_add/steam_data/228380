It\u2019s a motorsport with attitude.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique Racing Experience</h2>First and foremost, we\u2019re building a FUN racing game with PERSONALITY. It\u2019s all about the stuff that really matters: varied tracks, cool cars, and the defining once-in-the-lifetime moments that can be achieved only with true-to-life physics simulation. If you\u2019re familiar with our previous games, you already know what we\u2019re aiming at: exhilarating racing action with sophisticated physics and damage modeling, only this time we\u2019re upping the ante on almost every front.

In short, our cars ooze with STYLE. You won\u2019t find anything like them in other racing games. We\u2019ve got variety, as well: everyone loves the old American heavy-hitters from the muscle car era, but we\u2019re not neglecting the fun little European and Asian cars from the long-gone decades either. The best part is that you\u2019ll be taking them apart and building them back up again in your garage; the career is as much about your garage and your project cars as it is about racing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exciting Engine</h2>Our in-house ROMU engine is a hell-bent beast that's precision-engineered for high-speed, breakneck racing. We have also already implemented fully deformable soft body car damage, meaning that the cars will react to damage in a very tangible, convincing way. While we're focused on action, motorsport authenticity is not forgotten, either. To that end our engine is simulating vehicle dynamics in a very sophisticated fashion. Rolling resistances, casters and slip angles are definitely not ancient Greek to us, and you as the player will be the one benefiting from our expertise. <br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228380/extras/wallpaper.png?t=1497293052\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EARLY ACCESS FEATURES</h2>The current Early Access release contains four playable cars and a number of tracks, showcasing both white-knuckle track racing and explosive demolition derby action with 24 cars that will give you taste of things to come.
