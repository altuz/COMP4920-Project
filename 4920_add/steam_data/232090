Europe where the outbreak caused by Horzine Biotech\u2019s failed experiment has quickly spread and gained unstoppable momentum, essentially paralyzing the European Union\u2014 Just one month after the events in the original KILLING FLOOR, the specimen clones are everywhere and civilization is in disarray; communications have failed, governments have collapsed, and military forces have been systematically eradicated. The people of Europe know survival and self-preservation too well and lucky survivors have gone into hiding.<br><br>Not all have given up hope though... A group of civilians and mercenaries have banded together to combat the outbreak and established privately funded operation bases across Europe. Upon tracking specimen clone outbreaks, players will descend into zed-laden hot zones and exterminate them.<br><br>KEY FEATURES:<br>\u2022 Visceral Gore - KILLING FLOOR 2 ramps up the gore with a proprietary, high powered persistent blood system bringing new levels of fidelity to the genre. Players will send entrails, severed limbs, and blood flying as they wade through hordes of enemies. But they need to watch out! If caught, enemies will rip them, and their entire party limb from limb<br><br>\u2022 6 player co-op or solo play\u2014 A multitude of varied playable characters await for players to choose from as they enter the fray in online co-op mode or solo mode for those willing to brave the horrific specimens alone<br><br>\u2022 Versus Survival Game Mode - Be the Zed!  A 12 player PvP mode where two teams take turns playing Humans vs. Zeds in a pair of short matches. In the first match, one team plays Humans and the other Zeds until the humans all die during a single round or they beat the boss. For the second match the teams switch sides and when the battle is completed both teams receive a score based on their performance and the higher score wins!<br><br>\u2022 Terrifying Zeds - New enemies and fan favorites from the original game are back with expanded and smarter artificial intelligence, dishing out powerful attacks, working as a group to weaken the player\u2019s party and pushing the challenge level and fear factor to new levels<br><br>\u2022 Unique Blend Of Weaponry - From modern militaristic assault rifles, brutal improvised makeshift weapons, classic historical guns, and off the wall \u201cMad Scientist\u201d weapons, KILLING FLOOR 2 has a unique blend of killing tools that will satisfy any gamer<br><br>\u2022 Expanded Perk System - Perks from the original game have been reimagined with more added to the fold. All perks now progress with meaningful talent choices that amplify different play styles, giving players a progression path that is expansive and full of rewarding milestones<br><br>\u2022 Brutal Melee Combat - KILLING FLOOR 2 reinvents melee combat completely.

Formerly known as Kevin Clamely, the CEO and founder of Horzine Biotech, the Patriarch has found his way to KILLING FLOOR 2 and he\u2019s back with a vengeance. Feared by all, the Patriarch is even deadlier than ever, with new attacks that very few will be able to survive.<br><br>Additionally, two new maps will be included in the Return of the Patriarch Content Pack. The new Farmhouse map takes players into a misty, dimly-lit farmhouse far from civilization. With deadly Zeds crawling around every corner, players must do their best to destroy them all. They\u2019ll also find themselves isolated from humanity in the new Black Forest map where dangerous creatures live deep within the woods.<br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/232090/extras/KF2_Return_of_the_Patriarch_CSI-Small_01.jpg?t=1500904517\"><br><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/232090/extras/KF2_Return_of_the_Patriarch_CSI-Small_02.jpg?t=1500904517\"><br><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/232090/extras/KF2_Return_of_the_Patriarch_CSI-Small_03.jpg?t=1500904517\"><br><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/232090/extras/KF2_Return_of_the_Patriarch_CSI-Small_04.jpg?t=1500904517\"></p><br><h1>Trading Cards</h1><p><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/232090/extras/KF2_SteamTC-launch_Banner.png?t=1500904517\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get ready for a bloody good time this Halloween with monster-sized discounts for both <i>KILLING FLOOR</i> and <i>KILLING FLOOR 2</i>!

The people of Europe know survival and self-preservation too well and lucky survivors have gone into hiding.<br><br>Not all have given up hope though... A group of civilians and mercenaries have banded together to combat the outbreak and established privately funded operation bases across Europe. Upon tracking specimen clone outbreaks, players will descend into zed-laden hot zones and exterminate them.<br><br>KEY FEATURES:<br>\u2022 Visceral Gore - KILLING FLOOR 2 ramps up the gore with a proprietary, high powered persistent blood system bringing new levels of fidelity to the genre. Players will send entrails, severed limbs, and blood flying as they wade through hordes of enemies. But they need to watch out! If caught, enemies will rip them, and their entire party limb from limb<br><br>\u2022 6 player co-op or solo play\u2014 A multitude of varied playable characters await for players to choose from as they enter the fray in online co-op mode or solo mode for those willing to brave the horrific specimens alone<br><br>\u2022 Versus Survival Game Mode - Be the Zed!  A 12 player PvP mode where two teams take turns playing Humans vs. Zeds in a pair of short matches. In the first match, one team plays Humans and the other Zeds until the humans all die during a single round or they beat the boss. For the second match the teams switch sides and when the battle is completed both teams receive a score based on their performance and the higher score wins!<br><br>\u2022 Terrifying Zeds - New enemies and fan favorites from the original game are back with expanded and smarter artificial intelligence, dishing out powerful attacks, working as a group to weaken the player\u2019s party and pushing the challenge level and fear factor to new levels<br><br>\u2022 Unique Blend Of Weaponry - From modern militaristic assault rifles, brutal improvised makeshift weapons, classic historical guns, and off the wall \u201cMad Scientist\u201d weapons, KILLING FLOOR 2 has a unique blend of killing tools that will satisfy any gamer<br><br>\u2022 Expanded Perk System - Perks from the original game have been reimagined with more added to the fold. All perks now progress with meaningful talent choices that amplify different play styles, giving players a progression path that is expansive and full of rewarding milestones<br><br>\u2022 Brutal Melee Combat - KILLING FLOOR 2 reinvents melee combat completely.
