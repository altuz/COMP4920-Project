Instead of having to uncover a killer, The Ship makes you the killer. The main gameplay mechanic revolves around finding your target, called your quarry, and breaking their face as stealthily as possible. To do so there are plenty of lethal odds-and-ends to wield, and even some environmental traps. It's certainly a quirky take on first-person gaming, but it's an entertaining one once you get the hang of it.\u201d<br>7.4 \u2013 <a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/articles/2006/08/25/the-ship-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN</a><br>", "categories": [{"id": 2, "description": "Single-player"}, {"id": 1, "description": "Multi-player"}, {"id": 29, "description": "Steam Trading Cards"}, {"id": 8, "description": "Valve Anti-Cheat enabled"}], "developers": ["Outerlight Ltd."], "genres": [{"id": "1", "description": "Action"}, {"id": "23", "description": "Indie"}, {"id": "3", "description": "RPG"}], "support_info": {"url": "http://www.blazinggriffin.com/", "email": "support@blazinggriffin.com"}, "recommendations": {"total": 5348}, "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1477665793", "publishers": ["Blazing Griffin Ltd."], "type": "game", "name": "The Ship: Murder Party", "detailed_description": "<h1>Buy The Ship: Remasted and get The Ship: Murder Party FREE!</h1><p>You\u2019ll now get <strong>The Ship: Murder Party for FREE when you buy, or own The Ship: Remasted</strong>.
