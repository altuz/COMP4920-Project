Pick your own path through the forest on Myst Island. Listen to the crickets as the sun sets in the Channelwood Age. Relax in the falling leaves in the Selenitic Age. Spin around for a full panoramic tour of Sirrus\u2019 throne room. Seek shelter from the thunderstorm in Stoneship Age.<br><br>And If you\u2019ve ever been overwhelmed by realtime 3D - too many controls or too much motion - realMyst has something for you! You have the option to play the game just like the original Myst - with a simple point and click! Point where you want to go - click the mouse and you move through the world seamlessly to the new location. As a tribute to Myst\u2019s 20th anniversary we\u2019ve also added the original Myst images when you play in this Classic mode.
