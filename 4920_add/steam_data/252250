alien world, toxic to humans, yet lush with new life. Your mission is to colonise this poison eden, survive it's dangers and establish humanity's first foothold in the stars. Created by independent developer Simon Roth, Maia is a space colony simulation game about surviving and thriving on another world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build your Base</h2><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/252250/extras/build_base_V2.jpg?t=1487589827\"><br>Burrow into Maia's mineral rich crust to build and manage a complex base that fulfills your colonist's needs. They'll need somewhere to sleep, somewhere to build and a steady supply of food, water and energy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Enormous Procedurally-Generated World</h2><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/252250/extras/big_world_V2.jpg?t=1487589827\"><br>Twelve light years from earth, the planet 3452C[Maia] circles Tau Ceti. Its atmosphere is toxic, its surface is ravaged by solar flares and meteor blasts and its unstable crust is constantly shifted by earthquakes. Nevertheless, it is theoretically habitable. Explore Maia through a series of vast procedurally generated mission areas, each one up to 2km by 2km in size.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Challenge Yourself</h2><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/252250/extras/missions.jpg?t=1487589827\"><br>In addition to the sandbox mode players can take on four specific missions, with more to come in updates. Deal with an influx of refugees from a stricken space station in Cassiopeia, survive the perpetual night of arctic winter in The Twilight Zone, study Maia's local ecosystem in SN1572 and begin to terraform the planet in the shadow of an active volcano in Stratospheric Sulphates.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Research and Learn from the Planet to Survive</h2><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/252250/extras/research_2_v2.jpg?t=1487589827\"><br>Maia is a hard science fiction game based on real or extrapolated technology. Some of the colonist's tools have been brought with them, but others must be fabricated from what they can find.

Air flow and heat circulation are realistically simulated, emulating the deadly challenge of surviving on an alien world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Advanced Colonists AI</h2><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/252250/extras/people_2_v2.jpg?t=1487589827\"><br>In Maia you don't have direct control of your colonists, they operate on their own initiative, fulfilling their wants and needs.

With enough time and diligent research you can even begin to collect and herd the native wildlife of Maia. Unfortunately most of it tastes terrible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Custom Engine</h2><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/252250/extras/custom_engine_v2.jpg?t=1487589827\"><br>Maia runs on a custom game engine made by independant developer Simon Roth. It is used exclusively in Maia and is purpose built specifically to support this game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Immersive Soundtrack</h2>Maia's immersive sci-fi soundtrack adapts and responds to in game events, ensuring it always reflects the mood of the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Inspiration</h2>Maia was inspired by games such as Dungeon Keeper, Theme Hospital and The Sims. It mixes strategy, management and construction with dark gallows humour about the many dangers of an alien world. Maia also draws from the retro future style of 1970s sci-fi.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">To Come</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A full story driven campaign, several hours long.<br></li><li>More rooms, and new base management systems.<br></li><li>Multiple bases.<br></li><li>More indigenous life forms and a functioning food chain.<br></li><li>Somewhat sassy computers.<br></li><li>Realistic water and lava simulation.<br></li><li>Cats with bee suits.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get Involved</h2><br>One of the great things about early access is being able to have players follow along with the game\u2019s creation.
