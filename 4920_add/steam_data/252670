It\u2019s not. This is a project filled with incredibly smart puzzle design and an important message at its core. Anyone who absentmindedly picked it up during a sale should do themselves a favor and play right now. If you don\u2019t yet own it, then definitely consider making a purchase in the near future. Nihilumbra is a thoroughly enjoyable experience that will stick with you.

Its presentation rivals games like Braid and Limbo. Everything looks hand drawn and a bit ethereal, a mix between a Tim Burton movie and a Jhonen Vasquez comic. The visuals are complemented by an orchestral score that\u2019s just Danny Elfman enough, and narration that is very well voiced for the story. The tone of the game is serious, and the presentation really supports that rather than undermining it and making it come off as silly.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2013/09/23/4cr-plays-nihilumbra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2013/09/23/4cr-plays-nihilumbra/</a><br><br>\u201cNihilumbra shines brightest here (Void Mode). Where the story merely hints at the potential of behind its mechanics, Void Mode demonstrates their genius. It brings out Nihilumbra\u2019s best levels, testing your mettle while retaining the game\u2019s penchant for easily understood puzzles. The mode tests you without employing opaque logic, making you reexamine how you approach problem solving. Plus, there\u2019s even a couple story hooks that bring some additional closure, thus sweetening the deal.
