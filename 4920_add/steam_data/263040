The game\u2019s use of voice synthesis, which makes sense in this context, means that all the robots are fully voiced. Their pronunciation isn\u2019t always dead on, though I still grinned like an idiot when I was able to get Jimmy to address me as Bruce Wayne. I spent a good hour picking through Jimmy\u2019s recollections and even though we weren\u2019t discussing anything deep, it was curiously satisfying.  In its current state, Bot Colony definitely has promise, provided that the game\u2019s developers build on the quality of \u2018Intruder\u2019.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamespew.com/2017/03/bot-colony-preview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameSpew</a><br><br>\u201cObjectively speaking this is becoming a good game since it\u2019s in early access it\u2019s impossible to speak for the final version.
