GameGuru is a recreational game maker, not a professional tool, and is still very much in development.  GameGuru is unsuitable for serious game development projects at this time, and we highly recommend you visit the forums and ask many questions before you make a decision on the game making tool for you.<br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/266310/extras/GameGuru-TGC-Steam.png?t=1505296662\">", "mac_requirements": [], "short_description": "GameGuru is a non-technical, fun and easy to use game maker.
