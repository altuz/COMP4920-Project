Add radar detection, laser detection and tracking and local weapon controllers to give partial or full control to AI. Create anything from a fully AI controlled aircraft carrier to a battery powered drone. <br></li><li>Design custom engines using crank shafts, cylinders, carburetors, super chargers, exhausts and fuel injectors.
