Each mode offers a unique gameplay experience that requires a different approach and hones a separate set of skills.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong></u><br>Two teams of six group together and battle as a team in a race to 40 kills. Fighting as a group and knowing when to play defensively is essential to survival.<br><br></li><li><u><strong>Co-Op Bot Destruction</strong></u><br>Team up with three other pilots for 25 waves of increasingly intense encounters against computer controlled mechs and attack drones. Every fifth wave is led by one or more elite boss mechs that can\u2019t be defeated alone. Move as a group, plan your attack, and spend your resources wisely to eek out a victory against all odds. Co-Op Bot Destruction is currently available on the Facility and Front Line maps, each featuring a unique set of enemies.<br><br></li><li><u><strong>Missile Assault</strong></u><br>Split your team of six into groups and compete over three missile silos spread across the map. Capture a silo and maintain control over it to launch missiles against the enemy team\u2019s base ship. Control all three missile silos to do bonus damage and end the battle even sooner. Flexibility and effective use of items are the key to destroying the enemy base before they destroy yours.<br><br></li><li><u><strong>Siege</strong></u><br>Collect EU from two energy sources in neutral territory and return them to base to launch an attack ship at the enemy base. Fight for control over the Anti Aircraft battery in the center of the map to keep your ship from being shot down before it reaches and destroys the enemy base. There is no time limit in Siege, but every ship you launch is more powerful than the last.<br><br></li><li><u><strong>Deathmatch</strong></u><br>Watch your radar and be careful not to expose yourself until you have the advantage in an intense free-for-all battle. The player with the highest score after 10 minutes wins.<br><br></li><li><u><strong>Co-Op TDM</strong></u><br>Team up with 5 other pilots for online TDM against computer controlled mechs. If you want to jump into a match and have some fun without concerning yourself with human opponents, then this is the mode for you!</li></ul><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/271290/extras/customization.jpg?t=1506975766\"><br><strong>HAWKEN </strong> features a wide range of customization options that allow you to craft a unique look and equipment loadout that other players will remember.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u><strong>Cosmetic</strong></u><br>Strike fear in your enemies and confidence in your allies with unique trim colors &amp; paint patterns, chassis parts, thrusters, and repair drones. Taunt defeated opponents and make your teammates laugh with comic mech emotes and deployable hologram generators. Make yourself at home in your mech by using cockpit decorations, custom HUD colors and different combinations of primary and secondary reticles!<br><br></li><li><u><strong>Practical</strong></u><br>Customize your play style and abilities with passive internals and deployable items. Internals take one to three of six available internal slots and range in effect from giving your mech a unique ability, such as dashing or doing a 180 spin in mid-air, to temporarily boosting damage or healing each time you gain a kill or assist. Items can serve as an additional weapon (e.g. EMPs, Grenades), a deployable piece of equipment that helps you and your teammates (e.g. Portable Scanner, Shield) or one that disrupts your enemies (e.g. Machine Gun or Rocket Turret, Radar Scrambler).

Each mode offers a unique gameplay experience that requires a different approach and hones a separate set of skills.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong></u><br>Two teams of six group together and battle as a team in a race to 40 kills. Fighting as a group and knowing when to play defensively is essential to survival.<br><br></li><li><u><strong>Co-Op Bot Destruction</strong></u><br>Team up with three other pilots for 25 waves of increasingly intense encounters against computer controlled mechs and attack drones. Every fifth wave is led by one or more elite boss mechs that can\u2019t be defeated alone. Move as a group, plan your attack, and spend your resources wisely to eek out a victory against all odds. Co-Op Bot Destruction is currently available on the Facility and Front Line maps, each featuring a unique set of enemies.<br><br></li><li><u><strong>Missile Assault</strong></u><br>Split your team of six into groups and compete over three missile silos spread across the map. Capture a silo and maintain control over it to launch missiles against the enemy team\u2019s base ship. Control all three missile silos to do bonus damage and end the battle even sooner. Flexibility and effective use of items are the key to destroying the enemy base before they destroy yours.<br><br></li><li><u><strong>Siege</strong></u><br>Collect EU from two energy sources in neutral territory and return them to base to launch an attack ship at the enemy base. Fight for control over the Anti Aircraft battery in the center of the map to keep your ship from being shot down before it reaches and destroys the enemy base. There is no time limit in Siege, but every ship you launch is more powerful than the last.<br><br></li><li><u><strong>Deathmatch</strong></u><br>Watch your radar and be careful not to expose yourself until you have the advantage in an intense free-for-all battle. The player with the highest score after 10 minutes wins.<br><br></li><li><u><strong>Co-Op TDM</strong></u><br>Team up with 5 other pilots for online TDM against computer controlled mechs. If you want to jump into a match and have some fun without concerning yourself with human opponents, then this is the mode for you!</li></ul><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/271290/extras/customization.jpg?t=1506975766\"><br><strong>HAWKEN </strong> features a wide range of customization options that allow you to craft a unique look and equipment loadout that other players will remember.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u><strong>Cosmetic</strong></u><br>Strike fear in your enemies and confidence in your allies with unique trim colors &amp; paint patterns, chassis parts, thrusters, and repair drones. Taunt defeated opponents and make your teammates laugh with comic mech emotes and deployable hologram generators. Make yourself at home in your mech by using cockpit decorations, custom HUD colors and different combinations of primary and secondary reticles!<br><br></li><li><u><strong>Practical</strong></u><br>Customize your play style and abilities with passive internals and deployable items. Internals take one to three of six available internal slots and range in effect from giving your mech a unique ability, such as dashing or doing a 180 spin in mid-air, to temporarily boosting damage or healing each time you gain a kill or assist. Items can serve as an additional weapon (e.g. EMPs, Grenades), a deployable piece of equipment that helps you and your teammates (e.g. Portable Scanner, Shield) or one that disrupts your enemies (e.g. Machine Gun or Rocket Turret, Radar Scrambler). Select a loadout that matches your play style to defeat your enemies quickly, support your team, or control tactically important areas of the map.</li></ul><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Guide</h2></strong><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/271290/extras/mechs_big.jpg?t=1506975766\"><br><strong>HAWKEN </strong> offers pilots numerous mechs in three different weight classes that fill a variety of distinct roles on the battlefield.
