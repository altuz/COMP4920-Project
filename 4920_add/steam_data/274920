For sound base tracking you need a microphone. The requirements are based on desktop systems, not mobile (netbooks, ultrabooks, laptops, tablet pc). The mobile versions of processors and graphics adapters are not equivalent to the desktop ones. If you have a mobile PC please make sure the charger is plugged, you are running on the best graphic adapter and in high performance mode.</li></ul>"}, "legal_notice": "\u00a9 2014 Holotech Studios", "genres": [{"description": "Animation & Modeling", "id": "51"}, {"description": "Video Production", "id": "58"}], "supported_languages": "English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, Romanian, Simplified Chinese", "package_groups": [{"title": "Buy FaceRig", "description": "", "selection_text": "Select a purchase option", "is_recurring_subscription": "false", "subs": [{"percent_savings": 0, "price_in_cents_with_discount": 1499, "is_free_license": false, "can_get_free_license": "0", "percent_savings_text": "", "option_description": "", "option_text": "FaceRig - $14.99 USD", "packageid": 37197}], "save_text": "", "name": "default", "display_type": 0}], "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2040621/movie480.webm?t=1447376992", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2040621/movie_max.webm?t=1447376992"}, "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2040621/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1447376992", "id": 2040621, "highlight": true, "name": "FaceRig 1.0 Trailer"}, {"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256658998/movie480.webm?t=1449664459", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256658998/movie_max.webm?t=1449664459"}, "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256658998/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1449664459", "id": 256658998, "highlight": true, "name": "Live2D module release"}], "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/274920/header.jpg?t=1489588071", "website": "http://www.facerig.com", "steam_appid": 274920, "achievements": {"highlighted": [{"path": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/274920/46f6ae1a00a9f4f7dbe82623942ac8934a4c6d15.jpg", "name": "FaceRig Addict"}, {"path": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/274920/93c0ca71e54406cc364a2982cc0e5ec41b39b59e.jpg", "name": "First Pick"}, {"path": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/274920/581fd932da77c996829655e82d15f05fc59a7cca.jpg", "name": "Bronze Picker"}, {"path": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/274920/612485bac35a9095d842f1c03ae6df7b00866dc5.jpg", "name": "Silver Chooser"}, {"path": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/274920/fc2565f6e4fb9764c05744714d4cf9664baec633.jpg", "name": "Gold Digger"}, {"path": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/274920/eeeb3188a18b66dd2236bbe28e113c238f2b2dc4.jpg", "name": "I've been places"}, {"path": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/274920/c1af4d1cf194017e160e48abe2ec5b58ea438662.jpg", "name": "Cat Lady"}, {"path": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/274920/ec4d01a0f47a64a1be0787f32b80c606c2dbf4c8.jpg", "name": "Man's best friends"}, {"path": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/274920/a5d833a7feaf998c6dc7ce675c9ce1c2ad9382d3.jpg", "name": "Fur, it soothes me"}, {"path": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/274920/efe41fd90c5011c9617701960b40402aa0534c8c.jpg", "name": "We make good team!"}], "total": 38}, "platforms": {"windows": true, "mac": false, "linux": false}, "is_free": false, "linux_requirements": [], "name": "FaceRig", "price_overview": {"initial": 1499, "currency": "USD", "discount_percent": 0, "final": 1499}}
