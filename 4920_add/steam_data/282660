EasyAntiCheat eSports is not compatible with any anti-cheat programs other than VAC, therefore you must not run EasyAntiCheat eSports if you wish to play with any other anti-cheat at the same time.

Only games' folders (and subfolders) are verified to contain original game data. EasyAntiCheat eSports may replace or remove permanently any modified or custom game files found in games' folders (and subfolders). The use of any custom models, textures, sprites or other modified game files may lead to permanent ban if they can be considered to give the player an unfair advantage over other players.<br><br>3.

The author of this software and EasyAntiCheat eSports takes no responsibility of screenshots captured outside the Counter-Strike game screen. If any personal or harmful information is captured into a screenshot, the user is fully responsible of the happened incident and any consequences it may result in. (In case this happens to you, please inform your server provider to remove unwanted screenshots from the server.)<br><br>4.
