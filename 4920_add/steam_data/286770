The story itself is pretty much standard Hollywood fluff, so expect betrayals and some stiff banter in the cut-scenes. Shadow Ops makes use of standard first-person shooting techniques, but offers a very helpful lean function that actually is something other developers should rip off. Yes, lean has been used before, but it's very effective and even vital in ShOps.\u201d<br>7/10 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/22/shadow-ops-red-mercury-review?page=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN</a><br><br>\u201cGeneral movement is easy enough, and thankfully the standard control layout you would expect in a first person shooter is here. The action is fast paced, and you will have to keep on your heels to succeed in completing the missions, so a simplified control scheme is a godsend.\u201d<br>7/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamershell.com/pc/shadow_ops_red_mercury/review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GamesHell</a><br><br>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a decent shooter you\u2019ve come to the right place. All of the sounds are superb and the audio separation comes through very clearly. To complement the gunfire and chaos is a heart thumping soundtrack that helps convey the situation. It goes for a sort of middle eastern chant that was prevalent all throughout movies like Black Hawk Down and Gladiator and it works really well here.\u201d<br>6.4/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/Shadow-Ops-Red-Mercury/Item577.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gaming Nexus</a><br>", "recommendations": {"total": 135}, "packages": [39815], "about_the_game": "Race against time and terrorism as a member of the elite counter terrorist team in this all-out first person shooter.
