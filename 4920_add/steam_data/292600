The game has a clever premise: instead of controlling one character, you control two\u2014little dots that are linked together, occupying opposite spots on a single circle. Move a character right, and the other moves left.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/12/the-year-in-elegant-iphone-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The New Yorker</a><br><br>\u201cDuet is a game of few parts, but each one of those parts fits perfectly with the rest.
