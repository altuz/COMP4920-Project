A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well.<br><br><strong>Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.</strong> Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight.

These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.<br><br><strong>You can tame and train animals.</strong> Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists.

If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.<br><br><strong>Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.</strong> Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects.
