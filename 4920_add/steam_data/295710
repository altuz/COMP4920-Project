Your team ages: at 30 their stats start dropping, at 40 their skills follow.

If you like the sound of turn based tactical car combat this is your new holy grail. The physics of car movement, drifting, changing how a car performs offroad and on tarmac, a variety of physics related to each individual car ... I mean, it's all here.\u201d<br>90% \u2013 Game Tunnel<br><br>\u201cMMORPGs get repetitive to me ... Grinding drives me crazy with rage. How many rat-equivalents do you need to smack around before you get to go beat up something else? I think this is a natural state, though, as the game has to appeal to all levels, from the beginner to the seasoned veteran ... With the addition of scouting between cities, and frequent content injections, Darkwind has a lot to do and see in-game no matter the skill level of the player or the composition of the gang. This is a breath of fresh air in what I consider a very stale and one-sided genre of gameplay, where even the behemoth in the market seems destined for repetition.\u201d<br>7.5/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=964\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Inside Mac Games</a><br>", "recommendations": {"total": 415}, "about_the_game": "Battle for survival and supremacy in a gritty post-apocalyptic world of vehicular combat where strategy and tactics determines who wins.<br>Darkwind is a simultaneous turn-based, physics-based game.
