An immediate one-thousand copy donation has already been made for distribution to deployed active duty service members and veterans in need of entertainment and cathartic activities.<br><br>\u201cI fondly remember playing games to relax with my fellow jarheads when I was in the service. Games like Masters of Orion, Command and Conquer, and Doom 2 helped us pass the time on slow days,\u201d said Christian Allen, CEO of Serellan, LLC. \u201cNow that I run a game studio, I wanted to find a way to give back to the services that helped boost my career, and Operation Supply Drop is the perfect partner for us. They have been incredibly supportive to the veteran community and those on active duty, and it\u2019s an honor to contribute to their charitable operations.\u201d<br><br>\u201cPartnering with Christian and Serellan is very exciting,\u201d said Glenn \u201cCommander\u201d Banton, CEO of Operation Supply Drop. \u201cAs a veteran himself, Christian brings an authenticity to military-themed games and joins many others in our mission to support veteran-owned organizations. As Serellan continues to grow, we know it will serve as an inspiration to both active duty and veterans at home, and we expect many to follow in Christian\u2019s boot-steps.\u201d<br><br>ABOUT OPERATION SUPPLY DROP<br><br>Founded in 2010, Operation Supply Drop is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization that brings Veterans and Civilian Supporters together.
