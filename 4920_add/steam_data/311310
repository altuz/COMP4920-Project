We are squashing them one by one, but it's Caribbean - they will keep coming for quite some time.<br><br><strong>Enormous open world</strong> \u2013 Large open world, recreated based on 18th Century maps, historical harbors, positions, and town names. We do not believe in the various modern hand-holding markers, thus player position is not shown on the map: you will have to navigate yourself using compass, sun or landmarks. <i>PS. battles are instanced to allow extremely complex sailing and fighting calculations for 50 ship battles.</i> <br><br><strong>Freedom</strong> \u2013 Build ships, trade, sink enemies of your nation. You can attack anyone almost everywhere. Remember that every action could have consequences. So don't attack everyone - or you will become a pirate. Conquer almost every port in the Caribbean, but remember! other adventurous captains will try to ruin your plans.<br><br><strong>Beautiful ships </strong> \u2013 Accurate hull models, sail plans, guns, internal upgrades, historical speed, turning and heel performance. Ships from small cutters to large 100+ gun 1st rates will allow the player to experience every possible role of the Age of Sail period. <br><br><strong>Realistic sailing</strong> \u2013 Advanced wind and physics model provides for realistic portrayal of ship\u2019s performance in the age of sail.
