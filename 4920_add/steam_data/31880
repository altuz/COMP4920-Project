While this is an impressive accomplishment for any series, that\u2019s not Clock\u2019s only distinction. The game is based on the first book in the Nancy Drew canon, the game\u2019s release date is the 75th anniversary of that book\u2019s publication, and the game is done in period, right down to Nancy\u2019s more-or-less Model A roadster. Clock carries all this baggage effortlessly, providing players with one of the most sprightly entries in the series.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.tap-repeatedly.com/Reviews/Nancy_Drew_12/Clock.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >FourFatChicks</a><br><br>\u201cLike a cake, Her Interactive has all the ingredients \u2013 dialogue, voice work, and story \u2013 to cook up a confection that will be enjoyed by both Junior and Senior detectives.
