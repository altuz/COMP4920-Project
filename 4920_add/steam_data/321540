Leverage professional quality tools and streamlined modeling methods to produce the best 3D models out there. Easily create 3D-based details with instancing and bake to textures that standout from the rest. <br><br>Sculpting: <br>Spend less time sending models back and forth between applications, as MODO indie also contains powerful sculpting tools. Do you already have models created in another app? Don't worry, we have that covered too! MODO indie is better at high resolution data exchange with other sculpting apps than most applications out there. Exchange models with almost 1 to 1 accuracy using vector displacement maps and convert to multiresolution. <br><br>Painting: <br>Paint on a 2D plane or directly on the surface of your 3D model. From connecting to texturing, MODO indie\u2019s robust painting tools can be leveraged to improve the speed and quality of almost every stage of the workflow. <br><br>UV's: <br>UV's were never fun until now. MODO indie comes complete with UV tools that allow for both accuracy and precision. Create that perfect, low-distortion UV map for when painting textures in 2D. Or create an efficient and compact UV map to capture extra detail for 3D painting and baking workflows. It's all about flexibility with MODO indie and, more importantly, keeping technical tasks fun! <br><br>Topology: <br>Too many polygons, no attention paid to surface topology? This and other things can lead to odd, unrealistic animations in your games. The solution is to \u201cretopologize\u201d the model. MODO is known as the retopology tool of choice for professional game developers, and again MODO indie also includes all of these powerful features. <br><br>Shading: <br>Use MODO indie\u2019s's shader tree to develop high quality materials and aid in the creation of in-game textures. Full GI, ray-traced reflections and render outputs let you take your textures to the next level. You can even use MODO indie to composite your shader mask layers together for even greater precision, or use advanced shaders like the occlusion shader to create painterly effects and add dirt/grime. <br><br>Baking: <br>Quickly bake textures and visually get a feel for how your assets will look in context without having to jump into the game. Render layered shader mask outputs to streamline the baking process and provide you with more options to control your texture painting. <br><br>Preview/Rendering: <br>Leverage MODO indie\u2019s powerful rendering engine to preview surfaces and adjust lighting and shader setups directly in app. This allows you to easily visualize complex materials, such as fur, without the need to export to your game first. <br><br>Animation:<br>Ready to make your detailed 3D models come to life? MODO indie\u2019s dynamic 3D animation framework is highly customizable to any size gaming project, and it\u2019s packed with extra features that build on traditional animation techniques in exciting and powerful ways.<br><br>Rigging:<br>MODO indie\u2019s modular node-based rigging system makes it simple to create, edit, and reuse complex character rigs, using a nondestructive and nonlinear toolset that\u2019s fully integrated to give you the flexibility you need.<br><br>Learning: <br>Professional 3D authoring tools can sometimes take a career to learn and afford.
