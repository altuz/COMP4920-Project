Marks is a steal. This is a game that marries vehicular destruction with the depth and structure of something like FTL, and that makes for a fun game to delve into over short periods of time. The range of available stats, items and weapons ensure a good range of strategic depth as you build towards different vehicle loadouts, while the randomised nature of enemies, stages and boss encounters make the challenge unpredictable and at times painfully punishing. Sure, the action could have been a little better, but nonetheless, this is a surprising treat.\u201d<br>8/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamewatcher.com/reviews/death-skid-marks-review/11613\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Watcher</a><br><br>\u201cI've played this a week before release and not found a single bug or had a single issue.
