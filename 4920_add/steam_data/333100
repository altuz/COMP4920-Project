You must forage and hunt for food as well as protect yourself from wild animals and possibly other people trapped inside with you. You must find shelter to survive the unforgiving nights. As you do so, you will very likely encroach on the demesne claimed by someone other than you. The animals of the wild have laid claim to this forgotten land. This is now their demesne. You\u2019re in their world, now\u2026 <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur desire is to combine all the survival aspects of the games you\u2019ve come to love and incorporate beautiful graphics and a much more realistic survival experience. There are no supernatural elements here. It\u2019s you against the things that you would be experiencing in a real survival situation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is not the kind of a game that bores you after a couple of days. It\u2019s a really challenging and realistic project where you have to survive. You will have to hunt, pass the cold rivers of the Taiga, find friends, live in caves or buildings and constantly fight for your life as you explore the beautiful forested areas and man-made structures found on the map! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game will not contain zombies, monsters and anything like that. You will find real human beings and animals found in the real world. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will not find any weapons or items that would not exist in these places and years. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur game is for those of you who want to experience fishing, hunting, exploring nature, adventuring and surviving in the truest sense of the word.

(Vehicles such as a trucks, horses, etc.) <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst of all, you will have to hunt, earning yourself the meat, skin, bones, tendons, etc. If you have no means to cook the meat, you may eat it raw. If you eat the meat raw, you will risk being poisoned or becoming ill. You can also use meat as bait for predators and for fishing. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n* With skin you can craft cloth, belts, rope, bags, tents and sleeping bags. <br />\r\n* With bones you can craft needles, glue, wild game calls and fish-hooks. <br />\r\n*Sinew can be used for thread and rope. Players will also be able to build a temporary shelter and pitch a tent. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt will be necessary to monitor your clothes, so that they are in the good condition, such as dry and warm.
