This creates the most realistic results ever seen in a hockey simulation.  With the new engine, every second of a game is simulated and the engine keeps track of exactly which zones the puck and all players are, at all times. This allows us to simulate the flow of a hockey game much better than before, with each event playing out through the engine.<br><br><strong>Revamped Tactics System</strong>: You can trade for, sign, draft and develop the best and most talented players, but that\u2019s only part of the challenge in Franchise Hockey Manager 2.  In order to truly reach full potential, you will need to put in place the optimal strategies to get the most out of your players.  The tactics system and the entire game engine in Franchise Hockey Manager 2 has been rewritten.
