You remotely control a quad copter exploring an abandoned scientific facility, only able to see via its lidar scanning the surroundings. It\u2019s atmospheric to the max\u2013sounds echoing in empty corridors, clinical beeping coming from the automated defenses of the facility.\u201d<br><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/08/29/it-got-out-containment-protocol-demo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br><br>\u201cTaking gaming back to simple game play Containment Protocol mixes your imagination, memory and ability to play attention to successfully move forward\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://noaksey.com/indie-game/containment-protocol/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Noaksey</a><br><br>\u201cBleak in every way: a story about an escaped nanovirus, an infrared scanner attached to your remote-controlled the only means of seeing and an aggressive military voice over berating your every mistake.
