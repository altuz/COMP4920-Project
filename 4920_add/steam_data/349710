Outmaneuver your enemies with tight controls that make setting traps, disabling and boosting your way to safety light and responsive. Go brute force in arcade or show off your new skills in style, then; gear up for a tense checkpoint romp though an active minefield.

Compete against friends or random internet strangers and reach for the top, soldier.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What others are saying</h2><br><blockquote>Listen, this game is beautiful. Shwip is absolutely a labor of love, I believe that--the controls alone are a testament to the belief. It will take a while to get remotely decent at this, but, the ship is so dexterously controlled and the variety of weapons and movements so diverse in type and usefulness, that you will be able to truly develop your own tailored style of play, completely different from other players, yet highly capable</blockquote><br><blockquote>Seriously addictive, I hope the greenlight is successful as I can't wait to play the full game.</blockquote><br><blockquote>after 55 games tonight.. I think it's fair to say.... I LIKE IT! it has that ok.. just one more round feel. and then I end up playing five more rounds..</blockquote><br><blockquote>I got a chance to play the game and I have to say, this thing is tight! Super polished, very beautiful, and heaps of fun. I used to play the hell out of Beat Hazard, this kind of reminds me of it but way more tactical with the whip and magnet action. </blockquote><br><blockquote>Shwip demo was awesome! Can't wait to never see my name in the leaderboards! @JamhammerGames</blockquote><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>We insist Shwip be played as you wish. So we've given a few cool modes to ensure maximum levels of fun and excitement for everyone.<br><br><strong>Arcade</strong><br>Going out in 15 minutes and need a quick particle induced fix? Buckle up, buddy. This is three minutes of increasingly difficult enemies spawns and swarms with one objective; to turn you into dust. Arcade features all the weapon types but no ship improvements, so you better be ready. This is the arcade mode you grew up with and love, so set those high scores and compete against your friends.<br><br><strong>Style</strong><br>This is where you show off your newly formed Shwip skills. Link up attacks using different weapons, fly dangerously close to your foes, and; minimize your time spent out-of-bounds to increase your style multiplier. Then spend your hard-earned points on upgrades to your Shwip\u2019s awesome arsenal. The difficulty slowly increases, and enemies get harder to kill \u2013 so make sure you always think of new ways to destroy your foes.<br><br><strong>Minefield</strong><br>You\u2019re placed in an desolate environment with a wounded ship, a damaged weapons system and a serious case of home-sickness. There are mines scattered everywhere, and a series of energy fields you need to fly through in order to maintain your ship's integrity. Sound hard? Well then, we're keeping the best part a secret.<br><br><strong>Practice</strong><br>Choose the enemy type and frequency and unleash your might. Great for learning how to gain style points or just to mess around and show off new skills to your friends and family. There are no time limits, so customize your gameplay experience and get your particle fix for the day.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enemies</h2><br>What's a shoot em up without a wide array of enemies to tango with? These foes will have you fiddling with your controllers in ways you never thought possible. Take solace in the beauty of their particle ridden demise. Shwip features a range of enemies from floaty pawns to pack hunting units. You can read more about each enemy on our website!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weapons</h2><br>From industry standard blasters to the Shwip. We give you an awesome array of cool weapons and abilities to use and abuse. Pro-tip : Each weapon has an alternate use. From a whip, to missiles, to mines, to boosting, to blasting to magnets. Destroy your enemies as you please!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Online Leaderboards &amp; Stats</h2><br>Compete against the world and track global stats on our website and in-game. More information is coming as we develop out this feature. Currently it's in a very simple state, but we have big plans.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer</h2><br>W're bring back LOCAL multi-player.
