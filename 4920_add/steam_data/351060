You, the player, plays as a dog named &quot;Fen&quot; who comes into contact with an alien biological agent that bonds the dog/player with an alien life form who calls himself &quot;Tantalus.&quot; The player's objective is to leave Achelous and make it to the nearest spaceport by inducing enough fear into the stationed crew members that they abandon their 5-year long mission on Achelous and leave early. At least that's the plan, there may be higher powers at play.<br><br><strong>You're the Monster:</strong> Player's will take on the role of an alien monster strategically killing off crew members while maintaining their cover as &quot;Fen&quot; the crew's pet dog.<br><br><strong>Stealth, Strategy, and a Fiery Death:</strong> Player's will need to form a strategy to separate and alienate crew members by creating distractions, utilizing the ventilation system, and temporarily knocking out the outpost's power. If players are unable to maintain their cover and stealth or is discovered as the monster, the crew will respond with flamethrower's and you will be destroyed by fire.  <br><br><strong>Alien Planet Setting:</strong> Outpost 13 takes place on Achelous IV, a life viable planet several times larger than earth. Winters and summers last several years each, and it is currently 13 earth months into winter on Achelous.<br><br><strong>The character progression system has been scrapped</strong> for the current Act 1 build, however it may return at a later date.
