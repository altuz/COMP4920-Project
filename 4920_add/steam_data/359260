Word of warning: If you are looking for the usual storyline, crowded HOG scenes, Map, journal, standard puzzles and mini-games, sparkles that show you where to go and a hint system that is helpful, this is NOT your game.I loved the story which may seem a bit out there; I loved the graphics and funny enough, I relly did enjoy the Music.
