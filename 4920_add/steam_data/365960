The simulation supports a full day-night cycle as well as dynamically varying weather conditions such as rain. Tracks feature &quot;real-road&quot; technology that changes the grip as more cars drive on it. You can run full 24 hour endurance events and in multi-player mode, driver swaps are also supported. Everything can be customized by the community, including adding new tracks and cars, and a wealth of add-ons are available on-line.<br><br>rFactor 2 is also an evolving product, which will be updated and added to for many years, so the list of features will expand!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><strong>Physics</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Updated to use multi-core CPU technology<br></li><li>Advanced physics engine<br></li><li>Newly updated tyre model<br></li><li>Driving surface construction, even painted line thickness, affects grip levels<br></li><li>Engine boost and Turbo modeling<br></li><li>Complex aerodynamics<br></li><li>Head physics, cockpit vibrations, detailed bump modeling</li></ul><br><strong>Dynamic Racing Experience</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Real-time day/night lighting transitions<br></li><li>Realistic wet/dry weather transitions<br></li><li>Dynamically laid rubber increases grip throughout racing session(s)<br></li><li>Rubber chunks (\u201cmarbles\u201d) roll off tyres and can affect grip<br></li><li>Tyres sustain damage from poor driving (such as &quot;flatspotting&quot; a tyre) or setups, affecting grip immediately and over time<br></li><li>Dynamically drying racing line after rain<br></li><li>Environments filled with animated events like planes, flag marshalls and more\u2026</li></ul><br><strong>Graphics/Sound</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Real-time day/night lighting transitions<br></li><li>Projected headlights for night time driving<br></li><li>Look to apex and head motion tracking support<br></li><li>DX9 advanced graphics engine<br></li><li>Real-time day/night transitions<br></li><li>Adjust player and opponent volume ratio<br></li><li>See the apex with the Look Ahead slider<br></li><li>Adjust your seat and mirror while in the driver\u2019s seat<br></li><li>Updating real-time scoring towers<br></li><li>Expanded and enhanced gauge and LCD features for vehicle cockpits<br></li><li>Improved loading times<br></li><li>Updated sound engine<br></li><li>Changing engine sounds based on upgraded vehicle performance</li></ul><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>New AI who will race for and defend positions<br></li><li>Define AI opponent types, strength and aggression<br></li><li>Races can be lap based, time based or both<br></li><li>Vehicle upgrade system that affects both the appearance and performance of a vehicle</li></ul><br><strong>Camera/Replays</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\u201cResume from Replay\u201d allows you to resume a race from a saved replay<br></li><li>Full screen monitor and ability to rewind<br></li><li>Freely move camera from any position including the ever famous exclusive Swingman<br></li><li>Spectator mode</li></ul><br><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Opponent car skins automatically transmitted<br></li><li>Completely new multiplayer engine<br></li><li>Dedicated server<br></li><li>Native voting system<br></li><li>Add AI to multiplayer games<br></li><li>Boot and ban player lists that can be passed around<br></li><li>Security checks to combat potential cheating</li></ul><br><strong>Open Architecture</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Support for modder created car and track content<br></li><li>Fully adjustable Showroom, UI and HUD layouts<br></li><li>More Plugin Interfaces<br></li><li>Easy to use customizable multi-language support<br></li><li>Rules to simulate different types of racing<br></li><li>Completely customize your controller<br></li><li>Drop in new vehicle liveries</li></ul><br><strong>Cars and Tracks</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Steam Workshop support for installing cars and tracks<br></li><li>For a current list of cars and tracks shipped with the simulation visit this link to the workshop: <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImageSpaceIncorporated/myworkshopfiles/?appid=365960\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImageSpaceIncorporated/myworkshopfiles/?appid=365960</a></li></ul>", "mac_requirements": [], "demos": [{"description": "rFactor 2 Demo", "appid": 400330}], "short_description": "rFactor 2 is a realistic, easily extendable racing simulation that offers the latest in vehicle and race customization, great graphics, outstanding multiplayer and the height of racing realism.
