It's a local/online party game centered around the concept of &quot;constant one-upmanship.&quot; Power-ups include gems that can be picked up to empower your character with a certain element. Each element has a strength and a weakness (i.e, fire is strong against earth, but water is strong against fire). Also available are Lethal Arms, which can change your default weapon shot from a normal pea-shot to a Gatling, Barrage, Launcher, Ball or Thrower. When these two power-ups are combined they can make a deadly new weapon (i.e, Fire Gem + Thrower = Flamethrower or Water Gem + Thrower = Super Soaker). <br><br>Mix and match your equipment with an expansive arsenal of unique Tactical Arms (which include a teleporter, cement block-maker, homing beacon, bear trap dropper, swingable rope, shot-reflecting shield, magnetball that rips off enemy equipment and a claw that forces your opponents to wear whatever gem you want) and the extra-transportational Power Boots (jet boots for flying, rocket boots for speed and spike boots for stomping out enemies).<br><br>Features include:<br><br>- Single player Challenges Mode with 30 Challenges<br>- Survival Mode for 1-4 Players<br>- Infection Mode - 4 Players (or AI-controlled players) lock into battle for 4 rounds. Each round, someone is selected as an Infected player. That player has to infect everyone else to win the round.<br>- 7 Multiplayer Battle Modes for Local and Online, including: Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Super Gem, Mixed, Last Standing, Trophy and Domination<br>- All Battle Modes can be played with score/stock/time variants, Free-For-All or Team game types and wide variety of gameplay modifiers like Gem Roulette (where every 15 seconds, the player's element switches)<br>- Create-A-Character with 50 unlockable character parts<br>- 6 Unique Arenas<br>- 20 Pieces of Equipment<br>- 47 Steam Achievements<br>- Steam Trading Card Support<br><br>The Story:<br>The Jiblets were a benevolent species that inhabited the world of Septia. Due to overpopulation, a large portion of Jiblets were forced to move underground (these were appropriately referred to as The Descended).
