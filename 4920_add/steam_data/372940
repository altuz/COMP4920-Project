Which seems like a lot to ask for someone wearing red pleather and shoulder pads, regardless of gender, but hey. What's this &quot;great evil&quot; you ask? Well, it might have something to do with the fiery destruction you glimpse being rained down on the very cottage you find yourself standing in front of, though that's a future that will only come to pass if you can't find a way to stop the flaming swordsman who caused it. With mermaids, halflings, portals through space and time, and much more, Lost Lands: The Four Horsemen is a satisfyingly epic and lavish fantasy adventure that's perfect for casual fans looking for a lot of magic.\u201d<br>not shown \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://jayisgames.com/review/lost-lands-the-four-horsemen.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >JayIsGames</a><br>", "recommendations": {"total": 133}, "packages": [68566], "about_the_game": "An exciting adventure of a brave girl who found herself in a fantasy world.
