It combines side-scrolling platform style movement with undead slaying action, and it\u2019s hilarious.  Basically, you\u2019ve got to fight the undead, while dodging giant razor baldes and/or fire and work your way towards bosses. It sounds unplayable, I know, but you\u2019ll be relieved to hear that you are given a chainsaw, and a motorcycle at points. I can imagine those bits aren\u2019t so hard. The most annoying parts aren\u2019t the deaths form zombies or giant bosses though, it\u2019s the unexpected deaths from sneakily placed barbed logs. When you take your first log death, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll know how hard this game is.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.wow247.co.uk/2015/08/14/6-of-the-most-hardcore-indie-games-you-can-play-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >WOW 24/7</a><br>", "about_the_game": "Ted by Dawn is a humor laden throwback to classic action platformers such as Mega Man and Metroid.
