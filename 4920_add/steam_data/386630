All the equations were right, and that led the Nirvana Facility to prosperous times... for around two hours. Gravity could do so much more than deform space time, so much more... and they found it in a &quot;not so good&quot; way.

You must use all the resources at you disposal to proceed, and keep moving foward. You play as Tom Walker, a security guard that wakes up in an empty room inside the Nirvana Facility soon after an emergency evacuation. Right at the beginning, you meet the familiar voice of Doctor Lestrade, the man to instruct you through the various puzzles the facility presents. The puzzles involve interesting gravity shifts, and a gun that can move heavy objects, create anti-gravitational spheres and teleport Walker around.", "developers": ["Jardel Elias"], "support_info": {"url": "", "email": "geniusdev@bol.com.br"}, "publishers": ["Jardel Elias"], "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "31 Jul, 2015"}, "detailed_description": "Nirvana was a company specialized in gravity research.
