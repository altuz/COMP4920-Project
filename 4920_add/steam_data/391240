Forgotten Lore has online matchmaking, playing with friends, an actual in-game text chat with your opponents, workshop support for player to design their own cards built into the game, a complete deck builder with support for as many decks as players can create, tons of unique cards, and an ambitious Tome system. If this wasn't enough, players within Forgotten Lore completely control the community's economy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>At the start of a duel, each player is granted 64 HP. The goal is to get the opponent's HP to zero through turned based combat. Souls are used as currency to summon spirits from pages (cards) within a tome (deck), built before the match. Every card is unique, so there are tons of combinations of abilities.  Not only are the cards unique, but the tome that carry them have special abilities as well. The soul-gathering is actually different for every tome, so matches will be extremely varied. <br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/391240/extras/fissure.jpg?t=1506805034\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deck building</h2>Players start out Forgotten Lore by constructing a tome by filling it with pages before the match. Each tome (deck) can have up to 64 pages (cards). Each tome has a unique ability, so read carefully when deck building! For example, the tome <strong>Leech</strong> grants 2 souls each turn, but slowly kills its user by sapping away 1 HP each turn. With the tome Mill, souls can only be gathered by sacrificing your own pages before summoning them. And lastly, the Necromancer tome gathers souls by instead using the player's HP directly. <br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/391240/extras/cards.jpg?t=1506805034\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Workshop support</h2>Workshop item editing is built directly into the game! Build all sorts of interesting or even overly powered broken monsters! The cards built in the workshop are submitted me directly to look at, after they hit a certain number of votes from other players. Accepted cards with unique art may even earn revenue from the game!
