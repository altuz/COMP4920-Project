New missions provide a more interesting and rounded set of things to do for characters. New conversation questions and a 'meet me' option makes finding people that much easier. The ability to ask characters for transit between cities and planets helps with mid-late game ship management. <br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396680/extras/2016-11-16-1.2-shot-3-small.png?t=1479897759\"><br><br>The addition of Steam Achievements provides an extra opportunity for players to notch up rewards and compare their progress.
