</h2><br>Lift It is a fresh and dynamic game where you have to train your character in order to gain stats. <br>You can do 4 types of exercises: bench press increases your strength, squat your health, deadlift your defense and treadmill your stamina. <br>Increasing your stats will help you to beat your enemies when travelling from the main island (Gym Island) to the other islands. <br>Beat the 8 gym owners in order to get money, that could be used to buy integrators or weapons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Integrators and Weapons </h2><br>With the money you earn you can buy integrators. Each type of integrator can boost a specific stat, doubling it temporarily (3 minutes per dose). <br>Once you have earned enough money, you can also buy some weapons from Bill, the armorer. <br>The weapons you can buy are: swords, armors, shoulder armors, shields and belts, each one affecting a specific stat. <br>These weapons are available in different quality: the cheapest is the wooden quality, then you can find iron, bronze, silver, gold and diamond quality. Higher quality weapons give more stats multiplier.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat </h2><br>You can also practice the sword fight with the 4 trainers in the Gym Island, and get money by beating them. <br>With the skilled combat system, you have to guess where your opponent will hit you (up, down, left or right) and shield that side. You can also attack in the same way and your opponent needs to guess as well where you are hitting him. <br>Other than the Gym Island, up to now there are 2 other islands where you can travel, Labyrinth Island and Zombie Island, but more islands will be added with the updates.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer </h2><br>Fight against other players in a 1 vs 1 sword fight!<br>Other than skills, your stats and weapons quality can make a huge difference!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Other Activities </h2><br>Lift it allows you to do some other activities in the game, such as playing the guitar with Rosario or Larry. 12 keys are assigned to different parts of the songs, so that you can play them in the order you prefer. <br>You can also go to the bar and burp with Benny.
