It is extremely fun to play and the fascination of exploring is tremendous. Acclaim didn't make just a better sequel they made one of the best games of the year. For Turok and action fans you're in for a treat. Expansion pack isn't required to see awesome graphics but it raises resolution to give it a slick more detailed look, which is appreciated.\u201d<br />\r\n100 \u2013 GameGenie<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cIt's bigger and better in every way, including one of the best multiplayer modes ever made in Frag Tag. The addition of extra mission elements makes it as deep as GoldenEye. First-person action gamers will not be able to live without it.\u201d<br />\r\n92 \u2013 Nintendo Power Magazine<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cSo, what are you waiting for? Run right out and buy this game! Remember to buy the Expansion Pak--it\u2019s worth it just for this game, and hopefully there will be future N64 games that will take advantage of it. This may be the best N64 game to date, no joke.\u201d<br />\r\n90 \u2013 HappyPuppy<br />\r\n", "recommendations": {"total": 699}, "packages": [79813], "about_the_game": "<strong><i>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</i></strong> returns to the PC!
