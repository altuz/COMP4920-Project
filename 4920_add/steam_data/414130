Discover what the layout, structure and purpose of the ship was like 103 years ago, and experience the tragic sinking all over again.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> EXPLORE </h2>Explore every deck of the Titanic, from Orlop to Boat-deck. Walk along the promenade deck, or discover how excluded the boilers really were. Discover hidden rooms and amenities, like a swimming pool, bathhouse, squash course and much more. Enjoy the beauty and elegance of the first class, as well as the endless hallways of the lower decks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPERIENCE THE TRAGEDY</h2>The sinking escape mode allows for a deck-by-deck escape from F to Boat Deck. Hurry away from the rising water in search for useable tools and exits in the labyrinth of corridors hidden in the mass of the doomed ocean liner. See the beautiful spaces disappear in the endless water as you try to escape from a freezing death. Find your way to a lifeboat in the dark, cold night, surrounded by nothing more than water and the sound of a creaking, massive ship.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAKE IT SINK</h2>In exploring mode, control when the sinking starts, so you can see which areas fill up with water as the ship slowly sinks below surface.
