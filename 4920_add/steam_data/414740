Four prisoners of war \u2013 Sterling, Rivet, Kurgan and Wolfgang have been freed by \u201cMrs. White,\u201d a secret British Intelligence Operative, who needs someone to take down Hitler and his Third Reich once and for all.

In RAID: World War II, you are fighting the enemy from within. You are up against tough odds, but with enough fire power, determination and recklessness anything is possible.

Each class has their own highly developed Skill Tree, allowing for various play styles.<br></li><li>WAR CRIES - Each class has its own War Cry - a powerful ability that can be unleashed to buff yourself or the entire team. For example, if a player activates the War Cry BERSERK, players won\u2019t consume ammo for a limited time - so they\u2019re free to blast away.<br></li><li>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION - Our four heroes are drawn from the main combatants in the European theatre of World War II - Great Britain, USA, Germany and the Soviet Union. Each character has their own look with fully customizable uniforms making you stand out on the battlefield.<br></li><li>WEAPON MODIFICATIONS - World War II saw the dawn of a whole lot of new weapons. RAID: World War II allows players to play around with these weapons, upgrade and customize their look and feel with authentic weapon modifications. Players can choose between barrels, stocks, fore grips, optic sights and much more allowing for a vast range of different play styles.<br></li><li>OPERATIONS - RAID: World War II offers players the chance to play through extended adventures by undertaking special missions called Operations. Operations is a chained series of highly-modified Raids, featuring new storylines, including content and challenging objectives. The risks are greater, but so are the rewards!<br></li><li>CHALLENGE CARDS - RAID: World War II introducers a new feature where players can earn and spend special Challenge Cards. These let players customize the \u201crules\u201d of a Raid in a buff-debuff way. For example, a Challenge Card might make it so that enemy ammo drops will increase, but at the expense of enemies doing greater damage. Every Challenge Card is different and it\u2019s up to you to find your favorite.<br></li><li>LOCATIONS - RAID: World War II takes place in historic locations across war-torn Europe.
