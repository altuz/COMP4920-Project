However, there are also zombies that you may have to fight against! Thankfully, you are not alone in your plight. There are others in the same situation. Find them, and work together!<br />\r\nWhen looting and even venturing out you have a Survival chance mechanic that gives you odds of survival. This is helpful for deciding to sleep outside by a fire or looting a large building. Be careful with\u00a0your choices as making the wrong one can get you or your teammates killed.
