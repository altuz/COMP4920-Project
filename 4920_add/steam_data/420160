To start, all traces of DLC and IAP have vanished.  We've added custom songs (not possible on mobile).  Controls can switch seamlessly between controller, mouse, keyboard, or any combination thereof, all reconfigurable.  We've refined the UI to work better with larger screens, and added important usability options.  But, of course, the most significant improvement is you, the noble (PC/Mac/Linux) gamer, who will shatter our fair game's records with aplomb and sophistication.
