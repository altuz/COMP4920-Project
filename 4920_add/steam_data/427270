This mode introduces a new, head-to-head way to play OMD!U. In Sabotage, two teams battle on separate versions of the same map, competing to see who can finish their waves with the most rift points still intact. However, both teams can meddle in the other's ability to defend their rift by selecting potions, scrolls, and spells that can interrupt, distract, and disrupt the other team's strategy.Whoever has the most rift points left when all waves are completed wins!<br><strong> </strong><br>Also, beginning with this mode is an exciting new ranking system. Players can compete to become silver, gold, platinum, and finally diamond ranked. Win Sabotage games to become one of the honored few to reach diamond rank! Playerscan also work together to be one of the few guilds at the top of the ranked guild ladder.<br><strong> </strong><br>Have fun, war mages!<br><br>\u00a0<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Redesigned: Score System</h2>All leaderboards have been reset to accommodate new score changes. <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The base score for leaderboards is now entirely dependent on minion kills and combos.</li><li>Players receive an 8x bonus score multiplier for zero deaths. Each deathwill reduce this multiplier by 10%, to a minimum of 1x.</li><li>In Sabotage and Survival, players receive a 4x multiplier for zero rift points lost. Each point lost will reduce this multiplier by 5%, to a minimum of 1x.</li><li>In Endless, each wave completed after wave 5 now provides a 15% bonus to players' scores.</li><li>The time-score bonus has been reworked and is more significant. If a player hits par time, he or she will receive a 2x multiplier. If a player completes a battleground under the par time, they will receive a &gt;2x multiplier. If a player exceeds par time, he or she will receive a multiplier between 1x and 2x.</li><li>The combo point timer on minions now pauses while the minion is in the air.</li><li>Coin is no longer a factor in score.Developer Comment: We were uncomfortable with score being independent from star performance. With these changes, we hope to align perceptions of performing well with higher scores. In addition, these changes should result in combos still being necessary, but not the only consideration in maximizing scores.</li></ul><br>\u00a0<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Redesigned: Chest Opening Sequence</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Players no longer need to click through each card one-by-one.\u00a0Instead,with a single click, all cards are revealed.</li><li>If players have multiple chests, they can now quickly proceed to other chests to open them.Developer Comment: Back when players were not getting multiple chests as rewards, the slow presentation of cards for chest-opening worked well.However, now that players collect many chests and many cards for upgrades, the chest-opening sequence needed to be streamlined. These changes dramatically increase the pace of opening chests.</li></ul><br>\u00a0<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Updated: Enemy Heroes Replaced with Mercenaries</h2>We heard your feedback: enemy heroes are not fun to fight.\u00a0We have created four new mercenaries to replace them that have intelligent AI and will mix up gameplay in different ways.<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Pride Assassin:</strong> An enemy stealth mercenary that will attempt to gank players and run away to heal.</li><li><strong>Bouncer Bear:</strong> An enemy mercenary that escorts minions and tries to forcefully push heroes away.\u00a0Be careful; he will damage barricades if he steps on them.</li><li><strong>Dwarf High Shaman:</strong> This dwarf mercenary occasionally shields the minions around him, making them invulnerable unless heroes cross through his shield.</li><li><strong>Chaotic Kobold Wizard:</strong> A chaotic kobold mercenary that roams the map, placing crystals that slow players and disable traps.</li></ul><br><br>Click below to read the full patch notes and give us your feedback.<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://forums.orcsmustdie.com/discussion/12560/release-2-0-sabotage-commercial-release-notes/p1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Patch Notes &amp; Feedback</a><br><br><strong>Connect!</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Stay up to date on the development of OMDU by following on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/orcsmustdie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OMDGame \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Facebook</a>.</li><li>Get a behind-the-scenes look at Robot life by following on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robotent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RobotEntertainment \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Facebook</a>, and <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.instagram.com/robotent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Instagram</a>.</li><li>Join the community on the <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://forums.orcsmustdie.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >official OMDU forums</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/orcsmustdie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >/r/OrcsMustDie</a>, and the <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discordapp.com/invite/0uqwYy9HdURwNHQp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >community Discord server</a>!</li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/427270/extras/orcs-running-header.jpg?t=1506631698\"><br><strong> </strong><br><strong>We\u2019re listening to you.
