The most interesting aspect of this title is its total reliance on audio, and zero use of visual art. The game features full 3D environments, outlined in details through directional audio and cues, and even features a surprisingly challenging combat system. It's a game full of twists, throwing in numerous styles of gameplay from stealth, horse-riding, combat, and even careful navigation of treacherous terrain. Needless to say it's full of surprises that you might not expect to be possible to develop in a game without visual direction.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.nextpowerup.com/articles/a-blind-legend-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Next Power Up</a><br><br>\u201c\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.journaldugamer.com/2015/10/06/a-blind-legend-mobile-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Journal du gamer</a><br>", "recommendations": {"total": 128}, "packages": [92080], "about_the_game": "A Blind Legend is the first-ever action-adventure game without video \u2013 where ears replace eyes!<br />\r\nDiscover the original, innovative sensory experience of binaural 3D sound.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHEADPHONES ARE COMPULSORY!<br />\r\nAUDIO GAME FULLY ACCESSIBLE TO BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour eyes will be of no help.<br />\r\nSo close them, sharpen your hearing and your blade...<br />\r\nAnd embark on an epic, perilous rite of passage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLive the adventures of Edward Blake, the famous blind knight!
