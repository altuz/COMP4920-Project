Your goal is to rescue the citizens (humans and their pets!) to keep your heroic energy up, and also avoid crashing into buildings, traffic, and Von Pixel\u2019s weapons and traps. <br>If you don\u2019t rescue anyone for a while, your heroic energy will go down; and if it reaches zero, you\u00b4ll lose your powers and fall! <br><br>XBox 360 Controllers, Mouse and Keyboards supported (We truly recommend the controller).<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438000/extras/PIXELMAN_How_to.png?t=1478029662\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combos</h2>Every time you rescue a Pixelian, your combo meter will go up. Once you\u2019ve rescued 5 in a row, your score will start to multiply! BUT, if you fail to rescue a single soul, you meter will deplete, and you\u2019ll have to start all over again. Keep the combos going for maximum high-scorage!<br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438000/extras/PIXELMAN_Combo.png?t=1478029662\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Power Ups</h2>From time to time, you\u2019ll come across a present box. If you grab it, you\u2019ll activate the power up mode! In this mode, your score and combo meter multiply, your speed goes up, and you can\u2019t get hurt! The bad thing is, it only lasts for one hit, so you better watch out! <br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438000/extras/PIXELMAN_PU.png?t=1478029662\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PIXELMAN</h2>He\u2019s Pixville\u2019s senior superhero, his superpowers are flying and untying knots really fast.

In <strong>PIXELMAN</strong> you start on top of a sad soapbox, but to show their gratitude after being rescued, the Pixelians will start building new podiums for you! Can you unlock them all? Are you the hero Pixville needs? Or the hero Pixville deserves?

You can play until your eyes bleed or the speed goes so far up that you can\u2019t control your hero anymore! The goal of the game is to make it to the online leaderboards. And in order to achieve that, you need to maintain your combos going. If you have a high combo and you manage to get a power up, you can make over 1000 points for just one rescue! <br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438000/extras/PIXELMAN_LB.png?t=1478029662\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Achievements</h2>Can you slalom between 50 rockets?
