The number and variation of buildings and objects will be constantly increased during development and it will become more challenging for you to build more advanced buildings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Economy</h2>The economy of the game is our highest priority at the moment. This includes the number of different goods and production facilities but also how trading and resource management performs. We constantly improve and adjust balancing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2>Combat features are a low priority and will be implemented once the economy and building features are more solidly implemented.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Immersion</h2>The last aspect describes the emotional and ethical aspects of the game. We want to provide a grungy post-civilization scenario and believable events in the game. This also describes how detailed the game will be.
