Shattered Skies uses a state-of-the-art Anticheat system developed specifically for the needs of our player base because we know dealing with cheaters is one of the most important parts of running a stable MMO.

Certain rare weapons can also use an assortment of unique weapon skins that can be looted and traded for in the world of Shattered Skies.  <br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GLOBAL VAULT</h2>The Global Vault is a protected permanent storage available to all players.  The Global Vault exists so that you can store your most valuable possessions for use at a later time.
