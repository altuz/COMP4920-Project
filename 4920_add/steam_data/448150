We wanted to provide an awesome MMO expirience but we wanted players to be able to explore the world at their own pace and to discover the games secrets and lore on their own.

We started work on Mystica with the hope of giving fans of 2D mmorpgs a solid game to enjoy, where they can hang out, go on adventures, and maybe make some new friends. Some of our best memories as a child are from all the hours we put into games like Maplestory and Endless Online. We feel that a simpler game allows for a better community of players. As we build up the game we hope to build story through lore and narrative.
