In total, there are 27 stages.<br>\tThe player has at their disposal 04 different weapons for 16 characters (01 starting weapon, 03 unlockables and 12 very well-hidden), each with a unique special ability.

Every main character, when selected, shows a small text saying in what stage his 03 friends are. A main character cannot find the friends of the other main characters. Each one of these friends will ask for two gifts in exchange for their help, and they will tell where the gifts are. When the player has the two gifts, he must return to the stage where the friend was and deliver them. The gifts can only be found if the user has already found the friend who asks for them. After finding both gifts for a friend, the player can use any character to deliver them.
