What begins as a tongue-in-cheek romantic comedy ultimately transforms into an action-packed thrill ride in a war-torn alternate reality, and it\u2019s this drastic-yet-methodical genre twist that makes the final chapter the most highly-revered visual novel of all time. This is a story that will plant seeds in your brain early in the first act that you won\u2019t even notice until they sprout in the third for maximum narrative payoff and crushing emotional impact. Don\u2019t fall for Extra\u2019s cutesy exterior. This series ventures into some of the darkest thematic territory you\u2019ll ever see, and when the final curtain closes, you\u2019ll likely need a forklift to pick your jaw up off the floor. Make no mistake: this is a story that will challenge you in ways few works of fiction dare attempt, and an emotional tour de force unlike any other.<br><br>This game contains the first two arcs: Extra, and Unlimited. The final arc is the story\u2019s massive climax, and is nearly the size of the first two combined.

She calls herself Meiya, and - despite never having met him before - she insists that the two of them are destined for one another. This comes much to the chagrin of his childhood friend Sumika, the girl next door who\u2019s always had feelings for him, who realizes that if she doesn\u2019t act fast, she might just lose him forever. All of which begs the question: just who is Meiya? And do his feelings for Sumika run deeper than he thought? In the end, he\u2019ll need to decide between the girl who\u2019s been with him through thick and thin, or the stranger who claims they\u2019re bound together by fate.<br><br>But that\u2019s only one side of the story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Muv-Luv Unlimited</h2>Just as the page turns on Takeru\u2019s happily ever after, he awakens one morning in a world not his own.

And yet, all the set pieces are the same - his house is still here, albeit dilapidated and barely standing. His school is still here, though it\u2019s now a military academy.
