Carlos (a programmer) and Max (an artist) share a love for simulation games and classic play -- which heavily influenced <i>The Spatials</i>, their first project. Inspired by the great classic sim games of the '90s, <i>The Spatials</i> combined classic base-building gameplay (based on isometric tile room building) with a real-time combat system and an exploration campaign. <i>The Spatials</i> was released on Steam in March 2015 and took off! Thanks to its success and growing fan base, <i>The Spatials</i> spawned a sequel -- <i>The Spatials: Galactology</i>, which updates the original concept with deeper gameplay and a whole new take on the space station management business.", "developers": ["Weird and Wry"], "support_info": {"url": "http://thespatials.com/", "email": "info@weirdandwry.com"}, "publishers": ["Weird and Wry"], "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "7 Jul, 2016"}, "detailed_description": "<h1>Steam Workshop</h1><p>Browse and subscribe to mods created by the community for The Spatials: Galactology.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/450700/extras/Aboutgalactology-small.jpg?t=1505579214\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Spatials are back on a new adventure!</strong></h2><br>The Spatials: Galactology is The Spatials reimagined as a deeper, more rewarding simulation game.

Carlos (a programmer) and Max (an artist) share a love for simulation games and classic play -- which heavily influenced <i>The Spatials</i>, their first project. Inspired by the great classic sim games of the '90s, <i>The Spatials</i> combined classic base-building gameplay (based on isometric tile room building) with a real-time combat system and an exploration campaign. <i>The Spatials</i> was released on Steam in March 2015 and took off! Thanks to its success and growing fan base, <i>The Spatials</i> spawned a sequel -- <i>The Spatials: Galactology</i>, which updates the original concept with deeper gameplay and a whole new take on the space station management business.", "mac_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OS X 10.11<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5 1.3 Ghz (64 bit only!)<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4096 MB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel HD 3000+ / AMD Radeon HD 4000+ / NVIDIA GeForce GT 200+<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 300 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Requires stable OpenGL 3.2 drivers with GLSL support</li></ul>"}, "short_description": "The Spatials are back with Galactology!
