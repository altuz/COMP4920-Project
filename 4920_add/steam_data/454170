In order to maintain world-peace and to stop the terrorist group, Sashiro has to identify the leader by transferring to the school as a student. This won't be an easy task for him who has never attended a public school before and is only specialized in combat. He will meet several suspects with their own background story and has to find out more about them. Will he be able to find out the truth?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Setting and background</h2>This story takes place in the world-line Laedrum in year 2040. The world-line Laedrum was created in year 2017 by a supernatural group that annihilated about three billion humans who had physically harmed other humans; that means criminals were executed, but also children who played tag. The crime rate exponentially decreased and police forces were no longer needed during the the so-called <i>Purge</i>. It lasted for three years and that supernatural group called <i>Xorcerox</i> suddenly disappeared. When those news were spread all over the world, the crime rate increased again; this time without a police. Drastic times require drastic measurements: The World-Peacemakers (WPM) were born. They are the elite of the old special forces from all over the world. Given special rights, such as freedom of act (and thus to kill), they try to maintain world-peace in a <i>humane</i> way.
