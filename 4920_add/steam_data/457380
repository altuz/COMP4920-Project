This is the first, short introduction to a series of episodes of Storm. You wake up in an intense snowstorm.

And as you slowly move forward a bigger question rises: who are you? Where are you? How did you get here?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">INSPIRATION</h2><br>Storm is a game about identity, and about destiny. Storm lives somewhere between a film and a game. We were inspired by the visual beauty of extreme environments; an aesthetically beautiful but deadly experience where your body is pushed to the extreme.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE FUTURE</h2><br>The snowstorm is just the beginning of a bigger project. We have 5 further levels planned out, and a detailed script in-progress. Each level will take place in different environments. A desert sandstorm, a jungle, a city. And each level will be connected by a narrative where your quest for survival is intertwined with your ability to resolve the mystery around your identity.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TEAM</h2><br>Team Storm VR is made of a small group of friends.
