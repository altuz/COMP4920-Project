So should those seeking out a heartfelt, character-driven narrative. Honestly, as long as you\u2019re not opposed to a steampunk and superpowered rendition of the 19th century, then this is quite an engaging tale from start to finish. Few visual novels can manage to create such a distinct setting and ground it as realistically. It\u2019s also impressive whenever an over fifteen hour title can not only keep you reading, but get you obsessed with seeing it through to the end. Sure, there\u2019s a few oddities here and there, but overall Gahkthun of the Golden Lightning has rocketed up the list of must play visual novels on Steam.\u201d<br>4.5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/05/09/review-gahkthun-of-the-golden-lightning/205926/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >HardcoreGamer</a><br>", "packages": [99609], "about_the_game": "The year is 1908.
