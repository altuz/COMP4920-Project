To go from no experience to some level of control takes hours of attempts.<br><br>Racing drones are almost always hand built craft which can vary greatly in size, weight, thrust, acceleration, control delay, PID tuning and rates. So if you have real life flight experience it's highly unlikely that the default configuration of this simulation will match up with your experiences. This simulator should offer you all the settings you need to tweak the game's physics into something that does match the handling of your real life racing drone very closely. <br><br>Experience the rush of FPV racing and even develop real life drone flight skills with the life-like physics found in this sim. If you already have drone racing experience, this sim supports many Radio Controllers and will enable you do develop skills on new challenging courses. If you're just starting out, the game also supports common gamepads and joysticks to get you started.<br>Never got bogged down flying the same courses on repeat, build your own new tracks in the easy to use track builder.
