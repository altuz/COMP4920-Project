As in a real-life situation with un-manned nuclear plants, Gary knows he only has so many days to reach his father with his young daughter in tow, which many post-apocalyptic zombie games never address. Along the way, he must make harrowing decisions to evade zombies, trust other survivors, and redeem himself in the eyes of his daughter, whom he neglected her entire life.
