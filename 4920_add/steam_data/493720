In this Myst-like game inspired by Jules Verne\u2019s universe, use your senses and intelligence to find your way through secret passages and curious machinery.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE STORY</strong></h2>You are teleported to Seleos, the moon of the planet Menra. In front of you, a metal box opens, and inside, you find a note from Ektor Turren, the only survivor of a cataclysmic event that destroyed his world. In his note, he explains that he wishes to leave you the treasure that he accumulated during his whole life.<br><br>From that, you'll have to explore the islands on Seleos to discover who was Ektor Turren, what happened to him and to his world, where to find the treasure and how to go back home with it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></h2>The gameplay is based on exploration, observation, listening and problem solving. With the story\u2019s help, you\u2019ll have to solve puzzles that are integrated in the environment in order to reach the end of this adventure.<br><br>You can take all the time you want to explore and solve the puzzles. No one will come bother you here. The puzzles are neither too hard nor too easy, just like the length of the adventure is neither too long nor too short.

Russlan exclusively composed a wonderful orchestral cinematic music for Haven Moon, making the experience even more captivating.<br><br><strong>A game for everyone</strong><br>Haven Moon is a tranquil game dedicated to contemplation and reflective thinking. It's a calm and solitary place where you hear the sounds of the sea, the wind and the beautiful music. You have all the time you want to explore and solve the various puzzles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>20 YEARS IN THE MAKING</strong></h2>It took me more than 20 years to create this game.
