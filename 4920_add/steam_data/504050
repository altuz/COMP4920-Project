During the first days, I was hardly able to get food. Securing every meal was a life or death struggle back then, while now I have greenhouses to produce food for me. The planet felt strangely Earth-like at first, with atmosphere composition close enough to ours so that the suit filters have no problem processing it for me to breath.

I've built a rover and use it to collect resources from nearby mining spots I set up. It's beautiful out here, but it's not like I intend to settle down and grow old. I'm a building a much bigger version of the rover now. With some clever design choices I should be able to fit it with a generator, 3D printer and stasis chamber so it's all self-reliable and caring to all my needs. I intend to check what's beyond the horizon. Maybe there's a way out. Maybe there are other survivors out there.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Day 26</h2>There was an unexpected turn of events today. The armored gorillas paid me a visit. I don't think they like the mining machines that much so they came to tell me. I thought I could hide inside the base and wait it out, but the beasts started throwing huge rocks at the walls and the walls were caving in with a screeching noise all around me. I fired up the one mining machine I have in my base to serve as a distraction. Luckily enough I scheduled a test run of my new mobile base for this day. It was standing by all powered up and ready.
