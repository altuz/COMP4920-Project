Or maybe it was the bizarre readings eminating from the stellar fragment swirling below. Even stranger, the station looks like it has been almost entirely abandoned.

When you woke up, you found yourself trapped, alone, in a holding cell. Outside, you gaze into a laboratory of horrors. You don't know what they're doing here, and you don't care to find out. Escape the Lab. Find your Ship. Escape the Station. Don't look back.
