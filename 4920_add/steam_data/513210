One: save as many friendly critters as you can! Two: save as many trees by putting out the wild fires! By doing this you will accumulate acorns that can be used as in-game currency to purchase unique cosmetic items in the game. (E.g. hats, shirts, etc) Or; if you want to help good causes in giving back to real world charities and organizations for the victims of wildfires; we also offer unique downloadable content (DLC) that can be purchased with real world currency as well.
