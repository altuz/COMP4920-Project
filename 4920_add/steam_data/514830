But, we found, in our internal testing and observations, that there were many minor things (art polish, optimizations, sounds, etc) that could be worked on to deliver a much better and smoother play experience. Things we want to put the extra time and effort into delivering on launch.<br><br>We know this will disappoint a lot of you who has followed us since Lurking through to Stifled. But, quality is something we at Gattai Games strongly believe in, and we seek your understanding so we may deliver on that belief.<br><br>-Gattai Games' Team</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Stifled is a multi-award winning, VR and Mic-Enabled Sound-Based Survival Thriller, where sound is the only way you see and the enemies <strong>HEAR</strong> your fear. <br><br>In Stifled, the sounds made by your in-game character and yourself through *microphone input reveal the otherwise hidden world through \u2018echolocation\u2019. However, undue noise will attract the attention of creatures lurking in the darkness. To survive, you will have to tread the line between making sounds to see, and staying quiet to stay hidden. <i>(Put the microphone near your nose for even more challenge!)</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">*Microphone Input</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Microphone input is recommended but not necessary.<br></li><li>Sound generation can be replaced with a key input if you choose to.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">VR Support</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Stifled currently supports the use of Oculus DK2, Oculus CV1, and HTC VIVE headsets.</li></ul><br>Please direct your support questions to our Steam forums.<br><br>Stifled is the spiritual successor to our award winning student project, Lurking.", "required_age": 0, "about_the_game": "Stifled is a multi-award winning, VR and Mic-Enabled Sound-Based Survival Thriller, where sound is the only way you see and the enemies <strong>HEAR</strong> your fear. <br><br>In Stifled, the sounds made by your in-game character and yourself through *microphone input reveal the otherwise hidden world through \u2018echolocation\u2019.
