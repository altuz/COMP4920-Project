Cubotrox is an addictive puzzle game that challenges you to complete pixel art images by managing falling neon-colored cubes.

You must manage these cubes to complete the image. Mechanics are rather simple: catch, drop and rotate the cubes and rotate all the screen. But as you progress you start to face increasing challenges related to the limited time, the management of the cubes, the frequency of the cubes\u2019 fall, etc. But there\u2019s no use on explaining this: go play the game. By minute 1 you will say \u201chehe, this is stupidly simple\u201d; but by minute 20 you will be fully engaged and screaming \u201cdamn! I didn\u2019t think of that!

And it also is a HUGE pixel art gallery: +100 levels to be played and even an endless mode (coming soon) that dares you to find your skills\u2019 limit.
