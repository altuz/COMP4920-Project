Occupy the most structures in a territory in order to keep control of it. Territories provide army-wide bonuses and increase the number of troops you can control. Reinforcements you request arrive via your controlled territories. Controlling territories and denying your enemy a foothold are the keys to victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BUILDING OCCUPATION</h2><br>Buildings represent important strategic points; this is primarily an urban war after all. Some buildings unlock abilities, new units, passive bonuses, or squad refreshes. Storm buildings to uproot and destroy entrenched enemy forces. You have full control of your units whether they are inside or outside.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WEAPON ACCURACY &amp; RELOADING</h2><br>Your soldiers must keep a mental count of their ammo, or else they could lack it at a crucial moment. No soldier hits his mark 100% of the time, and no weapon is completely accurate. Distance plays a role. Closing down on your target is dangerous but can yield better results.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COVER</h2><br>The most common cause of death for soldiers of the Laperian conflict is exposure. And bullets. And exposure to bullets. Cover makes your units harder to hit. Troops in cover can be dispatched more easily by flanking and rear attacks.
