The Rusty Lake games are quickly carving out a niche as my favorite point-and-click series of the modern era, with a bold confidence underpinning their unconventional and inventive world.

An empathy for and understanding of even characters that don\u2019t speak a word. A frustration and then exhilaration at solving brain-burning puzzles. And an increased appreciation, love, and fear of Rusty Lake and its shadowy, timeless inhabitants. Roots just happens to have all of this in an even larger, longer package; with more lives on the line; and more reasons to book your stay.\u201d<br>4.5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamezebo.com/2016/11/01/rusty-lake-roots-review-hello-brother/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameZebo</a><br>", "packages": [128416], "support_info": {"email": "http://www.rustylake.com/contact/", "url": "http://www.rustylake.com/"}, "pc_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae XP/Vista/7,8, 10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1.8 Ghz Processor<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Direct X 9.0c compatible video card<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 100 MB available space</li></ul>"}, "name": "Rusty Lake: Roots", "short_description": "Experience the beginning and end of characters' lives and build your own family tree!
