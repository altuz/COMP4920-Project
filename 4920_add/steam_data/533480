You have towers frozen in time at the moment of their collapse, you have professors plotting against one another, and you\u2019ll have dynamic, incredibly complicated relationships between the eighty-some students themselves in your year \u2013 and every enemy you make is going to know how to make fireballs with just a stick and a bad attitude. Good luck with all that.<br><br>At least you'll have magic too. Incantation, the stuff of magical creation? Try not to entomb the city in a horrific magical winter, but otherwise have fun. Negation, the magic of deflection, evaluation, and stillness? Love it. Glamour, the work of illusionists and con artists and ambitious lovers of every stripe? It causes problems, but it\u2019s legal enough. Revision, turning things into other things? Nobody\u2019s going to complain if you fix a tear in your shirt or make your shoe the size of a house.
