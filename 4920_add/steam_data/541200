This is a fully featured Rogue Lite FPS mode for GTTOD which adds infinite replayablity in the shape of procedurally generated levels and enemy placements, as well as weapon purchasing between levels and perma death!<br><br><strong><u>Content update #3: WEAPON UPDATE</u></strong><br><br>This adds more weapons to the base game of GTTOD. These will be put in Grab-A-Gun Vending machines and hidden in crates through the main game, as well as being implemented into Rogue and Emission game modes. I plan on going crazy with this one.

This is the update which will have a fully featured Level editor and workshop support for anyone wanting to publish and share their hand-crafted levels with the world.

God have mercy.<br><br><strong><u>GENERAL UPDATES AND PATCHES</u></strong><br><br>Through the course of development I will also be doing just some regular updates and patches to improve the game.
