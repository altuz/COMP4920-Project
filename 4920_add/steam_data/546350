The enchantment stones can be used on swords and daggers to give them brand new properties like fire and ice. Simply etch an engraving on the sword or dagger you wish to enchant (I tend to use a variety of obscenities in various languages) and then rub the enchantment stone across the dagger until it glows. Job done! You'll have a legendary enchanted sword fit for any adventurer. Just be careful where you wave those stones, we will not be responsible for any third degree burns caused by the use of Enchantment stones.<br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/546350/extras/Scroll_header_3.png?t=1504601018\"><br><br>More often than not, the local adventurers do not maintain their blades.

Repair their blades using the forge, anvil and hammer. Remember, an adventurer with a broken blade is a poor sorry excuse of a man so treat them with kindness and respect...
