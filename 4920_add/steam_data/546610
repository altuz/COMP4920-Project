Take your pick of one of these high speed machines, and your choice of character, and prove you've got the mettle to race with the best, facing off against dangerous courses, and dangerous rivals!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i><u>The Story So Far</u></i></strong></h2>Airbike racing is one of the biggest sports in the galaxy- and for good reason- the thrills, danger, and sheer premise attracts people of all sorts. Of the many organizations out there, the ACRO (Airbike Competetive Racing Organization) is the biggest supporter of the sport, and is also the host of the PAR (Pro Airbike Racing) Grand Prix. There's a great deal that goes into the event, having a great many planets and corporations sponsoring it, in exchange for putting their names on display. The Grand Prix is also notable for its racing field being a mix of both exclusive invitation and yet having open qualifiers for bold racers to claim one of the coveted open spots. It is right after these have concluded that Acro Storm begins, as everyone is preparing for the first race. Countless fears, hopes, dreams, nightmares, and more are all running through their heads as they take the first of those final steps...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u><i>Features</i></u></strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><i><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>Characters</u></li></ul></i></h2>(The features described here will appear in the final build of the game.

Each of these vehicle types are not only generally quite variant to the other categories, but can be customized within their own class, so you can trick out your vehicle just as you like! It's important to find a vehicle type that fits your racing style, as all are viable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>Weapons</u></li></ul></h2>There are a plethora of weapons, both offensive and defensive, to carve yourself a path to the winner's podium in the grand prix. The weapons system is designed in a way that you'll always have multiple weapons to choose from when they're available. It'll take split second reflexes to figure out the right weapon to choose from, and to utilize it effectively- it'll also take those same skills to learn to evade weapons.
