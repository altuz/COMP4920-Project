Carve a unique niche for yourself with RPG-like talent and skill systems, allowing you to tailor your character to any play style.  Expand your technology and knowledge with your faction to unlock new heights of power to wield against your foes.

Will you be lost and forgotten, or will you emerge as champions?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Three Way Faction Warfare</h2><br>Engage in a struggle for dominance between three factions: Order, Conclave, and Revenant.  You will not survive this war alone, and your faction will be your home in the world of Rend.

Enemy factions may also strike while you are vulnerable, so your guard can never be let down.  Just remember, while your base is unprotected, your enemies are also ripe for plunder.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore, Craft, and Research</h2><br>You and your allies will venture forth to explore and collect resource from the world and its dangerous inhabitants.  Upgrade your faction's technology in many different directions as you go, giving you the ability to craft more and more powerful weapons and armor.  Uncover the secrets of the spirit world to bind vanquished creatures to you as mountable companions, and unlock powerful magics to bolster your abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Conquer Your Enemies</h2><br>Hiding deep within the frozen hellscape of the Eternal Wastelands lie the keys to victory.  Long sealed tombs contain powerful artifacts you can use to turn the tide of war to your favor.  You must gather your allies and prepare for a grueling trip through harsh and unforgiving environments, battling against the world's most fearsome denizens.
