When Our Journey Ends felt different than any of the visual novels I\u2019ve played before, yet familiar as if it were an old fairy tale. The story as a whole, including the extra chapters, is something I am very glad I got to experience. I found myself more and more attached to the characters, wanting to know more. Wanting more stories. I felt happy when I finished this visual novel.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://nardio.net/2017/02/24/when-our-journey-ends-a-visual-novel-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Nardio</a><br>", "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/563520/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1491817845", "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "14 Feb, 2017"}}
