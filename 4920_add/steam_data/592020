Dirahl is a beautiful, yet unforgiving world. Will you be the one to save its inhabitants from the reigns of the Auros? Or will you let the Laws of the land be the only deciding factor for freedom? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a world where travel, trade, and technology are highly regulated and vitrually inaccessible for most, your deliveries and decisions could decide the fate of your world. As you traverse the unforgiving terrain, you will come to aid or betray the many factions and classes of Dirahl. With over 160 track pieces and over 50 unique hovercraft parts, no two missions will ever be the same. There are no set maps or tracks, so adapt to your opponents and surroundings in order to succeed. Build your hovercraft, make world-changing decisions, and race against your friends to prove yourself to be the fiercest smuggler on Dirahl in this adrenaline-pumping racing game.", "screenshots":
