The graphic novel is represented through comic art style drawings that are beautifully done, it has plenty of interactive dialogue choices with a rich Chinese style. The Kung Fu elements come alive through the 3D combat system: the moves and the game feel is good; and having one on one combat and group combat has enhanced the variety of ways to play.

But while that may have been a theme previously seen, what hasn\u2019t is the act that this is not simply a game. It is an action graphic novel where readers can follow along in the story, but take over control of the combat scenes with 3D graphic and dialogue choice gameplay. Unlike any other, the worlds of gaming and comics have collided with stunning artistry of 1400 hand drawn illustrations from Asian comic master Daxiong (DC, Dark Horse). The story is an original, filled with ancient Chinese lore, and featuring over 300 combat animations referenced from Master Shifu Longfei Yang.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://fangirlish.com/fangirlish-exclusive-shuyan-star-kristin-kreuk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Fangirlish</a><br>", "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1507056893", "package_groups": [{"subs": [{"price_in_cents_with_discount": 1239, "option_description": "", "is_free_license": false, "can_get_free_license": "0", "option_text": "Shuyan Saga - <span class=\"discount_original_price\">$19.99</span> $12.39 USD", "packageid": 155288, "percent_savings_text": "-38%", "percent_savings": 0}], "title": "Buy Shuyan Saga", "description": "", "selection_text": "Select a purchase option", "save_text": "", "name": "default", "display_type": 0, "is_recurring_subscription": "false"}]}
