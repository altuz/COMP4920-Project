They fought us using the weapons we had created to guarantee liberty. They started by attacking the internet. They then attacked most of the important government positions. The exchange stocks were rapidly falling as revolutions began to burst. People did not have enough money to recover from these assaults, so the government started to opt for extremist politics and made the people be even more revolted. Countries were torned as richest people took power using armed groups. The population started to flee in the countryside, forming communities and little groups, fighting to have a small part of the freedom they once had. Some groups were fighting against others, and some were trying to restore liberty. <br><br>You are in one of these groups. In Burst, you play as a soldier who fights for freedom and democracy in all of the most disastrous and apocalyptic environment to win over your opponent using strategy and communication. Also the game is free, so you can invite all your friends to play with you at no cost !", "mac_requirements": {"recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OS X 10.10.5<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Quad-core Intel, 2.5 GHz or faster<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> OpenGL 4.1 compatible graphics card (with 2GB of VRAM)<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 10 GB available space</li></ul>", "minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OS X 10.10.5<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2.4 Ghz dual core Processor<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel iris Graphics 580<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 10 MB available space</li></ul>"}, "achievements": {"total": 0}, "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/615050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1506322426", "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256683150/movie480.webm?t=1492622388", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256683150/movie_max.webm?t=1492622388"}, "name": "Trailer 1", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256683150/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1492622388", "highlight": true, "id": 256683150}], "recommendations": {"total": 740}, "publishers": ["Brieyla Studios"], "linux_requirements": {"recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> SteamOS<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5 3470 @ 3.2 GHz, AMD FX 8120 @ 3.9 GHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GTX 970 | GTX 1060 | AMD Radeon R9 290 or better<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 10 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX-Compatible using the latest drivers</li></ul>", "minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Linux<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i3-550 | AMD Phenom II X4 955 or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GTX 560 or equivalent<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 10 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX-Compatible using the latest drivers</li></ul>"}, "required_age": 0, "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "26 Aug, 2017"}, "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/615050/header.jpg?t=1506322426", "website": "http://www.BurstTheGame.com", "is_free": true, "genres": [{"description": "Action", "id": "1"}, {"description": "Free to Play", "id": "37"}, {"description": "Indie", "id": "23"}, {"description": "Strategy", "id": "2"}, {"description": "Early Access", "id": "70"}], "short_description": "In Burst, you play as a soldier who fights for freedom and democracy in all of the most disastrous and apocalyptic environment to win over your opponent using strategy and communication.
