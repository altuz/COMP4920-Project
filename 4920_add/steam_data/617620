{"detailed_description": "Once stricken by a deadly plague some years ago, the little city of Aramor struggles to fully recover. Much growth and progress has been made, but will it be enough to save this shell of a city?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour adventure begins as you take on the role of Gabriel, a young man who lives with his mother in Aramor. From what begins as a normal day, you quickly learn that there is nothing normal about it. With a world filled with mystery and conflict, where will your heart take you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n'The Sequel' to the game Disturbed<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the success of the free-to-play Disturbed, a sequel game was announced near the end of the year 2016. With such a demand for more to experience, story planning and development took place immediately. Now after several months, the time has come to share the details with the launch of the Disturbed 2 Greenlight Campaign.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike the first, Disturbed 2 is developed using the Ren'py engine. A lot of the convenient features of saving and achievements are included due to this, along with controller support. Disturbed 2 will not be free however, and with this comes additional features the first game lacked. These additions include steam trading cards and a full original soundtrack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf Discovery and Opportunity<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was clear right away what was working, and not working, based off the reviews given for the first game. The sense of discovery and making choices has never been more important for Disturbed 2. This not only changes the narrative of the story, but how the player tackles various obstacles met throughout the game. Disturbed 1 kept players playing with its mysterious atmosphere and 'choose your own adventure' mechanics. Disturbed 2 does this very thing with more focus and flexibility, giving the player total control on the direction they want to go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike the first game, Disturbed 2 starts the player in a more linear beginning. Context is provided to the player, and once the player is set free, it is up to them how they want the story to go. For those who enjoy a story with depth, there are play options provided for them. Audiences that seek adventure and action from the start will find it easily without having too much story forced on them. Due to this design, the game may take several playthroughs to explore and achieve everything the game offers. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother addition that the first game lacks is a more flushed out combat system. Something people did not like about the first game was the 'trial and error' deaths that would happen in the game. Disturbed 2 tackles this issue by having this audience more in mind. To briefly explain the combat, every weapon and ability has a strength and a weakness. All characters in the game follow this system, and the player can choose what weapons and abilities they can use to meet these challenges as they play. Because of this, there will be multiple ways to solve various puzzles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith these changes and additions stated above, it is done with the intention to provide a unique 'choose your own adventure experience' to the player.", "mac_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> 10.4 or later</li></ul>"}, "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1504074738", "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256682852/movie480.webm?t=1491949741", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256682852/movie_max.webm?t=1491949741"}, "name": "Distubed 2", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256682852/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1491949741", "highlight": true, "id": 256682852}], "screenshots": [{"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617620/ss_e807eed7fab9dd1ea1c371174e6bcb3a0c3b6dd7.600x338.jpg?t=1504074738", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617620/ss_e807eed7fab9dd1ea1c371174e6bcb3a0c3b6dd7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504074738", "id": 0}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617620/ss_0910a7fdd287cd38f3510c9583780dd7184f6190.600x338.jpg?t=1504074738", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617620/ss_0910a7fdd287cd38f3510c9583780dd7184f6190.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504074738", "id": 1}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617620/ss_482f3210623c9b78b08d42888f754be2885f197f.600x338.jpg?t=1504074738", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617620/ss_482f3210623c9b78b08d42888f754be2885f197f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504074738", "id": 2}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617620/ss_37eb4463f451d948f3595422d9ed528a815056bb.600x338.jpg?t=1504074738", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617620/ss_37eb4463f451d948f3595422d9ed528a815056bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504074738", "id": 3}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617620/ss_35b76628b749424799caa6d5824d5d69caae1418.600x338.jpg?t=1504074738", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617620/ss_35b76628b749424799caa6d5824d5d69caae1418.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504074738", "id": 4}], "publishers": ["Brad Moore"], "linux_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> x86 or compatible</li></ul>"}, "required_age": 0, "release_date": {"coming_soon": true, "date": "2017"}, "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617620/header.jpg?t=1504074738", "website": "http://iblackpen.com/", "is_free": false, "genres": [{"description": "Adventure", "id": "25"}, {"description": "Indie", "id": "23"}], "short_description": "Your adventure begins as you take on the role of Gabriel, a young man who lives with his mother in Aramor.
