Then mutate!</h1><p><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/622370/extras/FreakyAwesome_screen.png?t=1506867970\"></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>When you found out that your missing dog was being held at the old factory, your past as an action hero kicked in and you didn\u2019t hesitate: you grabbed your keys, jumped in your car and drove all the way there. Yeah, there are toxic wastes, weird creepy monsters and deadly traps there, and it\u2019s very likely that you will mutate into horrendous shapes and even die a lot, but you would do anything for your four-legged friend \u2013 even becoming a four-legged hairy beast yourself! Fight, mutate, die, repeat: this is Freaky Awesome!<br><br>Freaky Awesome is a hectic action rogue-lite where you have to fight your way out of an old factory, full of mutated monsters and traps; the general layout of the factory and its rooms are procedurally generated. Every enemy leaves behind a poodle of mutagen that can heal you, but also mutates you eventually \u2013 even if you are in the middle of a fight! In order to survive, you will need to adapt quickly to the powers and specific mechanics of every mutation. Tearing off your head to throw it at an enemy? Sure! Laying eggs and seeing tiny copies of you hatching and fighting for you? Why not! And on top of that, you can use objects in combat and develop your character to unlock new powerful skills, as well as play in co-op with up to 4 players!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Fight against weird mutants in this fast-paced rogue-lite<br>    </li><li>Mutate to survive: mutagens replenish your health but also changes you into wild forms \u2013 each with different mechanics and powers!<br>    </li><li>Gain new mutations!
