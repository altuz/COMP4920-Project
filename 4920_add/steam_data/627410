Everything is different on the planet now. Something happened to those ancient forerunners. Now this mysterious world is divided into two - upper and lower ones. Some rational beings live in the upper world. Probably they are descendants of the ancient people as they feel quite cozy and good here. Life of the lower world is completely different.
