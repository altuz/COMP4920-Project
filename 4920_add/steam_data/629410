{"detailed_description": "VectorWave translates the traditional tower defense experience into virtual reality, allowing you the freedom to buy, place, toss, and move towers as you see fit between each wave with almost no need for menus. Each hand serves its own purpose in your efforts to build an impenetrable defense grid against increasingly difficult hordes of malware bent on destroying your mainframe.<br><br>Moving from a 2-D top down perspective in traditional TD games to Virtual Reality allows us to expand on this genre like never before. Because split second decisions and positioning matter, VectorWave's simple, yet versatile, movement and scaling system allows you to either stand directly in the action, or watch your carefully laid out plans from afar. <br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Current Game Features</h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>18 Unique Levels<br>    </li><li>17 Enemy Types<br>    </li><li>15 Towers<br>    </li><li>Unique Player Abilities<br>    </li><li>Achievements<br>    </li><li>Global Leader-boards<br>    </li><li>Trading Cards</li></ul><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Planned Features</h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>20+ Levels<br>    </li><li>New Special Levels<br>    </li><li>25+ Enemy Types<br>    </li><li>22+ Tower Variations</li></ul><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game currently supports the HTC Vive only, Oculus Rift support coming soon</h2></strong><br><br>Please be aware even though we have global and local leaderboards, while this game is in Early Access, constant rebalances mean we must reset every player's scores, along with possibly any save data.
