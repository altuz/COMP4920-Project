The essence of the game is to reach new levels in Planet Control mode, and then pass them in Drone Mode. <br><br>In Planet Control mode the player controls the orbital module, which explores the planet and finds the captured stations. Destroying the aliens' defensive weapon first will give access to most stations. Installing the weapon and the reinforced hull to the orbital module increases your strength. Extracting resources and using the crafting mode to produce all the necessary details are key to winning. Producing these requires certain technologies; they become available after passing the corresponding level in the drone mode. <br><br>The Drone Mode refers to exploration of huge space stations,
