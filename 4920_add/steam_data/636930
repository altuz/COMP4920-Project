{"detailed_description": "Soundscape VR is your own private music venue and a mind-blowing audiovisual experience. Featuring tracks sure to delight all fans of electronic music, Soundscape transports the visual excitement of live music and festival stage production into VR while stripping away the inconveniences (and adding physics-defying twists), paving the way for the next generation of music experiences. In Soundscape you don't have to worry about driving to a music venue, don't have to wait in line, get hassled by security, pay 14 dollars for a beer, stand behind someone taller than you, or suffer poor acoustics from an aging venue. Soundscape represents a new musical frontier and vision of the future where artists can connect directly with fans. Now their artistic vision is unlimited, not restricted by the deals they can make with labels, venues, or corporations. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nSoundscape is a cutting edge virtual reality visual experience, and even a 1080ti with supersampling will be heavily taxed. Enjoy Soundscape sitting or standing. Requires a VR headset and motion controllers. Check back with Soundscape often as new upgrades and songs are added constantly, always for free.", "mac_requirements": [], "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/636930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1501815579", "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256691014/movie480.webm?t=1500874015", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256691014/movie_max.webm?t=1500874015"}, "name": "Soundscape VR - Evolution", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256691014/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1500874015", "highlight": true, "id": 256691014}], "publishers": ["Groove Science"], "linux_requirements": [], "required_age": 0, "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "16 May, 2017"}, "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/636930/header.jpg?t=1501815579", "website": "http://www.musicvisualized.com", "is_free": true, "genres": [{"description": "Free to Play", "id": "37"}], "short_description": "Get teleported to a psychedelic world of music and light in this brand new VR experience.
