In the case of Run of Mydan... I think we have an answer. Though only in Early Access, this VR debut from Virtew surpasses many of the more simplistic linear action games I\u2019ve seen in recent weeks and months with its active, engaging gameplay. Run of Mydan is a wonderfully breezy and liberating experience... Leaning out of the way of swinging axes and rotating blades while fending off a legion of drone-like enemies had an air of stylish superheroics to it that many superhero VR games can\u2019t actually capture ...this could be one of the unexpected champions of VR gaming.\u201d<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://uploadvr.com/run-of-mydan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >UploadVR</a><br><br>\u201cNever during my time in the game did my movement feel too inhibited, which is a really hard thing to accomplish with an on the rails shooter. However, I think the thing that stood out for me most is how the developers incorporated so many elements into the environment of the game... if you\u2019re looking for an exciting new experience, then I would recommend you give Run of Mydan a try. The game offers an experience that gets your heart pumping as you fend off enemy attacks while dodging blades and trying to get in a few hits for good measure. I think...Run of Mydan might just become one of the go-to VR sports titles in the future...\u201d<br>7.8 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://vrthegamers.com/run-of-mydan-review-new-type-on-rails-shooter/#.WagRMrJJaUk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >VR The Gamers</a><br>", "legal_notice": "\u00a92017.
