Experience one of the world's favorite games of strategy in a beautifully rendered fantasy world where magic is the norm, wielded with just a flick of the wrist. You won't find any stylised icon interfaces here - this is the way chess against an AI is meant to be played. Even though it is still in Early Access, this is an exquisitely polished single player game. A full release is planned for the inclusion of multi-player gaming. Featuring numerous levels of difficulty, this game will pose a challenge for players of all abilities, from beginners to grandmasters. With graphics rendered in Unreal Engine 4 and AI powered by the Stockfish Chess Engine, Magician's Gambit provides plenty of eye candy for casual gamers whilst still providing a real challenge for serious chess players.", "mac_requirements": [], "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649120/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1504857621", "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256692473/movie480.webm?t=1502512026", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256692473/movie_max.webm?t=1502512026"}, "name": "Gameplay Teaser", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256692473/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1502512026", "highlight": true, "id": 256692473}], "screenshots": [{"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649120/ss_3ebf57db2ed632ea54a21a66099f609d5b66ec55.600x338.jpg?t=1504857621", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649120/ss_3ebf57db2ed632ea54a21a66099f609d5b66ec55.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504857621", "id": 0}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649120/ss_a35a516449299f352fe1cc336fd18f5f5f4501b2.600x338.jpg?t=1504857621", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649120/ss_a35a516449299f352fe1cc336fd18f5f5f4501b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504857621", "id": 1}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649120/ss_dd87b892c4e38956ecb163955ecba36f9d98643f.600x338.jpg?t=1504857621", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649120/ss_dd87b892c4e38956ecb163955ecba36f9d98643f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504857621", "id": 2}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649120/ss_6c30856684f75814bf516b369e7e00af0094d4bb.600x338.jpg?t=1504857621", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649120/ss_6c30856684f75814bf516b369e7e00af0094d4bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504857621", "id": 3}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649120/ss_b638a7127738ad33bc4c22c6407d976fdf5aea02.600x338.jpg?t=1504857621", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649120/ss_b638a7127738ad33bc4c22c6407d976fdf5aea02.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504857621", "id": 4}], "developers": ["Coding Caveman"], "linux_requirements": [], "required_age": 0, "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "1 Sep, 2017"}, "platforms": {"windows": true, "mac": false, "linux": false}, "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/649120/header.jpg?t=1504857621", "website": "http://www.codingcaveman.com/magicians_gambit/", "is_free": false, "genres": [{"description": "Casual", "id": "4"}, {"description": "Indie", "id": "23"}, {"description": "Strategy", "id": "2"}, {"description": "Early Access", "id": "70"}], "short_description": "Chess!
