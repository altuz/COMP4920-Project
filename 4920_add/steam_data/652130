At all times they are under scrutiny by an alien duo, one with likeness of a French Philosopher Voltaire and the other as Venetian Renaissance painter Tiziano, besides a common Raven, who appears to take great interest into the plight of the Hero and his friend.<br><br>        The game has a total of 21 levels, the first twenty being self sufficient dungeons of various lengths.<br>        The final level takes place in a village possessed by the 'evil shaggy one', where the whole story comes to a final wrap.<br><br>The story, characters and places are heavily influenced with everything from images of 'Lost in Space', 'Black Adder' or 'Monty Python' to words from the likes of 'Gargantua &amp; Pentagruel' &amp; 'Decameron' and strokes from painters like Pieter Brueghel, Van Eyck
