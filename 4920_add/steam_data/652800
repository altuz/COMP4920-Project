{"detailed_description": "Simultaneously a love letter to and a parody of classic role-playing games, Sojourner is the retro RPG that the world has been craving, but just didn't know it. By gracefully mixing modern gameplay elements with a familiar retro aesthetic, Sojourner features everything that you loved from the 8-bit RPGs of your childhood and leaves behind everything you didn't. Drawing heavy inspiration from NES classics like Mother (Earthbound), Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, and Legend of Zelda, while bringing in an original style and quirkiness all its own, Sojourner is a glorious blend of the old and the new, making for a very playable, very fun adventure for anyone who is a fan of the classics or simply a fan of RPGs in general. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Embark
