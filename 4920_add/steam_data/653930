{"detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About Tiny Town VR</h2><br>Tiny Town VR is a casual world-building game in virtual reality, inspired by the nostalgic storytelling power of LEGO and action figures mixed with the excitement of constructing something new. Build your world, big or small, then fill it with any of over a thousand objects. Add characters whose joints can be pushed, pulled and twisted into any pose imaginable, then give them a voice with custom speech bubbles. Once the scene is set, capture your story using the in-game camera, add captions, then save it or share it with your friends, direct to Facebook. Make something funny. Make something powerful.
