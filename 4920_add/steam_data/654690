Supplies are running low.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Day 15</strong></h2>I crafted some basic tools and hunted for fish. Let\u2019s hope I didn\u2019t attract any predators. Fresh water is still a problem.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Day 17</strong></h2>I found a huge reef. It\u2019s full of life and old wrecks. I salvaged a lot of useful materials from the depths and might be able to build a platform, like an ark or something.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Day 29</strong></h2>Welcome to my new home! It\u2019s not beautiful, but a suitable shelter. I also found a way to distill water, so I should be safe for the moment.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Day 30</strong></h2>I\u2019m trying to refine my crafted equipment for further exploration.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Day 34</strong></h2>Another reef, but something is different. The water seems darker here. I found an artifact near a strange stone formation. It looked like a sunken pyramid or temple. I spotted some sharks, so I marked the position for later.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Day 41</strong></h2>I was right about the stone formation, it\u2019s an ancient building. There is a small entrance but I only found empty chambers inside. I need more oxygen and a light source to dive deeper into this labyrinth.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Day 44</strong></h2>Strange things are happening! Something awoke! I saw lights moving in the depths...<br><br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/extras/bermuda_steam_spacer.png?t=1506787841\">", "mac_requirements": [], "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1506787841", "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256687875/movie480.webm?t=1499025185", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256687875/movie_max.webm?t=1499025185"}, "name": "Bermuda - Early Access Trailer", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256687875/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1499025185", "highlight": true, "id": 256687875}], "screenshots": [{"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_794971f94fc5bfdaad14f8219b32132ce578b34b.600x338.jpg?t=1506787841", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_794971f94fc5bfdaad14f8219b32132ce578b34b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506787841", "id": 0}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_f925d508cad27dda63a90f375dd1823c82e8b6ad.600x338.jpg?t=1506787841", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_f925d508cad27dda63a90f375dd1823c82e8b6ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506787841", "id": 1}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_1d7b35c5d77ae25ae68a12df83b64e9477683ca9.600x338.jpg?t=1506787841", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_1d7b35c5d77ae25ae68a12df83b64e9477683ca9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506787841", "id": 2}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_5d6d5a7e6fd098327cf50ebf4d867ad0668bb74a.600x338.jpg?t=1506787841", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_5d6d5a7e6fd098327cf50ebf4d867ad0668bb74a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506787841", "id": 3}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_47502b2d26f76af890ae350504e9c33d4ae05859.600x338.jpg?t=1506787841", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_47502b2d26f76af890ae350504e9c33d4ae05859.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506787841", "id": 4}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_aeec96f8e65802abaf77298ff14bdc9c9668809c.600x338.jpg?t=1506787841", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_aeec96f8e65802abaf77298ff14bdc9c9668809c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506787841", "id": 5}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_da4122a895e9c4f1ebc8c643275dda089b200cca.600x338.jpg?t=1506787841", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_da4122a895e9c4f1ebc8c643275dda089b200cca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506787841", "id": 6}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_08f2d1abd94ed91a894e5d1e22b9a2f24ff96e85.600x338.jpg?t=1506787841", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_08f2d1abd94ed91a894e5d1e22b9a2f24ff96e85.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506787841", "id": 7}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_581e75e42552c7a2d08ca2ab4fe27bfc08b2d2dc.600x338.jpg?t=1506787841", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_581e75e42552c7a2d08ca2ab4fe27bfc08b2d2dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506787841", "id": 8}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_cad1568e177ff95382bf1226d44edb81982be785.600x338.jpg?t=1506787841", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/ss_cad1568e177ff95382bf1226d44edb81982be785.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506787841", "id": 9}], "developers": ["NIGHTBOX"], "linux_requirements": [], "required_age": 0, "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "29 Sep, 2017"}, "packages": [184564], "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654690/header.jpg?t=1506787841", "website": "http://www.bermuda-lost-survival.com", "is_free": false, "genres": [{"description": "Action", "id": "1"}, {"description": "Adventure", "id": "25"}, {"description": "Indie", "id": "23"}, {"description": "Strategy", "id": "2"}, {"description": "Early Access", "id": "70"}], "short_description": "Survivors, Adventurers, Explorers!
