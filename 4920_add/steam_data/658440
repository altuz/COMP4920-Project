{"detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story So Far</h2><br>The 21st century saw the dwindling of resources, large scale extinction and an overpopulation crisis that led to a desperate final effort to prevent further destruction to Earth\u2018s ecosystem. Rapid progression in the field of virtual reality offered the opportunity to escape from the increasingly dire conditions on Earth; an attractive proposition that saw millions migrate to a series of underground facilities. These facilities were provided with an independent oxygen supply generated by artificial environments housing a wide range of flourishing fauna and flora. <br><br>Tensions rose between the limited law enforcement institutions on the surface and the disgruntled masses leading to the establishment of an autocratic entity known as the Watchdog. The Watchdog erected small police states that ensured the safety and security of the underground facilities providing them with the most sophisticated and lethal security devices available. As time passed and the Earth began to heal more rapidly habitable zones were established and now the time has come for everyone to return to the surface.<br><br>Players assume the role of Jill, a botanist who has been plucked from a Watchdog police state and placed within a team overlooking the exodus from an oxygen production facility. The Watchdog\u2019s intentions with Jill aren\u2019t as simple or innocent as they may seem and while Jill\u2019s life prior to Watchdog subsumption has been buried it\u2019s beginning to catch up with her.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Outline</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Enshrouded World breathes new life into vehicular combat, a genre consisting mostly of action orientated racing games by incorporating survival elements and a unique approach to the way in which the player progresses through the world. <br><br></li><li>The key components of Enshrouded World\u2019s gameplay are combat, exploration, survival and management which are intertwined by a central relationship between the player and their hovercraft. Resources important to the player\u2019s survival are scattered throughout environments that may only be scavenged outside the safety of the hovercraft.
