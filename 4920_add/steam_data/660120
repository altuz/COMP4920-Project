{"detailed_description": "Lunch Truck Tycoon 2, Lunch Is Served<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore the open world of Lunch Truck Tycoon 2. Win all 12 competitions, earn the trophies for all 3 regions, find all of the hidden gems, become the grandmaster of Luncher Island.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory Mode \u2013 Maliciously Rotten<br />\r\nLunch Truck Tycoon 2 will include a story mode known as \u201cMaliciously Rotten\u201d. Shortly after the conclusion of the tutorial, Maliciously Rotten kicks in and you are tasked to track down the source of the rotten food and who is delivering it to the lunchers. Make deliveries, sell items and find objects are all part of the story mode in Lunch Truck Tycoon 2. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDynamic Economy<br />\r\nLunch Truck Tycoon 2 will feature a Dynamic Economy that will allow for an ever changing environment. Prices are constantly changing, therefore so are your profits. A hamburger needs beef but the latest shipment hasn\u2019t arrived yet and the demand is causing the price to go up. What do you do? Push the expense off to the customer or acknowledge the fact that you will be losing profit till the situation is resolved. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCompetitions<br />\r\nCompete against the clock to unlock signature items! Discover the recipe, then discover the amount of ingredients needed to craft the signature item. If you complete the challenge, you will then be able to craft the signature item and sell it to the lunchers. These sought after items can be sold at a much higher price therefore creating a higher profit margin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDelivery Missions<br />\r\nNot all lunch is easy to distribute amongst the lunchers. That\u2019s where your delivery service comes into play! See a luncher in need? Grab the delivery request from them and then setoff to your destination. Get there in time to receive the delivery bonus or receive nothing at all! Be sure to have the right truck for the job as speed is a big factor in this game mode. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nProgressive Environment<br />\r\nWith an active day night cycle, lunchers are always on the move. From morning rush hour in the suburbs to the lunch traffic in the city to the after-hours hot spots in the slums. Finding where the lunchers are amassing can make or break your day. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCatering Gigs<br />\r\nOnce unlocked, you can drive over to the catering building and grab a new catering gig. Here you will have to put together a larger order then deliver it to its destination. Don\u2019t worry, you will have several hours (in game hours) to complete the gig! But if you don\u2019t, you can potentially be stuck with a surplus of product.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvents<br />\r\nEvents popup all over the Island at any given time. For example, the game just ended and there will be a mad rush of lunchers leaving the arena. Head to the arenas main entrance to take advantage of the situation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u2022\tStory Mode \u2013 Maliciously Rotten<br />\r\n\u2022\tDynamic Economy<br />\r\n\u2022\tCompetitions<br
