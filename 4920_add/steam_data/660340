{"detailed_description": "The first in a 3 part series, Robot King follows the journey of a robot on a quest to find his place in a kingdom where everyone seems bent on his destruction. Navigate through 4 unique areas, collecting gold as you go. Customize your robot with 40 possible equipments. But with only 10 equipment slots, various builds will have to be utilized to make it through the harsh terrain and boss levels. Combined with 2 different gameplay modes, Robot King offers a wide variety of options for different player styles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe uniqueness, and challenge, of Robot King lies in 2 key game design aspects: you cannot farm gold, and you can only save, purchase and repair at the shop. The tedium of farming gold is missing from Robot King. There is a finite amount of gold to be had in the game, encouraging full exploration of the map. Your robot starts in the center of the map and can venture out in any direction. But you can only purchase equipment, save, and repair your robot at the center. The further away from the center you travel, the riskier and more dangerous it becomes. This makes planning equipment combinations all the more important.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is nothing stock about Robot King.
