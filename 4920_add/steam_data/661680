{"detailed_description": "<img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/extras/b.png?t=1498820238\"><br>Growbot is a 2D point-and-click adventure game in which you play as Nara, a student growbot on her first day of captaincy training on board a space station. Before you can learn more about your new home's ecosystem of alien flowers and strange creatures, an attack by an unknown force infests the station with large and quickly growing crystals. Communication is cut off, and so you venture out of your room in search of your captain. Along the way you must make new friends, fix the station's strange machinery, and discover the origins of the crystalline force spreading throughout the station. <br><br>The game is inspired by classic adventure games like Loom, modern adventure games like Machinarium, and aims to appeal to both seasoned and new gamers. It is being developed in Unity for Windows and Mac.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A story set aboard a space station populated by beautiful plants and starring a cast of strange alien creatures.<br></li><li>Puzzles that are satisfying yet accessible to people of all ages, including those who are inexperienced with games.<br></li><li>A beautiful world to explore, with world and characters drawn by an award-winning illustrator.<br></li><li>Meet a fluffy white hologram called Star Belly with spaghetti arms and a universe in his tummy.<br></li><li>Wonderful music by musician Jessica Fichot.<br></li><li>IndieCade 2016 Digital Select.</li></ul><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/extras/a.png?t=1498820238\">", "mac_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> OS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 5 GB available space</li></ul>"}, "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1498820238", "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256688803/movie480.webm?t=1498820225", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256688803/movie_max.webm?t=1498820225"}, "name": "Growbot Teaser Trailer", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256688803/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1498820225", "highlight": true, "id": 256688803}], "screenshots": [{"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_5a97a411a73b16c2744963eb79db344864b38c3b.600x338.jpg?t=1498820238", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_5a97a411a73b16c2744963eb79db344864b38c3b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498820238", "id": 0}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_2d7f6b1eb913566792e0652d1de56feefe0005fa.600x338.jpg?t=1498820238", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_2d7f6b1eb913566792e0652d1de56feefe0005fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498820238", "id": 1}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_420f5a96930ede6a5f499cd3bcfd79b52f049747.600x338.jpg?t=1498820238", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_420f5a96930ede6a5f499cd3bcfd79b52f049747.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498820238", "id": 2}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_b5c36af0355e7bd31e46cb2920941621b3c08203.600x338.jpg?t=1498820238", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_b5c36af0355e7bd31e46cb2920941621b3c08203.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498820238", "id": 3}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_d3457e3052361220183a90343e4f3530f23fd040.600x338.jpg?t=1498820238", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_d3457e3052361220183a90343e4f3530f23fd040.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498820238", "id": 4}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_6094593bc2f391469ef6d06c8d89870da4c15dab.600x338.jpg?t=1498820238", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_6094593bc2f391469ef6d06c8d89870da4c15dab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498820238", "id": 5}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_7fe02a33eaed86ea11d1b516a7065886f9621e1e.600x338.jpg?t=1498820238", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_7fe02a33eaed86ea11d1b516a7065886f9621e1e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498820238", "id": 6}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_a15abb42b4cff83bf4fcc7b6ff55d8ce2aee8f5c.600x338.jpg?t=1498820238", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/ss_a15abb42b4cff83bf4fcc7b6ff55d8ce2aee8f5c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498820238", "id": 7}], "publishers": ["Wabisabi Games"], "linux_requirements": [], "required_age": 0, "release_date": {"coming_soon": true, "date": "To be announced"}, "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/header.jpg?t=1498820238", "website": "http://growbotgame.com", "is_free": false, "genres": [{"description": "Adventure", "id": "25"}, {"description": "Indie", "id": "23"}], "short_description": "Growbot is a point-and-click adventure about a robot saving her home, a dark crystalline force, and a space station bursting with plants and aliens.", "supported_languages": "English", "about_the_game": "<img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/661680/extras/b.png?t=1498820238\"><br>Growbot is a 2D point-and-click adventure game in which you play as Nara, a student growbot on her first day of captaincy training on board a space station.
