Players will venture into a Wasteland-inspired dungeon known as the Ark and experience a risky journey plagued by crisis. <br><br>The original inhabitants of this dim underground complex and those who have dared to enter it have either died or have lost their mind.

Some wasteland tramp discovered that the asteroid shards grant possessors unexplained powers; so they founded this cult, calling it the 'Scientific Church of Enlightenment' and this 'Church of Enlightenment' built the Ark and they built a whole city around it. It's gonna be where the restoration of humanity starts, they said. But just look around you; these streets are all empty, not a soul to be seen at all now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sounds worthy of <span class=\"bb_spoiler\">your life to have</span> a look... right?&quot;<br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/663300/extras/game_features.png?t=1502342991\"><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Procedurally-generated Dungeons - In the underground complex of The Ark, use the environment to your advantage as you fight against enemies in challenging scenarios that change every time you enter the game.<br></li><li>Unlockable Weapons and Items - As you return to the starting camp after death, talk to the different merchant to purchase potent unlockables like new guns and other consumables to help you on your next journey.<br></li><li>Difficulty and Hardcore Play - In the beginning you may die a lot, maybe even &quot;a lot&quot; a lot.
