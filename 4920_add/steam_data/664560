{"detailed_description": "Are you tired of recalling robots, working a simulated job, training to be a pirate in space, or enjoying the weather in Arizona? Then it's time to take a relaxing trip to the DreamTank, a sweeping musical journey that takes you through randomly generated alien worlds in an interaction-light VR experience. <br><br>DreamTank contains ten different DreamTracks--the musical score that drives the visuals--with each experience beginning with simple shapes and a muted color palette, and then as the DreamTrack plays on, the worlds become more vivid, the shapes more complex, and the colors more vibrant. Watch the sun rise and set over alien worlds, see massive objects float through the sky above you, and watch distant comets burn through the night sky backlit by stars and planets--each world a randomly generated snapshot that will be unique to your experience!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DreamTank is an interaction-light experience!</strong> </h2>DreamTank was created to be something that was observed, something that was relaxing and something that would inspire the imagination. This means that there is no teleportation, no weapons, no gravity guns or terrain manipulators, and this is by design! DreamTank is the kind of experience you would want to do when you don't want to do anything, just watch and experience the worlds it makes for you!
