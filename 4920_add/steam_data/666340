{"detailed_description": "You find yourself trapped in a stone basement, locked in by an unknown mastermind. Your task is simple: to escape by completing the series of challenges and puzzles set before you. You have one hour before the bomb he's left with you detonates. Can you discover the inner workings of the game and complete the challenges in time, or is your gruesome fate inescapable?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInescapable VR: Underground is the first entry in a series of made-for-VR escape room games to be released on Steam. In it you'll find puzzles ranging from relatively simple to quite complex, with clues both transparent and cleverly obfuscated. We've endeavored to keep objects true to their real world counterparts and to give the player the tools they need to interact with the virtual world as comfortably and intuitively as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInescapable VR: Underground was made to mimic the feel and pace of real life escape rooms as closely as possible. The puzzles are not designed to be simple matters where you have to follow very basic instructions or complete overly obvious tasks. Each puzzle in the game has multiple parts to it, with some requiring the combination of various objects to find the final solution. A challenge awaits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is designed around roomscale VR on the Vive and features both teleportation and sliding locomotion options which can be swapped on the fly with a simple button press.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrailer music:<br />\r\n&quot;Digital Fortress&quot; by Machinima Sound", "mac_requirements": [], "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/666340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1501943172", "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256690723/movie480.webm?t=1500515368", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256690723/movie_max.webm?t=1500515368"}, "name": "Final Trailer", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256690723/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1500515368", "highlight": true, "id": 256690723}], "screenshots": [{"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/666340/ss_b9e5713bb7b2706bf02245124a6530f3525b3bce.600x338.jpg?t=1501943172", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/666340/ss_b9e5713bb7b2706bf02245124a6530f3525b3bce.1920x1080.jpg?t=1501943172", "id": 0}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/666340/ss_cfe204f4e37a8d44f0157a6b3286b4e2a8da1fd0.600x338.jpg?t=1501943172", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/666340/ss_cfe204f4e37a8d44f0157a6b3286b4e2a8da1fd0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1501943172", "id": 1}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/666340/ss_6c862012939c41e9a53f20918ba71ea94423cc0e.600x338.jpg?t=1501943172", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/666340/ss_6c862012939c41e9a53f20918ba71ea94423cc0e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1501943172", "id": 2}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/666340/ss_577fb22a60cdf1c9accc4b76e78326e4f0b16d32.600x338.jpg?t=1501943172", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/666340/ss_577fb22a60cdf1c9accc4b76e78326e4f0b16d32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1501943172", "id": 3}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/666340/ss_537c12c4eac26286455568f698d37de57f8eefee.600x338.jpg?t=1501943172", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/666340/ss_537c12c4eac26286455568f698d37de57f8eefee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1501943172", "id": 4}], "publishers": ["Deep Dive Interactive"], "linux_requirements": [], "required_age": 0, "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "2 Aug, 2017"}, "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/666340/header.jpg?t=1501943172", "website": null, "is_free": false, "genres": [{"description": "Indie", "id": "23"}, {"description": "Simulation", "id": "28"}, {"description": "Strategy", "id": "2"}], "short_description": "A mysterious villain has locked you in an old basement and given you a simple task: to escape by completing the series of puzzles set before you.
