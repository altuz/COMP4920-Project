If the enemy overruns, you will retreat to the next position. Should you find the enemy assaults too overwhelming, you may manually fallback to the next position. Do you retreat in order to preserve the lives of your men, or do you put up a determined defense in order to hold valuable ground?<br><br><strong>Classic Mode</strong><br>For a more traditional experience, Classic Mode is stylized after Mud and Blood 2.

You will be pressured by the overzealous theater commander to succeed on your missions at all costs, pitting the lives of your men versus the mission's objective.
