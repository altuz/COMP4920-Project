If so, then this is quite a predicament. Little Marshmallow, if you don't stop diving deeper, well... Who knows what might happen to you, or who might just take an interest. Like a moth to the flame... But oh how excited this makes me feel, absolutely mesmerizing and drawing out an even more curious side of myself which makes me want to explore you all over...<br><br>Still, you must remember; you're not alone. You may always seek help from others, or you may even try to lead others to being helped. Helping others is rarely a bad thing, and while I admit I may grow a bit jealous as you're giving so much attention to others, I do remember how you've helped me in the past and so I shall hold my tongue.
