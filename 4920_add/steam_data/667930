{"detailed_description": "StickDodgeVR is a wave survival ball throwing shooter where you have to physically move to dodge and throw. It's dodge ball with a twist! Play until all of your 5 lives are gone and when you're in trouble, oh no! Throw grenades at the oncoming enemies as you watch them slowly shatter to their death. You can even save up coins thrown at you to buy amazing personalized skins for your balls! And watch out! The 20 foot tall giant adds an extra challenge by taking two hits to kill as it is trying to squash you with his giant ball!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Multiplayer against difficult AI<br></li><li>The ability to purchase a variety of designs for the balls<br></li><li>Built in tutorial and target practice<br></li><li>The awesome ability of having a grenade at your side that can be thrown every 20 seconds<br></li><li>In game currency which allows the purchase of skins for balls<br></li><li>A giant can come in the play area throwing bigger balls and taking 2 hits to kill</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Things To Come</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Support for online multiplayer<br></li><li>Oculus Rift Support</li></ul>", "mac_requirements": [], "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/667930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1503172164", "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256688644/movie480.webm?t=1500506863", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256688644/movie_max.webm?t=1500506863"}, "name": "StickDdogeVR Gameplay Trailer", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256688644/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1500506863", "highlight": true, "id": 256688644}], "screenshots": [{"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/667930/ss_5b5b2b8c7ea90ee0f2f52da801ed104f80f66e10.600x338.jpg?t=1503172164", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/667930/ss_5b5b2b8c7ea90ee0f2f52da801ed104f80f66e10.1920x1080.jpg?t=1503172164", "id": 0}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/667930/ss_351301df978b820b770f2820adbeebb51276e46e.600x338.jpg?t=1503172164", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/667930/ss_351301df978b820b770f2820adbeebb51276e46e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1503172164", "id": 1}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/667930/ss_38eb954e298509234c00d7b8b527e88298d1c72a.600x338.jpg?t=1503172164", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/667930/ss_38eb954e298509234c00d7b8b527e88298d1c72a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1503172164", "id": 2}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/667930/ss_501994048939c96d5da98e946dacfe895f72b979.600x338.jpg?t=1503172164", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/667930/ss_501994048939c96d5da98e946dacfe895f72b979.1920x1080.jpg?t=1503172164", "id": 3}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/667930/ss_5c258b2b4da85db935e5a45d26c336e867ccaf77.600x338.jpg?t=1503172164", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/667930/ss_5c258b2b4da85db935e5a45d26c336e867ccaf77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1503172164", "id": 4}], "developers": ["Brian Underwood", "Ben Makarechian"], "linux_requirements": [], "required_age": 0, "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "2 Aug, 2017"}, "packages": [189860], "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/667930/header.jpg?t=1503172164", "website": null, "is_free": false, "genres": [{"description": "Action", "id": "1"}, {"description": "Adventure", "id": "25"}, {"description": "Indie", "id": "23"}, {"description": "Sports", "id": "18"}], "short_description": "StickDodgeVR is a challenging game of VR dodge ball having the character play against difficult enemies", "supported_languages": "English", "about_the_game": "StickDodgeVR is a wave survival ball throwing shooter where you have to physically move to dodge and throw.
