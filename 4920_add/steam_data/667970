{"detailed_description": "VTOL VR is a near-futuristic combat flight game built specifically for Virtual Reality.  You are the pilot of an AV-42C, a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capable vehicle that can perform transport, air to surface, and air to air combat roles. Take on a wide array of challenges that will put your flight skills, situational awareness, and combat tactics to the test.<br><br>No extra hardware is required.  If you have a VR set with tracked controllers, then you have a virtual cockpit where you can reach out and interact with the stick and throttle, flip switches, press buttons, and even pull the eject handle if things go wrong.<br><br>Immerse yourself in action packed combat missions, delicate vertical landings, aircraft carrier operations, aerial refueling and more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Current Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>AV-42C Tilt-jet VTOL/STOL/CTOL Attack/Transport vehicle<br></li><li>Fully interactable cockpit via tracked controllers<br></li><li>Various interchangeable equipment - guns, rockets, missiles, bombs, etc.<br></li><li>Near realistic vehicle systems - heads-up display, targeting pod, multi-function displays, radar, IR flares, chaff, etc.<br></li><li>Head-mounted cueing system<br></li><li>Ejector seat<br></li><li>Realistic vehicle physics - lift, weight, thrust, drag<br></li><li>Several playable missions - &quot;story mode&quot;
