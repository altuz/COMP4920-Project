Play as a group of four contemporary immigrant teenagers squatting in a World War II era machine gun bunker, trying to find a place for themselves in a pre-apocalyptic, present-dystopian country that has no place for them. Will you go native, turning against your own people to bury the past your parents fled to escape? Will you cling to your parents\u2019 identity at any cost, at the price of being a permanent stranger in your adoptive country?

Love is all you need\u2026and also improvised firearms.<br><br><strong>Four Horsemen</strong> is not another hagiographic, pioneer-tradition, self-exotifying immigrant explainer about being slightly different. It is an exploration of human migration in terms of people\u2013neither as mythology nor as political platform, but as a difficult decision made by ordinary human beings caught in impossible circumstances, with consequences that ripple for generations. <strong>This isn\u2019t a game about finding yourself\u2026it\u2019s a game about your self finding you</strong>.<br><br>Drawing from real lived experience, interviews with current and former immigrant teens from around the world, and a year of painstaking anthropological research, featuring <strong>4 different main storylines, 9 different endings, 12 different playable homelands</strong> (all of which play differently), and a multitude of agonizing, important decisions, Four Horsemen tells a powerfully compelling, heartrendingly familiar, brutally honest story about what it's like to be a stranger in a strange land. One playthrough can be finished in a matter of hours, but you\u2019ll want to revisit it again and again to see all of the many stories the game has to tell\u2026and to pursue that elusive dream of a land you can call your own.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exciting Bullet Points!!</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>YOUR DECISIONS MATTER.</strong> Hard choices you make at the beginning come back to haunt you at the end.
