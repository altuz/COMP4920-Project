{"detailed_description": "Welcome to the futuristic and dangerous world of Glasswinged Ascension! This hardcore game doesn't give much room for mistakes, and there is only one checkpoint on each mission - in its very beginning. Stealth and caution are your best friends here, as enemies require just one shot to kill you, there are a lots of deadly traps around, and even environment itself may become a problem if you will not proceed carefully. Even though not all rushed actions will be fatal, they may still weaken you. Had to ram a glass wall, or fell down? Well, this kind of action cannot be followed forever, because you will need first aid, which is not unlimited.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnemies can see and hear you. Using sneaking stance will reduce you movement speed, but will also make your footsteps unnoticable. And if you'll manage to turn off the lights it will become harder for the enemies to see you, so you'll be able to come closer undetected even if they are looking in your direction. Remember, you don't really need to kill each of them. If you prefer pure stealth and non-lethal attacks, feel free to play the ghost leaving enemies alive and keep proceeding through a mission at the same time. But, if you like using assault rifles and other deadly stuff, then you can definitely do so after obtaining it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game's missions are not linear. You always have alternate routes, some of which can be blocked, unless you'll find the way to unblock them. Keep in mind that all tripmines you've disarmed along your way can be used to destroy weak walls or floor, while exoskeletons will allow you to lift and move heavy objects or even pass through hazardous environments unharmed. Each mission pushes the story forward, so be sure to read all dialogues you'll encounter. Even though dialogues themselves are pretty linear, they are helping to build truly cyberpunk atmosphere, and give you some interesting themes to think about.", "mac_requirements": [], "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1507073148", "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256697180/movie480.webm?t=1507073133", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256697180/movie_max.webm?t=1507073133"}, "name": "Glasswinged Ascension", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256697180/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1507073133", "highlight": true, "id": 256697180}], "screenshots": [{"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_3bf3d62db91458cd918cdc39c86a1451a8f98aa8.600x338.jpg?t=1507073148", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_3bf3d62db91458cd918cdc39c86a1451a8f98aa8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1507073148", "id": 0}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_8bd023de12182705ca6e0ff42638b26af4db0f3a.600x338.jpg?t=1507073148", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_8bd023de12182705ca6e0ff42638b26af4db0f3a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1507073148", "id": 1}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_5e482436124308e9f27d9659cd6917023a96f3a1.600x338.jpg?t=1507073148", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_5e482436124308e9f27d9659cd6917023a96f3a1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1507073148", "id": 2}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_99b4d47fa398d015e029bb1ad7891588227cb182.600x338.jpg?t=1507073148", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_99b4d47fa398d015e029bb1ad7891588227cb182.1920x1080.jpg?t=1507073148", "id": 3}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_75eb988a3f8d213c2a7d02eee484e3dd996543f2.600x338.jpg?t=1507073148", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_75eb988a3f8d213c2a7d02eee484e3dd996543f2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1507073148", "id": 4}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_21da4940fd11b1750c01a6d4f0b0c5691d074c3c.600x338.jpg?t=1507073148", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_21da4940fd11b1750c01a6d4f0b0c5691d074c3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1507073148", "id": 5}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_4c157787069c0eedef3a60b896a24d015c20488a.600x338.jpg?t=1507073148", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_4c157787069c0eedef3a60b896a24d015c20488a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1507073148", "id": 6}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_33a93d67cb3ce2ee8e33633ca244bf7789461be4.600x338.jpg?t=1507073148", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_33a93d67cb3ce2ee8e33633ca244bf7789461be4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1507073148", "id": 7}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_ac1f6b1e5b108e47e9ae789654e8eb97977789a9.600x338.jpg?t=1507073148", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_ac1f6b1e5b108e47e9ae789654e8eb97977789a9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1507073148", "id": 8}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_dcf5b3a937479f3b8709a3ed171930ac5c8b2ed2.600x338.jpg?t=1507073148", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/ss_dcf5b3a937479f3b8709a3ed171930ac5c8b2ed2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1507073148", "id": 9}], "developers": ["Sergey Kalmanovich (aka Red Spot Sylphina)"], "linux_requirements": [], "required_age": 0, "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "21 Jul, 2017"}, "packages": [190093], "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668670/header.jpg?t=1507073148", "website": null, "is_free": false, "genres": [{"description": "Indie", "id": "23"}], "short_description": "Glasswinged Ascension is built around cyberpunk theme permeated with avoidance, caution, and story telling.
