{"detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About this game</h2>The concept of the game was developed exclusively for Virtual Reality. DEAD MOON is available for Oculus Rift and HTC VIVE. The game captures an advanced combination of movement techniques with intuitive controls. Items can be touched, used, or destroyed for an even more intense feeling during the game. There are a lot of weapon types and a lot of different opponents. Each opponent has its own AI behaviour and its own unique fighting skills. Experience the fascinating moonscape and explore a dilapidated moon base with a lot of secret hideouts, impregnable hordes of opponents, and a sinister Sci-Fi setting. <br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/668840/extras/gun.png?t=1506762337\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dead Moon Story</h2>It is the year 2393: You are an archaeologist. On your way back from a mission on Mars, you made a forced landing on Moon Phobos and found the forgotten outpost \u201cStickney 2\u201d, which was abandoned 70 years ago. While trying to find a way to leave the moon alive, you find yourself fighting against massive waves of monsters there. The bloodthirstiness of the monsters is everywhere, whether you are in the abandoned space station or on the moon\u2019s surface.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SVSD Locomotion</h2>You can choose between a combination of stationary, roomscale, walking (motion controller direction movement), and teleportation for movement at anytime.
