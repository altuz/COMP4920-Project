{"detailed_description": "Espire 1: VR Operative is an ambitious new virtual reality game and IP with its sights firmly set on the single-player \u2018stealth\u2019 genre, currently available through Steam's Alpha Release Channel in its prototype phase.

Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative.

From the safety of their &quot;Espire Control Theatre&quot; (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire with less than 10ms of latency.
