{"detailed_description": "&quot;Castles II: Siege and Conquest&quot; you can experience even more then the original. It is the year 1311. The King of France just died and because King Charles didn\u2019t have any heir it is up to you to take control of as much of France as you can through the game of medieval diplomacy, treachery and power. To win you must survive. To survive you must scout the surrounding territories, defeat the local militias, subjugate the land with castles, feed and maintain the people, forge diplomatic alliances, appease the church and unite the land under your iron fist.  If successful and the Pope gives you the blessing, then you will become the King of France. <br><br>There's more. Now you can watch 30 minutes of BBC documentary footage which shows you how and why castles were constructed, planned, besieged and attacked prior to the age of gunpowder.
