{"detailed_description": "A virus outbreak has spread across the galaxy infecting all human life which are now known as V.I.R.M (Viral Interstellar Radiated Mutants). It appears to have originated from an unknown life form from planet Aiphus, where scientists have found a sign of life but kept their findings classified. This information was revealed after a rescue team was requested for search and rescue at the space colony where the scientists were experimenting on the unknown life form. There was no one to extract upon arrival. The galaxy is now known as a dead space. Explore various ships that have fallen to the virus and fight off waves of enemies to level up your classes and acquire additional assets for your loadout! You are the galaxy's last hope on putting an end to the virus before it finds its way to Earth where humanity will then seize to exist!", "mac_requirements": [], "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1504459458", "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689272/movie480.webm?t=1504459321", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689272/movie_max.webm?t=1504459321"}, "name": "Trailer", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689272/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1504459321", "highlight": true, "id": 256689272}], "screenshots": [{"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_0dd937d385c72ce7b0c029b0a35cd34e72ad8c26.600x338.jpg?t=1504459458", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_0dd937d385c72ce7b0c029b0a35cd34e72ad8c26.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504459458", "id": 0}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_b9934dd335c22891808f1794b9601e4bfb083a76.600x338.jpg?t=1504459458", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_b9934dd335c22891808f1794b9601e4bfb083a76.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504459458", "id": 1}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_dea6633f203022d1501963db01cd84f232067a69.600x338.jpg?t=1504459458", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_dea6633f203022d1501963db01cd84f232067a69.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504459458", "id": 2}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_41e4633f8e757199302e9c92fc86deaaae390392.600x338.jpg?t=1504459458", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_41e4633f8e757199302e9c92fc86deaaae390392.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504459458", "id": 3}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_ac72c0e84a3b7745a631ad3e5d998206f2bc98dd.600x338.jpg?t=1504459458", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_ac72c0e84a3b7745a631ad3e5d998206f2bc98dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504459458", "id": 4}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_a83c02fef7ba1566748e5446a8ff077c19266e74.600x338.jpg?t=1504459458", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_a83c02fef7ba1566748e5446a8ff077c19266e74.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504459458", "id": 5}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_fc94d18c7b832a5e44a541c321ef9944e495bd67.600x338.jpg?t=1504459458", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_fc94d18c7b832a5e44a541c321ef9944e495bd67.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504459458", "id": 6}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_30a441f287adacfd13ae14265075c7639a21b2fc.600x338.jpg?t=1504459458", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/ss_30a441f287adacfd13ae14265075c7639a21b2fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1504459458", "id": 7}], "publishers": ["Hokkaido Studios"], "linux_requirements": [], "required_age": 0, "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "1 Aug, 2017"}, "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/672450/header.jpg?t=1504459458", "website": "https://hokkaidostudios.wixsite.com/home", "is_free": false, "genres": [{"description": "Violent", "id": "73"}, {"description": "Gore", "id": "74"}, {"description": "Action", "id": "1"}, {"description": "Adventure", "id": "25"}, {"description": "Indie", "id": "23"}, {"description": "RPG", "id": "3"}, {"description": "Simulation", "id": "28"}, {"description": "Strategy", "id": "2"}, {"description": "Early Access", "id": "70"}], "short_description": "A virus outbreak has spread across the galaxy infecting all human life which are now known as V.I.R.M.
