{"detailed_description": "Floor Plan is a puzzle adventure game that takes place entirely inside an elevator. Go floor to floor, find items, and meet a bizarre cast of characters.

Walk around the elevator, grab things, and press buttons! Or if you'd rather enjoy your buttons from a distance, you can play seated or standing with a variety of control options. <br><br><strong>Classic Genre, New Paint</strong><br>Floor Plan takes mechanics from your favorite classic point-and-click adventure games and reimagines them for first person VR. Whether you dream of inventory puzzles or you're a newcomer to the genre, you'll see it like you've never seen it before.<br><br><strong>Play Your Way</strong><br>Figure out alternate solutions to puzzles, solve them in different orders, or call the operator if you need a nudge in the right direction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IMPORTANT</h2>Floor Plan generally takes players about an hour to complete.
