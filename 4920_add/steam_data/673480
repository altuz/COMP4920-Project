I wanted to create a game, which has the feeling of classical games like Battle Isle, Battle of wesnoth or Jagged Alliance, but with a very unique nature theme and challenging content. In Timbertales you will first have to draft an army before you can start a match. Unlike other turn based strategy games: You will not have to produce units in game. Its more based on a table top strategy game approach, where you have to build up an army with a specific point limit before the match starts. While processing through the game you will be able to unlock more units, which can be used in drafting.<br>In game we have a classic hex tiled map in an isometric view. You will have to move your units around the map and clear out different map objectives to be victorious. Every attack is handled instantly: You will see the results as fast as possible and you are able to plan your next steps immediately.<br>Many units provide very special abilities: You have the choice for just normal attacking or using very special abilities, like healing, cursing or heavy attacks.<br>There will be very unique game modes for solo playing and multiplayer. Let me introduce the features more detailed:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Races</h2>There are different races: Vermin and sylvans.

There are heal spheres which can heal your units, critical strike spheres which increases the critical strike chance for several rounds and acorn point sphere which increases your acorn points. Acorn points are the in game currency to unlock features.<br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/extras/sphere.png?t=1506592823\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ranking</h2>Several rankings will show your progress through different game modes.

This means we have different unit types and different attack types. The unit types are small, medium and large. The attack types are normal, piercing and breaking. If two types clashes each other the types are used to calculate the critical hit chance for the unit for example if a normal attack type is fighting against any armor type he will always have the standard 10% critical strike hit chance. But if an piercing attack type is fighting vs. a small armor type he will receive a 100% bonus which means he has a critical hit chance of 20%. Critical hits will be displayed with a bigger yellow number while normal hits are shown in white color.<br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/extras/combat.png?t=1506592823\"><br><br>For more informations please visit Twitter / Facebook and my website :)<br>I am looking forward for your support, feedback and comments.", "mac_requirements": {"recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> 10.x<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1+ GHz 32 Bit oder 64 Bit<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 400 MB available space</li></ul>", "minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> 10.x<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1 Ghz 32 Bit oder 64 Bit<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 400 MB available space</li></ul>"}, "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1506592823", "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689328/movie480.webm?t=1500639114", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689328/movie_max.webm?t=1500639114"}, "name": "Gameplay Tailer", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689328/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1500639114", "highlight": true, "id": 256689328}], "screenshots": [{"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/ss_f5e309a55316fe24237098956352785a3ec0d5d2.600x338.jpg?t=1506592823", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/ss_f5e309a55316fe24237098956352785a3ec0d5d2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506592823", "id": 0}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/ss_d06fd2e106610e614d25a004c8202003fe98880d.600x338.jpg?t=1506592823", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/ss_d06fd2e106610e614d25a004c8202003fe98880d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506592823", "id": 1}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/ss_9f87fd87042d743368dc49bd86a4dd7cc93be1bd.600x338.jpg?t=1506592823", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/ss_9f87fd87042d743368dc49bd86a4dd7cc93be1bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506592823", "id": 2}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/ss_b5e887c0f691702390568199ae1a9df4c8e845a3.600x338.jpg?t=1506592823", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/ss_b5e887c0f691702390568199ae1a9df4c8e845a3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506592823", "id": 3}, {"path_thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/ss_f789f47c42d169c82d3e74556d2adf2255a8bf77.600x338.jpg?t=1506592823", "path_full": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/ss_f789f47c42d169c82d3e74556d2adf2255a8bf77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506592823", "id": 4}], "publishers": ["Rainware"], "linux_requirements": {"recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Java support<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1+ GHz 32 Bit oder 64 Bit<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 400 MB available space</li></ul>", "minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Java support<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1 Ghz 32 Bit oder 64 Bit<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 400 MB available space</li></ul>"}, "required_age": 0, "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "25 Jul, 2017"}, "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673480/header.jpg?t=1506592823", "website": "http://www.timbertales.net", "is_free": false, "genres": [{"description": "Indie", "id": "23"}, {"description": "Strategy", "id": "2"}, {"description": "Early Access", "id": "70"}], "short_description": "Fantasy turn based strategy game in an unique nature theme.
