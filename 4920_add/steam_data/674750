This is why last year we've decided to drop XNA and switch to Unity3D.

And the fourth playable character, finally. There's also features like localization including non-English chat, cloud saves, non-Xbox controller support with full controls remapping, overall better stability and performance, as well as many other minor improvements.<br><br>Another great news is that everyone who owns the base version will be granted a 75% off coupon at the game's launch, and will be able to cut its price from $3.99 to just $0.99!
