{"detailed_description": "Billy works in a high tech factory, only... he\u2019s kind of a dummy. His job is to test all kinds of wacky vehicles and contraptions. Your job is to make sure he survives the test in one piece... or not, we are overstocked on these units anyway, so go nuts!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game contains two game modes, Mission mode and Sandbox mode. Mission mode currently has 9 missions where the objective is to get the crash test dummy, Billy, to the checkpoint. To get to the checkpoint you have to overcome certain obstacles, such as jump over a wall, fly up to an elevated platform, fit through a small opening and so on. To achieve this, you must design a vehicle using the available parts, such as building blocks, wheels, jets, rollers, de-couplers and many more. Once you are happy with your vehicle, you must pilot it through the level and get Billy to check point. While doing so, you must also keep an eye on the maximum g-forces acting on Billy. Exceed the threshold and the mission is a failure.
