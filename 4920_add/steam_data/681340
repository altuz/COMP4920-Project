Simply click on a block on the left hand side and it will jump 2 colors, and all the blocks touching will change 1 color.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n#Puzzle That Will Make You THINK#<br />\r\nYou have already mastered many puzzle games? We dare you to try Arraynium. We know that this type of thinking puzzle will not be an easy target, even for the smartest and best puzzle match game players.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n#Tons of LEVELS#<br />\r\nPuzzles would not be interesting if the levels are not variable and unpredictable. We worked hard to make the levels challenging, hard, but also extremely entertaining. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n#Smooth GAMEPLAY#<br />\r\nThe gameplay of the game is really smooth.
