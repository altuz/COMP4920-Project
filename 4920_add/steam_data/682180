{"detailed_description": "<img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/682180/extras/desc_1.png?t=1506781121\"><br>Tile Battle is a local multiplayer strategy game for 2-4 players. Gameplay focuses on a unique unit control system that allows players to move their own units as well as their enemies. Find openings in the grid style map to sneak units up to your enemy's base. Destroy their base to stop reinforcements and finish off the rest of their army to claim victory. Tile Battle is easy to jump into but various factions, abilities, and gameplay settings provide more depth to be discovered for returning players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>2-4 local players<br></li><li>Choose from 3 factions and 9 different faction abilities<br></li><li>Play across 6 maps per player count for a total of 18 unique maps<br></li><li>Customize game settings to fit your preferred experience<br></li><li>Many controller types supported.

Units walk in a straight line until they bump into a wall and turn around. Units will automatically engage in combat when they get close enough to attack an enemy. A player wins the game when all enemy units and bases are destroyed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Moving Units</h2>The player uses their cursor to place direction tiles (left, right, up, down) onto a grid space. When a unit of any team walks onto a directional tile they will change to walk the direction of the tile. Tiles need to be used both offensively to get your units to the enemy base and defensively to redirect enemies away from your own base. This becomes more challenging because you are limited to 5 active tiles. Players have the ability to remove a tile on a cooldown to sabotage an enemy's plan or to help push through their defenses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Factions</h2>Players can choose from one of three factions before the game starts. Choose between Marauders, The Guild, and Haunted. Each faction has its own unique base unit with two additional special units. Play each faction to discover their varying strengths and weaknesses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Abilities</h2> Each faction comes with three unique abilities to choose from. Players pick their faction ability before the game starts. Abilities range from the offensive fireball to the buff spell Undying which empowers units and delays their death.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Settings</h2>Customize gameplay parameters to fit you and your friend's play style. Change game speed, spawn rates, sudden death settings and much more. Easily save and load presets to quickly get back to your favorite settings.<br><br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/682180/extras/desc_5.png?t=1506781121\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the developer</h2><strong>Created by LadrikDev:</strong> This is my first entry into the indie game scene.
