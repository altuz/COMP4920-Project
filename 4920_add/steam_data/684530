{"detailed_description": "Grab your couch and your friends and get ready to lance <strong>a lot</strong>. Lance A Lot\u00ae is a fast-paced local multiplayer game about jousting. Except you\u2019re on rockets. Because let\u2019s face it, knights on rockets are way cooler. And if anyone says otherwise, then challenge them to a duel and prove them wrong!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u>Glorious Features</u></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Lance A Lot! You have a rocket lance that you can poke your friends with to cause a one hit kill. Or fire it from your hands to skewer them to the wall. We're pretty sure your friend deserved it. <br></li><li>SMASH. EVERYTHING. You have a Rocket Hammer to bash each other with. Smack them into things, take out all that internal aggression on the controller. <br></li><li>Interact with your environment. Bash rockets for an excessive amount of explosions. Don't like trees? Yeah, no one does, so break them with your hammer. You also have Holy Hand Grenades. Throw them. Throw all of them. <br></li><li>Change your playstyle with 4 different game modes and 6 different rulesets. You can fight over territory in King of the Hill until everyone is yelling at each other, or smack each other out of the arena in Sumo. We're pretty sure that's how rockets work. <br></li><li>Play solo against AI. They're pretty smart. A little too smart. Suspiciously smart. </li></ul><br><i>Lance A Lot: Enhanced Edition is an improved standalone version of the original Classic Edition which is no longer available for purchase.
