Each adventure is unique, and the uncertainty of it ensures the excitement for the players. That's why the map is randomly generated by the system in the game.<br><br>Learn and build<br>There will be random resources in the game, and that's one of the most important assets in the game. Players can use those resources to build tools to survive.<br><br>The following figures are crucial for player's survival:<br>[1]HP: the character will die when the HP drops to 0. The HP is lost when get attacked, and is restored slowly in out-of-combat situation. Crafting weapons will help you to kill the zombies faster.<br>[2]Hunger: the character will die when the Hunger drops to 0. The hunger is lost gradually, and make food helps you to add hunger figure.<br>[3]Stamina: the character will die when the stamina drops to 0. The stamina is lost in out-of-rest situation; rest in bed helps you to restore stamina. The better bed quality, the shorter rest time required which gives you the chance to make more items. <br>[4]Hygiene: the character will die when the Hygiene drops to 0. The hygiene is lost when the character is sick, including wound (in battle), internal disease (food problem) and drug addict (drug abuse). You can use medicines to cure the sickness and restore the hygiene points. <br>[5] Spirit: the character will die when the spirit drops to 0. The spirit is lost if the other figures drop below a certain level, you can use some items and spend time to rest to restore spirit.<br><br><br>Most learning and building activities take place in the shelter. <br><br>Battle<br>Stealth is a key concept in the game, character will switch to stealth mode on hearing any zombie noise. The character can run if no zombie can be heard around. Relevant Items are necessary in every battle and will be consumed at the end of the battle, and how to make full use of them is also a challenge.<br><br>Time<br>Time plays a vital role in the game. Time is necessary in all explore, develop and battle activities.<br>In instances, the time is lost gradually. The time is also lost gradually in developing (learn or build) or move the target in the shelter.<br>Make good use of time is key pleasure of the game.<br><br>Shelter Defense<br>The shelter may under attack when the character is asleep. You cannot see the attack and you can only check the defense when wake up.<br>You can build all kinds of defensive measures to repel the zombie invasion, and the character will die if the defense is breached.<br><br>Day and night<br>There will be day and night in the game, 12 hours for each part. Zombies are dummy during the day time and aggressive in the night. So you can execute exploration during the day and stay in the shelter to learn, build or rest at night. <br>During the 12 hours in the day time, some will be used on your way to explore. You'd better take as more items as possible in the scene for the rest of the time! If the character failed to leave the scene when the night comes, the zombies will rampage and have the character surrounded. If the night falls on your way back, the zombies will attack you on your way back, and your character will die when the HP drops to 0.<br><br>Data collection<br>The story line of the game is relative abundant, for the key gameplay doesn't need too much game story telling. So most of the story description and suspense can be found from the in-game items.

Small animals have their own reproduction system, over prey them and you may not find them again.<br><br>About the game background<br>\uff081\uff09Cancer makes immortality possible<br>Recently, a drug study team claimed that they have found a causative factor for pancreatic cancer. The pancreatic cancer is caused by 2 mutated genes. More specifically, these 2 genes have influence on the DNA of human longevity.<br>\tProlonging of longevity has always been a popular topic for researchers, and the telomere is inevitable when we come the topic of such kind. Telomere is the end part of the chromosome and will get shorter as people age. Some scientists believe that maintain the length of the telomere leads to longer life (some rat experiments proved it). The only problem is, what a cancer lengthened life will be like?<br>Maybe the only one who walks away from death is the cancer cell. For pancreatic cancer patients, keep the telomere from shortening is why the cancer cell is alive. Cancer cell is the zombie of cells. Their function limited to self-duplication and infect others in the body. This is not with in the definition of immortality but a mere status of remain undead.<br>To make this stale status into the long-desired immortality, we need to figure out which gene can stop the cell from aging by lengthen the telomere. But is the telomere the reason for  the aging of cells, or just a concomitant symptom of aging?

But few people knew that the mastermind behind all this is Ender Fred. The country is collapsing, and the world is falling.<br>At that time, Ender Fred launched the shelter he built to take in people that have not become zombies. Ender Fred was addressed as the last savior (Last The One).<br>But in fact, this is all Ender's plan. He believes that in the new world, people should be immortals, and the world doesn't need so many people. Inferior genes are to be discarded and the superior ones should be kept.
