{"detailed_description": "Will your Bloodline become a hero of Prima? <br>Or will you choose to rebel against the nations? <br>Find  the hidden secrets of Prima and seek the truth behind it all.

Your character also has hunger and thirst to manage as well. These bars deplete over time and require consumables to replenish. <br><br>When you die, you drop everything in your inventory, including the gear you were using. You respawn as a fresh member of your Bloodline, still benefiting from the bloodline points you've previously spent and the items you've stored in your bank.
