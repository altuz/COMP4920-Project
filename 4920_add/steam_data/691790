{"detailed_description": "Arcadian Atlas is a 2D isometric tactical role playing game about the choices people make in pursuit of the things they love, and the havoc it wreaks on a kingdom.<br><br><img src=\"https://orig02.deviantart.net/6f30/f/2017/214/e/d/1_by_bbreakfast-dbimoyu.png\"><br><br>Watch your footing and mind the strategic vantage points as you traverse the richly detailed pixel art world of Arcadia -- A single misstep on the battlefield could cost you a friend\u2019s life. Let the moody jazz soundtrack carry you through a thought provoking &amp; ruthless story of love, deceit, murder, companionship and war. Meant to be a fresh take on the classic strategy RPG style, Arcadian Atlas was designed from the ground up to incorporate more challenging battle strategies, new &amp; balanced job classes, and more cutthroat plot twists that'll leave these complex characters' lives hanging in the balance.<br><br>Featuring dynamic job classes, a rich character driven narrative, strategic grid-based battles and a jazz infused soundtrack, Arcadian Atlas is a lushly handcrafted 2D isometric tactical RPG that takes the rich history of the genre and makes it fresh.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>The core philosophy behind Arcadian Atlas is simple: Challenging strategic battles with unique classes that make every fight a different experience. That means terrain that affects your movement, cover that can hinder the best laid plans, and skills that are never wasted.<br><br><img src=\"http://orig09.deviantart.net/d639/f/2017/214/d/c/2_by_bbreakfast-dbimp3g.png\"><br><br>Investment matters, and in a tactical RPG your biggest investment is your character class. So we want them to be purposeful, which is why classes in Arcadian Atlas have several core builds that your characters develop over the course of the game. That means no class hopping, but instead class evolution.<br><br><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/615/140/df1ea3f3ff55766671dfedf5cb6b0478_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459285202&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=003d72a7f079cb19ce30c400faa20a8d\"><br><br>Customize your character at the start with their preferred class build, and when the time comes you can specialize that build through branching evolved classes with entire skill trees all their own.<br><br><img src=\"http://orig02.deviantart.net/16d3/f/2017/214/7/5/3_by_bbreakfast-dbimp3n.png\"><br><br><strong>Ranger</strong> - the master of area control, a Ranger\u2019s projectile attacks and crowd control skills revolve around traversal and using terrain to their advantage.<br><br><strong>Apothecary</strong> - a chemist of extraordinary skill, the Apothecary\u2019s potent brews and experimental arts can heal or wreck devastating damage on the battlefield.<br><br><img src=\"https://orig12.deviantart.net/cfae/f/2017/214/2/d/img1_png_by_bbreakfast-dbimpby.png\"><br><br><strong>Rogue</strong> - sneaky, sneaky; stabby, stabby.
