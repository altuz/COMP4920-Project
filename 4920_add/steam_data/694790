I was stressed out, and living in the city, but nature and open, green spaces, always helps to calm me down. I didn't think much of it at the time, but I made the game generate a random plant based upon a random word.

I noticed that people would always do very similar things the first time that they played. They would type in their own name, their pets name, loved ones etc, to see what kind of plant would grow. It was amazing to see them connect the plant to the person. Maybe the plant was very chaotic and messy, which made them think of their cat, or tall and graceful like their partner.<br><br>I saw this happen with enough different people to convince me that I should turn this idea into a full game.
