The people are in desperate need of a powerful leader that can unite the kingdom. Many tribes claim their right, but there is only room for one banner in the kingdom capital. The goal of the game is to lead your bannermen to victory and defeat the evil, once and for all.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY</h2><br>Bannermen will contain a singleplayer campaign and several multiplayer modes. The game is designed to encourage players to interact with each other and the world, where the typical gameplay elements consist of base building, resource management and battling enemy armies efficiently.
