Juno lightheartedly decides to give it a go, unaware that the game conceals an outrageous secret...!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDivide up the packets that appear one after another, and aim to get a higher score than your opponent. This is a competitive-type active solitaire game where you aim for a high score by gathering the necessary packets while avoiding specific colors and putting them together in poker-style hands.
