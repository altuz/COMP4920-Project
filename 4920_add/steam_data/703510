You build a wooden fort, place units, and then watch the battle unfold. To win the game you either have to destroy all of your opponent's units, or capture their flag. Units can be toggled as either &quot;offensive&quot; or &quot;defensive.&quot; When units are designated for offense, they will move towards the enemy flag, engaging any enemy soldiers they encounter along the way. Units designated for defense will stay where you place them, waiting for the enemies to come to them. If there are no more offensive units left on the map, the game enters a tie breaker procedure, where all defensive units are automatically switched to offensive mode, and all forts/blocks disappear to clear the way for the soldiers. The armies from both sides will march towards each other and engage in an epic showdown.
