{"detailed_description": "Tiny Bubbles is an award-winning organic puzzle game about playing with clusters of realistic soap bubbles in a microscopic aquatic world.<br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/705500/extras/JellyCrab_Inline.png?t=1506469170\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Innovative New Gameplay</h2>Winning multiple awards for its innovative new gameplay, Tiny Bubbles takes gaming into the organic world. Fill bubbles with colored air and push nearby bubbles around using the physics of pressure and surface tension. Break edges between neighbors and mix colors to create matches of 4 or more. Make moves in real-time with a Tetris-like queue that lets you build up cascading chain reactions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">160+ Handmade Puzzles</h2>Experience deep gameplay with surprising new challenges down every path. Each puzzle requires new thinking and twisting strategies. Play two games types in 7 worlds: puzzle and arcade worlds.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Incredibly Lifelike Soap Bubble Physics</h2>Based on the unique artistic vision of designer Stu Denman and his world-renowned scientist grandfather Cyril Stanley Smith, the game brings to life the beauty of nature to your screen, with incredibly fluid 60 FPS animations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Relaxing And Atmospheric</h2>Adaptive ambient music gracefully integrates with the satisfying sounds of popping. Put on a pair of headphones and get your brain in the zen-zone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mesmerizing Creatures</h2>Save microscopic aquatic creatures that are trapped in the bubbles. Avoid greedy jelly crabs and spiky urchins. A curious fish named &quot;bloop&quot; will reveal your nature as an optimist or a pessimist.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Awesome Powerups</h2>Are the puzzles too challenging? Earn wild bubbles by making longer chains. Additional bonuses for collecting the right colors and making matches of 7 or longer. Earn color shufflers, boundary expanders and other powerups to use just at the right moment to save yourself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Colorblind Mode</h2>Featuring an innovative colorblind mode that provides an authentic experience without intrusive icons or patterns.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHAT THE PRESS IS SAYING</h2><i>&quot;Blown away with the level of depth.
