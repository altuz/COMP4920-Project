{"detailed_description": "Two years after the freeware release of Close Your Eyes on Steam, and nearly 4-years after the original Ludum Dare game, Close Your Eyes returns for its anniversary with a complete remake.

Completely remade from the ground up, it includes new locations, brand new threats, extended story, 10 possible endings, and a delve into an atmospheric abyss that may linger with you long after you beat it.<br></li><li><u>Girl's Graveyard</u>: The predecessor to Close Your Eyes has also been remade. The maddening arcade-styled game about a girl collecting candy for her beloved includes new scenes and greater darker depths. There may be more than sweet things to find behind the facade...<br></li><li><u>Close Your Eyes - Beneath the Surface</u>: A brand new scenario where Marshmallow Monk must dig deep to find a hidden truth... Burrow your way down 100 floors in a chilling experience that may leave you sinking into the murkiness of an unseen horror.<br></li><li><u>Close Your Eyes Anniversary Mode</u>: A brand new mode which remixes Close Your Eyes with even more new scenes, challenges, and an extended story. Unlike the main game, there's only one ending to achieve in Anniversary Mode, but the route to that ending is unlike anything you've experienced before.<br></li><li><u>Girl's Graveyard Challenge Mode</u>: Are you a masochist? Taking place after the events of Girl's Graveyard as a sequel of sorts, Challenge Mode is not for the weak of heart. Can you overcome all odds and reach the shocking finale?<br></li><li><u>Unlock the Secrets of the Annex</u>: As you make progress in all of the game modes, you will begin to unlock more content in a new hub world known as the Annex.
