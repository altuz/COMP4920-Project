{"detailed_description": "Fantasization is a team-based roleplaying game with turn-based tactical combat, deep RPG mechanics and an evolving procedurally generated world with warring factions. Your party of four heroes belongs to a secret order protecting the largest known collection of the mysterious substance called the Aether. The Aether used to be a pure and benevolent element used by the greatest mages and the dwarven smiths alike.  Recently, however, the Aether has started to become dark and malevolent and your party will need to find allies to stop this corruption before the growing darkness engulfs the world.<br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/708200/extras/Title-Key-Features.png?t=1506418131\"><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Character customization: We have created a system that enables hundreds of very different ways to create powerful characters for your party.
