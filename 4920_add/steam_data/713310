You control the Gambol Gumball through a gauntlet of levels designed with flow and rhythm in mind to test your platforming grit.  But don't be too nervous, because along with the slick controls you also have a triple jump that's energy is reset upon touching any (non-lethal) surface, including the ceiling.  Holy cow, that sounds great.  The controls are simple enough that you could play it on a NES controller, with only run, jump, left, right, down-boost, and [REDACTED] to worry about.

But for all you hardcore platforming buffs out there, I've made a second, harder difficulty with special levels, and normal mode levels with more hazards added.
