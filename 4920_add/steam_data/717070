{"detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story</h2>A malfunction with your experimental R-COIL engine has torn a hole in reality and you have fallen through it.

Use the stick to aim and a single button to fire and thrust. Tap to fire. Hold to thrust. Each time you fire your bullet will push you back a little.
