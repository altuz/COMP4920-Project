{"detailed_description": "Imagine being stranded on an island in the early 1900's, being a only survivor in a experimental plane crash. However, the island you crashed on is not a normal island, its Boom Island! Engage yourself in this arcade style first person shooter, where the main objective is to shoot highly explosive bouncing beach balls while staying alive. Immerse yourself with vintage effects and arcade style game-play. Play many different game modes including:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Survival: A classic style of play where your objective is to survive an infinite amount of beach balls in various waves, as you survive the waves, your difficulty will gradually increase until you get blown up.<br><br></li><li>Protection: Similar aspect to survival, however your arsenal and mobility has greatly changed. Get strapped in to a giant mounted machine gun on your destroyed plane, as you flawlessly penetrate the explosive beach balls with ammunition, not being a problem.<br><br></li><li>Blueprint: In Blueprint mode, your goal is to collect as many blueprints for your plane around the island, while staying alive. Blueprints will spawn randomly and you must collect as many as you can.<br><br>What are you waiting for? Go head to the island and good luck.</li></ul>", "mac_requirements": [], "background": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/717820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1505947009", "movies": [{"webm": {"480": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256695683/movie480.webm?t=1505857355", "max": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256695683/movie_max.webm?t=1505857355"}, "name": "Boom Island Trailer", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256695683/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1505857355", "highlight": true, "id": 256695683}], "publishers": ["csgood"], "linux_requirements": [], "required_age": 0, "release_date": {"coming_soon": true, "date": "Oct 2017"}, "header_image": "http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/717820/header.jpg?t=1505947009", "website": "http://www.playjustrun.com/boom-island", "is_free": false, "genres": [{"description": "Action", "id": "1"}, {"description": "Indie", "id": "23"}], "short_description": "Imagine being stranded on an island in the early 1900's, being a only survivor in a experimental plane crash.
