{"detailed_description": "<h1>Steam Deluxe Edition</h1><p>This edition comes with exclusive bonus content:<br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/721300/extras/steam-deluxe-edition-features.png?t=1506675168\"><br><br>The Main Game in the Free Edition is identical to the Steam Deluxe Edition. &quot;Murderbook&quot; is a short story that expands on what happens in the game. The Mini Games take place in the American Angst universe and won't be released separately.<br><br><strong>Why should I buy your game here when I can get for free somewhere else?</strong><br><br>Valid question. Here are two and a half arguments for spending $2.99 on American Angst: 1) You would like to access the bonus content that comes with the Steam Deluxe Edition 2) You would like to support me, the author of this game. In the latter case, by all means play it for free first and find out if you enjoyed the game. If you did and you feel like supporting me, buy it here on Steam and maybe gift it to somebody you like. Or just keep it for yourself. Or don't buy it at all, I won't find out anyway. Whatever works best for you. But then again, I hope $2.99 isn't too much of a risk to take \u2013 you'd be buying me a cup of coffee or a snack for our dog. Finally, argument 2.5: <strong>American Angst will be released on Steam first</strong>, roughly a week or two ahead of the other platforms. You'll be an early adopter and will be able to tell your friends you already played American Angst when it wasn't cool yet. How about that for an incentive, right?</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You wake up in pitch black darkness. You know not where you are. You know not who you are.
