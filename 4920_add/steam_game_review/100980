I cannot reccomend 3D Coat until they fix the serious bugs and freezes.\n\nI have to say that I use this software every day for my indie development. So here are the pros and cons and why I cannot reccomend it at this state.\n\nPROS:\n-Advanced 3d Sculpting tools with a lot of functionality\n-Awesomeand intuitive retopology.\n-Best and easiest also intuitive UV Unwrapping I've even seen (Please try it out, you won't use anything esle)\n-Painting PBR materials with layers which is awesome!\n-Advanced Baking features.\n-From 3D to Seamless textures with all the texture maps: Diffuse, Normal, Specular/Roughness, Metallic, glow etc...\n-Nice Render engine!\n-HDR Environments.\n-Exporting to a ton of softwares (including game engine such as Unreal Engine4, Unity.\n\nCONS:\n-Lacks customization on some important things like UNDO levels and memory usage.\n-Painting tools are not precise, they tend to only align with model polygon normal and distorts the paint brush, also does not provide Align to View painting. Instead you have to do it in photoshop which the software let's you do inside the app.\n-Text and Spline tool are horrible. They have the same issue on alignment. Sopmetimes they just don't align properly.\n-Mirror/Symmetry tool does not apply on all functions. Some times it just does not mirror what you're doing.\n\nTHE WORST:\n-Freezes a lot even on a good computer with a low poly model.\n-undo stops working randomly and you have to use the eraser manualy. Good luck if you accidentally painted over a complex detail. Better save frequently.\n-Undo corrupts! This is the total annoyance. Some times you paint a text or something, then press UNDO and you'll see the text being undone partially. Like it forgets some squared parts of the text or paint brush.\n-Keeps crashing alot even when working on low poly models and 2K texture (The app supports up to 16K and I have 24GB of ram).\n-Some times you'll have to reset the whole layout because come windows/toolbars disappear randomly (No! I'm not pressing any hot key accidentally).\n\n\n\nSo, the software is awesome but if you're not careful enough, you'll loose a lot of work and rage a lot.\nFor a 379\u20ac software I've expected more stability and quality of the functions.\n\n\nHope the devs read this and fix those stuff. I'm here to assist them in order to dicover and fix the issues.\nI'm not saying \"NOT RECCOMENDED\" because I'm just a D**k.. but because It's been a couple of months using this software and I keep loosing my work...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]}
