Aces reveals console-port-itus by making it impossible to change the controls ingame, and if you have a 360 controller hooked up expect to get lots of rumble you can't do anything about.\nI was attracted to Aces because it looks and plays a bit like Rez HD. You can move side to side and dodge, but you have no ability to change your path. When executed well, this can be alot of fun. However, shooting in Aces is accomplished by clicking the mouse button instead of holding it. Within the first few minutes of play, I encountered swarms of enemies, and I do mean swarms. You can fire missiles by holding the right mouse button and dragging it over your enemies, but the recharge for this ability encourages you to click away with your guns, and this quickly becomes a pain.\nOutside of gameplay, two more issues quickly made the experience intolerable. Firstly, the majority of the enemies arn't well-differentiated from the background, the shots they fire back at you, or thier own vapor trails. The result is an incredibly busy, confusing, and deadly mess, and that's before you start adding your own shots to the mix. Secondly, I quickly encontered a piece of music that was ear-splittingly painful, and while I could certainly turn off all the music, I really don't see the point of playing a game like this without decent beats.\nThis is obviously a subjective review, so I encourage you to examine other sources."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1409483960, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491191", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "11933417", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197970558721", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1409408844, "num_games_owned": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 20}, "timestamp_updated": 1409483960, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Find a blunt object and start beating yourself in the head with it...
