There's signs of a good idea here but sadly it's buried under a tonne of mediocrity. Let me split this into two broad sections: plot and gameplay\n\nPLOT\nThe premise of the game is that the villain has stolen a prototype suit that lets him travel through time and alter the future so that he is now the great dictator. Now this could have been interesting - alternative universes can offer the devs and players a chance to explore different philosophies and possibilites - but sadly the game wastes all that potential. We never see how the villain came to power, why he did so (not even a \"I just want to be all-powerful\" speech) and if you weren't told explicitly that this is what happened then you would never figure it out. \nThe environments are your bog-standard \"wet industrial area\", \"wet bombed out apartments\", and \"wet military camp in forest\" (one of the consequences of altering the timeline appears to be creating a constant monsoon season). They are completely interchangeable and it's almost impossible to distinguish one from the other. Eventually it all just blurs into one dull slog.\nOh and the time-travel that is supposed to be the key feature of this game? Yeah, it barely ever gets brought up. You could remove that element entirely and the game would not change one bit. \n\nGAMEPLAY\nWhile the story at least has the germ of a good idea buried underneath all the mind-numbing averageness, the same cannot be said for the gameplay. It doesn't so much as scream \"mediocre!\" as mumble it half-heartedly. Guns are what you'd expect - you get  the standard pistol, machine gun, rocket launcher, shotgun, sniper and they shoot alright, I guess. Nothing really special and they seem to lack any kick. \nEnemies come in a few flavours: standard grunt, grunt with shield, grunt grunt with a rocket/sniper, and elite grunt with \"time travel\" (they move really fast). Apart from a skin change from level to level, there is no real variety and you learn pretty quickly how to deal with it. \nYour special time-travel powers are also a joke. You have three: stop, slow, and reverse and using each power requires \"energy\" with slow using the least and reverse using the most. Because of this you'll probably end up using slow the most during combat since it can last about 30 seconds until depleted while reverse only lasts about 10. The only other time you will use your powers will be at set stages in each level where you have to complete a puzzle in order to advance. Again, these are easy to figure out and feel like they were only put there to justify the powers.\n\nCOCLUSION\nDon't buy this game. It is boring as hell that mistakes having a near-useless gimmick as being comlex. There are better things you could spend your money on"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505375995, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501139", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34944221", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198009384622", "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1505374977, "num_games_owned": 870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 486}, "timestamp_updated": 1505376135, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Remember how way back when, back when [I]Gears of War[/I] changed the prevailing color palete to shades of brown, back when everything had to be 'dark and realistic', back when the most common complaint about games was that they were linear?\n\nYeah, [I]TimeShift[/I] made me remember.\n\n[I]TimeShift[/I] has a single gimmick. It's a good gimmick in theory and I'd love to see a game handle it right, but when you implement something as grand as time powers it's a complete waste if your level design is nonexistent and your gameplay consists of nothing but shooting mooks with generic weapons over and over. \n\nLike many mediocre games, [I]TimeShift[/I] has a number of good ideas but fails at execution. The art direction starts promising, with a sort of dieselpunk meets [I]Half-Life[/I] aesthetic, but then we get stuck in canyons and drab metal hallways for most of the game. The weapon system seems to promise variety with alt-fires and unique designs only for everything to fall into archetypes - this is your rapid shot pistol, your basic assault rifle, your shotgun, your sniper rifle, your railgun, etc.. Enemies... look cool I suppose, but do nothing unique besides run at you. The puzzles consist only of activating a platform to lower it, hopping on, the reversing time to raise it back up. The story is only Beat Evil Man Because You Are Good Man.\u2122 Even the music is completely forgettable.\n\nBasically, short of some OK looking scenes there's nothing great here. There's a million excellent FPS games in existence - your time is much better spent playing one of them instead of something entirely drab like [I]TimeShift[/I]."}]}
