"received_for_free": false, "review": "Prototype is an open world Sandbox where you have powerful abilities to destory your enemies, while finding out what happened to yourself and what Gentik is up to.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\n[b] The gameplay and powers [/b]\n\nAlex's powers feel brillant to use and are all around a lot of fun, no power was underused in my playthrough and I liked all of them, my personal favourites are the claws due to their high DPS compared to the other abilities, the other has to be his mobility skills, Alex doesn't need to use a car to get around as he renders any form of transport useless since he is very faster and can glide for miles.\n\n[b] Vehicles while limited, are all fun to use [/b]\n\nYou can only gain access to tanks, apcs and choppers via missions, however they are all fun to control and wreck havoic with.\n\n[b] Killing infected hives and bases [/b]\n\nIt feels so badass when you do this, seeing the building expolde into a million pieces and getting a huge boost of currencty to get it feels so good.\n\n[b] Upgrades [/b]\n\nKilling enemies and doing events allows you to earn currentcy, which can buy upgrades, all of them find a use and I like all of them!\n\n[b] Story [/b]\n\nWhile not the best story I've seen, it keeps you intrested about Alex's backstory and how the virus started.\n\n[b] It's just a lot of fun [/b]\n\nMindless, stupid, action packed fun, while in my playthrough, I had urges to come back over and over to finish it.\n\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\n[b] I can't take the game seriously [/b]\n\nI understand this game is serious about it's plot, however you cannot tell me to keep a straight face when talking about Alex.\n\nHe is so edgy I expected another version of him to appear with different coloured clothes and him to start shouting \"FAKER!\", then shoot up an entire school, then teleport behind me, with his katana out and say \"Nothing p...\" wait hold on a second he has a blade ability... so he can do that if he wants to.\n\nAlso look how he's dressed, he was orignally a scientist before becoming infected, he now looks like a Linkin Park fan.\n\nHonestly I liked his backstory and about the virus, other than that, I cannot take the game seriously.\n\n[b] The most boring city I've ever played in [/b]\n\nLike the colour brown? A lot? and I mean A LOT? Then you will love Prototype's manhattan island where 90% of the island is either brown for most of the game, or red and infected.\n\nPrototype came out during the time I like to call the \"Brown Era\" where games became more realistic. and lost a ton of colour, COD did it, GTA IV did it, and so did this, Prototype is lacking so much colour, it's boring and lifeless.\n\nAlso the peds do nothing except drive or walk, there are no bums, business men chatting on phones, people eating, nothing at all and the city feels so life less.\n\nAlso the city is just squares and cubes without any memorable landmarks, everything looks the same, christ this city is so BORING!\n\n[b] Lack of enemies [/b]\n\nFor humans you only have your average soldier, who can also use tanks and choppers.\nAs for infected you only have normal Zombies, Hunters, Leader Hunters, and once in a while (Mostly in missions) Hydras.\n\nExcluding the bosses, these are the only things you fight throughout the entire game, and it gets boring, very fast.\n\n[b] The bosses are weak [/b]\n\nYou either dive bomb ontop of them killing them quickly, or they spam the shit out of their attacks, not allowing you to get a single hit 90% of the time (Looking at you Miss Greene} and none of them feel satisfying to kill.\n\n[b] Lost potential with stealth [/b]\n\nDuring the story you gain the ability to stealth consume enemies, however you do this ONCE and never again... why? It is helpful in free roam if you don't want the army on ya, but why do you introduce it once and never use it again, everything else is used over and over.\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\n\nPrototype has aged quite a bit, but it's still a lot of fun, grab it in a sale or something like I did, I enjoyed my time with Prototype, and I hope you do the same."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504673453, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34769600", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198150755720", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1450854906, "num_games_owned": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 26}, "timestamp_updated": 1504673453, "received_for_free": false, "review": "does this game work on windows 10 at all?"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504694209, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497312", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34773057", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198065715857", "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1504693903, "num_games_owned": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 11}, "timestamp_updated": 1504694209, "received_for_free": false, "review": "i had no issues getting this game to start on windows 10 after my first download, however it seems during the tutorial that a mission objective npc was placed outside of the skybox preventing me from killing it. the game is fun in its own right from the 11 minuts i played of the game but if you cant get past the tutorial then your basically left with a super mutating character in times square with no one to oppose or kill you with only a screaming , seemingly infected zombie crowd to kill. again they pose no threat because as soon as you kill them they drop what i assume is a health orb that heals you. \n\nit just needs a few bugs worked out but other than that it seems like a great game being nearly 10 years old."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504766401, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499866", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34789292", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025713237", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1506120499, "num_games_owned": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_forever": 91}, "timestamp_updated": 1504766401, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I'm sure i would have loved the game but its a common problem that the game wont run on most windows 10 machines so im giving it a thumbs down"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505089167, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34873789", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198118603890", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505088149, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 30}, "timestamp_updated": 1505089670, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Poor overall textures on important features (Meaning that npcs tend to look better than the MC himself), predictable story, poor controls even if you use a controller it barely alleviates the main issue which is movement. In order to make a basic turn it takes far too long, especially for the 'foot race' events that are spread throughout the game. \n\n  Your character moves far too fast for the nimble turns required. Easy fix for this would be to go a bit slower right? You would be wrong. The game interprets movement on the keyboard/thumbstick so poorly that moving forward at all during a turn results in an infuriating mess of trying to face the correct direction again. It forces the player to have to play in an older fashion which is now obsolete, making turns while standing still.\n\n  I bought this on PC after playing both games on console years back when they released and still think the same thing then as I do now. That is the movement is terribly done, mind you it's a great idea but suffers from poor execution, the second managed to remedy this but still had an underwhelming story which only payoff was a better looking city and well executed powers.\n \n  Lack of focus on how the game actually felt to play vs just making sure it ran decent was the obvious priority when this was released. This was a dissapointment to me as I loved these games when I focused less on thinking critically of them and just tried to play them having fun. \n\n  All in all it could've benefitted greatly if the modding community it did have was supported but unfortuantely almost all mods have completely died with no further communication from the authors. The lack of fluid controls could've been overlooked as this is just a port but that still leaves the replayability of the game in a state of turmoil. While it is good for a once through play I doubt many people would be willing to subject themselves to the abomination that the controls of this game are."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505894042, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496803", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35079561", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198082836423", "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1498045584, "num_games_owned": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 899}, "timestamp_updated": 1505894042, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Why is my name jeff you ask?

For me, I'm just spending money on broken game that wasn't supported even when it was fresh. Unlike most people, I went trough the trouble of applying fixes for all the stuff people are complaining about in the comments. And then I immediately get a \"rare bug\": mouse doesn't work in gameplay at all. Works in menus no problem. Apparently it's completely random and I just need to \"deal with it\". Activision will have to deal with my refund, however little it means. That said, I do have my original retail copy lying around. I'm really curious if it's going to have the same bug, I had no such issues back in the day LOL\n\n\nBtw, it really is worth it if it works for you. The game was brilliant back in the '09 and the sequel is total cringe in comparison. Though I bet it works no problem, ffs."}]}
