To clear the topic \"Hackers\",its broken into 3 categories as you all now: 1) Hackers that use wallhack/aimbot/kicktools just because they don't have the BALLS to play the game normally and with a legit way 2) Hackers that use modded lobbies to boost some peoples XP and actually focus on making some people happy and improve their experience on the game and last but not least 3) Good players been called hackers for a shit tone of reasons but mostly because they can actually move their mouse and have a decent game sense.

I mean - it's from 2009! I can just get PUBG for 10 bucks more !!1!. Let me start by saying, if you have a midrange modern PC (i5, rx 480, 8gb ram) this game will run maxed out at 1080p over 60fps and it is a sight to see. Honestly feels like a completely different game from the one I played in 2009 on my Playstation 3. Of course this is also a game that should be enjoyable on Intel integrated graphics, like in your laptop. You buy this game because it holds a special place in your heart, it was and is your favorite (or maybe top 3) COD's of all time. Yes there is still an online community. You should be able to find 10-20+ lobbies at any given time. Ping isn't terrible, but you try hards might cringe at 100ms ping but it is perfectly fine for the avg casual person. I've only run into one hacker, it's easy just to leave the game and join a new one. Newer COD's have more hackers. Last time I played this game I was in 2011, and back then all I really wanted to do in campaign was beat it as fast as possible. Go back and play it again, pay attention to all the little details, pick up random enemy weapons. It's a relatively short feeling campaign that I beat under 6 hrs but appreciate the story waaaay more. It will make you want to go and play all of the MW's again. Spec ops missions could take twice that amount if you want to get 3 stars in everything. \n\nThis is not a bad game in 2017. sure not the golden years but plenty of fun to be had."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506849423, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35373901", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198127318229", "num_reviews": 53, "last_played": 1499541337, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3219}, "timestamp_updated": 1506849423, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\n\nGreat campaign, great multiplayer, great co-op missions.
