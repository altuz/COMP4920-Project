Seriously, you\u2019d regret it. Hell, you\u2019d regret playing it for free. It\u2019s a borderline-broken, boring, frustrating, unfinished mess, and there was nothing we could do stop it.\n\nWhat happened is that we agreed to let a big Russian publisher develop and publish a third Postal game, which we would handle the design for. It was actually going well for the initial development time, but then the economy crashed especially hard in Russia and the project was handed to a smaller, less experienced team that didn\u2019t have the skill or resources to make the game we designed, and they were forced to rush development to meet unreasonable deadlines. Corners were cut severely, dramatic changes to our design were made, and the game was put out in an unfinished barely-Alpha state. The game is simply unfinished and broken. And when it does work, the game is just boring and frustrating to play. The sad part is that the publisher made little-to-no effot to fix it themselves, nor did they ever give us access so that we could try patching it up for them. We are stuck with Postal III as it is.\n\nYou\u2019re a responsible adult (we hope), so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re capable of making your own purchasing decisions. I just want you to consider all of the above, before you make the leap of regret into paying real hard-earned money for this title. We don\u2019t own the game, we can\u2019t support it and we don\u2019t get anything from its sales, so if you decide to risk the purchase \u2013 you\u2019re on your own.          \n\n\nfrom Running With Scissors crew\n\n\n(look up the website its even said they dont like it.)"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506002849, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507908", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35105381", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198117328685", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1480370105, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 95}, "timestamp_updated": 1506002849, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Not even half as good as Postal 2."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505196306, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505203", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34895792", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198164060778", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1500082729, "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1044}, "timestamp_updated": 1505196306, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is waaaaaayyyy too overpriced for what you're getting,\nit feels unfinished, is SUPER buggy and crashes a ton I would NOT recommend this game...\n\nGet Postal 1 or 2 instead.."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504637565, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498282", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34762497", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198007657951", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1504661706, "num_games_owned": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1090}, "timestamp_updated": 1504637565, "received_for_free": false, "review": "its not a \"Bad\" game.
