I am glad I did.\n\nSome aspects of this game are really great, others are awful.\n\nThe artwork is fabulous and it helps the game exude atmosphere. It reminded me of 'Evil Under the Sun' with a bit of 'Black Mirror 1' and 'Syberia' thrown in, but in the mountains. The hotel was a dream to explore as it is huge and would be a fantastic place to stay. I loved the short sections outside, with the snow falling. The artists did a fab job.\n\nDifficulty is not too tough. I only needed to check a walkthrough once, when I couldn't fathom how to lure the owner out of his office. \n\nKaisa is certainly very cute.\n\nThe music is lovely for the most part, though a couple of horrendous rock pieces come in at odd moments and not just when entering the room of a particular character.\n\nGameplay is ok, with a clear changing cursor.\n\nNow for the bad. The story  is a real slow boiler, which is a good thing as it sets the scen beautifully and allows us to get to know the characters. However, when the main events finally happen, the story just ends. I had the most nonsensical ending  to a game ever and though there are different endings none make a lot of sense, with an absolutely ridiculous twist at the end. So the game takes a good few hours to brew and then when something big finally happens, it ends. Crazy. It is like the developers suddenly lost interest to continue the plot.\n\nThe translation is poor, though understandable. Sometimes it appears that characters give a comnpletely different answer to the question being asked. The voicees being better than the inaccurate subtitles. It's crazy that the developers didn't get someone who can understand proper English to check the translation. The character voices range from ok (the main character, Kaisa, and Olga) to horrendously bad (Alec, for instance). Also the voices are obviously done with the actor not having a clue as to the context in which they are supposed to be said. A basic error.\n\nSo, I am going to recommend this title as parts of this game are very enjoyable indeed, though the ridiculously abrupt and silly ending ruins the experience in the end."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1385534028, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501808", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "7780782", "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197997602124", "num_reviews": 42, "last_played": 1377935151, "num_games_owned": 765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 253}, "timestamp_updated": 1385534028, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Appallingly awful - spent ages setting things up, then ended abruptly in a ridiculous way that bore no relation to anything that had happened up to that point.

I've never read this particular book, but I figured anything related to them couldn't possibly turn out that bad. I was horribly wrong, but I don't need to tell you that, because I doubt anyone was actually planning on buying this game to begin with. But I'm going to go over it anyways because I need a therapeutic rant session to recover from playing it.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice within five seconds of starting the game is that the voice acting is absolutely terrible. Just listen to the opening dialogue of the game, and you'll see what I mean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRYvubs4MQs . Well, actually the first thing you'll notice is that despite originally releasing in 2007 the game only runs in one resolution, and it's 1024 x 768 and cannot be changed, but still. There are one or two actors who border on decent, but for the most part the game sounds as if they hired a bunch of bums off the street and paid them in bread to do the voice acting for the game. It's kind of hilarious, and was mainly what kept me playing through the game, but it also made the story impossible to take seriously.\n\nLuckily, there really isn't much story. Again, I've never read the novel this was based off of, but I highly doubt it went quite like this. You spent the first four or five hours of the game doing absolutely nothing relevant to the plot, mainly involving stupid puzzles like helping the hotel owner fix the room service call system that never gets used again, or choosing a dinner from various categories that doesn't cause the other guests to laugh at your choice (I don't know why having too many vegetables in your meal is grounds for making you redo a \"puzzle\", but what do I know?), or playing billiards with another character that isn't even really a puzzle so much as just a billiards flash game implanted into the game. Then in the last 20 minutes or so of the game the story finally starts, you talk to each of the hotel's residents, and then it ends, and the game explains the story to you. \n\nAs you might have gathered from that last bit, the store page is pretty misleading. It mentions \"15+ hours of gameplay\", but I finished it in less than 6 and I can't imagine it taking 15 hours unless you just get lost in the unnecessarily large hotel. The store page also makes it seem as if the hotel guests have AI routines and go about their own lives, hinting at a system something like how Deadly Premonition's characters go about their day, but the game doesn't have any sort of time system and the characters just move from place to place as you solve the puzzles like in any adventure game. I used to think RunAway was the worst point-and-click adventure game I'd ever played, but I'm not sure if anything will ever top this one."}, {"votes_down": 17, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1385595106, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498403", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "7795367", "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198015075204", "num_reviews": 344, "last_played": 1503248469, "num_games_owned": 1358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 21}, "timestamp_updated": 1385595106, "received_for_free": false, "review": "you might think that a hotel owned by a dead mountaineer would be interesting but actually this game will make you want to die, much like that mountaineer, who is dead, as the game's title explains, and also several signs and paintings in the hotel which are of a dead mountaineer please don't buy this game"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1419762781, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501725", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13660257", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027756435", "num_reviews": 60, "last_played": 1359705600, "num_games_owned": 898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 512}, "timestamp_updated": 1427674264, "received_for_free": false, "review": "\"A call button... purple maybe....\"\n\nOPTION A: *PRESS IT?*\nOPTION B:  *DON'T PRESS IT?*\n\n*SELECTED: OPTION A*\n\n\"...PRESS it...!\"\n*Presses button.\n\nAnd then... well... yes.\n\nCONS: \n\n1) Bad voice acting: Atrocious.\n2) Gordon Ramsay didn't give his permission to be the main character, or in costume.\n3) The ending.\n\nPROS: \n\n1) It's so stupid it's amusing at times.\n2) A dog is a scholar, apparently.\n\nDo I recommend?\nOh gawd, no. \n\nWas it gifted to you?\nGood luck with that!\n\n..then again, it's so bad it's amusing... watch a \"Let's Play\" or something instead :)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1466631430, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "23714519", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198017846409", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1453620236, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 502}, "timestamp_updated": 1466631430, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ok, so after lots and lots of hours I basically just gave up.

The voice acting was very bland, like they read from a script and that's it. The hints of what to do or who to speak to were either vague or non existant. And the story wasn't that great to begin with, and got even weirder near the end. Even if you like adventure games, with no replayability, you would do well to avoid this one, and get something else instead."}]}
