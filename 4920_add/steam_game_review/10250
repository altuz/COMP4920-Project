In my case I use Win 8.1 64X with an AMD card, I tried the demo in the page of the editor however, I was unable to make it work, fortunately a user in the forums posted the link to the proper driver, I installed it (no rocket science) and the demo ran perfectly.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/10250/discussions/0/846954921855418513/\n\nIf you are interested in this game try the demo first, if it does not work please check the forums\n\n\nNow the game features.\n\nThere are 3 tutorial missions, and 54 missions in campaign.\n\nWeser\u00fcbung: 1940, 5 missions, Germany and Great Britain.\nEnglish Channel: 1940, 5 missions, Germany and Great Britain.\nCold Waters: 1943, 4 missions, Germany and Soviet Union.\nLand under sight: 1944, 4 missions, Soviet Union.\n\nRoutine service: 5 missions, Germany, Allies and Soviet Union.\nBonus missions: 2 missions, Germany, Allies and Soviet Union.\n\nYou control a PT Boat,  you can change stations, artillery, machine guns, torpedo launcher and helmsman.\nYou will have control of other ships, minesweepers, destroyers, etc however you can only take the helmsman role you can't directly fire their weapons.\n\nA nice variety of missions, attack convoys, defend convoys, collect intel, search and attack bases, etc.\n\nSome missions are very short maybe 10-15 minutes and others can reach 1 hour, you can't save in the middle of the missions so be careful.\n\nIf you like Battlestations Midway/Pacific, take a look at this game."}]}
