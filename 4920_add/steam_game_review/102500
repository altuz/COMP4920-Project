For some reason i only played a bit. Recently  i started it again and i must say this is one of the best RPG i've played! \n\nStory - This is one of the best thing about the game. It's basically a fairy tale and an interesting one. It has really good story and how enough options to create your own. \n\nQuests - Since Quests are important part of a RPG game i thought of adding it. Each quests in this game has meaning unlike few other games. Quests tell good story while revealing more of its pretty big open world and getting more and more main/side quests. Each quests are really fun to do and undoubtedly really enjoyable.\n\nGameplay - This game has pretty different gameplay than most other RPG. You can chose to be a mage/knight/assassin or all 3 together. These are not ingame choices, just my own gameplay experience. There's lot of different class weapons and they don't really strict you to play 1 class at a time. You can chose whatever weapons you want in both of your weapon slots. Good amount of magic casting. The game is also pretty hard since the NPC are not braindead and using same technique will get you nowhere. I like this kind of gameplay. Of course i could not summary nearly half of the gameplay mechanics this game offers but i tell you there's alot!\n\nGraphics - Considering it's a 2012 game, pretty decent graphics. \n\nControls - Controls are not clunky and easy to access. Really easy and straight forward actually.\n\nOptimization - It's perfect you could say. \n\nWorld Design - It's really good. \n\nOverall - 9/10 from me. \n\nYou really should try it if you wanna play a pretty big and enjoyable game. Don't expect skyrim lvl. tho!\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506478001, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507163", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35233784", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198096859211", "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1497143961, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6205}, "timestamp_updated": 1506478001, "received_for_free": false, "review": "My only complaint is that there's limited storage in your house(s) yet they give you so many neat custom armors and materials to make your own. \nYou can respec your character to anything you want but you more often then not will have sold off all the items you'd use for a different build simply due to lack of proper storage space. \nAside from that i freaking love this game. The combat system is a blast and the character creation options give you not only the three archtypes (knight, assassin, mage) but you can combine their attributes and pick/choose what suits you. \nThink old WoW single player but with 3x as many character attribute options. Best part is that you can change them later on if you change your mind.\nIt can feel grindy at times after the main plot, it's kind of par for the course for RPG's, you can only dress fetch and kill quests in so many outfits before it doesn't feel new anymore but there's a surprising amount of guild/clan quests that i found to be even more interesting then the main plot. Getting out off the beaten track and exploring pays off here, they placed a ton of neat side quests as a reward for those who prefer to look around. \n\nRuns great. Only one weird bug during a sidequest that crashed the game but i never could get it to happen again. One glitch after 100 hours of game play is a worthy note.

That's massively disappointing. You can, however, approach a \"fateweaver\" and change your current skills if you want to try being good at lockpicking instead of potion making. That's interesting, but I'm still pretty bummed that I can't advance my character any further. A big incentive to complete quests is that you get huge xp bonuses for finishing something, and that incentive is lost without any more leveling up :(\n\nThat flaw doesn't completely counter the fact that this is an excellent game.

Poorly designed system.\n- Difficulty: played on Hard and it was still too easy.\n- Combat:  mostly liked the combat skills, but overall the combat is lackluster. Auto seeking spells and enemy special attacks that are frustrating to dodge -- my experience was just getting overpowered skills/items and mashing two buttons without any real thought or positioning involved.\n- World: quantity over quality. Yes, it's big - too big. Although the environment is beautiful, I don't remember any of the NPCs. The monsters are repetetive.
