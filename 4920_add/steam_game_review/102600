You have to use traps, spells and weapons to prevent massive hordes or Orcs from reaching the rift that your defending. I'm not normally a fan of the genre but I really liked this game. You can unlock a wide variety of traps and its quite fun to use them to slaughter waves of Orcs. The cartoony, over the top violence is quite funny even though putting Orcs through a gauntlet of murder machines is quite sadistic if you think about it.\n\nThis game also puts your character directly in the action so if some part of your defences isnt holding up you have the option to personally intervene and help defend using weapons and spells. I found this was quite good as it feels you have more control in shaping the situation.\n\nMy main criticism of the game is the balance of how useful each trap is. Some are only really useful in a couple of levels and I rarely used them. Others like the Swinging Mace for example are really overpowered.  Ultimately I found myself using some traps almost exclusively as they're just too effective not to use.\n\nOverall though its a fun game and I did enjoy it quite a bit which is saying a lot as I'm typically not a fan of these types of games."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499748267, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497974", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33447778", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198053160084", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1499823611, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2480}, "timestamp_updated": 1499748267, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is by far my favorite \"tower defense\" game. It requires a fair amount of skill in addition to clever trap placement. I loved this game so much that I completed it. To complete the game, you have to get five skulls on every level on war mage difficulty, and then you have to do it again in nightmare difficulty. Plenty of challenge, but I would just keep coming back to work on the next level and before I knew it, it was over. \n\nThe story is fun, and not really repetitive which is surprising given how many times you have to play through it. The shooting is arguably the best part, and you can just chain together headshot after headshot for massive damage. The DLCs add some fun traps and levels as well if you couldn't get enough."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499471583, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494287", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33357991", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197964259073", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1496511077, "num_games_owned": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 139}, "timestamp_updated": 1499471583, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I REALLY liked this game for the first two hours.
