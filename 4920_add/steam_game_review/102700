Then you have to choose a security question. Just let me play, please.\n-The main menu and launcher layout is so garbage. If I didn't have experience with crappy layouts like this, I probably would of never been able to play the game.\n-You can't make a girl character.\n-It puts you in windowed mode after/before a match.\n-You get more accuracy with guns when you don't look down the sights. wat.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's pretty fun, basically the free and more expanded version of CS:GO.
