I've spent over 16 hours on it so far, and I played all the way to the end, fully upgrading my character, called a \"Walker.\"\n\nThe [b]graphics[/b] and animations are wonderful! The screen is very clear, and the characters have unique attributes and expressions which make them identifiable. If you pay attention, you'll even notice quite a bit of humor, particularly in how the workers on the conveyer belts move, the billboards, and the final boss battle. \n\nThe [b]soundtrack[/b] is also good, and it's extremely helpful while playing, because certain sound effects alert you to what's coming. I played most of the game with the sound off, just so I didn't disturb my husband watching T.V., but if you leave the sound on, you'll have even quicker reaction times with the advance warning that the sound effects can provide.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nYour character is the uncle, and you're in a mech called a walker. This walker can be upgraded multiple times, and gold bars are the currency by which this is accomplished. Bars are obtained through normal gameplay as you complete levels. You also gain experience points through gameplay, and these are used for cosmetic unlockables: skins, effects, and pets. These don't impact gameplay in any way and are purely cosmetic but can certainly gain you some bragging rights.\n\nThere are 5 full chapters, each with area levels that progressively introduce more enemies and increased projectile speed. The game sports fully functional, and very responsive, controller support, so this is definitely a game that can be fully enjoyed with a controller. I used an XBox 360 and didn't have any issues in that regard. \n\nGatling Gears can be played on easy, normal, and hard [b]difficulty levels[/b], and it also includes campaign and survival [b]modes[/b]. Additionally, you can resume the game right where you left off if you die or exit the game. You have 3 lives, but never fear, this is [u]not[/u] a permadeath situation, because once you've completed a level within a chapter, you can always pick right back up where you left off, and any upgrades or unlockables stay with your walker. You'll never go any further back than repeating the specific area where you died.\n\nHardcore gamers, never fear, because you can still strut your stuff and create an even harder challenge by utilizing the hard difficulty setting or simply not using grenades and rockets. If that's not enough for you, then you can actually use gold bars to [i]reverse[/i] upgrades, creating a whole new difficulty level for those who are gluttons for punishment. If you're into [b]co-op[/b], the niece can also be played for some tagteam [i]bad-assery[/i].\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1] \n\nI really enjoyed this game. I paid full price for it, simply because I wanted to play it, and I'm very glad that I did. I've gotten over 16 hours of enjoyment out of it already, and I can see myself spending more time with it to obtain the remaining achievements. I definitely recommend it to both casual and hardcore gamers and also those who enjoy twin-stick or arcade shooters. It was a whole lot of fun."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1442191386, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526403", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "18024571", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970470391", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1468450891, "num_games_owned": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1205}, "timestamp_updated": 1442217659, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Combine Metal Slug, Ikari Warriors and Steam Punk into a game.

While the narrative is rather vapid, it's hard to notice since the action is perfectly paced and the levels are solid. The only other thing that is lacking is the number of players ready for co-op - multiplayer is essentially limited to local games only, since there is no drop-in multiplayer mode.

While admittedly pretty simplistic, I like the cartoony graphics and it's a solid twin-stick shooter.  You have an arsenal of four weapons from the start and unlimited/regenerating ammo for each - there are no weapon/ammo pickups in the game.  While I like the upgrade system for your weapons, I don't understand why the upgrades are purchased with the gold bars placed through each level instead of the parts or \"gears\" that you're already collecting from everything you destroy - it seems that would create more incentive to try and destroy everything (at least, as much as possible) in each level.  Regardless, I still think it's an incredibly fun game, though challenging enough to not be completely mindless.  I definitely recommend this to fans of twin-stick shooter action games.\n\nNote: I've only played with keyboard/mouse so I can't speak to controller functionality.\n\nUPDATE: The one big thing that annoys me about this game is how you can't go backwards.  As you advance through the (completely linear) pathway, the camera moves to follow you so, if you miss a gold bar and walk too far ahead, you're out of luck until you play through the level again.  However, I read somewhere that there are more gold bars in the game than it takes to fully upgrade your mech so it's not that big of a deal but it still delays your ability to upgrade if you miss some gold.\n\nSomething else that may be of interest to some prospective players is that there seems to be little if any replay value to the game.  The entire game is very straightforward and totally linear so the only reasons I can see to play through again would be 1) to collect any gold you may have missed or 2) to try a higher difficulty setting.  Of course, this depends on what type of player you are - it's feasible that you could love the rampaging shooter action so much that completing the game once just isn't enough.  If you think a single play-through is kind of a ripoff, you'll probably want to wait for a sale."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1364099660, "weighted_vote_score": "4.998889", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2783623", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012563758", "num_reviews": 62, "last_played": 1373439794, "num_games_owned": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 428}, "timestamp_updated": 1364099660, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A solid twin-stick shooter set in a mech/steampunk world.
