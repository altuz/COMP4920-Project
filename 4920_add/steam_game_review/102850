It's a solid concept: you're an alien that's crash-landed onto earth, and you've been brought in for experiments in a lab on the bottom of the sea. You and a mysterious alien friend of yours need to escape. The catch is that you get this ability to warp from place to place around you, including within objects. It's a clever concept, and it looks and feels pretty good for a game that lists a usual price of $10. The puzzles are generally challenging, and some of the challenge maps are quite tough.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the praise ends. You have to deal with stupid EA account BS every time you log in, or you can't access your save file. The story is pretty flat and not that dynamic, and from what I've heard, the game runs like crud on systems with older CPUs. There's little incentive to collect everything you find (no achievements, no end-game rewards, and the powerups you can get from SOME of the collectables don't change up gameplay that much). I really had to force myself to finish this game after spending maybe 4-5 hours on it total. It's not even that long, I just wanted to collect as much as I could.\n\nIf you're really desperate for an indie game, I guess give this a try?

It's a neat mechanic that isn't used in many games and lends itself to some intresting puzzles.\n\n-=Overview=-\nWARP is a pretty neat game. It's semi cartoonish appearance hides it gory nature, as fragging enemies result in gory and satisfying explosions. The protagonist is a yellow alien that has been captured by humans for research. It soons gains or regains the ability to telport short distances, which allows it to move quickly and hide in objects of it's same size - which are mainly various canisters and the torso's of humans. The alien can \"charge up\" these items, causing it to explode violently. Eventually, you can earn the ability to create an echo of yourself to distract enemies and later, swap places with objects, as well as the ability to throw objects that you are hiding in. Throwing and telefragging are the only ways to kill enemies beyond environmental hazards, so you need to use the camera to scope out an area and find out to get past guards and hazards,\n\n-=Presentation=-\nOn the PC, the game looks somewhat bad. The modeling and texture work itself and actually fairly smooth looking (though the alient model has some slight blockiness close up in cutscenes). The content and assets actually look good, but the total lack of anti-aliasing destroys that work, as everything on your screen looks almost as jaggy as PSX era games. I have a feeling the console versions doesn't have this problem. You will need use your graphics card anti-aliasing in order to improve this, but even after that, it looks more like an effect than a proper in-game smoothing. The developer failed on this part. There's not much to say about the soundtrack....I'm sure there was music and ambience, but I don't remember any track. The main menu has a nice extraterrestial sound though. The sound effects are great however - the warping effect sounds believable, explosions of objects and people seem realistic, and the alien makes a chittering, sqeaking type noise that make it seems like it came from another planet. The sound design, besides the lack of music (which admittedly, does help with the sterile research environment) works well for immersion.\n\n-=Experience=-\nThe game is fairly easy to play and may occasionally challenge you, but most players should be able to solve the game if you understand the mechanics. I only got completely stumped once. The game plays in an isometric fashion where you never change height (slopes and stairs) except for elevators to another floor, so I never thought about the game in that third height dimension. There is one moment where you must throw a canister over a obstacle about the height of the alien. Since you never have to do this anywhere else, it's easy not to realize you have to use the crane in the area to throw a canister over that obstacle. The average player is more likely to die from environmental hazards and turrets than they are from guards. Bosses provide some moderate challenge (especially the very annoying last battle). The biggest challengs comes from finding grubs through out the world and from challenge levels, These grubs are currency for minor upgrades available at certain checkpoints. There is no respec or buyback, so you should choose upgrades wisely, but fortunately, no upgrade is so necessary that you will loose if you didn't \"Build your toon correctly\". \n\nThe experience is severely ruined by the Origin/EA requirements. You have to log in to the game every time you launch, which doesn't make sense as there is no online experience beyond leaderboards and oddly enough, a friends system just for this game (it's possible that it would pull from your Origin friends - I don't have any though). You need to enter a key upon first use of the game. The login experience is pretty annoying, as it's easy to accidentally log out (at least for me) and have to log back in again. The login screen is mouse based, even though the game is mostly keyboard based and after typing your user name, you have to press tab twice to get to the password field where you can then login, and have another screen telling you that you have logged in (while still being able to control the main menu with your X Input controller, oddly enough), but having to use the mouse to click OK. It's way to clunky. More clunkyness ensues as you can't rebind the keys and it looks like the game assumes you have a controller connected (I did have one plugged in at all times, but I have a feeling the game will always show XBox style prompts regardless)\n\n-=Conclusion=-\nI did enjoy the game and it's unfortunate that this game didn't appear to sell well (perhaps it did ok on consoles) - I only have two friends who have this game, and nobody else has wishlisted this. I've had this wishlisted for a long time due to its interesting mechanics. I think this game could have been extended tremendously with a level editor, where players can make levels for each other. Players who like to speed run can probably get enjoyment out of finding the fastest way to play this, but unfortunately, I've only seen one video for this. Funnily enough, some of the challenge levels have clearly hacked/cheated leaderboards, with times of literally .500 seconds. It's a good puzzler that gave me about 7 hours of enjoyment. A high skill player can probably do so in 1-3 hours less."}, {"votes_down": 54, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1396901971, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564520", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "9757051", "votes_up": 98, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198021299105", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1396901632, "num_games_owned": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 14}, "timestamp_updated": 1396901971, "received_for_free": false, "review": "And why do I not recommend this game.
