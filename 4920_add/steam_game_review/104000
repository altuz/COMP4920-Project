PROs and CONs first. Then some comments & random notes I have about the game.\n(note, MY #/10 score = [b]MY ENJOYMENT[/b] + minimal thought of gameplay+graphics/sound+story etc.. )\n\n[h1]PROs:[/h1]\n+solid tower defense\n+minimalistic/simple\n+lot of levels\n+high ground usage (bigger range)\n+fair TD difficulty \n\n[h1]CON:[/h1]\n-flash game era game\n-average everything\n-not that many upgrades/variation\n-soundtrack?\n\n\n[h1]Comments:[/h1]\n... if you want simple TD flash game..yeah play it. If you want actual PC TD game.. go play something else. There a lot of them and much more intriguing than this one. This is something you can find on flash game sites (if they even around still) .. rather play Canyon Defense or something like that.\n\nThis game basically has 5 units? (can't even remember anymore..) few upgrades and then simply defend yourself. But yeah.. I recommend to play something else.. \n\n[b]Dropped[/b]\n[h1]5/10[/h1]"}]}
