If you're looking to add some whimsy to your life, this is a great choice. If not, this probably won't be your cup of tea (haha). The gameplay is very simple - you're a dude who floats around in a magic teacup collecting sugar cubes and stickers and avoiding obstacles. Obstacles include lava, angry clouds, pits and various pointy things which cause instant death. What I think makes SIT special is that there is a meter that controls your ability to jump/float that rapidly depletes when you press jump but immediately starts to fill when you release it. This means that you can do a variety of midair maneuvers such as changing directions and jumping higher than you would expect. You can customize your little dude with stickers you collect (mostly just color choices, but boy, do I enjoy the different colors of magic teacup trails). There are a few different game modes. Story mode is 40 levels with no unifying theme per cluster of levels and no appreciable increase in difficulty. Some levels sprinkled in are randomly a little more difficult, but nothing frustratingly so. There is some variety as far as grassy level, boat level, underground level but like I said, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to level order. A few levels add wind obstacles or little shooting mini games and I guess this is called story mode because there are a few pictures at the very beginning and there is a quasi boss battle at the end. The 10 bonus levels add a cool new element - blocks that allow you to rotate the level. Survival mode consists of 5 levels of collecting sugar for two minutes while avoiding obstacles. You get an achievement for collecting 30 sugars in each, but I collected 50 in each in only a few tries. Challenge mode is 5 reworked levels that you have already played that have more obstacles thrown in to make them more of a challenge. \n\nTips & Tricks - So this is the first Steam game that I have unlocked all the achievements on. They are pretty straightforward except for 3. I got the no jump achievement on level 21. (It isn't possible on many of the levels because you cannot reach the goal without jumping unless there are wind boosts on that level). I got the no sugar achievement on level 12. (Again this is not possible on every level because the sugar cubes are often between you and the goal). Lastly, I was stumped at first as to how to get the achievement for perfecting the credits level because the credits did not roll after completing story mode or after completing the bonus levels, although there was a congratulations screen after each. To play the credit level, pick Cobra from the main menu and then click on credits. (Weird).\n\nBottom line - Whimsy! Fun, not overly challenging but decent challenge if you are going for all the achievements which requires perfects on the levels. A nice little diversion. If you're looking for something low stress and sugar-coated, I definitely recommend this. I picked this up during the summer sale for $0.74, so just keep an eye out during the upcoming fall and winter sales if you are interested."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1395787278, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502430", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9629544", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198113481876", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1395854778, "num_games_owned": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 357}, "timestamp_updated": 1395787278, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Storm in a Teacup is a nice little platformer with puzzle elements; the levels are short enough to play on coffee breaks, and there's a nice amount of variation in backgrounds, game elements, and throwbacks to classic games like Space Invaders.
