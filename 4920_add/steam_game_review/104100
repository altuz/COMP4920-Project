Inside a Star-Filled Sky is exactly the type of game I'd expect to see win some kind of award at the IGF - but winning an award at the IGF doesn't necessarily mean it's a good game. \n\nInsidie a Star-Filled Sky is a novel concept and little more. The game itself is themes around the idea of recursion where you 'enter' power ups and enemies. While this is a nice idea it doesn't really impact the gameplay that much and each item you enter is effectively just the next room. I did appreciate the power up mechanics. You can collect up to 3 powerups and they can be combined in interesting ways to produce interesting effects. This fact alone, however, is not enough to merit a recommendation from me.\n\nAs a product, the game is very unpolished and feels like a prototype - for example editing the controls involves manually editing a config file. There's also no sound effects to speak of, just some ambiance music. \n\nThere are some nice ideas here but I don't feel the developer took time to flesh them out into a compelling gaming experience and instead delivered us a rough prototype.\n\nScore: 3.5/10"}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1326477079, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "4260945", "votes_up": 35, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198034663705", "num_reviews": 89, "last_played": 1326528000, "num_games_owned": 6724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 51}, "timestamp_updated": 1408502127, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Perfect example of how NOT to use procedural generation: as the content of the entire game.

There is no reward for continued play.\n2) Bullet patterns are mostly undodgable and relies on your health bar to tank hits. A lot of shmup games do this and they usually suck. You can do this thing where you enter an enemy to make them suck more if they're giving you trouble, but it takes so long it's not worth the time. (but then again there is no reward for continued play so do whatever you want)\n3) Some levels aren't even related to the thing they spawn from. This usually happens in powerups, where you get in real close and randomly some open area spawns out of a design. It would be much more impressive if you always could tell what you're inside, and sometimes you can- but most of the time the screen is too zoomed in or the level too irrelevant to tell.\n\nI bought this game when it was released and since then it's only gotten 60 reviews.

The game is described as: an \"infinite, recursive, tactical shooter\". By infinite and recursive, the designer of course means procedurally generated, and by tactical it means you'll often be sitting behind a corner waiting for the one time you can dash out without instantly dying, or choosing to run away into a different level because discretion is the better part of valor.
