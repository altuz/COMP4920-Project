Its all about trying to get best possible score in level. Biggest problems this game has are GFWL and Somewhat repetitive gameplay. Could still recommend for people who like old-school games and want to try something new\"\n\nGeneral\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n The Club is very unique and refreshing Third-Person shooter, its not story driven game , but instead its all about the score.\nYou get points for each enemy you kill, depending on where you shot him, how difficult was the kill etc. You also have combo meter ticking down and each kill refreshes it and adds more combo. There are also other ways of getting combo points (shooting skull signs on the walls). So the whole point of the Game is to do stylish kills and chain them for maximum point gain. The stages also play out always the same way, requiring you to memorize enemy locations for best possible points. \nThere are different characters and they all have different stats (health, speed etc) , but differences are quite small and you unlock new Characters by playing Campaign. \n\n\nCampaign \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Main Gamemode is Campaign, where you are taking part on these Club Bloodsport tournaments altough there isn't really much story going on here, you have AI opponents and your goal is to beat their time/score depending on the mode, sometimes you can only stay in chalked are or you will blow up, sometimes you need to reach end of level in time, but they are all essentially the same, all about score and time. This is how the campaign plays out pretty much from start to end, you have different locations where you play, prison, bunker, venezuela , factory .. etc and it brings decent enough variety to the levels. Campaign doesn't seem to be that long ,about 3-4 hrs long, without retries. But you can always try to get better time, or crank up the difficulty, which is the point of the game really. \nAs said, the campaign mostly plays out the same way, so it does get bit repetitive at the times, but its good in short burts\n\nOther Modes\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou have also freeplay mode where you can replay all these missions and try getting better time and the game also has versus mode, but atleast i didnt get it to work.\nAlso worth noting is that the game does still use Games for Windows Live, which means that some players might have problems launching/playing the game. I Didnt have thoes but its been reported that this might cause problems to some.\nGfwl also seems to affect said versus/multiplayer mode and you cant play online anymore\n\n\nSummary \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+ Fast paced, fun and hectic\n+ Great level layouts\n+ Varying Locations\n+ Good in short bursts\n- Still bit repetitive gameplay\n- GFWL\n- Lack of Different gamemodes"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1476800493, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504140", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "26101513", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198007760547", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1506135321, "num_games_owned": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 225, "playtime_forever": 1671}, "timestamp_updated": 1476800493, "received_for_free": false, "review": "From the creators of Project Gotham Racing. They bring quite an unorthodox video game. \n\nIt's a game that your main focus is achieving the highest score rather than progressing through any form of plot. Except the characters' brief backstory, and an ending in the same shortness of earlier fighting games.\n\n8 skilled killers have been taken into an organization called 'The Club'. Whether they wanted to be in it or not. They fight in several tournaments of ultraviolence to reclaim their freedom or what they desire.\n\nEach contestant has unique attributes to them.  How fast they move, how much damage they can take, and how much damage they dish out. It allows for some experimenting to see who can rack the best chains of kills quick as possible in various events regarding survival, moving through the level at a quick pace, or sustain damage better when health is scarce.\n\n\nIf you like score attacking video games, just killing your foes stylishly and quick as possible. This game is for you. \n\nIf you want plot or deep storyline. Don't expect it in this game.\n\nPlease note to use the patch fix guide on steam, when you finished installing.\n\n\nPros:\n*Can be as very tough or very easy as you want it to be\n*Art style aged decently for a 2008 game\n*Good pacing for the action\n*Decent music\n*Has a skill ceiling required to get the best scores. AI does their best to disrupt your scores or to overwhelm you.\n\nCons\n*Multiplayer is probably non existent by now\n*Could've been at least some more lines for the characters in their endings. I think they deserve to at least say something for killing for their freedom.\n*May get repetitive for some.\n\n7.5/ 10 \n\nWould recommend to anyone who likes arcadey gameplay or third person shooters, and can live without a plot rich storyline.\n"}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1374794742, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501500", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "69758", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197961093505", "num_reviews": 392, "last_played": 1381359464, "num_games_owned": 2276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 97}, "timestamp_updated": 1374794742, "received_for_free": false, "review": "YO FIFTY JUMP OFF THAT BIG-ASS RAMP\n\nWait, this isn't that game?
