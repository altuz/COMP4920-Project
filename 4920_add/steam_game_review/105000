The list of cons is so long I have to.\n\nCONS\n- Only made 7 years ago but it feels and looks like it was made in the early 90s.\n- No widescreen, black bars down the side of my screen\n- Dreadful voice acting.  Not just bad inclination but somehow actual bad acting. ie actor 1 stops half way through sentence waiting to be interrupted but actor 2 waits a significant time before supposedly interrupting.\n- Fay one of two playable characters just looks permanently grumpy I actually wanted her to be killed off along with most other characters.\n-And the biggest con was HOW the story was done.  It took an interesting idea; time travel to prevent a catastrophe due to climate change but because of the heavyhanded approach to the story I felt I was being thumped on the head by an extreme environmentalist at the same time listening to a boring lecture on the subject instead of playing a game.  The problem with crusaders of any kind is that they have zero humour and manage to not only suck any joy of anything they touch but actively put you off any interest you had in the subject.  \n\nUsually daedalic games aren't written by people like that and have multi subject threads in a story to keep it interesting.  Even games that are dark or serious, if they are good have either fun gameplay or characters done in a way to keep your interest or humour in certain parts of a game.  If only they hadn't been so heavy-handed or had more than one subject that the conversation revolved around this could and should have been easily an interesting gripping story.\n\nAlthough I felt all joy being sucked out of everything including gameplay, most gameplay was technically good it just felt leaden. It was this devs usual gameplay, not obvious in parts a lot of exploration more old fashioned point n click gameplay.  They had some mini games which were either not easy or not quick.\n\nI had played most of this before at GOG (hence short time here) but couldn't finish it due to cons so picked this up in steam sale as it had achs and it was only that that kept me playing this time.  But at least this time I knew to mute sound, and just FF speed reading all the lectures. I wanted to see if it got better and it did about 3/4 way through, the lectures mostly stopped.  I don't do real spoilers ever on plot or story but if you don't want to know anything about the end then don't read the following spoiler although it is more my general feeling on the writing. [spoiler] I did feel the writer wanted you to feel some sympathy towards the bad person at end for you to get the point, I did get the impression that the writer was that extreme or had sympathies towards those that do. [/spoiler]\n\nIt was so close to being good and could easily have been if above points were addressed, that is what is frustrating about this game.  More storylines, better more balanced writer and editor it could have been good.  If you don't mind being lectured at, can FF the dialogue, play on mute and like harder games to work out then I think you could enjoy this (if you also are tolerant at what people come up re science in games) if not then I'd pass on this one.  Just lacked the fun/enjoyment factor for me."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506385428, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35213037", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198032729607", "num_reviews": 29, "last_played": 1489182536, "num_games_owned": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 644}, "timestamp_updated": 1506385428, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A New Beginning is one of those games that have a messege, it will have you think about its messege afte the game is finished, or you can simply ignore it and forget about the whole deal.
