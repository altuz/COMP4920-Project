The more of a color you remove, the bigger the combo. This review is from a disabled gamer (I only play with a mouse).\n\nhttp://youtu.be/a6Kdsyvsaks\n\nLoading the game, you can easily access options and change the game to Windowed Mode.  Windowed Mode is borderless so you can change windows without exiting the game.  There's multiple resolutions you can set the window too.  It also has Colorblind Mode which adds a symbol in addiction to the blocks color.  Another option I was impressed with was the Mouse Button option that let's you swap each buttons role.  There's also a single option for the mouse but it seemed to be picky on exactly where I cllicked which slowed me down.  I opt'd to keep using  the reversed option.\n\nActual game modes include Classic, Survival, Meditation and Rush.  While most modes do require you to work within various time tables, Meditation is a completely untimed relaxing strategic gameplay.  To play the game, rotate the mass with your left mouse button and place blocks with your right mouse button. Many games actually didn't require much rotation so I completed many levels using only 1 mouse button.\n\nIf you're a mouse user who can left & right click gameplay should be a breeze!  Colorblind gamers should also be fine with colorblind option enabled.  It's actually my favorite way to play."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1421265016, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547482", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "13986273", "votes_up": 30, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198058687420", "num_reviews": 77, "last_played": 1421267840, "num_games_owned": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 83}, "timestamp_updated": 1421265016, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I hate bashing on Ozzie companies. ;p And this isn't an evil, unplayable game. My first impression was good, I played it for a bit, expected to play more, had it installed forever, yet every time I fire it up, I close it after 5 minutes.\n\nIt's a match 3 game with some 3D tetris elements. The concept is good. The graphics are polished. The music isn't bad. The controls feel annoying at first, but they're actually mostly okay. The problem is, the gameplay doesn't feel satisfying. It expects (and rewards, scorewise) big combos and long term strategy. It also expects you to be fast and responsive. This should theoretically work, in that zen-like way games like this work, but it doesn't. The rythym and pacing feels all off, it feels like the speed jumps from 1,2,3,4,5 to 50 to 150. Once you get into the zone and start planning ahead for later big score combos, it feels like you blink and the game jumps speed, asking you to go for quick, \"just don't make a mistake\" placement. That may be totally subjective of course, or it could be that the feeling gets exacerbated by the clunky cube placement process. It simply isn't visually always obvious or easy to correctly target the location you want on a constantly rotating cube, which really hurts the game when it picks up speed. People misplace blocks on tetris too, but usually feel it's their fault, here it feels like the cube jumps place three times before you can be sure it's where it should be. By which time the game has jumped two speed gears and you're basically done with.\n\nAgain, not a bad game, in theory. I just never feel like playing it long, because it doesn't feel very enjoyable. The thumbs down is just trying to balance a \"very positively\" reviewed game, with an 80 something metacritic score that few people seem to actually play much (notice the curiously short play times of the majority of the positive reviewers?). So I'd suggest to approach with caution, and at least play the demo first."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1383365241, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523850", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "7545356", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197967048538", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1420568944, "num_games_owned": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 184}, "timestamp_updated": 1385414337, "received_for_free": false, "review": "They weren't kidding when they wrote up the description for this little gem.

This is impossible through legitimate play as the current Rank 1 players are clearly hackers, so there is no way for anyone to claim those achievments legitimately. If they had weekly or daily leaderboards it would make much more sense.
