This is a real-time strategy with two parts. The first is the campaign, which is pretty unremarkable. Second is where the game really shines - skirmishes. The big draw here is that you level up between games, which lets you unlock new and more powerful bonuses, which you can activate by doing things such as creating units or controlling train routes.\n\nOne huge plus for this game is that the countries play very, very differently. In the first two Age of Empires games, the civilizations were basically the same plus or minus a technology and one unit. Here, the difference is huge. Russians create units in \"batches\", the Dutch rely on gold instead of food and can build banks to create a flow of passive income. Those are just some examples - each civilization plays very differently and all of them are interesting. Except for Spain, but you can't win 'em all.
