When I did finally get it on Steam, I purchased two copies: one for myself, and one for my wife. We played together, helping each other collect health and mana upgrades, equipment upgrades, and collecting the NPCs. She fought off slimes and zombies while I established gardens for mushrooms, trees, and plants for potion ingredients. We mined, we explored dungeons and caves, we fought bosses and discovered how to navigate Hell.\n\nIt's been an amazing time, and this game has been well worth the amount of money I've spent on it. I've gotten more hours of enjoyment out of it, both alone and with my wife, than I have with nearly every $60 AAA game. The music, the graphics, the controls, and the amount of stuff available to do just make it an easy recommendation for me."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504812335, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591402", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "34800980", "votes_up": 76, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157405510", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1507060069, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2126, "playtime_forever": 318599}, "timestamp_updated": 1504812335, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One of the best games ever far a very good price\n(Plus it gets better when you install mods!)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505355930, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551691", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "34940837", "votes_up": 40, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047619185", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506456752, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_forever": 14536}, "timestamp_updated": 1505356472, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Probably the only thing I could legitimately play forever."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505539463, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531871", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "34988222", "votes_up": 32, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050040597", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1505540122, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 43576}, "timestamp_updated": 1505539463, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Get this game if you want to have fun"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506071704, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537354", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "35123631", "votes_up": 26, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159500102", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1503768847, "num_games_owned": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 77945}, "timestamp_updated": 1506071704, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Worth all 1,299 hours"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505591928, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521831", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 13, "recommendationid": "35005856", "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290338469", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506283892, "num_games_owned": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "playtime_forever": 4390}, "timestamp_updated": 1505591928, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Dangit!

I was looking through new streamers on Twitch and discovered someone playing it and just took a look... and got hooked. I was never into Minecraft or anything like this, but the \"retro\" flair of the game caught me by surprise. And so I gave it a try... and am totally into this game since 2 weeks now, even set up my own server for people to join while I am streaming :) If you first start the game you can be overwhelmed really easily as there is so much to learn. The learning curve is pretty steep. It is best to just start running around, digging through stuff and get a feeling for the world. But then you should definitely look for the Terraria Wiki to read the first Walkthrough and understand the first things you need to get going in this game: Housing and Crafting. Once you get the hang of it, it is actually pretty straightforward. There is just a lot to do.\n\nThe game gives you the option to start worlds either small, medium or large in size, and to define the difficulty as normal or expert mode. Within the world you are playing you can than even unlock the so called \"Hardmode\" - this happens after defeaing several easier bosses, and unlocks even more, harder bossfights and better loot in your world. I recommend you start up with a small world set to normal to not get frustrated. If you set your world to expert, the mobs have higher lifepools and hit harder - but you get better loot from them.\n\nIf you settled in you can basically start building whatever you like with the materials you gather. You can craft all sorts of bricks, walls, tiles, workstations, furniture, weapons, armor etc... from the ressources you collect. And whatever you can imagine, most surley you can build it! A castle in the clouds? No problem! A palace made out of ice? Sure thing! Dig deep down to the depths of hell to set up a demonic empire?
