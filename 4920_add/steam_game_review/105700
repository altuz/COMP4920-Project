Well, Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a Side-Scrolling... Er, Up-n'-Down-Scrolling(?) platformer where the idea is to get from the top of a cave to the bottom and then make your escape back to the entrance, all while collecting gems and animals as you descend/ascend. It offers two different playable characters for singleplayer and multiplayer story modes across four different worlds, each with four levels. So lets get started shall we?\n\n\nFirst of all I'd like to mention the presentation. The majority of the game is represented in the form of sprites, with some art slides that are used as cutscenes and such. The style of the art is nice; it's a simplistic style where everything is gratuitously round for some reason or another. I'm being told it's cute, but something about the hips of both characters being twice the size of their heads puts me off... Anyway, it works, but it's nothing I can say is spectacular. The in-game sprites also look okay and have decent animation to them, but I noticed that a fair few of them were blurry or lacked sharpness, specifically the character sprites. Overall, it's a quaint artstyle, but it's nothing to write home about.\n\n\nAudio is also just okay. Not a lot of music to listen to; There's the menu music, one track for each world, and then some cutscene music. Once again, none of it is /really/ good, just kinda okay. I suppose I liked the 1st and 3rd world's music the best, seeing as I remember them the most, but it's still all... Whatever y'know? Sound effects as well, which really wouldn't even be noted in this review if it wasn't for the fact that many sound effects occuring at the same time will cause the sound to increase in volume exponentially. Collecting gems becomes a little less fun when you start hearing \"ding, Ding, DING, DDDIIIINNNGGG\" as you pick them up in groups.\n\n\nPut hey, as long as the gameplay if fun, right?... Er, well, it's okay. That's the word of the day folks. As previously mentioned, you start at the top of the level and must make your way down to a chest at the bottom. You'll encounter stage-specific traps and collect power-ups such as balloons and ropes... Which is to say those are the only items you collect. Balloons allow you to float down for a short period of time and ropes can be thrown to the ceiling where they'll hang down and you can climb them. In all honesty though, I never really /needed/ these items. Aside from using balloons to break my fall simply so I could go down a vertical shaft a little more quickly for my own convenience, everything can be done almost, if not just as easily without these items. They /can/ occasionally be used to make speedruns easier, but speedrunning, while encouraged, is not the main focus of the game.\n\n\nThe worlds don't have a whole lot of diference in them either. The first one is just a cave; there are some enemies that walk back and forth, nothing really special. The second world is an ice world that introduces horizontally positioned ropes, and has invisible blocks as one of it's level gimmicks. There's also a trap that's, like, an impossible-to-see fake wall that'll drop on you from the background, but it only appears twice and it's where you'll be running so fast that you'll pass them without a second thought. Third world is the lava world, so there's lava and stuff. This world has these bubbles that'll pop and bounce you up when you land on them, which make the platforming a little more interesting. Thing is, these bubbles reform waaayy too fast, so you'll encounter vertical shafts with unavoidable bubbles in them so that you can quickly ascend, but on the way down will only bounce you up and reform before you fall beyond them. Lastly there's the pyramid island. There's some shooty traps, there are some annoying spike traps, and some crushers. Nothing entirely notable really.\n\n\nWhat IS kinda cool about this game is the escape bit of the levels. Once you get to the bottom, you have to unlock a chest which causes the cave to crumble while you make your escape. You have a limited amount of time, which can be extended by 10 or 15 seconds depending on how well you do on the chest unlocking QTE. At this point in time, the level changes, destroying certain walls and platforms to allow for certain shortcuts and various hazards. It can also make getting the collectibles easier, but you also have a time limit, so you kinda have a risk/reward thing goin' on there. You can even see what blocks will be destroyed when the cave crumbles, so you can semi-plan your escape route on your way down!\n\n\nFinally, lets talk about the characters. There's not a whole lot to say about them; both can grab ledges, wall-jump, and roll. Tobe, the yellow one, is faster and can do a short wall-run. The controls for the wall-run are fairly clunky and imprecise though, so I'd always screw it up at vital points in time. Nana, the pink one, on the other hand is slower, has less health, but has a double jump. This double jump allows her to make ascend quickly, break a long fall, take short cuts, and basically wall-climb. She is by far the easier character of the two, as reflected by the stricter speedrun times in the achievement sections. The game was short enough as it is, but even after clearing the game 100%, Nana got me through it in a little under a half hour. \n\n\nAnd that's kinda the whole problem with the game. It's pretty short, and what little there is of it has a lack of substance. Playing through the game as both characters was probably an hour's work, and that's with doing the previously mentioned 100% completion. And that's not even mentioning the various glitches I've come across, including but not limited to being clipped inside of a wall consistantly after being hit on a particular level, or stuttering scrolling during co-op play. Match that with head-scratching desgin choices like unnoticable but sparsley placed wall traps, or quickly respawning bubbles, and this game is a short, unpolished, substance-lacking \"meh\" of a game.\n\n\nThe one place where this game shines to it's fullest though is it's co-op, which is still flawed in a way thanks to the lack of duo-controller support and the fact that it's local-only. Still, in co-op, there are some extra moves you can pull off such as head bouncing or pulling the other player up a ledge, which made for some interesting multiplayer-specific shortcuts. Two players also collect gems and animals more quickly and efficiently, making the experience a touch more streamlined.  Good luck finding someone who'll play it with you though, even if it would only be a half-hour.\n\n\nBut hey, that's all just my opinion. Cross reference mine with others and determine if this is a game for you. Though personally, there's juuuust enough wrong with the game to lean it towards the negative side of meh, and I really wouldn't pick it up unless it was on sale or something."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1392287681, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506828", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9080034", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198039869303", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1465342139, "num_games_owned": 423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 109}, "timestamp_updated": 1392287681, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is a very short and sweet platformer with an emphasis on collecting all the little critters while running through each map in as little time as possible.

However, Nana can double jump, which beaks the game (you can get almost anywhere). You're given ropes to get up to places more easily and balloons to make longer jumps, but I found myself rarely using them. Animals and treasure chests are placed throughout the level to collect and some are put in tricky places (as Tobe, at least).

The game has a few technical shortcomings that, at least for me, hamper my enjoyment.\n\nThe Good:\n[list]\n[*] The game's art style is retro. Nice SNES would probably describe it pretty well.\n[*] The game has nice music. It's not mind-blowing but it fits the games visual theme and genre.\n[*] The gameplay extends beyond simple adventure platforming through the use of consumable tools/items (like ceiling ropes, balloons, etc.)\n[/list]\n\nThe Bad:\n[list]\n[*] The controls. A platformer lives and dies with its controls, and moving around in the world is painful. Taking turning around whil running for instance, it's a seemingly-forever animation that heavily penalizes for running in anything but a straight line in the game. Precision jumping feels a bit trickier than need be, but maybe that's just me.\n[*] The frame rate. It suffers from an XNA bug (thanks Microsoft!) that locks the game at a lower framerate than what it's supposed to run at. Rather than just looking choppy, this framerate affects the controls as well so the game feels sluggish. See the forums for a post about this where someone links to articles written by other devs who've had to fix the bug in their games.\n[*] Limited video settings including no resolution adjustment. This isn't a horrible aspect since the game has a decidedly retro look anyhow, but I couldn't find much in the way of graphical settings of any kind. Given that it's made with XNA, my guess is this was because it was intended to (or did?) live on a Microsoft console at some point.\n[/list]\n\nI suspect if the developer ever came back to this game to give it some love, this could be a really fun game. However, its technical shortcomings right now leave it in a state that are mildly frustrating and certainly not worth anyone's time given the quantity and quality of other platformers on the PC."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1323393898, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476690", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "1676795", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197996291285", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1340262000, "num_games_owned": 3355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 140}, "timestamp_updated": 1323393898, "received_for_free": false, "review": "\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\n\u30ed\u30fc\u30ab\u30ebCo-op\u3067\u3072\u3068\u901a\u308a\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3057\u305f\u304c\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u5c11\u306a\u3081\u3002\n\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u30d0\u30b0\u304c\u307e\u3060\u76ee\u7acb\u3061\u307e\u3059\u304c\u305d\u308c\u306a\u308a\u306b\u306f\u904a\u3079\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1414256105, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498866", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "12628024", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198017436910", "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1488030949, "num_games_owned": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 73}, "timestamp_updated": 1414256105, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Light fun with tight controls, good music and enjoyable art reminiscent of NES platformers with a little added panache."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1311370150, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483473", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "811422", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979084213", "num_reviews": 921, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 3516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 51}, "timestamp_updated": 1402265199, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I really, really want to like this game, but I just can't.

Go buy that game, and screw this one.\n\n2/5"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1313098930, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "5130397", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198045398367", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1416996297, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1}, "timestamp_updated": 1406462410, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The design is cute, and the game seems like it'd be fun, but it is crippled by the fact that the control scheme was clearly made in mind for people with a superflous third arm- and by proxy, a third hand."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1343171203, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498194", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "4048575", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198031294895", "num_reviews": 200, "last_played": 1342854000, "num_games_owned": 1216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 17}, "timestamp_updated": 1463534038, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Tobe is a kool dood on a quest to find the Diarrhea Farm, its called vertical cause ur peepee becomes vertical if u plae"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1417482365, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13190111", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198021534686", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1417482162, "num_games_owned": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 128}, "timestamp_updated": 1417482365, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's a fun little game, but there's a lot of little things that will make you rage. \nThe game is short.
