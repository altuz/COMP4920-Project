While undoubtedly a video game, there isn't all that much to it. It's mostly an abstract, physics-based platformer, where you jump around using momentum to collect objects. You can swing around, you can jump, you can fast fall and you have some control over your aerial momentum. The goal is to spread pollen to activate plant seeds, which in turn become platforms for you to launch yourself from to collect Spectra - the major collectible (think Stars or Jiggies, although this is not the same kind of game). Each time you collect one it boots you out and you must reenter the garden. Every few Spectra you open a new garden, which must be 'stabilised' by collecting at least one Spectra. Playing with mouse, the game is responsive and pleasing to move around in, once you get used to the particular nuances of the physics.\n\nWhile visually pretty and aurally pleasing, with use of simple shapes, flat contrasting colours and a casual chill electronica soundtrack, the game doesn't really amount to much, in my opinion. Good much in the same way a game like Flower is, in that it would be a good game to relax or unwind with, spend some quiet time lost in this little world, but not something I would sit down to actively play, enjoy, and experience.\n\nIf it's the kind of game you're into, a casual, relaxing experience to lose a few hours in every now and again, then you'll definitely enjoy it - maybe pick it up on sale. If you want something more exciting or something to really sink your teeth it, I would suggest looking elsewhere.\nUltimately, I believe it sets out with a specific goal and achieves that goal quite well."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1496436468, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470776", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32137723", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197983328338", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1496436378, "num_games_owned": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 42}, "timestamp_updated": 1496436468, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Playstation version was multiplayer :'( this is a shallow shell of a port without the coop"}]}
