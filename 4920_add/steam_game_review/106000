As the game progresses the enemies acquire armor and can deflect your attacks so you may be whacking them a lot longer than you'd want to unless you freely use the curse power.\n\n- Someone mentioned annoying QTEs, which I'll admit are a little obtrusive but not as bad as they claim. They do not appear during combat unless you are stunned or fighting against a couple bosses, and during regular play most of them as partner actions (like opening a door or boosting onto a ledge) and are not timed.\n\n[b]FLAWS[/b]\n\n- Biggest is the checkpoint system, sometimes they're right where you expect them to be after each section, other times you have to restart the whole level after progressing so far and dying. Especially bad in later levels when you get surrounded by multiple enemies that can deflect your attacks and stun you and you just can't block/counter fast enough (there is no dodge move)\n\n- SPOILER (maybe) [spoiler]game ends abruptly without a solid conclusion, and it's unlikely a sequel will come[/spoiler]\n\n- Game crashed a couple of times but other than that I didn't find any noticeable bugs/glitches\n\n\nOverall it was enjoyable with co-op, but I don't think it would be worthwhile going solo.

The two characters go through what can only be called a Mideival Buddy Cop Movie-like story, with the two working together as if they'd been \"on the force\" for years and it's just another day on the job.\n\nThe combat's rather well done; fluid and easily manuverable, and it has some rather neat combos that are centered in (mostly) reality, and while your character can wield any weapon in the game, they're not experienced in every weapon, and so you can actually train (to a degree) just how well your character can use weapons, and which you prefer. Because of this, however, you can also nick the weapons off of your slain enemies or even from walls where they're set in armories. Which is necessary, because all of your weapons, armor and shields can (and will) break due to wear and tear. \n\nThe game can be a bit weird at time with camera angles and some wonky movements when the camera shifts suddenly, but overall the game is a fun, enjoyable mideival party. And while it's obviously meant for, and would be fun with, two players, the single player alone works just fine, and is built in such a way that a co-op partner can hop in whenever. Thankfully, the AI that controls your co-op partner is intelligent and dependable."}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1414955266, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503039", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "12749967", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197989296829", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1414952111, "num_games_owned": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 681}, "timestamp_updated": 1414955266, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Finished the game. Had some fun while was at it. I used keyboard and mouse, so my opinion can be biased.\n\nI will suggest you try this game when it's on sell. It has nice graphics and exciting fighting mechenics. It's main selling point is in the fighting. It falls short in replayability due to its linear story progession. Unlock weapon combos is nice, but once you finish the game you might not have the motivation to start again. Story lacks some depth, and enemy design is quite generic. But you will enjoy the fights while you are in the moment especially when facing against multiple enemies. I give it a score of 7/10, its not a game that will keep you up late into the night.\n\nFollowing is the detailed breakdown of my gameplay experience:\nGraphics:\nOverall the game is greatly optimized, there are no lags even when hoards of enemies are on screen. Graphic quality is not bad, not much to complain about. Environment texture could use a bit more work, some came out pixelated, character models are done decently though, they have great details. Lighting is beautiful. \n\nAnimation:\nAnimations have varying quality. Combat animations are nice, especially when you perform your combos correctly and end with a finishing move. But cut scene animations have funny bobbing movements to every act. They probably motion captured but didn't smooth out the keyframes. There is absolutely no facial expressions (or just one). Mouths move in good sync, but you can't see any emotions whatsoever.\n\nCamera:\nCamera system is a mess. Free chase cam is totally insensitive, you want to change angle but it just doesn't do it fast enough, especially when you are fighting multiple enemies at the same time. Some areas will automatically switch to a fixed camera or a far away camera, they were also placed at the worst positions possible. Some even are behind trees that block your view you can't see a thing (they should have make obstructions transparent). Some far away cams are so far away that you can't really see what is going on.\n\nCombat system:\nWay too many combos. You can't possibly remember them all, and you cannot check the combo list mid game so you end up not able to practice them unless you write them all down on piece of paper. Best way is to just unlock the longest  combo streak for each weapon type then just mash your buttons away. Battle mechanics not bad, counter and dodge moves keep your fingers busy and game pace relatively exciting. \n\nRanged weapon:\nHorrible aiming controls. The crosshair will move a chunk of space at a time, if you are good at counter-strike kinda game, you might break your mouse in frustration. Appearantly there is a auto-function when you hold shift while aiming, but i only discovered 2 chapters before the final mission. The \"duck and shoot\" part of the game feels like a Mario Party mini-game. I guess it's added to give the game some variaty, but i rather hoped ranged combat was not included in the game at all..\n\nCurse:\nHonestly, entering curse mode just gives you a slight advantage over enemies (faster attack speed and fire spells). It feels like a gimmik to make the graphics cool, but the implementation gives  no variability to gameplay. It doesn't give any complementing elements to the story either. Sometimes it bugs out too, and leaves objects on fire when you exit the curse mode lol.."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1399667301, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500212", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "10064863", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198039812292", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1399667114, "num_games_owned": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1474}, "timestamp_updated": 1399668154, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Nice hack&slash game.

You don\u2019t want to play it. Believe me. It\u2019s so badly designed on so many levels. It doesn\u2019t even have a proper end. Yet, when you play, it is oddly compelling -- just to see whether you can beat it, or it\u2019s going beat you. Still, don\u2019t. Just don\u2019t. For your sanity\u2019s sake.\n\nBut one thing at a time\u2026 \u2018The Cursed Crusade\u2019 is a hack-and-slasher set during the time of, you guessed it, the Crusades. Which one(s) exactly isn\u2019t exactly established. Or rather, if it is, the game\u2019s throwing everything and anything related to the Crusades into a mixer, anyway. Jumps in time and locales make following the game\u2019s time-line pretty hard to impossible. The story is about Denz, son of and himself a Templar, who is trying to break a family curse. Although, it\u2019s more of an \u201ceveryone\u2019s cursed, anyway, not just this particular family\u201d deal. He\u2019s hired to fight in the Crusades where he befriends Esteban, and hence the hacking and slashing can commence.\n\nGameplay-wise, it\u2019s basic hack-and-slashing with forced Bro-op sequences, a buttload of QTEs, and crossbow shooting for good measure. The titular Curse offers little to enhance the experience, except maybe even more QTEs.\nEnemies level up with you, meaning you have to flail at them several times in always the same way. It gets annoying instead of challenging rather fast. The levels are oftentimes irritatingly designed, very much not helped by forced camera angles. There\u2019s even one level that is entirely played like a 2D brawler, for some reason. I could see this working as some kind of reference to The Olden Days\u2122, but, really, the game is trying to take itself too serious. Incidentally, it\u2019s failing at that, too, with stonily delivered references to the likes of Frank Miller\u2019s/Zack Snyder\u2019s \u2018300\u2019.\n\nTo top all this off, there\u2019s exactly one female character in this game. Which, to be fair, could be justified with \u201cIt\u2019s medieval war, for chrissake! There were no women\u201d. Yet, when said female character is introduced -- she doesn\u2019t even have a speaking role, but is mute instead.\n\nIf all this doesn\u2019t throw you off already and you still want to play it because you want to hunt for achievements, be warned that the fighting system\u2019s flaws make it a chore and ordeal to beat the game in Nightmare mode [the hardest difficulty].\n\nThere\u2019s one really good thing, though: The levelling system. Pieces upon pieces are added to your armour when levelling up, and hundreds of different -- and rather brutal -- moves can be unlocked for the myriad of weapons/combinations. There is something compelling hidden under all the other bad decisions, which is sadly not brought to its full potential."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1375677172, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500617", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "6174358", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198060580684", "num_reviews": 83, "last_played": 1497465127, "num_games_owned": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3895}, "timestamp_updated": 1407338814, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you like hack & slash games, this is your game.
