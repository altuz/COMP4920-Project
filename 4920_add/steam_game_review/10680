The gameplay lets you play through out story in the same maps witch gets a little repetative from time to time. But still having a very enjoyable adventure getting from point A to point B in the story. the story itselfe Is pritty simple, The Weyland Yutani industrie wants to uncover the secrets about the Xenomorphs and Predators acient history about who they are as an extraterrestrial species and what can they do to turn a majority of them into a weapon against their own kind to cause more conlfict that everyone is already in.  \n\nYou play as the Chosen one Alien, Predator, and  Weyland Yutani Marine to find out how to stop every one from killing eachother or from losing less lives and leaving the Xenomorph home world, so that the Weyland Yutani industrie doesn't have to make a new world for humanity to populate because theres an alien species already evolving on it, waiting to hunt you down because of their species cultrual reasons for why you don't deserve live once you set foot on their home world. **COUGH!**... Anyways enough Plot of the games story, time for the game gamplay itsselfe.\n\nAs the Marine, you'll experience a claustrophobic and terrifying experience where light is your friend, but there's never enough. However, the United States Marine Corps are humanity's last line of defense, and as such they are armed to the teeth with the very latest in high explosive and automatic weaponry.  As the Predator, you will stalk from the shadows and from above, passing athletically through the treetops to ambush your victims. Although equipped with an array of powerful, exotic weapons and tracking equipment, honor ultimately dictates that you must get in close and take your trophies face to face. As the Alien aka Xenomorph you are the most deadly species in the universe, the Alien offers you the chance to play as the very stuff of nightmares - the monster in the dark swarming forward with countless others, jaws like a steel trap and claws like blades, and the ablity to climb on walls like they usually do like in the movies they are featured in.  \n\nOther than that this is a 9 out of 10 star game, I highly recommend to play this game no matter if you are a current Alien vs Predator fan or a new commer to the Alien vs Predator franchise."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504824751, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511104", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34804063", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197990939508", "num_reviews": 119, "last_played": 1504730335, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 430}, "timestamp_updated": 1504824751, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I liked this game and Bethesda should use what they use for Wolfenstein and make a new game based on Alien vs Predator.\nThe graphics are old and the AI isn't great and the game is very short so only buy on sale.\n\nBut it is fun you play as a Marine and use weapons.\nYou play as a Predator which I love with it's own weapons and such.\nAnd you play as an Alien it's great.\n\nSo yeah buy onsale and they should do this game in beautiful graphics and animations."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505215925, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505315", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34899221", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198052754386", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1506685966, "num_games_owned": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 642, "playtime_forever": 1454}, "timestamp_updated": 1505215925, "received_for_free": false, "review": "this game is not a survivor horror like Alien:Isolation but it is a great action game. to sum it up, you can play as an alien, a marine or a predator with unique campaing missions for each one, aliens and predator models look fantastic, it has a satisfying melee combat system, blood and gore is realistic, boss fights are fun and difficulty settings feel properly balanced. if you are a fan of this franchise i can assure you that you are going to play  a fantastic action game, just don't expect it to be like Alien Isolation."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504988165, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34845848", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198029779075", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1504988094, "num_games_owned": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 551}, "timestamp_updated": 1504988165, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Reminds me of the first AVP that Rebellion made back in 1999. \n\nEnjoyed all campaigns."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505546789, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34990026", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011086924", "num_reviews": 53, "last_played": 1456603694, "num_games_owned": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 287}, "timestamp_updated": 1505546789, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you are a fan of any of these movies then this is a must play.

You want to be sneaky and stick to shadows and avoid flashlights, but you can super leap and get some of the most powerful weapons in the game, like some of you might remember that stupid spear that came out of no-where.
