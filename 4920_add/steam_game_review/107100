A lot has been said about this game, but let's cover the basics. Released in 2011; it was awarded with over a hundred awards; including \"Best Debut Game.\" Does it deserve those awards?\n\nGraphics\n     This game excels at three things, and this is one of them. The world is beautiful, even in it's collapsed state. Every frame flows well, and there are bright, vibrant colors that only watercolor games can bring. A few things are proportioned oddly, like the main character looks like someone that skipped leg day most of the time, aside from during cinematics; where everyone has a large head. That said, those little things add charm to the game, and are easily overlooked, and so I can't hold them against the game.\n\nControls\n     Perhaps the weakest part of the game. For an action RPG, it's pretty slow paced. The Kid moves slowly, and some of the weapons are also really slow. The controls also felt backwards throughout most of the first playthrough. I found myself using my ranged weapons a lot when I was intending to use my melee weapons, and this continued all the way to the final levels.\n     Disclaimer; this game is designed with controllers is mind, so it plays best with that, but it is slow enough paced that people without them that aren't used to the keyboard shouldn't have much issue. The keyboard controls are fine, though they also suffer from the same issues as the controller in regards to feeling off.\n     While your first weapon is slow, you acquire weapons of varying speed, and all are masterfully balanced, so you will find a loadout that you like, and will stick with that, saving for when you get new weapons, the game forces you to change to it, so that you can practice with it for a little while.\n     Overall, the game is simple, easy to pick up, but a little awkward on the controls.\n\nSound\n     In short: I have nothing but praise for this part of the game. It is good enough that it deserves recognition. Bastion's music is nothing short of outstanding. While there are only around half a dozen songs, they all convey the emotion of the scene well, and are not in the least distracting. They enhance the story well.\n     \nStory\n     Easily the best part of the game. Overall, it's short, only around six hours long on your first playthrough, and that's including the \"Who Knows Where\" sidequests. With that said, the brevity of the story is actually a strong point. No section feels long and drawn out, with each part of the story only as long as it needs to be.\n     I'm not going to go into detail about the story itself, but it is told through the use of a narrator, and while that normally is a problem, here, it works.\n     There are a few choices, which all matter, but they are more a moral choice, as they have no actual rewards or consequences for those choices. They are strictly about what you would do in those spots.\n     The story is easily the strongest point in an overall great game. While it doesn't stir any emotions, save for a few spots, it does a tremendous job of pulling you in and making you care about the characters and your pets.\n\nGrade\nEasy A. Bastion deserves those accolades. While not one of the best games of all time, it is a tremendous effort by a developer that hadn't created any games before this one. While there are a few shortcomings, mainly in the control side, it is one of the better games of 2011. Add in the New Game+ feature for added replay, and you have an overall excellent game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506576255, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511979", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35255193", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198019265503", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506575990, "num_games_owned": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 730, "playtime_forever": 730}, "timestamp_updated": 1506576255, "received_for_free": false, "review": "10/10 \nBeautiful\nAmazing\nSoundtrack was fantastic\nGameplay was brilliant\nIf you have the opportunity to play this game, do not let it pass by you.

It is an isometric action adventure RPG that tells the story of the Kid in the aftermath of a disaster called the Calamity.\n\nThere are three things that instantly stand out as you start a new game:\n[list]\n[*]The beautiful hand painted visuals. It is a really vibrant and colorful world.\n[*]The outstanding soulful soundtrack. Eventually you will find yourself humming to the music as you take on waves of Scumbags and Gasfellas.\n[*]And probably the selling point, the Narrator. The Narrator, in his thick and burly Southern accent, narrates more or less everything you do. Think The Stanley Parable but with a badass Narrator.\n[/list]\n\nAs mentioned above, Bastion is an RPG. The gameplay is pretty run and gun. You kill and roll your way from Point A to Point B, get what you need and fly back to your home base. You are introduced to several weapons throughout the game, which are upgradeable. You can acquire various passive buffs and you can buff up the enemies for extra XP. The game gets increasingly fun as you unlock more things. Levelling up can take a while though.\n\nBastion has a decent story with extremely well written dialogue. The story is short (3-4 hours) and tight and does not overstay its welcome. It feels like it ends exactly when it needs to. There's also New Game+ and Score Attack mode.

It looked so good: colorful environment, interesting concept of the world building itself as you explored it, lots of potential customization in weapon choice and which drinks/gods to invoke, and a storyline which is told via real time narration.\n\nThe problem is that the game's combat is repetative and difficult. It is very hard to avoid getting damaged by enemies while fighting; they come in big crowds that will quickly surround you. You can roll out of the way or use a shield to block attacks but it's never enough. Firing a ranged weapon requires standing still. The only way to really play this is to rush into battle while constantly drinking health potions. It rarely matters what kinds of weapons you use; you can basically upgrade any weapon to do whatever you want it to do. The optional modifiers from drinks or idols only add marginal benefits that aren't really noticable unless you start stacking them, and even then it doesn't really change the fact that battles are long slogs that require numerous health potions.\n\nI have tried three times to play this game. Each time I promised myself that I'd see it through to the end. Each time I had to quit because I got so incredibly bored of playing the same, \"hack through a mob of badguys\" gameplay that every level had. The game's storyline was too vague to really engage me. I was offered a whole host of customizations but in the end none of it really mattered. As much as I hate to say it, I can't recommend Bastion."}]}
