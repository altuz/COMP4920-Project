The graphics, the lore, the way you can customize your ship. I'm pretty lazy also, i don't like steep learning curves, and here its so easy, everything is self explaining and i found myself now several times thinking: wow, good luck that i found this one.\nThere are 5 sizes of ships and every size has around 10 types of ships you can built but first you have to kill the shiptype to drop a part for reverse engineering..if you have all parts, you can build it.\nPlans for weapon and armor you buy in space stations, which is fun also. \nIf you like space games and if you are ok that some dexterity is needed(not much, but enough to have fun) and if you like the way you have to handle your ship(check vids in youtube where they fight, so you can imagine) then just get it. It's worth much more money.\nEnjoy !"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504255222, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34654620", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197977879276", "num_reviews": 42, "last_played": 1504251153, "num_games_owned": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5792}, "timestamp_updated": 1504255222, "received_for_free": false, "review": "SPAZ: the final frontier.

In a tough fight you need to fly well and use superior tactics to win, switching ships and giving orders to the others.  The exact manner will depend on your particular combination of ships, modules, and research, which can all be changed as needed (small penalty to respec research).\n\nThe only downside is that it's a bit of a grind at times.
