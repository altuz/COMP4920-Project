There are no glitches, there is a maximum number  of fights for each area, you can save everywhere and the fighting mechanics are rpg maker standard (in a good way). But well ... after this there isnt much. The story is genre standard and almost non-existent, your team is a faceless group you randomly meet in the world and the interaction with the enviroment is the bare minimum. \n\nWhat we have left here is a rpg maker wise game with no story, no good enviroment or setting and a fairly good fighting mechanic. The only rly good thing in this game is the hommage to a lot of rpg stereotypes and tropes."}]}
