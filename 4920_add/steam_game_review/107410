This game hypes me since the first day, but yeah it has a lot of bugs at the beginning. Now after 4 years its one of my most played games in Steam with over two thousand hours of gameplay. So why you should you buy Arma 3 we begin with Arma 2 was before, it gots a lot of good mods at the end. So Arma 3 started 2013 and with his annnouncement, it was clear to me that this mods most ported over in Arma 3. So it thought it would be nice too have one or two of them, but after 3 years was the Modding Community in Arma 3 so big that i quite must honoured this people, its one of the biggest, best and various Sandbox Games I ever played. With the biggest Mod-Community ever and this people doing all a good job in this 4 years that Arma 3 coud be what its now better than every other game in this sector on the Market. Arma 3 give every player the opportunity to play any faction on this planet or any other things like Star Wars and so on. I hope i could help you people with this big Review.\n\nThank You\nFredpe"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505095281, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505825", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "34874889", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198024549500", "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1506228470, "num_games_owned": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 638, "playtime_forever": 3070}, "timestamp_updated": 1505095281, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Revolver \"Revolver Ocelot\" Ocelot melted my glasses so I can't see so good anymore but I still have fun with the administrative work that comes with army work."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504646360, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500454", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34764795", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198114264960", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1505839713, "num_games_owned": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5832}, "timestamp_updated": 1504646360, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Amazing game took me awhile to learn the controlls.

This game is fantastic. After a crappy day, hop on Arma and shoot some people, after a fantastic day? Hop on Arma and shoot some people. This game is absolutely fantastic. In fact, after writing this review I am about to play Arma 3. I have tried all the games that are competition to this game, Squad, Battlefield 1 & 4, and a few others that you may know that on paper are very competitive, but this game wins by miles, if you are deciding between any other game and this game, BUY THIS. The only downside I would have to say is that it doesn't run perticularly well. It really doesn't matter your Graphics Card. Your processor does the heavy lifting, I have a i5 6500, which runs it very well, Ultra settings at 1080p holds me at 40-60 FPS fine, those framerates were taken from my game that runs currently with 114 Mods on it. Well over 20 Gigabytes of mods. Without them you could probably see 15 to 20 more FPS. I have bought every DLC, and invested many many hours into this game, and I probably have seen roughly 40% of what this game has to offer, thats even before Multiplayer, from the EDEN editor, to the Scenarios, to the super easy Steam Workshop downloading of user created missions. This game hooks you.\n\nOne feature that is absolutely stellar in this game is Freelook, where you can hold ALT and move your head Freely from your charachters direction of movement. That means if your gun is pointing straight ahead, you can move your head around and look about 140 Degrees to your left and right. This doesn't sound like a big deal but trust me, after getting used to using Freelook, it nearly ruins other games for you, I have been playing more squad recently, and I find myself constantly pressing ALT only to realize that it lacks Freelook, It feels like other games have a Handicap which is the lack of Freelook.\n\nI know your scrolling through reviews thinking \"Man this game looks awesome but its 54.99!\" I was like that too, but I bought it and I havent looked back. So you, debating this purchase. Nothing else you will buy, wether it be a New Wristwatch, or lunch for a few weeks, NOTHING else you will buy will be this fun. BUY THIS GAME. YOU WILL LOVE IT."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505588498, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499623", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35004658", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198354891192", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505520649, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 18}, "timestamp_updated": 1505588498, "received_for_free": false, "review": "-Very realistic first person soldier game. \n-The mechanic are littlebit complicated.\n\n9.7/10"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504907725, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34823913", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198148000321", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506522282, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "playtime_forever": 195393}, "timestamp_updated": 1504907725, "received_for_free": false, "review": " Arma 3 is the best military simulator !\n\n Actually looks like real life warfare and you feel like you are on the battlefield !\n\n 10/10\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504904380, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494118", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34823036", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198016094945", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1503156523, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6579}, "timestamp_updated": 1504904380, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[list]\n[*]Logged into Invade and Annex game\n[*]Spent half an hour figuring out what gear I should use\n[*]Spent another half an hour figuring out how should I actually play Invade and Annex\n[*]After some standing around I got promoted to squad lead simply because I had a microphone and didnt run away\n[*]Killed my entire squad about 3km from the main AO.\n[/list] \n\nLove every aspect of this beautifly crafted buggy masterpice. \n\nRecommended by 11/12 dead squad members (1 survived)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504935041, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503001", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34829653", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198140415464", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506819641, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4702, "playtime_forever": 115072}, "timestamp_updated": 1504935041, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game.
