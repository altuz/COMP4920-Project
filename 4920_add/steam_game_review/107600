From the crisp clean retro/neon looks to the clutch gameplay, I'll always fit in a game or to of Waves if I find myself with nothing else to do.\n\nThe soundtrack is very neat and I actually purchased it not long after the game itself....\n\n...however, it's been starting to get on my nerves as of late. There's nothing wrong with the music - it suits the game very well, it just gets a little repetitive after a while.\n\nAll around a very well made game. 9/10 from me."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501334842, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501167", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33880783", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198061596714", "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1501433261, "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 72}, "timestamp_updated": 1501335318, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Small TL;DR at bottom\n\nI played Super Hexagon before, something similar to this except its less \"dodge aim and shoot\" and more of a \"aim and dodge\" sort of game. The soundtrack in this game is more satisfying than that of S.H. and the graphics are pretty, especially if you can have them at full.\n\nThe cool parts are that you can try different game modes, crush (highest score in a finite amount of time with infinite lives), survival (finite amount of lives, infinite time) are among my favorites.\nYou can also play in ambient mode - go into sound options and turn down music volume, click ambient sound and boom; when playing the atmosphere is noticably different, more calm and relaxing rather than a hectic twin stick shooter.\n\nDo I recommend this game? If its for free, try it... If it costs money then its not worth looking at. Why? Because of the reloading time when resetting the level. I die a lot, and I want to keep my pace... the slower the reset the less I want to try again.\n\n1st time: ok, lets go again.\n2nd time: ok, lets go again.\n3rd time: ok.. lets go again.\n4th time: lets go again.\n5th time: lets go again.\n6th time: mm..\n7th time: aaaaah! \n8th time: damn, I froze..\n9th time: ...\n10th time: ok. lets go again.\n11th time: ok, go, go!\n12th time: gooo!\n13th time: :D\n14th time: ... Hexagon restart was better.\n15th time: ... mhm.\n16th time: 4 million pts, I can go higher.\n17th time: fck died early.\n18th time: mistakes were made.\n19th time: slow reset is slow.\n20th time: yeah.\n21st time: 6 million!\n22nd time: man..... \n23rd time: *now I am starting to feel held back by the amount of time it takes to restart*\n\nWhen you start to get a feel for the game then resets happen less often - I want to be around 10 million pts before I ever lose 1 life (in survival), but I make mistakes when trying out different styles.\n\nWhy does it matter at all? This is a fast paced game, I like the \"instant\" reset when it comes to games where you die a million times - a million times until you're done today.. adding a few seconds (2-3 seconds each time) becomes a huge dissatisfying factor. I want to jump right into the action after I died, because I already realized my mistake and I quickly want to reach my previous stage. Asap does not mean a small non-skippable \"cinematic scene\" where the camera moves to x0 y0 origin. Its not difficult to make the screen reset within a few milliseconds, it doesn't take any CPU - problem is that they went for aesthetics instead.. the game already looks good, a 2-3 second reset doesn't make my mind more ready, if I wanted that break I just press ESC.\n\nTL;DR\none feature of the game makes me say don't buy it - \" 1-3 second cinematic when resetting. \"\nI liked the gameplay, the mechanics. It was fun - a non aggressive game that plays with your senses.
