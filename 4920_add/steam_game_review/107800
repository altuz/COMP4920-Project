Before I say anything else I will say that if you like puzzle platformers this will be the best $0.99 you will ever spend.\n\nThis game gets a lot of things right, it's got a nice story, reasonably interesting characters and nice graphics. That's all secondary though because the most important thing in puzzle platformers is gameplay and this game gets that right too.\n\nThere are a lot of gameplay mechanics on display here. There are reduced gravity environments as well as gravity reduction as an ability, there is gravity reversal, forcefield barriers that can be manipulated to let through organics or non organics and action/reaction mechanics. Almost all of those are very well implemented, the only things I didn't like we're the action/reaction mechanics because they are too finicky and instafail areas on some levels. Overall the platforming and puzzle mechanics get a bit tick.\n\nThe game also has combat and while it isn't the best point about this game it is reasonably well implemented and adds to the experience. There are also collectibles in the game and they also add to the experience because they are normally hidden behind some puzzles."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506251341, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35177816", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198373847005", "num_reviews": 44, "last_played": 1507168345, "num_games_owned": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 323, "playtime_forever": 323}, "timestamp_updated": 1506251341, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Please Read @Recoil Games \nThis is a really good game...\nSome of the best Level Design i have seen, coming from someone who loves portal (1 and 2)\nThis has an exiting story however its nothing we havn't seen before\nthis has Great Physics\nThis has REALLY GOOD mechanics\nThere is also humorous and engaging dialouge to keep you in with the story.\n\nWould Recommend to new people to the 2D games, also would recommend the sonic games and Capsized\n9/10\n\nif there ever is a second one i would buy it and i would love to see more gadgets like a grappling hook or a portal device not like the portal games but one where you can shoot red, white blue and/or orange portal things like what we saw in this game.\nalso i liked the hidden items, im glad there was not too much things to collect.\n\nHow Could this have been beter? In my opinion i think this game would be beter if there was more game modes, not heaps but 3 or 4 more, one Deathmatch-online and vs. CPU, SpeedRun (you get the idea) (also i love the how it tells you how much time you have taken) 2 player campain (a new campain for 2 players) and last of all a level design where you can create and download campains and level's in the steam workshop.\n\nLast of all: im getting the dlc hard times now. :)\nThanks For reading!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504824395, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34803996", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197998120577", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1492556477, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 446}, "timestamp_updated": 1504824395, "received_for_free": true, "review": "This was a real suprise.
