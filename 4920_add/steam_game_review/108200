With no warning, after I purchased the game the developer dropped Linux support and updated the game. The game currently crashes when you start playing. \n\nI'm well past the point where I could ask for a refund but now it's just money wasted. This seems lazy on the part of the developer at best, and at worst dishonest. At a bare minimum they could provide a previous version of the game that worked on Linux through the Steam Beta program, so that people who bought the game in good faith could continue to play the game. This is a basic software versioning issue that competent software companies have solved in several industries (not just gaming). \n\nLinux might not make up a large portion of their sales, but who knows when they'll drop OSX or Windows 7 support? \n\nIf the publisher had any integrity they'd fix the game or offer people who purchased the game a refund if they spent most of their time on a platform that the publisher chose to break."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505639939, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526223", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35018580", "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197966678209", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1505855280, "num_games_owned": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1786}, "timestamp_updated": 1505639939, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Described as \"True cross-platform: players can challenge on other platforms including Steam PC and Mac, Linux, Android, iPhone and iPad\".\n\nEmphasis on \"including Steam PC..
