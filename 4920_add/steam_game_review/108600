You get bitten, the game is over for you. \n[*] PZ is an unforgiving game and therefore way more enjoyable when played with friends via Online Coop. Having a group of survivors where each takes over a specific role is something that empowers each character and makes the game more enjoyable for the whole group. \n[*] Devs provide weekly reports [Thursdoids*], informing the community on what is what.\n[/list]\n\n[b]To sum it up:[/b]\n\nPZ is the realization of a unique approach to the zombie genre and an outstanding game in its own rights. Even after hundreds of hours you might find a hidden little feature or something you wouldnt expect in a game that is developed by only a handful people (like: Your character waking up in the middle of the night because he/she had a bad dream). While the Singeplayer is neat, the game is best be played in multiplayer, since there are still key features of the game missing (NPCs) this is possibly the best approach to not die of lonelyness in the world of PZ. \n\n\n[h1] What I dont like about PZ: [/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] If you look up \"development hell\" in a lexicon, you will most likely find a reference to PZ somewhere in between.\n[*] Promised key features (Non player characters, Animations) are still not implemented in the game.\n[*] There are three separate builds of the game that you can play now, each one holding different features, being at a different stage of development. A general test branch, the stable branch and a vehicle test branch.\n[*] The player base is very, very small. It is at best a few hundred players, meaning its relatively hard to find a good server when you dont play with friends in the first place.\n[*] Guns (in the vanilla game) are pretty useless and only bring hundreds of zombies to your base, which will ultimately force you to abandon it.\n[*] Some of the aforementioned professions are outright useless (Electrician, Cook, and a few others) since they either provide no meaningful unique talents or fall short compared to other professions.\n[*] Devs dont keep their own timelines, because they decide to have none at all. I would argue that this games development pace is only second to that of the DayZ Standalone. (This point has been debated on the forums to some extend recently, so take this with a grain of salt)\n[*] Internal work orders and priorities are clearly in disarray at TIS. Polishing the game is not one of their top priorities.\n[*] Most of the mentioned weekly reports are pretty much fluff only and provide rarely any substantial information about key features.\n[/list]\n\n[b]To sum it up:[/b]\n\nPersonally, at the moment i can not give this game a recommendation since the abysmal development time is outright unacceptable. NPCs, while they were already in the game (in a rudimentary fashion) have been in development for several years now and for the past 2 or 3 years no one has heard a word on them. While the devs said that eventually, after implementing a new animation system, they would talk about them that has yet to happen. Animations itself have been delayed by almost two years now, after the devs generated quite a bit of hype in early 2016 with a showcase of the new animation system, making it sound as if great things were about to happen. Well, nothing happened and ever since they have pretty much gone dark about it. Every now and then a single line is dropped in their weekly reports but 80% of these reports is them telling us that they will add a formula for gas consumption for cars or a rephrase for \"we are working on something.\" If you are one of those that are waiting for information on animations (you >might< get lucky) or NPCs (you wont hear a word) - try not to get your hopes up.\n\nSome have even called this game \"Abandonware\" on the forums - which is a lie, since development still happens.  Still, personally I think that they waste their resources on gimmicks and marginal features that find their way in one of the several test branches, while already existing core elements (like professions, aiming system, etc, etc) are still far from polished. One of the most recent examples is their latest report (28.09.2017) in which they showcase their progress on the cars. Cars like ambulances now have flashing lights and even some button to change the pattern of the lights - amazing. What cars still do not have, is a functioning inventory. Full loads of items still disappear when players leave the area - [url=https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/22436-released-vehicle-tech-test-build/&do=findComment&comment=257573]a bug that I personally reported several times around four months ago on the forums[/url]. Losing full inventory loads does not seem to be much of an issue for the devs at TIS, at least not when compared to implementing a blue flashy light. If you are trying to play this game in Multiplayer, then be aware that these issues still persist and that frustration and inventory losses are still a common thing. In a lenghty discussion on the forums I was told that if you have a lacking background in game design, these decisions might be hard to grasp. I agree to some extend but nobody can tell me with a straight face that a game like this has to be in development for more than 6 years,while some of the most prominent features are still missing. In that regard I would like to warn any potential buyer that should you decide to buy this game, then do it only if you are okay with what you will currently get and dont buy it if you are hoping for NPCs or such a thing. You will get disappointed like I have.\n\nI hyped a group of friends to play this game under the impression that animations were soon to be dropped (early 2016) and out of my friends I am the only one who still plays this game at times. The others got bored or angry pretty fast and dropped this game like a hot potato. \n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\n\nGame could be awesome, but its development is an outright mess.\nBuy it only if you are ok with what the game currently is and dont get your hopes up that it will be done anytime soon.\n\n\nEdit #1 (21.09.2017): Mondoids became \"Thursdoids\". Devs just changed their name and shifted the reports from Mondays to Thursdays.'\n\nEdit #2 (28.09.2017): Added the part about flashing lights on cars vs. losing full trunk loads of items."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506194702, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535558", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35161911", "votes_up": 25, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058431669", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1468769404, "num_games_owned": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5302}, "timestamp_updated": 1506194702, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Three years ago i was a big fan of this  game.

All the while, the devs waste years in development on a game that will never be complete, nor fun. 3/10.\n\nAlright, I'm done. I've played as much as I could of this game and I've completely snapped and I can't stand this game anymore. I do want to commend the devs on a great idea for a game, but I just can't say I recommend it. I could bring up the years that this has been in early access (like I am now) or I could just focus on what gameplay there is and try and explain to others how this game is the antithesis of fun (like I will next).\n\nBasically it's the zombie apocalypse................... How original, right? Well, when this game first came out years and years ago it might have been a little more fresh. Unfortunately for Project Z, neither this game nor genre stand the test of time. But that's only half the problem with this game. Every single action is as follows: \n\n* right click, \n* then move mouse, \n* then hover over option, \n* then new menu appears,\n* then move mouse to new option,\n* then click the new option,\n* And then you wait for a progress bar to complete. \n\nWhile you wait there is no animation of the character doing anything. No change in your surroudings while progress is being made. Nothing. You just sit there and watch a progress bar fill up while your character just stands there.\n\nAt first you don't mind. It's a game of action and planning. It's a game of survival.. but as you'll soon realize, none of that matters because you only experience that for about 10 minutes out of the hours and hours of play each instance brings. Most of your time is literally spent watching a progress bar slowly complete while your character just stands there. A progress bar to read. A progress bar to cook. A progress bar to construct. A progress bar to fill a water bottle. A progress bar to water a plant. A progress bar to repair. A progress bar to jerk off. Ok maybe not that last one, but you get the point.\n\nThe real problem is that the game is literally one loading screen after the next. NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL. Sure a zombie could walk up on you and you get to hear that screeching sound when your character is surprised (oh yeah, that wears off after the 3rd to 400th time you hear it). But the reality is you are watching a character standing with a loading bar over its head 99% of the time. And that's the game. Eventually you'll die, or live forever because there is no end game, but no matter what, you'll spend countless hours watching a mother fucking cocksucking bitch ass fart licking horse vomiting boring as shit loading bar go by as you slowly age in real life.\n\nAnd if that wasn't bad enough, the game has the audacity to mock you while you're playing. You need to cook something? Here's 10 drop down menus to make a stir fry dish. Then the game has the BALLS to send you a status update on your character that says, \"Getting Bored, Occupy yourself, or seek entertainment.\" ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS!? No KIDDING I'm FUCKING BORED. This crappy game is telling me that my character is bored? I'M BORED IN REAL LIFE TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI think the joke is on us for giving the devs our money. They have proven to deliver too little too late and to mock us while we play it. I found this game to be a solid concept that is completely lost and muddled with features that are overly tedious and in desperate need of streamlining. I keep hearing Steve Jobs yelling, \"WHY ARE THERE SO MANY BUTTONS?\" Worse yet is this game is a progress bar simulator where nothing ever happens. I'm sorry, but this game is just the exact opposite of fun, and I'm usually the kind of idiot that like this kind of micromanagement garbage. 3/10."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507116499, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501330", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35469148", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198066726511", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1507137332, "num_games_owned": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 572, "playtime_forever": 9674}, "timestamp_updated": 1507116499, "received_for_free": false, "review": "abandoned, the post news that has no meaning and no new features or reall bug fixes\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505936833, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500782", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35090971", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989584196", "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1506702165, "num_games_owned": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 420, "playtime_forever": 4869}, "timestamp_updated": 1505936833, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Fun cool and allot to promise. \njust some thing else instead a fps zombie servivel. only bit more options in crafting and stuf.\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506127049, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502932", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35140769", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197981139631", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1507078017, "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 550, "playtime_forever": 11053}, "timestamp_updated": 1506127049, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Really an under apreciated game of the zombie survival genre.

So many Early Access titles are just not ready for public use. This is not one of them. It took me 20 mins to establish that not only was this a stable and efficient engine, but the depth they have included was staggering.\n\nI play a GREAT many survival games, some \"a little like real life\" and some are so close that you dream about them as though you were there (See The Long Dark). While the graphic engine is simplistic in nature, it is more than complex enough to suck you into the world. After 10 mins of learning to \"move things around\" from your bags to containers and such, getting your feet under you, then...all your \"The Walking Dead\" and \"Dawn of the Dead\" training starts coming out.\n\nOnce you've worked the interface out and are comfortable with it enough to function, you then slip easily into your \"survival boots\". Your senses go high, you mind starts running in the background on its own, plotting out what-ifs for anything that might happen, all the while you are actively looting your first house (likely your own house). \n\nAs you gather things you quickly come to understand that you can't (and shouldn't) take everything. You are now alone in the dark. You have no help coming...and as long as you stay quiet and inconspicuous, you have a lot of time to think on your plan of survival and start to pool resources together and get your feet under you.\n\nThe crafting engine can seem overwhelming at first, but it is actually quite forgiving as long as you have the curiosity to read the possible designs and think to yourself \"how can I make this help me\". And to have a hoarding nature will help...gather ALL the stuff you find and put it into a workshop style environment. Then you sit down and quietly tinker all night long from one thing to another. \n\nThe physiological and psychological aspects to the game are amazing, even to this old survival sim veteran. As I sat there with a screwdriver, disassembling a remote control for its I.R. sensor, I looked over and realized that I have become well-adapted to being (in this case) 5 things at once...I am a little hungry...I am a bit tired...I am getting bored...I am having some pain in my left forearm (due to glass from breaking a window last night)...and I am being soothed by the sound of the rain outside. The depth of ailments, conditions, and afflictions are really amazing. If you were to be stabbed, you wouldn't just \"Lose 25 hp and get 'bleeding' condition\". No no...you would take the hit...stab...I've been hurt...then blood spurt 3 seconds later...I am bleeding and it's severe...then 10 seconds after, I am getting scared (seeing so much of your own blood) and in some pain...then 20 seconds after as you stuble towards your camp, I am in tremendous pain and am wailing out and cannot help it...30 seconds...I am cold and trembling and sliding into shock. \nApply sterile bandages (you made yesterday from whiskey and ripped bed sheets)...and the conditions slowly subside over time. This makes for an IMMENSELY more engrossing event than \"I got stabbed and lost 25 hp\". \n\nI am just scratching the surface of the jewel...and already I have declared \"You have SOO earned my money on this game\". I bought my own copy and am likely to purchase a 4-pack for the rest of my gaming unit. Multiplayer HAS to be just righteous. \n\nSo for TLDR: Well worth the money, take 10 mins and learn the interface, then go live your life in this REALISTIC survival simulation. Make your own server, tweak your \"in my end of the world zombie apocalypse things would be like this...\" settings. Then immerse yourself into a sim that will carry you for 100s of hours as you push your boundries and your imagination."}]}
