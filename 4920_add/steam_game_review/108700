But if we ignore the original.... well honestly this isn't a fun game. \n\nIt's a game TRYING to be like Carmageddon.  Trying to offer \"race, or kill\" but the problem is unlike Carmageddon where both approaches feel doable, this game seems to forget to make either goal achievable in most races.  You CAN race, and try to get into first (while your gun auto fires and damages opponents) but item drops are important, if you get a couple nitros, you're going to do fine, if you don't... well better luck next time.  The controls aren't conducive to racing.  You turn but quite often your car will go where it wants to and often that's into a wall. \n\nBut Link, it's DEATH rally. \n\nOk... so let's try to kill enemies.  Well there's two problems there.  A. You really only have time to kill maybe 3 enemies if you're lucky.  And B. When an enemy is \"almost dead\" they feel like they get another health bar.   So you're... going to have to still kill them but now don't know how much life is left in them. \n\nThe AI isn't exactly that bright.  I've complained a lot about how Drivatars get into too many accident, but they're based on players, the AI in this game isn't... and yet every so often you get in a three to four car pile up.  Great, you can avoid it and get ahead of them?  Sure, but the two cars not in the pile up tend to be farther down the line especially if you have to swerve around a wreck. \n\nBut clearly you aren't using the upgrades. \n\nOk you're kind of right, I haven't used all the weapons and upgrades.  I have two guns (Shotgun and gattling) and mines.  The mines are great, 3 uses if you're in front of someone you can fuck them up.  The shot gun is near worthless, and the Gatling gun is thirsty, but does .... well really not that much damage.  And the rest of the upgrades?  WEll upgrades in this game is done like this.  You get 1 upgrade per track, it usually is a new car upgrade.  But then there's Guns, an new tracks that each get upgraded one at a time.  You get extra upgrades by killing enemies, but as mentioned, that's hard as hell to get.  You don't get upgrades by winning races.  (though you get more fame that way)   So to get 5 upgrade parts to get the shot gun is annoying, but you can bang it out in a couple races.  Getting 15(!) upgrade parts for the fourth weapon is a LOT.  I can't imagine what's beyond that. \n\nWhich brings me to a point I've seen elsewhere.  This originally was an IOS android game.  The controls feel like it, but the grinding progress and weak gameplay almost confirms it.  This isn't \"death rally\" it's more \"grind fest\" and to me that makes it a no at any price.  Yeah it's 10 bucks, but you'd be better off saving that money, watch a video of someone losing a race in this game and realize that's about all you're going to see. \n\nThat's not to say you can't win races, but it's QUITE random.  This isn't a game based on \"Skill\" as much grind for stats, that are expensive, and grind for weapons, and then hope you somehow win.  A shame, because the original game was good, but even ignoring that, Death Rally is not a very good game.  In fact it's bad, not because it doesn't try, but because I think they tried to make this game into something it wasn't.  I don't know where they were aiming, but it's neither a racing game, or a car combat game."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1492766323, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497498", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31271489", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198063545962", "num_reviews": 37, "last_played": 1492765794, "num_games_owned": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 31}, "timestamp_updated": 1492766323, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Not at all a decent tribute to the original.
