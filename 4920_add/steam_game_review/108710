Sort of...\n\nThe combat in this game is kind of like being ganked in a multiplayer game. It consists of set piece after set piece where a small (or bigger) group of enemies attacks you from all sides - often from behind where you can't see them. Usually, this would be quite frustrating - and it was for me, until around the midpoint of the game. Then I got a hang of the combat and was using all the available tools in the game. As you have to first \"soften up\" the enemies with light (mainly your flashlight), flares and flashbangs are the most powerful weapons in the game and if used correctly, make the previously very hard fight into a much easier one.\n\nStill, the combat is somewhat repetitive. And you will be doing a lot of it. They try to mix it up here and there but it doesn't change the fact that you will be mostly rushed by a bunch of dudes, evoking the aforementioned gank fests.\n\nIn between these combat set pieces, there are the usual cutscenes and story vignettes. The story is mostly a mix of Twin Peaks and Stephen King's \"It\". It has some mystery to it, and despite the cliches, I was drawn more to it then most other game stories. It's all presented like a mystery TV-show with making chapters into \"Episodes\" with a recap at the beginning and a nice (licensed) music track at the end of each episode.\n\nThe visuals of the game are dated but it sill looks serviceable. The characters don't quite go into uncanny valley territory but still look like puppets for the most part.\n\nAlthough I almost wanted to quit until around the middle, I enjoyed this game in the end."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504585453, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34749553", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198041150586", "num_reviews": 54, "last_played": 1497356775, "num_games_owned": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 450}, "timestamp_updated": 1504585453, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is probably one of the best single player games released in the last 5 years.

Every one got you pumped and interested for the next one.

The combat in this game is decent. It's not the best, although the idea of your \"weapons\" and \"enemies\" I thought was very creative. Regardless, this game's main highlight for me was its story. Music fit well with the game, and the characters were all mostly likeable.\n\n82 / 100\n\nThis game had a really good ending that I really liked that left you with a lot of thought on what might have actually happened.
