When you cast a spell, the enemy doesn't have this hookup -.-\n- After a while it'll be boring\n- Currently I'm on level 30+ and there is a lot's of though enemy while your HP is still not much, you can't upgrade it. Yes you can heal yourself, but you have to decide: attack and using your mana, or heal, using the SAME mana... sou you heal yourself and you'll die. You attack, and you'll die. Smart hugh? -.-\n- Not much to do here... if you see 10 minute, you saw the whole game"}]}
