I was somewhat off for the first few hours, but the game gets better and better with every hour you spend in it. \n\nA disclaimer #2 - if you don't like timegate mechanic and grinding dailies don't read further.\n\nLet's start with some pros:\n+ Setting - I'm definitely a FR lover. You should know that Salvatore helped with writing some of the quests in the game. You will also meet some amazing characters like Bruenor Battlehamer, Drizzt Do'Urden or Minsc&Boo. \n+ Music - wether you're in the heart of Neverwinter, traverse the Underdark or purge the Dread Ring of the undead you'll always be accompanied by really nice tunes. It's an MMO so obviously music does not play THAT BIG of a role, but the tracks playing at the background do not disturb you.\n+ Character development(bright part) - it's really well made. While power upgrading does not matter much, traits and boons can passively make your character stronger in different ways(for example make your trap also deal damage over time, and even stronger against immune targets)\n+ Combat - you're basically on the move all the time, combat is dynamic, there is a lot of dodging, blocking and watching out for enemy attacks\n+ Endgame - that is just my opinion but endgame is great. Dungeons are challenging(unless you get boosted by that 3k+ player), long, bossfights are fun. There is always something to do due to campaigns which not only give great rewards but boost your character stats via boons. Also progress is slow paced but significant enough to see the difference between those two items, 30-40 item levels or that one tier of your artifact. \n\nCons\n- Hard to earn currency - getting AD as a fresh player is a pain in the arse. Enough said. \n- AD to Zen converting ratio - Zen is that \"real money\" currency of NW. And while gathering AD to exchange for Vip(1k Zen - 500k AD) is not that big of an issue, trying to get AD to buy Zen while also managing your characters equipment is. Artifact here, refinement stones there, goodbye 120k AD here. \n- Outdated graphics - we're in 2017, yet graphics sometimes feel like a 2012 game. It doesn't look bad, it had actually aged quite well, but I think devs should consider making some upgrades here and there. \n- Character development (sad part) - boons from campaigns are a double edged sword. They greatly increase character capabilities, but good luck getting most of them. Some of them are after huge timegates(ToD, Dread Ring, Underdark) and others are just annoying to start with(Icewind Dale, fuck you).\n\nMy final mark would be somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10. It's definitely a game worth at least trying out."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1488294928, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509051", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30241986", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198146996338", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1497769138, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2538}, "timestamp_updated": 1488295337, "received_for_free": false, "review": "PROS: \nWhen you've reached like level 3 you're gonna start to nerd this game A LOT\n\nThe game is constantly updated to either fix bugs or add in new content\n\nIf you're into MMO RPGs you're gonna love this game to bits\n\nCONS:\n'astral diamonds' wich you use to buy stuff in the AH (Auction House) (buying items off others) are kinda tricky to get if you don't have 2 friends with you or if you're under level 20.\n\n\n\nRATING: 9,5/10"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1488312907, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500713", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30247432", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198337588478", "num_reviews": 58, "last_played": 1489869814, "num_games_owned": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 391}, "timestamp_updated": 1488312907, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Really fun!!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1488312496, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30247294", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198072980563", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1500012063, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7354}, "timestamp_updated": 1488312496, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Awesome game, very addictive :)"}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1487420170, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507661", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30007214", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198056664265", "num_reviews": 57, "last_played": 1439367029, "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4063}, "timestamp_updated": 1487420170, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It is just another MMO RPG"}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486512557, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508625", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "29771947", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198051320288", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1486702645, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4223}, "timestamp_updated": 1486512557, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Don't expect the greatest game of all time, but expect the perfect formula for hijinks with your dad friends.
