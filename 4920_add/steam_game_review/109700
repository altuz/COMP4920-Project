I stopped when I literally got a headache. But I was hooked. \n\nIt plays about as complex as you might expect a game with time travel to play. It manages it with a timeline you can view 5 minutes forward or back or anywhere in between. You click back 30sec and you change an order, then click back to the present and everything is the same. But then time waves come into it, they move slightly faster than the passage of time and wash over the timeline from start to finish and collect and propagate changes from the past to the future. So that change you made 30sec ago, you would see a wipe go over your screen in about 20sec and if it was a large difference in orders then things would change. \n\n[u]This opens up unique solutions to problems...[/u]\n-Create 5 units, skip ahead in time 30 seconds to when they are finished and send them to a task. Skip back to the present and continue your base preperations.\n-Attack fails on an enemy base? Go back in time and build more units to send. When the time wave propagates then you will see a successful attack. \n-Theres a rock/paper/scissors weak against/strong against thing happening with units in this game. So if you find yourself being decimated then you can jsut go back and change the composition of units in a squad and sit back and enjoy victory. \n-Enemy attacking you? You will see which direction they came from. Go back in time a minute, build more troops, and send troops in their direction to intercept. Your base is saved. \n\n[u]But your enemy also has access to this time manipulation also. [/u]\n-Your troops find a large group of enemies and are outnumbered, go back in time and send more. You win. But with the next passing timewave you notice your troops sitting unharmed doing nothing. Your enemy went back in time and canceled the order to send the troops out so now you found nothing. \n-You attack and destroy an enemy base. Your enemy goes back in time 1 minute before this happens and sends air units to destroy the factory that created the units that will destroy your base. When the time wave propagates, you notice your attack suddenly is failing (all your units that were made from that factory no longer exist). You go back in time and cancel the attack to keep your troops near to defend the base. Your enemy goes back in time and cancels the air unit's movement as there is no longer a need to destroy the factory.\n\n[b]Does your head hurt yet?[/b]\n\nYou will be glad to hear there is a limit. As you use a regenerating resource called chronoenergy to send orders to troops in the past or future. Go back too far and one order takes more than a full bar or chronoenergy. So that is the logistical limit. You have hierachies so that one order can concievebaly control 30+ units but there is a hard limit.\n\n[b]Want to hurt your mind more? Yes I thought so.[/b]\n\nYou have heard of teleporting. Which is in the game by the way. But what about chronoporting? This is the process of sending units forward or back in time. \n[u]Which creates deliciously complex solutions to problems....[/u]\n-Oh god the base is being attacked! You only have 5 tanks and no time to make more units. Go to the chronoporter and send all the units back in time 15 seconds. Time jumps back 15sec, you now have 10 tanks. The originals and the time clones. Just make sure to protect the original 5 tanks, as they must survive the battle in order to go to the chronoproter and go back in time. Aaagh\n-Send back 10 units one minute. Have them in a hierachy beforehand. Then assign them to an existing squad. You will suddenly have unprecedented firepower for that stage of the game. But you gotta weigh your options. Is it worth pouring all those resources into the early game??? Aaaagh\n-Out of the three races, one can chronoport without using a structure. They do it on a unit basis. This is the most mind boggling feature in my opinion. You can actually avoid conflicting forces by chronoporting back in time a minute right before you begin your attack. If you chose the right spot then you will begin your attack before you first arrived at the base. AAAAAGH\n\nSo you need to study before this game is fun. It is not quite dwarf fortress diffuculty curve but it's up there and a clear reason why it was not as popular as other RTS games. Another thing that contributed to that is it was a bit buggy at first and the pathfinding took a lot of updates to make right. \n\nIt completely changed the way I play any other game. I sat down for a game of age of empires and after an unsuccessful raid I began looking to reverse my action and bolster my troops. I felt the mentality bleeding into my life and in an uncanny moment I snapped back into the realization that I live within time. \n\n[b]Any game that makes me lose sense of reality, even for a bit get the big thumbs up from me. \nI'd highly reccomend this game to people who want to think and can see through complexity to do so.
