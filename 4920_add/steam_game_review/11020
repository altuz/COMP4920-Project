For example, you can only do 5 races in a row until you are basically forced to sit out and spectate the ENTIRE next race. Try to leave and join another? Nope, nice try. You are required to sit and wait for a good 5-10 minutes and if you try to leave to join another server it starts all over again. Five more races, and then another round of spectating. Sure, to most people that is fine and they suck it up but for a guy who likes to sit down, relax, and play for more than a little bit at a time that is a major let down. It sucks, because if they wouldnt have implemented that little limitation this game would be awesome. Great user made tracks, fast, arcade racing fun is what this game nails perfectly. I would recommend but they need to lift that limitation and get rid of it because its not for safety, for hackers, or anything for that matter. Its just a way to be a pain in the ass pushing you to buy the full game. Also, the full game is like $20 or $30 last time i checked. This game is pretty good, but it is not $30 good. That being said, if you are willing to sit out every five rounds of racing and watch other people race, then download it. This version is free. Unless it is on sale for like $5, stick to the free version."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1366928136, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2312430", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198005575857", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1480138512, "num_games_owned": 618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1382}, "timestamp_updated": 1366928136, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Sonic The Hedgehog with 4 wheels.
