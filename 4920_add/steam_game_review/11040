Looked for and found the paintings that I needed to find, but nothing happened. Why? Because you have to talk to the museum's director first, who tells you that he's busy and you should go look yourself. How important, how helpful, how enlightening, how meaningful. Looked at the same pictures again, voila, trigger, game goes on. Next chain of puzzles, same mechanics. This is no adventure game but an increasingly boring walking simulator full of bad animation, annoying pixel hunting, and gratuitous items on the programmers' shopping list of things you need to do in just that order to finally trigger the next far-fetched chain of puzzles."}]}
