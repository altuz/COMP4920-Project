But sadly.......inMomentum is a huge disappointment.\n\nThe game's trailer touts its 'Competitive First-Person Racing', 'Various Game Modes' with 'Over 30 Achievements'. But at time of writing the online multiplayer does not work, this in only one mode of play, and the achievements might as well as place holders because they have no funciton. Basically the game is not finished, and this almost throws me into a rage, because this is a FANTASTIC game, but if I can't play with other people Its nothing but a pointless time sink. I had bought this game with one steam friend specifically in mind who would go bananas for a game like this.

I tend to get frustrated easily and don't usually have the dexterity required to be very successful at them. That said, inMomentum is a jumping game, but it shifts the paradigm somewhat in that the jumping is tethered to the mouse rather than the keyboard. Initially this seemed like a strange choice, but in reality, the game is so focused around jumping that it makes the most sense and gives the player the quickest control method. inMomentum features clean and bright Unreal engine graphics as well as a nicely made tutorial. I was especially impressed by the excellent soundtrack that matches well with the action without resorting to a pounding bass line. I liked the music so much, I would purchase this game just for the soundtrack. That said, if you enjoy games like Mirrors Edge or Prince of Persia where acrobatics take center stage, there is a lot to like in inMomentum."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1367464351, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500572", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "1633625", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995658400", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1340434800, "num_games_owned": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 170}, "timestamp_updated": 1403592842, "received_for_free": false, "review": "MULTIPLAYER IS NOT WORKING.
