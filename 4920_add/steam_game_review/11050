The music was okay, it got a little repetitive when trying to figure out a puzzle.  My only complaint is I think they took out the see through top of the succubus from this game.  You can find it in a couple of screenshots, but after playing the game recently I think they just zoomed in on her face for that particular scene.  I was waiting to screenshot it myself!

The puzzels presented within Dracula vary in difficulty and complexity and the style of them also changes depending on the location you are in, this is a nice touch and keeps the game moving and engaging for the around 2 - 3 hours you are in a certain area. The story within the game follows a rather cliche plot, and ends abruptly however its enough to keep you going, however for an adventure game where story is usually a mian factor it is a bit of a let down. The sound design is great, with different background music  playing in different areas and ambient noise creating a creepy atmosphere which suits the overall theme of the game.  \n\nOverall Dracula Origin is a well designed adventure game and did as a whole keep me interested, I would recommend this game to anyone wanting a casual adventure game that does not last to long but overall tells a short creepy story with clever puzzels. For me $10 is a good price for fun experience you will get, however if you are not that into adventure games I would recommend waiting for a sale.  \n\nOverall 8/10.\n"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1404293499, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495526", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11016738", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198132738655", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1414260441, "num_games_owned": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1860}, "timestamp_updated": 1404293499, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Hell,\nI love this game!!!!\nHas hidden objects & really works my mind.
