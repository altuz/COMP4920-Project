Despite wanting to like this game, I cannot recommend it. \n\nLike many computer themed game, this game has nothing to do with actual computers and is only there to facilitate a convenient Tron-like art style. Zipping along the racetrack as such is fun at first but quickly loses it's luster and ultimately feels a bit like a gimmick. Where this game fails is the fact that it's procedurally generated and that it throws everything at you. As a result playing this game is a bit of a chaotic mess which puts you in situations that often feel unfair.  I feel this game could have been better with intentionally designed challenges instead of throwing the player into a sloppy mess. \n\nThe game does support USB controllers fairly well. If you're looking for a challenging (and sometimes unfair) arcade game that you can play with a USB controller than this might be a good title but don't expect too much.\n\nScore: 5.5/10\n"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1389767125, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508509", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8713204", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197960531283", "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1389766722, "num_games_owned": 646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 8}, "timestamp_updated": 1389767125, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a fun little abstract racing game, suitable for quick playing, though there's an entire campaign built in.
