It was an overly addicting portable title that played with the feel and charm of a classic arcade shooter. I found it to be one of those rare games with simple controls that anyone can watch and instantly know how to play. \"Alien Zombie Mega Death\" is an entirely re-worked game revamped from the older version but made for the PC and consoles. The game plays exactly the same but has updated the visuals with higher resolution graphics and provided additional gameplay features. The addicting arcade feel and atmosphere that the predecessor had still remains and makes this version a must own for anyone with a Steam account. If this game were made in the 70s it would have been historically known as a fantastic skill based arcade game.  (a la ... Pacman, Space Invaders). Although each level has challenges that you must complete to advance and open up more levels, I actually consider this to be in the vain of old school high-score games that have no real ending. (ie, Tetris, Tapper). This is a must buy for any fan of retro arcade games. I can't believe how many people have never heard of this game.  Whether you are playing for a high score against friends or trying to complete all of the levels and their challenges, this game will provide gamers with countless hours of pure gaming fun. I consistently come back to this game as my \"go-to\" when I want to put on some music through steam and play a game that allows me to get lost in the mix. It is a real gem and one of my personal favorite games of all time."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1325807934, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495730", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "5097124", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198045010067", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1341903600, "num_games_owned": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 73}, "timestamp_updated": 1325807934, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It gets more and more addicting by time.\n\nPros : Unlimited enemys to kill\n            Variety in kinds of enemys\n            Multiple game modes ( Survival , UFO , Bomb Defusal , Baby resque , Jetpack)\n            2 player game feature\n            Chalenging stages so that its hard to earn medals.\nCons : Somewhat tiny weapon pick-up duration\n             Limited customization depending space suits\n             13 Achivements\n             Medium graphics for its type of game while released in 2011 \n\nI can give it 75/100 something that i dont do easily.\nIf its worth the money ?

Nothing special, and if I didn't have about a trillion other smaller distractions, I'd be plenty happy playing it a lot more.
