You choose from 8 levels of difficulty in the form of different coloured belts then dive into as many 30-second levels as you wish. [i]Adventure[/i] mode is a last-as-long-as-you-can romp. First off, the game throws you into a very tight arena-type room with little space for manoeuvre and challenges you to clear it in thirty seconds. You get an ominous siren after 20 seconds to signal that an indestructible nasty will soon arrive. The actual challenge from room to room rises well. One death ends the level (in [i]Tally[/i] mode) making that 15 seconds delay to get back into the game seem VERY long. \n\n[u]--PRESENTATION & DESIGN--[/u]\nProgress is displayed by showing which of the 89 rooms have been cleared and with which coloured belt. The game takes you to this screen every time you finish a room which is a great, at-a-glance progress system. The sound is ambient and tunnel-like. When entering a room you get that echoey industrial sound which adds a suitable edge to the game's atmosphere. Explosions and the deaths of enemies is satisfying especially those that require a number of hits to be dispatched. Rooms are lit with a Tron inspired neon-lighting theme.\n\n[u]--CONCLUSION--[/u]\nLike most twin-stick shooters this is not a game you'd normally play for long stretches. However, for a fifteen or twenty minute blast it's a great pick-up-and-play game. There is a bit of back and forth screen hopping when changing difficulty but no biggie. \n\n5/5\n\n\nFor the full review of this and other games please check out or follow my curator page at:\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26108770-Parsons%27-Garden/]Parsons' Garden[/url]"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1411572135, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509734", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "12219996", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197964519426", "num_reviews": 37, "last_played": 1469313536, "num_games_owned": 3405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 97}, "timestamp_updated": 1411572135, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I remember looking at Mutant Storm when it first came out and being absolutely blown away by how it looked, how things moved in it. It was a genuine and very real inspiration for me thinking \"one day, I want to do something like that\" and well, I do now.\n\nIt wasn't just the game, it was that there was this really small team making arcade games at a point where it's generally accepted that the arcade is dead. Well, that's fairly good right?\n\nAnd sure, looks wise even despite a couple of makeovers it looks sort of less inspirational now than it did in the early 2000's and we're in a post Geometry Wars world where everything subscribes to a similar sort of neon-particle explosion sort of thing and I like that, I really really like that but Mutant Storm looks like Mutant Storm and nothing else. It's clearly got Minter-spirations but it's very very \"looks like a Pompom game\" and that's the kind of thing we can all aspire to. Not necessarily looking like Pompom but making a game that's ours and unmistakably ours too.\n\nThe gameplay seems, now, rather tame considering. It's not easy but there's a rigidity to the waves and patterns that compared to a lot of what we see now is very much more considered. And that's fine, absolutely fine because it still remains a very good little game of shooting things. And what's a game like this if not about shooting things, right? Right.\n\nSo yeah, Mutant Storm. A classic and an inspiration to me. Still, after all these years. An essential, no doubt."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1454526680, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506446", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "20937172", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011289000", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1454525711, "num_games_owned": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 32}, "timestamp_updated": 1469018521, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This had a game breaking graphical crash about 30 minutes into playing, it was totally unplayable in this state and it never self corrected(even the title/menu screen was messed up).
