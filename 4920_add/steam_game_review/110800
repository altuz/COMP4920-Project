Noire[/h1]\n...is a third-person action investigation game. Returning from World War II, now-police officer Cole Phelps is quickly singled as a brilliant detective where his case investigations has him facing the corrupt forces that rule Los Angeles. This review takes into account all DLCs.\n\n[h1]\u26a0 [u]Description[/u][/h1]\nWhile the game is set in an open-world city with drivable (and commandeerable) vehicles, this is not a 1940s-set GTA clone. Each case works as a separate chapter, you start your day being assigned a case you must investigate with your partner, being given a specific location to drive to in your department-supplied car. At each crime scene, you must uncover clues, interrogate witnesses and gather information to figure out where to go next.\n\nInvestigation has its own neat set of mechanics: spot clues laid about on the ground, on furniture, or on victims. As you pick them up, you observe them by moving in your hand on a 2-axe 3D fashion, spotting marks, inscriptions or additional information. Witness interrogation consists of asking the questions in the right order, each answer chained to additional information depending on whether you correctly assume the answer to be truthful, doubtful or false (the latter must be backed by proof you select from your already accumulated clues or testimonies).\n\nAdditional investigation mechanics include solving puzzles, secretly following or trailing people by car or on foot, or contacting the office whenever you need additional information such as location addresses or followup messages from collaborating personnel. Driving and shooting are pulled out directly from similar open-world games.\n\n[h1]\u263a [u]Pros[/u][/h1]\nThe campaign has a good length to it, totaling 22 different cases across 4 different desks: Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Each case is very distinct, it can be easy to miss clues, mess up interrogations, charging a culprit with a lack of evidence or straight out charging the wrong person. You'll often be able to progress in the story without a 5-star success in some cases, but sometimes you'll have to replay an entire investigation and figure out where you went wrong and try things differently.\n\nWhere [i]L.A. Noire[/i] really shines is in its characters. Even though graphics haven't aged that well, this game pioneered facial recognition in video games: each face is a 3D rendering of an actor who spoke each line, many you'll recognize from various TV series (yes, Leland Monroe's face and voice really is John Noble, aka Walter Bishop from [i]Fringe[/i]), and while their facial articulations may seem overdone at times, they are usually very believable with top-notch voice acting, you'll spend a lot of time looking at faces and twitches in an attempt to see if the person in front of you is being honest during interrogation. The script is also very good, and most people you come across have implied motivations of their own.\n\nFictional late-40s Los Angeles is beautifully recreated, filled with people and almost a hundred real-life time-appropriate cars including hidden special car models. There are also collectibles to find and landmarks to visit. 40 optional side quest will be made available as police calls you get during your investigations while driving from point A to point B, giving you additional incentive to get to know the city.\n\n[h1]\u2639 [u]Cons[/u][/h1]\nThere's a missed opportunity with this open world: there are no stores, no activities to do in the city. When you conclude an investigation, you begin a new one the next morning, and that's it. There is no building you can enter unless it is related to a case at some point or another, so unless you really care about collectibles, you won't feel any urge to explore the city. The developers obviously put a lot of heart in creating the city, but it is left unmemorable. As for all the cars, you'll stick to your supplied car for convenience, assuming you don't simply let your partner drive to skip directly to the next location.\n\nThe overarching story is lack luster to some degree, supplied as chatter during driving segments, or small cutscenes in between cases. Sure, the flashbacks help flesh out your character, but his personal life is barely explored. Important moments such as [spoiler]your love affaire with a singer that has you thrown out by your wife and reprimanded by the police chief[/spoiler] come as a complete surprise as it's barely hinted to, and overall contributes to making you relate very little to the protagonist. To top it all off, the last few chapters feel rather rushed, giving the game an unsatisfying ending.\n\n[h1][b]Verdict[/b]: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 - [i]\"Next on your list!\"[/i][/h1]\n\nThere's a lot to be found in this game you won't find elsewhere, and it requires observation, thoroughness, and most of all enough patience to redo some cases until you succeed. If that sounds like you, I strongly recommend you give [i]L.A. Noire[/i] some of your time!\n\n[quote][b]P.S.[/b]: Before closing down, Team Bondi's management team gave the shaft to many of their staff members by supplying Rockstar with an incomplete credit from which they had removed over 100 developers (artists, coders, etc.), people who worked gruesome hours, spent years on the project, and were ultimately fired weeks before the game's release.

The way L.A Noire's world comes to life is worth the play through on its own. Every part of Team Bondi's recreation of 1947 Los Angeles feels genuine and feels like a lot of time was spent accurately recreating the feel of the period. Cars break and crumple like the great big hunks of hard steel and bolts that cars of the time were. The interior designs of buildings are so well done, they look fantastic and you forget you are playing a game that was made in 2011 pretty quick, it holds up very nicely, this is because of just how detailed each area of play is. I can only assume that this was possible due to the 'level' like struction of this open world. It's open world but not in the same way that Rockstar's other published works are. It's more episodic, with the player spending the majority of their time exploring incredibly realised pockets of L.A; Each apartment, office, and dingey factory are all perfectly completed with little cups, papers, personal items just laying around in a really believable way. There are loads of notes and hand written letters and stuff in the game, which just adds even more life to the world. \n\nSo I've just been talking about its world. The game also owes a lot of it's depth of its wonderful motion capped animations, which have truly unique look amongst games, Some have called them bad, or weird, but I think they are truly wonderful. Yeah they have some tech issues here and there, the eyes and mouths are scanned and lack depth and their own materials, but the amount of expression they add to the game is just awesome. A seemingly large necessity in a game about reading peoples faces and trying to deduce whether they are lying or not. The actors are great and it's really cool to see how well they perform. Its grouse!\n\nThe gameplay is nice. I'm going to say nice and not amazing, because it has a few issues. Not experience breaking, but a lot that I question could be better. The first is the Truth, Lie, Doubt system. It works, but it just feels really broken sometimes. I don't know if its just me not paying attention. But it find myself screwing it up quite a bit. It just makes me think if it could've been done in a better way. The investigating moments in the game are a lot of fun. Finding clues and stuff. I just wish there was more of it, done in a more exciting way, that perhaps let the player put a few more pieces of the puzzle together. The majority of the time you arrive a location, HAVE to pick up the 4 or 5 pieces of evidence at that location before you can continue to the next one. I feel like there is also a way to push that further as well. I mean this is all just me, and that stuff is still all great so, take it with a grain of salt. The gunplay is littered through out and is just plain fun, it plays lots like Red Dead Redemption, could just be the older guns hahaha, but yeah it just plays nice. \n\nOverall, L.A Noire is a fantastic game, and one worth playing if you haven't already. They are making a remake so you could wait for that. Or enjoy it as one of 2011's best games!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506292671, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501879", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35192171", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198401460689", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506292935, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 564, "playtime_forever": 1636}, "timestamp_updated": 1506292671, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Has a fanstasic story and very atmosperic its 9/10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506342508, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504309", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35201720", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198124252619", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1506068159, "num_games_owned": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 82, "playtime_forever": 874}, "timestamp_updated": 1506342508, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[i] a small unexpected jumpscare [/i]\nRoy Earle: \"Hah.

So I had to use desktop configuration. That said, it's a really good game to get to grips with the Steam controller, as its not too demanding. \n\nL.A. Noire, is not a perfect game. But if you have a fascination with the 1940's, enjoy crime drama and detective shenanigans then you're probably going to have a good time. My only recommendation is that if you fail a case even one time, just pull up a walk through. The game has some odd conversational fail states at the end of missions, that require to retread ground to get right. It's easier to restart a mission with a guide. \n\nOn the more positive side, the setting is great and believable. The game respects your time by not over populating the world with endless pick ups and side missions. I managed to get all the non DLC achievements with very little extra effort put in. Even the hardest one which requires you to get in every vehicle has a built in mechanic that helps you cheese it if you are struggling. \n\nI enjoyed the game a lot. I've played through it up to the about 3 hours from the end multiple times, but for various (moved platform, played on a different account, etc) I never finished it. And it was still a joy to play it again and this time get all the way through till the end. It actually tries to do something fresh and different in the last stretch to the end, and I really appreciate the effort. \n\nOverall a really good game, as long as your expectations are in the right place."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505956831, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503020", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35095083", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198089486644", "num_reviews": 22, "last_played": 1503753608, "num_games_owned": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5432}, "timestamp_updated": 1505956831, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Very fun game, but has little to no replay value.\nRockstar, WE WANT A SEQUEL!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506878515, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502979", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35390148", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198048461220", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506729933, "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1709, "playtime_forever": 2939}, "timestamp_updated": 1506878515, "received_for_free": false, "review": "11/10\n\nTop 5 best written stories for a game by far!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505077944, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34871357", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198105549894", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1505164294, "num_games_owned": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1256}, "timestamp_updated": 1505077944, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The only game to make me realize i suck at telling if people are lying.

Set in 1947 Los Angeles, the game stands as both a loving homage to film noir and an excellent adition to the genre. Right from the menu screen, this game just oozes style. From the soundtrack to the loving recreation of 1940's LA, this game has great presentation. The story is equally good, with complex characters, interesting cases that are based on real life crimes, and a slow-paced, but excellent plot that unravels as you find yourself in the vile underbelly of the city of angels. On top of that, the game utilises compelling gameplay mechanics, such as interrogations that require you to guess whether the suspet is telling the truth, holding back information or simply lying. This is done by listening to their statement and their tone, their facial expression, and movements they make with their body. Whilst it can sometimes be hit and miss, this mechanic can make you feel truly immersed in the world, on edge and anticipating each and every detail in the case.\n\nWhilst you can complain about the game's 'flaws', such as a lack of activities in the city, or the ability to go on rampages and wreak havoc, one should be aware of one fact: the game, despite using a similiar engine to GTA, is certainly not a GTA game. This is a much more linear and complex game than GTA, at least in the way of story and gameplay elements. The city of LA is not a violent playground, it is a city, a stage for the thrilling events to occur in the story.\n\nOverall, a fantastic game that undercuts the industry standard of violent shoot-em-ups by looking to the past for inspiration.

So why did he have an affair with Elsa? This was incredibly out of character. He spoke highly, if rarely, about his wife and daughters, and when talking to Elsa, showed no romantic or sexual interest. So why would he throw that all away?\n\nMoving on, after he is exposed by his partner Roy, as a scapegoat to cover up an LAPD scandal, he is hated by everyone in the force for being disloyal to his wife. However, this is the 1940's. Men are racist, homophobic, and sure as hell cheat on their own wives. So why all the hate for Phelps?\n\nThirdly, Phelps dies at the end.
