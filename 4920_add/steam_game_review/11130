Also it is not stable on modern systems as I had several crash to desktop's while playing the game. Thankfully they are predictable as they usually occurred during cutscenes and with saving before solving a puzzle little progress would be lost. The puzzles in the game are very challenging and added the fact there is timed segments and puzzles that result in Sherlock Holmes death if you get them wrong.

It started in windowed mode and there's no option ingame. I had a few crash loading the 3rd level, the 5th level, and the menu after final credit rolls but everything seems to be solved by setting the Win XP SP3 compatibility, or by skipping the cutscenes.\nThis game takes you inside a mansion where you can see in First person view and you may freelook simply pointing your cursor to the sides of the screen. You move and interact with the classic Point and click system, so nothing particular or new in the gameplay, actually it's pretty minimalist, as you only use your mouse with its left button. Unfortunately there's no way to examine items unless you pick them up from your inventory as nothing shows when you hover on them through the inventory, nor there's a specific function. It's not like you really need it in the game but it surely would have helped a bit...\n\n[h1]+++PROs+++[/h1][list]\n[*][b] STORY.[/b] Actually the story is interesting. As you move on you get more and more clues and notes that somehow destroy your certainties and premises. I can't say more to prevent any kind of spoilers but I appreciated the plot. The final scene shows a classic Sherlock moment where he explains all the presents what really happened.\n[*][b] MUSIC.[/b] I kind of liked the music you hear in each level, I appreciated the compositions.\n[/list]\n[h1]---CONs---[/h1][list]\n[*][b] GRAPHIC. [/b] I know it has its age and it's a simple adventure but I really have to say that the graphic is very very poor and low detailed.\n[*][b] MUSIC & AUDIO.[/b] Unfortunately hearing the same music abrutly interrupted then restarting again for the whole level is really alienating. Besides that, some parts have very bad leveled volumes, and sometimes some sound or speeches are clipping. (though this happened rarely. Except for the first music track which crackled every time it finish to play again)\n[*][b] STEAM OVERLAY.[/b] Another game that doesn't support the Steam Overlay...\n[*][b] SETTINGS.[/b] The game started windowed and there were no options to set, nor for the graphic nor for audio (music, effects and speech levels)\n[*][b] INTERFACE.[/b] As a point & click game the interface is very important. Unfortunately the hot zones (zones that change cursor suggesting movement or actions) sometimes are too specific forcing you to search too long through the screen in the direction you want to move to find out later that the hot zone is really limited and lightly dislocated. Besides that, sometimes it's really hard to understand or see items you can pick or interact with. Not to mention a less important but still annoying bug that shows the wrong cursor icon when you interact with items and instead of restoring the defaul icon or changing to another secific one it stays the previous (and now wrong) one.\n[*][b] SHERLOCK'S & OTHERS VOICE.[/b] Well, it's not really about the voice, nor the accent. Actually it's his tone that doesn't convince me, as sometimes is really too harsh... And also Dr. Watson's voice sounds kind of... a parody...\n[/list]"}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1404185681, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517114", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "10991565", "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198048905044", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1404185064, "num_games_owned": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 413}, "timestamp_updated": 1404185681, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game hasn't aged well, and I doubt it was ever much fun to begin with.

For instance, one puzzle requires you to place exactly four liters of water on a depression. You're not told that's the amount you need, which, considering there's no earthly reason that putting more weight on it wouldn't work, should really be included. One puzzle is a nonogram, something I had never seen before, and the game gave no instructions.

Probably the first thing to mention is the continuous crashing, particularly at the end of cut scenes and chapter ends. MAKE SURE YOU SAVE OFTEN. I cannot reiterate that point enough. Much frustration comes after completing a devilish puzzle to have the game crash and redo it ALL over again. However, these crashes can be overcome with the good ole ESC key, for the most part.\nThe second most disappointing element is the visuals in relation to the difficulty of the game. I appreciate the age of a game and God knows how many adventure games I have played over the years but to find a hairpin, for example, on a floor that frankly is blurry and the object resembles a smudge is poor form. Being penalised via having to consult a walkthrough so often for locating objects is not on. On the plus side the story is engaging enough to make you restart again and again and finish it but it feels a chore to 'get through'. The voice acting/recording is atrocious (knowing in the future this becomes its' main selling point) and the dialogue itself is poorly written. After almost no interaction with characters the game finishes with a huge cutscene that wraps it all up with way too much assumption and frankly insults the gamer who has been there all the way by solving the whole thing and saying goodnight with silent credits. Fans of the games NEED to play this one to experience the whole saga but this one cannot have it's age to blame because in its era there were many other adventure games that got this formula right with less frustration.
