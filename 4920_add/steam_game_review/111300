I'm so glad its here on steam.\nI would recommend this for anyone who likes R/C cars or action racing.\nPlus, the driving physics are acctually fairly real for R/C cars (other than the ability to jump on command.)\n\nUpdate:\nFisrt off, if you're using a keyboard and mouse: RIP. You WILL need a controler for this game. Plus, it sucks that you can't set keycommands (or button commands or controler, you can only use the ones that they give you. \nTurns out the just first map is really the best (in terms of build quality.) The rest of the maps have a bunch of \"mystical walls\" or in other works invisible surfaces. With slower cars you don't really have to worry about these, but faster cars are required for certain races. Sometimes when you're flying down a stright-away your car just go flying to one side for no good reason. This can make it impossible to win some races against the OP A.I. with infinite N2O that was put in place for the \"Knockout Races.\nDespite its cartoony look, its very competative game and can be hard to beat with all these glitches.\nI'm still glad they tried to bring it back, but why reinvent the wheel?\nI might still recommmend this game if it goes on sale, but $10 is a f***ing rip-off. (glad I got it on sale.)\nIf you're easily enraged; leave this page now/do not buy. If you don't mind the glitches mentioned, and like R/C cars; just get it when it goes on sale.\n(Sorry for typos, or misspellings, I'm stuck on this race where s*** keeps going wrong, and its p***ing me off.)
