Personally, I am a huge fan of anything Lovecraftian, so I was definitely a sucker for the story this was able to deliver.\n\nNot the best adventure of all time, but the experience boils down to playing in one of the coolest universes mankind has ever thought up, which is quite a redeeming feature in my book and makes me completely oversee flaws like having to do an exceptional amount of leg work to wander around quite obviously scattered hotspots with little ways to interact with the game world in the first place. The investigations and having to come to conclusions by one's own from time to time as well as an inbuilt hint system with up to a dozen hints before the game just simply tells you what to do make all of these flaws more than bearable though and allow this game to be a rough little adventure gem. More than worth the asking price within the Sherlock Holmes collection."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500151926, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504384", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33568427", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198058218515", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1500151826, "num_games_owned": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 412}, "timestamp_updated": 1500151926, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Wow! I really enjoyed this one. The puzzles were at once more challenging and also more realistic than in the previous game, and the addition of the Lovecrafitan elements helped to create a more unique atmosphere. The \"quiz\" system here was also much better, though perhaps more difficult. Highly recommended to fans of adventure games and mysteries."}]}
