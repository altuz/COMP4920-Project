No voice acting, the controls feel stiff, when reloading the character doesn't turn so looks awful.  No damage is shown with enemy attacks.  Enemies are uninspired.  The first level repeats the SAME mission at least 3 times, and then finishes on a slightly different mission (different character name).  This game is just bad. \n\nI'd write a longer review but it doesn't deserve that."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1492459232, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31206294", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197962882733", "num_reviews": 53, "last_played": 1329465600, "num_games_owned": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 77}, "timestamp_updated": 1492459232, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Mediocre twin-stick action that's shallow, repetitive and without substance."}]}
