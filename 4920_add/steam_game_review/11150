Doesn't quite capture the feeling of discovery and accomplishment that comes from putting things together. As it is, Holmes is always one step ahead of the player--which can still make for a great story, but it doesn't really let you have the experience of playing as the great Sherlock Holmes. Fun enough, and worth a playthrough, but between taking what ends up feeling like a very passive role in the story and some quirks of gameplay that end up being rather annoying--particularly in those sections of the game requiring precise timing--it's all a bit of a let down at the end."}]}
