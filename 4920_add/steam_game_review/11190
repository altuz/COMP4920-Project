There's a lot of issues here and there, bugs and some very wierd stuff. Save often, because this game has no autosave feature and it can mess with your file. There's also no steam cloud, so if the save goes, it's gone for good.\n\nThe voiceacting on certain characters and NPC's are really bad and the pacing in some dialogues are wierd. If you have played the other Sherlock Holmes games you will probably recognize some of these wierd but funny shenanigans.\n\nThe story is however really good and exciting to play through if you can overlook some of the problems mentioned. I looked up some characters in the game from Jack the ripper case and I actually found out that they were real suspects in the case, which I though was really cool. The developers obviously did a lot of reseach and I think they manage to capture the creepy dark look of Whitechapel in a good way.\n\nEven if I mentioned some bugs, like clicking on something not always working or required a specific angle, the game overall runs okay. I got 60 fps which was more then I expected from a game released in 2009. It works well on windows 10 from my experience, however I had some framedrops, not sure if that was the game or just on my end, but most of the time I had steady 60 fps. The game is about 10 hours long, depending on how fast you solve the puzzles.\n\nExpect a lot of puzzles and solving in this game. If you have played \"Testament of Sherlock Holmes\" or \"Crimes and Punishment\" you know what im talking about. Some puzzles are easy, others are really tricky and I had to think for a long time or look up the solution. Overall I think they were satifying though and a fun way of progressing the game.\n\n It's a bit too expensive for being so old, therefore I recommend picking it up on sale or in the complete Sherlock Holmes bundle. This game is a mixed bag so I would only recommend it to fans of the series and those who can overlook some problems. If you can do that however I think you will find a tricky detective game following one of the most mysterious and interesting crimes in history. I had fun playing through the game despite the problems, just like the other Sherlock Holmes games."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1495390397, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514371", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31888126", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198040385182", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1422663443, "num_games_owned": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 66}, "timestamp_updated": 1495390397, "received_for_free": false, "review": "You can't get it any better than this.

Since Sherlock Holmes was a contemporary of the Ripper, pairing him with this real life case is a no brainer, and leads to a strong and interesting story, enjoyable for Holmes fans and Ripperologists alike. The characters are all based on real suspects and evidence (with fictionalized conclusions, of course, as the real case has never been solved.) As with each entry thus far in the series, the gameplay is much improved over its predecessors.

The graphic had progressed just enough for the game to have decent look and world having some normal looking life in it. The detective part of the gameplay might be one of the best, if not the best in the series. The story is classic and it remains interesting throughout the whole game.\n\nThe only negative for me is the ending, the decision that Holmes takes instead of the player. I don't buy the rationalization at all. If you agree with it, it will however be a great ending and some reviewers have put that under advantages.\n\nEdit: I have to add one more negative. There is a saving bug and from what I read online there is no solution. Sometimes you will not be able to save the game anymore. You have to restart the game and resume from the last save.
