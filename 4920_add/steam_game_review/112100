I've enjoyed the first 40 hours, and not really sure why.\n\nPros: Dunno, but I enjoy it\nTONS of story\nTONS of side quests you complete at the same time as main\nI enjoyed making \"black squares light up\" (Exploration)\n\nCons:\nEverything is TINY and no zoom\nNo camera rotation\nCombat is brain-dead simple 95% of attacks are base attacks, 5% are AoE (that you can *rarely* cast)\nDue to very few skills, and all be on extremely long cooldowns, combat can't get any more complex than that.\nReally hard to find where side quests start\nGoing back to the exact same place over and over is... tedius\nNeed to increase runspeed when out of combat... one quest had me run across two zones JUST to read a wall to run across two more zones (Absolutely no combat until the end)\nAfter lvl 25... I just stopped doing sidequests... ready for the ending.\n\nI think I got this game for $2 and was pleasantly surprised.  But... you *really* have to be in the mood for oldschool... or you'll hate it."}]}
