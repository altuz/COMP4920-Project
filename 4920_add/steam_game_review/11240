If you never thought about buying this, you'll be very fine without owning the game :)  Short sum-up at the end, please refer to that to decide if this is a game for you at all.\n\n\nThe game is a really nice trading game - buy cheap, travel, sell expensive. Alternative money income is picking up the scattered boxes and selling it's contents (Value scales with time) or doing bounty hunter missions.\n\nThe trading itself is pretty simple, easy to get into, easy to organize and I have to be honest, fun. Reminded me of the old isometric Spells of Gold, where your income source was trading, and you expanded your trade (and your character skills) from the money. Here we have the growing trading parts, but sadly it lacks other progression. Buy more inventory space, then just haggle with the goods ; sidequests are either get X amounts of Y items, or kill someone - which is a bounty mission again.\n\nThe bounty missions sadly always start with just a pistol (regardless of your money) and take place on ~5 different map. It's charmingly broken in it's early 2000's ways, like a badly done Quake III ripoff. Aiming is bad, AI is horrible, there are pistol-SMG-assault rifle-shotgun weapons but you literally need nothing but the rifle. The map has respawning armor and healing items, and I think the enemies can pick them up, but they won't really go for it - so you can just stand on the armor, get max, go and shoot some enemies then go back and wait to heal/rearmor to max. Like I said, charmingly broken system, but works. And if you're shameless enough to abuse it, it's even easy.\n\nThe best thing in the game in my opinion were the sidequests, and *some* characters. There's no story of yours, but you can help a robot uprising to make them free, find a wizard (!), save Lieutenant Dan, a french robot cause reasons, Terminator references and have some pretty sly 4th wall breakings. These were pretty well done, and weirdly enough feels the most homogenous, good quality content of the game.\n\nSo to sum it up: Nice trading system in my opinion. Retro-ish, broken, half-assed and abusable but kind of stylish FPS missions, good references (and like 15-20 character alltogether, somewhat ridiculous how many modells are re-re-reused)...  But it oozes the 2000's FPS game's cheeziness and I really liked it for it (Somewhat like Chrome) . If you never played those games in that era, the game will likely be just trash for you, don't get baited by it's usual 0.5$ price.\n Maybe starting devs could check this out?[spoiler] Looks fairly minimal, somewhat akin to recent Unity games, but it has an idea, cohesive game made up by simple elements, this could teach a little about how to use basic things to get something that's more than the elements themselves.
