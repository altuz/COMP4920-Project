It is surprisingly granular in that you can set maximum ranges at which your units will attack enemies, how aggressive they are, call reinforcements. The camera seems fairly powerful with a zoom in zoom out, full rotation. This seems to be the kind of game where you have a collection of scenarios with set forces and must accomplish the objectives. It is not a build additional pylons, not enough minerals, make a 4 gateway rush kind of real time strategy. The user interface works, but it is awfully complex, and the number of keybinds around is rather overwhelming. The engine feels very dated even when controlling units from a high distance. However units seem to behave correctly in terms of speed and maneuvrability to what you would expect them to do historically and everything seems to be to scale which is relatively impressive. All in all I have missed my chance to enjoy this product when it was at its prime and I do not think I want to pay into the effort/reward scale to get entertainment out of it in this day and age. Removing from Library for declutter."}]}
