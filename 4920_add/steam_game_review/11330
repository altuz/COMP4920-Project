You need to cut chains to allow physics to move balls through pendullum over to a bowl. Each chain needs to be selected first before being cut which is an extra clunky step that messes all the timing and the flow of the game. Especially compared to a swype on a touch screen. The game has made some decent effort in providing a varied musical soundscape to vary the flavor of the levels but the recording is sibilant and pierces the ear. Also the sound effects themselves are extremely poor and will definitely drive you mad as the obnoxious chimes of failure ring everytime the ball fails to land in the pot. The visuals are extremely 2D flat mobile technology from yesteryear. Even the color palettes are a little bit on the drab side. The physics is not the most convincing either, you do not have the feeling that you are dealing with a marble or something physical."}]}
