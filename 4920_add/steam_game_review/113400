Only after my first message to their support which contains the asking of why this was done, they have replied to it with an undefined reason.\n\nConcerning this, i had given a detailed presentation of all facts and circumstances with letters (under email *******@***). As result of this explanations follows that a misuse of my account mentioned above has not taken place.\n\nThe publisher, however, have not responded to the statements of mine in any way, \nbut only sent two emails, which have all the identical wording, so in all probability, they were not created individually, but only automatically. With regard to this, is has even to be feared that they have not at all taken into account the informations of mine.\n\nNeither i myself has used my account in an abusive or otherwise illegal manner nor has this been done by a third person.\n\nTheir Terms of Service provide the closing or any other sanction only with regard to an account, that means only when illegal behaviour has been realized via a special account.

The overall concept behind this game and the competitive aspect is AMAZING. I love it. \n\nThe customization you can do in this game is something I have never seen nowhere else. EVERYONE can be unique in their way, you can literally customize any piece of clothings and cars you have, and there are PLENTY of clothes available.\n\nThe missions are repetitive but they're still very enjoyable. Some maps can give an advantage to an opposite team, but that's not the biggest issue.\n\nEvery gun classes has their pros and cons, and each of them can be used in different situations. Heck, even the different classes of grenades have different uses. \n\nYou can put \"perks\" for your character and your gun which will give you some bonuses-maluses depending on what you prefer. \n\nNow that this has been said...\n\nGamersFirst is a really shit company that doesn't care about either its playerbase neither their game in general. Their goal is to make as much money as possible while you're still playing their fucking game until you're out of it.\n\nEach and every time they release a new weapon it will most certainly be incredibly unbalanced for at least 4-5 months, so that the players will be so tempted to buy the damn gun. Buying guns permanently in this game costs A LOT of money, and it's even more retardedly expensive if you want it on more than one character. Oh, and since it's a new gun you'll have to pay some more.\n\nThe matchmaking system is retarded. If you're gold, most of the time the servers will force you to go in a gold server but nobody plays in those, so they either go in silver servers and ruin silver's days OR they derank on purpose so they don't have to deal with that. That is, until they win a lot of games because they're obviously much better than actual silvers so they rank up to gold again, so they want to derank... You can easily see why it can become a major issue in the meta.\n\nSome missions are very unfair to one of the team. Depending on the mission, sometimes the enforcers are way way in favor, and vice versa.\n\nOh and the anti-cheat system. It can take a while before it does something and sometimes it can ban people that weren't cheating. Meanwhile there's a retard teleporting everywhere and plowing everyone in the server.\n\nHonestly, I think the concept is so beautiful and could be so much better. I'm waiting for another company or group of people to steal APB's main concept and actually put their love and soul into a new game that will be better than this one.\n\nGamersFirst.

The other 30% are guns, you can also buy with \"Joker-Tickets\" (which is just a pure daily mission grindfest).\nOther things you can buy with money in this game, are just pure cosmetics, better cars, more customization options and stuff like that. Nothing that would actually boost your combat effectiveness.\nSo it's actually \"Pay2GrindLess\" or even \"Pay2Enjoy\" since buying a premium subscription gives you an additional 125% boost (wtf) to the money you gain after each match.\nThe only reason I can think of why people say it's pay2win is because they suffer from shit matchmaking and get thrown to way more experienced players who are willing to spend 35 bucks for those awesome weapon reskins.\n\nThe idea and the concept are really good and this game WOULD be fun if there wasn't all the issues I listed above."}, {"votes_down": 4,

customisation system, and variety, however, unfortunatly, very poorly executed, in a nutshell, it's a Pay 2 Win GTA-Style MMO that had great potential, but it went down the drain, it's a very fun game for the first few hours you play it, but as the missions spiral on, you start to see the problems seep in through the cracks...\n1. As a free player myself, i've noticed it's extremely hard to get anything you want that is upper-class without upgrading to a premium account or using real money.\n\n2. The whole \"Cops vs Criminals\" thing is broken, the Enforcers cannot make any worthwhile cash if the Criminals don't ready up for a mission, and because of this, there are some desperate Enforcers i've encountered that have begged the Criminals to ready up on low-pop areas, and most of the time nothing will happen, and they get to the point where they actively try to instigate a mission by following you and waiting for you to do something they can use as a means to dispatch against you, and the Criminals are usually grinding for something expensive, as to why they aren't wanting to go on a mission, so if you don't notice one, you'll lose all your money and progress from that 40 minutes of grinding if they kill you. And the Criminals can't do anything about it\n\n3. Another point on Paragragh one, the P2W aspect is a catastrophic problem in matchmaking, even on high-pop areas, the game doesen't effectively balance matches even in mission areas, where it's sorted via skill compatability, not availability, and yet my friends and I (Bronze to Silver threat levels) get frequently put up against Gold-Tier Enforcers, who are either Wallet Warriors, or people who sweat so hard over the game it's not fun.\nAlso it's kind of ironic seeing that the company who made a Pay-2-Win game is called \"GamersFirst\".\nMore Like MoneyFirst.\n\n4.5/10. \n\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1487115809, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29930970", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066727709", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1353225600, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 118}, "timestamp_updated": 1487115809, "received_for_free": false, "review": "no"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486146669, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502082", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "29675063", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198018723766", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1501478114, "num_games_owned": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 264865}, "timestamp_updated": 1486148026, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Would be worth playing if the engine upgrade actually happened in 2013.
