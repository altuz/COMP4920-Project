I think most of the negative reviews are pretty unfair and are coming from people who miss the original development team (from what i've read) but as a newcomer the game has tons to offer. It isn't that hard to get the hang of even though the controls are a little unusual and take a bit of getting used to when you start (even after adjusting them more to your own liking). My number 1 complaint is that you cant go into water at all, and if you try to hop over it and miss you'll get stuck and have to suicide to the nearest clone-pod-thing. \n\nThere is an abundance of crafting materials and things to craft, lots of skills and a nice leveling/expirience system, and enemies and crafting materials respawn frequently making it easy to farm and level in populated areas.  So far it seems only the begining/main story line had voice acting, so theres a lot of reading but that isn't really a big deal. Running around the world  you'll see tons of other quests you can pick up along the way which so far for me have been easy to understand and complete. \n\nThis game isn't life-changing or anything, but I can definately see myself sinking a good chunk of time into it, and from what i've read/seen the map is pretty huge. If you're debating playing because of the negative reviews you should ignore them and download anyways.
