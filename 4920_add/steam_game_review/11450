I recommend getting this game with the raising hell dlc because at the end of the game you will want more (plus the raising hell dlc is basically paying for the proper ending with another 6 hours of gameplay) So first of all, one of the unique things about this game is being able to control an army of minions that will kill and destroy things for you. All of the minions have a special attributes (except for the browns, besides them being the strongest of your minions) The reds will get rid of fire that may be blocking the path or stopping your minions from grabbing an item without dying. The greens can get rid of toxic gas that some plants emit and are also resistant to poison (the reds are resistant to fire) And The blues are the only minion that won't drown in water. This game will allow you to hold up to 50 minions at max which doesn't sound like a whole lot but it is. The combat is one of this games strengths, usually when you are about to be put into a difficult fight, it is best to strategize about what you are going to do with your minions, you can place some in a certain area to jump on your enemy and some other minions near that position to fire fireballs at the enemy, there are many ways to go about a fight I just named a simple example  (all of the minions have a different fight style, forgot to mention this earlier, reds can fire fireballs at enemies and when there are a lot of reds it will definetly do a number on your enemy, blues use magic and are the weakest of your minions, they also revive dead minions, greens like jumping onto enemies so they can attack them without the enemy being able to do anything about it and browns are your strongest fighters, doing the most melee damage and just running straight at the enemy) Items dropped by your enemies or items found in boxes, your minions can pick up to become stronger, like pieces of armor and weapons. Items your minions can pick up will usually have a shine on them and when you sweep your minions across it one will pick it up, when a minion picks up a item this will increase your minions horde power which just makes your minions stronger. You can also control your minions and move them around to get to switches that you may not be able to. At this point, you may think that I have talked a little too much about minions and that is because a lot of the game focuses on them and is what makes this game unique.\n\nNow some other things rather than minions. This game allows you to customize your tower (Your base) You can forge different types of armor and use your minions to upgrade parts of it like defense and max health, you can also forge weapons and just like with your armor you can use your minions to upgrade damage and knockback ect. the games story is decent, nothing really special, not a lot of the voice acting is good, a bit cheesy but that is mainly from smaller npcs, most of the main npcs have better voice acting like gnarl and some others I guess. The minions are cool, they act and sound like what you would expect them to. The game does get a little annoying closer to the end and the final boss isn't amazing but is still fun. The ending isn't great either so buy the raising hell dlc to get the \"proper ending.\" Welp that is about it, if you skipped to the bottom of this review all I have to say is buy this game and buy the dlc and you will have a great time.

This game has so much to offer for fans of any game genre in my opinion. It is very reminiscent of the gameplay of Pikmin but with a dark humor attatched. It's a charming game with occasional puzzles, Real time strategy feel. I'm someone that really enjoys the feel of numbers going up in a game and this definitely fits that need. You expand your health, Your mana, Your hoard size and even the strength of your hoard has an indication of it's always increasing numbers. Outfitting your minions with equipment they find whether it be a weapon or armor is really fun. Sometimes I spend about ten minutes just thrashing around a town trying to see if any of my minions want any of the loot that drops. When you first start the game you definitely have the feeling of being vulnerable. Your numbers are low and your minions could die if hit right by a rock. As you advance however you quickly grip how powerful you are getting. With your armor and weapons forged specifically for you as the overlord you can make them to fit your needs. Lets talk about minion typings. You start with the brown minions, These are your basic units but are very good with combat. You then have your reds, These are your \"archers\" They throw fireballs at enemies in range and are very much useful when setting up combat strategies. They also have the ability to absorb fire which occasionally will block your path. We then have the green minions, Basically rogue/assassin minions. They take advantage of an enemies weakness and jump on their back stabbing until dead. Like the reds these greens absorb poisonous obstacles(Personally my favorite minion type). We finally have the blues, If you've played any RPG these guys are the mage or white mage more specifically. They have the ability to revive your fallen minions within a certain time limit within it's death (Altho i've had minions die out of the blues reach). The blues are capable of swimming which no other minions can do. These powers make the blues very very useful in my opinion. I wouldn't travel with a large amount of them because they are incredibly weak unless dealing with something they happen to overpower which doesn't feel as often as it should be.\nLet's talk about the graphics. I'm not a stickler for graphics so for me the appearance doesn't degrade the game for me at all. However age has not been kind to this game. The environments are still very pretty don't get me wrong. But your overlords bare arm looks like a bent raw hotdog. I would love to see this game get an HD remake because it really is a great game. I can just see the looks pushing people away from it.\nI really can't think of an negatives for this game, I'm just an optimistic person, So for me I can't nitpick it to pieces and give this \"professional\" Over look on it. Plus every complaint you could probably make on this game more than likely were fixed in the sequel.\nTo me this game is a 7/10 easily. I enjoy the Pikmin play style. Heck I got Overlord BECAUSE It's very much like Pikmin. Hopefully this has helped you with whether you want to get the game or not. You should give it a try though! It's a relatively cheap game these days. It deserves more light to be honest."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501974724, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34048443", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198214414663", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1503268374, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1489}, "timestamp_updated": 1501974724, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's just as I remember from when I played on the XBox, ages ago - charming (frustrating) bugs and all. I've also convinced my wife to give it a go, which has served to remind me of just how quickly and extremely the difficulty spikes. Melvin will probably always be the hardest boss in the game.\n\nFor anyone who's never played before, please do. It's a quirky and loveable game that pokes fun at basically everything, from Fable's moral choice system (in this game, you can choose be evil or completely despicable) to the haughtiness of \"high fantasy.\" But it stands on its own merit, and isn't just \"a good piece of satire\" - it's good. Period. The controls make sense, and even though you you have to work to get control of the camera, the camera also is usually good about pointing the right way for the situation. As mentioned above, there are some bugs that could've been worked out. Occasionally a minion will manage to get caught inside a wall or something and your only choice is to leave the area or continue on without the minion.\n\nIt does seem strange to me that there are no achievements, since I know Steam does those. But that's a rather minor complaint to make."}]}
