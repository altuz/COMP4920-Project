Couple years passed and I forgot all about it and I rediscovered it on GOG and I bought a copy there, now I bought it on Steam, I even have a physical copy of the game IRL now cause I don't wanna lose my memorys of this game. Basically the game has a sentimental value to me so my review is biased but basically this is the 1st ever Men of War's game that got released in 2004. The game was supposed to be a test or a demo, luckily they saw that the project was successful due to the game being technologically and in graphics ahead of it's time, the game is fantastic cause it's basically like the old Commandos game where you only have couple of soldiers to defeat the whole German army on each map and depending on the 4 campaigns you will fight different enemys such as Soviets, British, Germans and Americans. They sold their game engine to a new company who started spamming Men of war assault sqaud 1/2, and other DLC games but the newest successors that are coming out are Gates of Hell and Soldiers: Arena. These 2 games are being made by the original developers, and if you go check out Soliders: Arena then you'll see that they are using exact unit copys of the 1st game and the games logo + a little teaser of how they turned the old game units into our todays and modern graphics. My only downside to Soliders: Arena is that it's gonna be Free 2 Play, I'm not against that but the game might die quickly due to having Pay 2 Win elements in it so because of that I'm looking forward to Gates of Hell."}]}
