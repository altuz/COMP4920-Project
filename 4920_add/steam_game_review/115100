A traditional turn based RPG with a Halloween concept and smart writing, Costume Quest is perfect for all ages. This game comes with a free DLC called Grubbins on Ice.\n\n[b][u]Story[/u][/b]\n\nDepending on who you choose, you play as either Reynold or Wren. The twins are hyped to go out and trick-or-treat but a monster ends mistaking one of the siblings as a large piece of candy and kidnaps the child. With the help of a cat(?) who may or may not have given your character special powers through his/her costume, your character goes off on a quest to save his/her sibling with friends he/she makes on the way, and maybe, in the process of doing so, end up saving Halloween.\n\nCostume Quest's story is fairly adequate but it is bolstered by stellar writing filled to the brim with traditional Double Fine humour. Expect to chuckle often while playing this game.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]\n\nCostume Quest is a turn based RPG lite. It's very simplistic in execution, and gets the job done. Do not expect huge skill trees or deep mechanics - there are none in this game. You can do additional damage or reduce damage taken by doing QTEs with very generous timings, and you have 'Battle Stamps' that give you passive bonuses like dealing additional damage. Your characters are also healed automatically after every battle. There are no random encounters in this game (aside from the monsters that you encounter while trick-or-treating). Costume Quest has boss battles that are quite fun indeed.\n\nOutside of combat, you play in fixed camera hub worlds, trick-or-treating at various houses or bashing various environmental objects to get candy. You can use candy to buy new Battle Stamps to make your character even stronger, however, each character is only allowed to equip one Battle Stamp at a time. After you trick-or-treat all the houses in a given hub, you are allowed to pass through the Monster Gate that blocks your progress to the next hub and this repeats several times till you reach the end of the game.\n\nEach costume your characters wear provide them with various powers in battle. The Statue of Liberty costume plays a traditional healer role while the Space Warrior is a pure melee character. Some of your costumes also have environmental effects - the main character can use the Shield ability to block falling debris while wearing the Knight Costume, while the Robot costume can allow you to quickly Boost yourself so that you can dash around through the environment. You'll need your costumes to not only fight, but also make it through the various obstacles you encounter in each hub, all the while collecting candy and Creepy Treat cards, doing quests, and finding various pieces of costumes that will help you in your adventure.\n\nThis is a very easy game, and one should expect a playthrough to be between 4-6 hours. The additional DLC chapter, Grubbins on Ice, is another hour or two of gameplay.\n\n[b][u]Visuals[/u][/b]\n\nCostume Quest has a very charming art style and is definitely easy on the eyes. The small scenes that precede battes where your character transforms into a giant sized, realized version of the costume he/she is wearing is really good and well animated. \n\nHowever, the game doesn't run all that well technically. It's sufficient but a game like this shouldn't be having difficulties running at a solid 30 or 60 FPS. There are bits of slowdown, most noticeably in the scene where you are trick-or-treating. This is not a big deal in battles, fortunately.\n\n[b][u]Audio[/u][/b]\n\nOn the aural front, Costume Quest is not a winner. None of the music in this game is memorable or even good.  I can't comment on the voice acting in this game because it has none. Sound effects do their job.\n\n[b][u]Overall[/u][/b]\n\nCostume Quest is a must-play, fun game that is perfectly paced - just before the signs of repetition even kick in, the game ends. Clever writing and tons of heart make this game perfect for every age. If you see this game on sale, be sure to snap it up. My only regret is I didn't play this game on Halloween. Oh well. \n\n[b][u]Note to Prospective Buyers[/u][/b]\n\nThe game was an ~600 MB download on Steam. \n\nCostume Quest works on Windows 10. Word of caution : DO NOT ALT+TAB OUT OF THIS GAME; Alt+Tab will result in a crash, almost always.\n\nCostume Quest has Steam Trading Cards.\n\nPRO TIP : You can skip the short scene that plays when you get into a battle by pressing Shift.\n\n[b][u]Note to Achievement Hunters[/u][/b]\n\nThis game is very easy to 100%, and you can do so in a single playthrough."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506165978, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35150937", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198056837040", "num_reviews": 44, "last_played": 1506165655, "num_games_owned": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 158, "playtime_forever": 498}, "timestamp_updated": 1506165978, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I finished both the main game and the Grubbins on Ice DLC in about 8 hours. The game is fun, the theme is great, the humour is typical Double-Fine (which means good, in my book!). There are RPG elements and some sorts of enigmas that you need to solve in order to advance the story (mainly: using the special ability of your costumes in certain parts of the maps). \n\nI would recommend playing Costume Quest, but there are some shortcomings. Mainly, combat. Combat is repetitive and after a while it's not challenging (once you equip the right battle stamps and you use the most powerful costumes, you beat every enemy in the blink of an eye). At a certain point I wish I could skip combats... Also, I would have appreciated some teleport ability in order to move faster across maps and within maps (otherwise the only choice you have is skating with the robot costume, and you end up always using that costume in combat).\n\nStill, it's a few hours of fun, you won't regret playing it!!!"}]}
