A Baron comes to collect on a debt of the Blackmore family, leaving only little Charlie and his mother. Charlie goes to try try and save them. The idea of the game is you start with the smallest character and stack it inside the next smallest and so on until you get to the largest. Each character you stack in has a unique quality that can be used to solve each of the quest puzzles and move to the next puzzle and ultimately the next area. There are 5 levels to go through and a bonus level called The Lost Hobo King. Each level has something called hijinks in which certain characters to something to other characters and a specific character in the game, though you don't need to do these to beat the game.\n\nI thought it was pretty amazing how each level looked, how each of the characters looked, and how many different characters and unique traits they have. Game was fun, funny, and challeneging. I thought the game was a chalenge of 6 out of 10 but 10 out of 10 if you are trying to get all of the achievements. Pretty amazing little game."}]}
