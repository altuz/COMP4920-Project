This game's stakes were much higher and it kept me intrested.\n\nAs for James himself, while he acts tough and edgy like Alex in the first game which I didn't like, as the game progressed, James slowly become more angry, violent, and even more edgier then Alex was in the orignal, when he lost Father Luis Guerra, he was cyring, and then rushing to leave after finding important infomation, but before leaving, he takes one last look at Father upset, then left, James has a massive range of emotions that Alex lacked in the last game, meanwhile in the orignal Alex always acted edgy from the start and pretty much stayed the same.\n\nAlso Alex turning evil isn't explained well, which is the only downside I can think off.\n\n[b] Holy hell, the city/map is a million times better then the orignal [/b]\n\nMy biggest issue in the first game was the city, it lacked colour, the structure was boring, everything looked the same, no memorable landmarks, and the peds did nothing except walk and drive. Honestly New York in the orignal was the worst city I've ever played in any game ever.\n\nHowever this game improves the map IN EVERY SINGLE WAY POSSIBLE!\n\nWe have 3 Zones, the Yellow Zone which you start in is an area filled with refugee camps, slums, old apartment buildings, very little amount of vehicles, people wearing masks coughing and being in pain, people hanging out on roofs and around fires in barrels, people in line to escape the yellow zone while being tested for infection, people in Hazmats treating them and others testing them.\nThen we have the Green Zone which is the safest zone, full of cars, your average Joe walking around, bums and drunks sleeping against walls, Blackwatch Propaganda on the walls and with tons of electric lights all over.\nThen we have the Red Zone, we have giant infected fleshy towers latching onto crumbling buildings, with Zombies below running around, suffering and eating the flesh of the dead, smoke filling the air, with the fires of the Dead Zone in the distance, with Survivors on roofs in the south, with some being on the ground level with hungry Zombies.\n\nI LOVE THIS MAP! It's full of life, detail and colour, a massive imrprovement from the orignal with some memorable zones like the Church, security checkzones, the leftover bridges from bomb attacks, and the infected covered towers in the red zone.\n\n[b] New Powers and enemies[/b]\n\nPrototype 2 has some new toys for you to play with and beat up! But I won't spoil them!\n\n[b] Improved Stealth system that is used a lot! [/b]\n\nThe first game had stealth, but it was never used except for once, now this game does stealth a lot more and it's a welcome change of pace.\n\n[b] Overall just as fun as the orignal [/b]\n\nThe best bit about the orignal was how fun it was, this sequel keeps that tradition and is very addicting!\n\n\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\n[b] The glitches [/b]\n\nThis is the biggest reason why this game has a mixed rating, it has some nasty bugs, which can be fixed, the most infamous one is with the mission Flytrap where you can't finish it, however it can be fixed, I fixed it myself by changing how the game used my CPUs in task master during the mission, then changed it back to normal when I finished the mission.\n\nThere are other glitches like game crashes, but they were few and far between (Well to me anyways)\n\n[b] If you liked Alex in the orignal, you might hate this game [/b]\n\n2nd biggest reason why this game has a mixed review, Alex was likeable in the orignal and was the hero, now he is the villain for this game for no real reason, and you do end up killing him... however funny thing is, in this game, HE IS EVEN EDGIER THEN IN THE ORIGNAL... HOW DID THEY DO THAT?\n\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\n\nIf you can fix the major bugs yourself like I did, you got yourself a fantastic sequel that trumps the orignal in every single way... well except for optimisation and bug fixes... but Prototype 2 is the better game overall, it fixes so much what the orignal struggled with and made it awesome!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505095038, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491087", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34874852", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198063920595", "num_reviews": 102, "last_played": 1439432991, "num_games_owned": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 898}, "timestamp_updated": 1505095038, "received_for_free": false, "review": "As of 9/10/2017 there seem to be some bugs with Windows 10.

love this game, I remember back when I played it on ps3 I thought it was fantastic, but I could never get the hang around to it in order to finish the actual thing, not really sure why, I guess some personal problems or something.\n\nEither way, there's much to love here, the game oozes character even in it's upgrade menu, which have plenty of different upgrades that turn you into an overpowered killing machine, the game it's also absurdly violent and \"gory\" with blood, dismemberment, and pieces of enemies flying all around, consuming enemies which serves as an ability to also absorb their physical appearance it's among one of the coolest abilities in recent videogames in my book.\n\nThey also added a new \"stealth\" sort of mechanism this time around, it's fairly simple, you get the ability to steal someone's appearance, say a soldier or a doctor, and then repeatedly keep doing the same, it never gets repetitive tho, and really all you have to be concerned about it's finding the one character that isn't being \"watched\" by other enemies, you do this by activating some sort of view it's called \"mutation view\" or something like that, essentially highlighting the one enemies that you can't consume in red, while the ones you can in yellow.\n\nIt's incredibly simple but also immensely satisfying to use.\n\nThen there's the overall combat and the powers, which feel amazing, I don't think I had this much fun in destroying things in a videogame since Hulk: Ultimate Destruction way back for the Ps2, and GameCube, it's enjoyable to jump on top of a tank to shred a rocket launcher and then use it against other vehicles, it's fun to slice your enemies into pieces while you watch the floor getting covered in absurdly vast amount of blood, it's liberating to traverse the map gliding through it like some sort of monstrous squirrel.\n\nIt's hilarious to jump in front of a chopper miles away from you only to then use one of your powers to \"tie it up\" with a series of mutated tentacles that then proceed to \"pull\" everything around it and smash it against it, making it explode in hundreds of pieces.\n\nThen there's the story, which is incredibly \"cheesy\" but I love it for it, I think if you understand what the story is, and you take it for what it is, then everything will be fine for you and you'll almost certainly enjoy everything about it, but if you're expecting something sincere, personal, deep, and emotive, then you're simply going to end up feeling disappointed.\n\nThe main character in the game James Heller might as well be one of the funniest characters in any game, every sentence that comes out of his mouth needs to be shared with curses, and an incredibly deep tone of voice.\n\nIt's hilarious.\n\nIn regards to the pc port it goes like this.\n\nMy specs:\n\nGtx 970\nI5 6600k\n24gb of ram\n\nNothing it's overclocked, nothing it's changed, everything it's kept up to date in relation to drivers and software updates, stuff of the sort.\n\nI (so far) haven't experienced any problems whatsoever in the game, at one point you get an ability that it's called \"devastator\" or something like that, essentially what it does is that it makes your character \"explode\" sending countless of enemies, vehicles, and structures flying around him, only to then proceed to shoot out of his body a series of \"tentacles\" of sorts, tying up every nearby enemy, vehicle, and structure around them, making them explode into thousands of bloody, rocky, and separate, pieces.\n\nThe framerate never dropped with everything at the highest setting, below 60fps at 1080p.\n\nNow that's not to say that if people are having problems with the pc port of the game, those problems don't exist, this is simply to point out, that so far, IN MY PLAYTHROUGH, I haven't encountered anything alike.\n\nBesides a poor texture quality, and overall relatively \"bad\" image quality in comparison to games that came out around that time, I haven't really experienced anything like technical problems, and really I\u2019m not even that bothered by how the game looks, it looks, and plays, so far, for me, like the best version of the game available in the three platforms, the textures look sharp, even if they're not necessarily the most detailed, the performance it's perfect, even if I do use vsync and my framerate it's locked at my monitor refresh rate, and overall, generally, it looks fine, and detailed, even if I\u2019m only playing at 1080p.\n\nDefinitely recommend it, just take it for what it is, don't expect the freaking thing to satisfy you in every way.\n"}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504641076, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503755",
