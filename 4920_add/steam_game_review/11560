working.\n\n[u]Summary[/u]\nMaelstrom: The Battle for Earth Begins is a Real-Time Strategy/Third-Person Shooter hybrid developed by KD-Vision Games in Russia, published by Codemasters, and released in 2007.\nThe game takes place in 2057 where corporations rose to power and caused a nuclear war.\nThe resulting climate change has rendered much of the planet inhospitable to human life.\nWithin this chaos, three forces battle out for control of the Earth.\n\nThe Remnants are the rebel forces of those who still fight for freedom and justice.\nTheir structures and units are relatively weak but are cheap and quick to build.\nTheir heroes are James Buchanan, Marcus O'Neil, and Sasha Antonova.\n[b]Tip: Focus on building as many units as you can before the enemy finds you.[/b]\n\nThe Ascension are an imperialistic collective of corporations ruled by Arlan Khan.\nTheir structures and units are costly and slow to build but compensate with raw power.\nTheir heroes are Maxamillian Khan, Dr. Kie Fujishima, and the AK-RD.\n[b]Tip: Use Manipulators to terraform barriers to protect yourself while you build.[/b]\n\nThe Hai-Genti are an alien race that seeks to conquer Earth after destroying their homeworld.\nTheir structures and units are all specialized for different roles but depend heavily on water.\nTheir heroes are Mammon, Auriga, and the Psyclade.\n[b]Tip: Prioritize what to build based on the situation and flood as much of the map as you can.[/b]\n\n[u]Pros[/u]\nThe game features two unique mechanics known as terraforming and weather control, which allow players to transform entire maps at will, provided they have enough resources.\nThe voice acting is fairly decent, although the Hai-Genti unit voices are rather annoying.\nIf you click on any of the heroes enough times, they'll make sassy remarks at the player.\nIt has an original story and all of the characters are quite memorable.\n\n[u]Cons[/u]\nAs one might expect from a game made in 2007, its graphics are significantly outdated and the CD version is incompatible with any operating systems made after Windows 95/XP/Vista.\nThe Steam version is merely a bypass to this incompatibility, but there are consequences.\nThere are two crippling bugs that cause the game to crash consistently.\nThese bugs occur at random and there's no autosave, so if you get this game, [b]SAVE OFTEN[/b].\n\nThe first bug occurs between transitions such as loading screens and cutscenes.\nThe game will freeze and any audio playing at that moment will skip like a broken record.\n\nThe second bug occurs during gameplay, especially when using the Third-Person mechanic.\nThe game will suddenly stop and exit automatically without any notification.\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\nThere's not much to say about this game, it's really fun but time has left it on life support.\nKDV Games is defunct and Codemasters disowned the game by taking it off their website.\nBecause of this, this game is abandonware, which means anyone has the opportunity to remaster it and breathe life back into the series, especially since its ending suggests a sequel."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english",

I feel that it has lost in some of the most basic elements of an RTS.  Whether this is a result of lack of polish or overemphasis on a few key features, the result is a game that just feels weak.  Leaving aside cinematics, vocals and dialog, from the very beginning, the command UI feels frustrating.  There is no feeling of control over an engagement; your infantry will wander around and do whatever they want.  They'll watch complacently while a teammate is mowed down five feet away, and one guy will take a jog around three sides of a building to rejoin the squad after you moved them to an adjacent corner.  Any attempt at strategy is pointless, and blobbing soldiers is really the only thing you can do.  The game's age isn't an excuse; there are many games much older than this one that have better playability.
