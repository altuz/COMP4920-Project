Before looking at my 33hours on record and thinking i didn't play the game enough i probably have around 2K hours on the SEA server so trust me i played more then enough of this game and i can say without doubt the game is just dead at this point. They bsaically reworked the entire game to where only late game matters after you reach max level and by the time this review is posted max level is 93 so around lvl1 to 93 is just a grind fest and with the game being already pretty much dead most likely its going to be a solo grind then with actual players. Getting partys for raids and such is so hard if your new basically if your new and looking for a mmo game dont bother with this its not new user friendly at all you will feel you are playing a solo game until you reach max level and get good gear. \n3 years ago : HELL YEAH PLAY THIS GAME so much fun doing nests ( 4 man really hard dungeouns ) and dragon nests ( 8man raid ) just do main quests / side quests or grind up with party members \ntoday : solo grind to 93. find a way to obtain good gear somehow. try to find a party or guild to do raids with ( too much hassle and pain not worth it anymore )"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1488258476, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500205", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "30234153", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198170343429", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1481750086, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 13359}, "timestamp_updated": 1488258630, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Hi, I'm an adventurer of indisclosed gender who randomly came upon a village one day and decided to save a girl I've met only once while she was being chased by a harpy. On the way to being savior of the world I killed every single one of the people dear to me by miraculously trusting the hidden villain 10 times out of 10. \n\nBut I got a cool weapon from this dragon I killed and it's all okay.\n\nI used to give crap to Argenta for verbally abusing me every minute she sees me but she really is right. I am an utterly incompetent fool. I run around making bigger messes of everything, messes that often require one or another npc's life to clean up.\n\nBut in all seriousness, DN is a decent game.\n\nIt's a fun time waster. The battle system is fun and I didn't mind the grind (which, compared to some of the mmorpgs I've played in the past, wasn't really difficult at all. When I picked it back up I made cap on my legacy whatever char in 3 days and the other one hit 90s in a week, I wasn't even playing nonstop). I got bored eventually because I didn't really feel committed. And as for the story, well. I guess it's interesting, I was intrigued enough to follow it despite having to run the same 3 dungeons on repeat for each part (honestly, who decides to live in a place constantly infected with monstrocities and decide not to move?) But I was really serious when I say the PC is literally the stupidest, most gullible person alive. The main quest is always the shady person out of the cast of the characters asking you to fetch some god awful, powerful evil device for \"good\" and the pc shrugging and saying \"Why not? What harm could you possibly do with it, guy I just met yesterday?\" \n\nTldr; If you like the battle system and don't mind playing it like a solo player (because just about everything except hardcore endgame content is doable alone if you have enough time and skill), then this is great. If you are expecting a welcome community, this isn't for you. If not for having friends that asked me to play this game with them I could probably go from level 1 to cap without talking to a single soul and that's something most people (me included) is not prepared to do."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485136608, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499398", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29434882", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198080474267", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1488320964, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2120}, "timestamp_updated": 1485136608, "received_for_free": false, "review": "when me and my friends were little this game was fun and challanging and you felt good going through dungeons. now it's far to simple untill endgame and I'm kinda sad because i really loved playing this game when you didn't charge through the lvls and got to actually play the game. other than that it's really a good game and very enjoyable."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1488051749, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499762", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30176055", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079894110", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1492554012, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 86}, "timestamp_updated": 1488051749, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Issues when downloading the patch.
