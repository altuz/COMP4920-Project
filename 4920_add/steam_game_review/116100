I enjoyed the game a lot. It delivered the toy car feeling quite well, almost reminded me a bit of revolt (if anyone remembers that game) the racing was fun and the elmination mode was cool. Graphically the game was nice as well. However the gameplay was almost clunky at best, the drifting as well as the rest of the stat balancing for each car was not done too well. If I was using a car with high drift and High Handling it should operate like a dream when racing, but the high handling mixed with the drifting caused the car to stop dead in its tracks half the time. While a car with bad handling and good drift worked amazingly. the game itself is pretty buggy, sometimes I went too fast for the game to pick up what was going on and i would reset and be from first to last place instantly. Weight dosent seem to matter in the game, I was using heavy cars and was still being pushed around like a rag doll with cars that had extremely low weight. Tried the online mode but I ended up having to use task manager to force the game to shut down, multiple times. So there is not much else aside from the main campaign of the game. Honestly a lot of the issues with the klunk factor of the game has to do with the unity engine. I went from hating that engine to saying its ok. It has some games that are surprisingly well done (sometimes).  for what few level designes this game had they were done quite well. But seeing as they used the same environment for so many maps it was hard to distinguish if I was in a different track or  not. I would very much like to see more variety in level design, as well as some bug fixes to improve crashing and collision detection in the game. But over all for a game that I got on sale. No too bad. But wait until it goes on sale. Even for the price of 10 bucks I think that this game is asking a little much if they are not going to use the money to make updates for the game."}]}
