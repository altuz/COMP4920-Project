What makes this game unique in the puzzle genre, though, is that the blocks don't simply disappear instantly - a white line sweeps over the entire field periodically, and as it passes over chained blocks it \"tags\" them for destruction. While it is doing so, you can add more blocks to that. They are destroyed once the white line reaches the end of the current chain. This is interesting because it allows you to extend your combos, adding a little more depth to the game. \n\nOne of the key features of the game is that the blocks emit sounds in tune with the songs, and doing bigger combos changes the music. The bigger and faster you combo things, the more frantic the song gets. \n\nThere a few game modes, like mission, puzzle, time attack and regular. Nothing you haven't seen before, so no need to explain.\n\nWill you like it? I don't know, but you will certainly hate it if you dislike the soundtrack, so before buying it, try listening to the OST or looking some gameplay videos on youtube first. \n\nIs this a good port? Kind of. It seems like the assets were lifted straight from the PSP game and there is no option to make it fullscreen at all - you get black bars on top and on the bottom of the screen (maybe they wanted the CoD audience so they did this to make it more \"cinematic\"...?). That aside, it behaves adequately. I do feel like the songs in the PSP version were better (unless my memory is deceiving me) and they could maybe add some filters, but at the end of the day you will be looking at a bunch of squares, so having anti aliasing or anything else is hardly a dealbreaker.\n\nAlso, do note that this game has never, ever been on sale. I think the developers forgot they even put it here. It seems kind of expensive for what it is, and I don't think the Advanced Pack is really worth it."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1310028549, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503962", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "811145", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197979084213", "num_reviews": 921, "last_played": 0, "num_games_owned": 3518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 0}, "timestamp_updated": 1402231285, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The port isn't very good, but man, I loved this game back when it was first released on the PSP. The clean graphics, good music and addictive gameplay; it all made sense. The goal is to create cubes (by using cubes). The cubes that fall down have two colors so you have to match them and try to make as many cubes as possible before the 'beat line' moves over them. It's really a line that moves from the left to the right (apparently on the beat of the music, but I'm usually too focused to notice) and clears the cubes. Of course things speed up after a while until you are overwhelmed. It has a lot of similarities to Tetris actually (it's hard to create a game like this these days that doesn't use Tetris elements so I can live with it. Besides; Tetris rules !). Anyway, the game itself is definately worth it, the port itself, however... not really. If you can get it cheap, do yourself a favor and get it immediately though.\n\n[Rating: 80/100]"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1348849996, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497387", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2079532", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198001935833", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1322121600, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2141}, "timestamp_updated": 1348849996, "received_for_free": false, "review": "hours of puzzling fun, and snazzy music"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1317601231, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "563507", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197972261419", "num_reviews": 29, "last_played": 1484379595, "num_games_owned": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 147}, "timestamp_updated": 1317601231, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A very fun puzzle game.
