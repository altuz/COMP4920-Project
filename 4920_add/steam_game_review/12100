GTA III and Vice City are god awful on Steam.\n\nController support is awful. Yeah, I can plug in my Xbox 360 controller and I can move around and everything, but I can't look around, and the buttons are all jumbled around. B is to accelerate, A is to shoot, Select is to change the radio, clicking left stick changes the camera? Awful.\n\nAnd the graphics settings are terrible. There's only draw distance, frame limiter, widescreen, and resolution. The game looks atrocious. Literal PS1 textures, what in the hell. They don't use the Xbox version's textures, and they even removed some things too!\n\nThose reasons alone are good enough for me to say don't buy this game, emulate it for free. \n\nIf you ever see the GTA trilogy on sale, just get San Andreas on its own. Even then, I barely recommend that awful port, bt it's not as bad as this one. Only get this if you don't mind using the keyboard and mouse, and don't mind the ugly textures."}]}
