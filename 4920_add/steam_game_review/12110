Many reference to Scareface, but also got its own personalities. And there are tons of things to do and explore apart from main quests.\n\nSure the graphics is a bit old for today's standard. But if u look beyond that, u will find Vice City offers u a beautiful miami in 80s. Imo, it is the best theme/background among all GTA.\n\n10/10, Enjoy your stay!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505871297, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506344", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35075447", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198115696349", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1505875024, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 505}, "timestamp_updated": 1505871297, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is the greatest 80s simulator of all time"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505430561, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34959545", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198066545552", "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1506626765, "num_games_owned": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "playtime_forever": 663}, "timestamp_updated": 1505430561, "received_for_free": false, "review": ">be me\n>stole a taxi\n>play the taxi sub-mission\n>first passenger is the same tassist \n\nGTA:VC is one of the best GTA, and this version here on Steam seems really good on graphics.
