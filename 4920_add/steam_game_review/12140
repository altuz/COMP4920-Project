I recently read an article where someone said it wasn't worth revisiting, but I couldn't believe that.\n\nIt has aged a bit, and the gunplay lacks a certain immersive \"umph\", but it's still a fun game. It also wasn't as hard by today's standards. I did a fair bit of saving and loading, but still played through and beat it in three or four days of mostly casual gaming.\n\nThe story is generic \"hard-boiled noir\" stuff, but that's part of what makes it so much fun. The nods and inspiration of outside influences like \"Twin Peaks\" is fun and interesting, and the real-world locations are still fun to go shooting through. Max's attitude, voice, and metaphor-laden narrative is still great, and so are the graphic novel sections of the game.\n\nSo it's been outclassed by what came after, but the original is still a fun play. I would recommend it to anyone who likes shooters, or is a particular fan of Max Payne (I still haven't played the third one as of this review, but I will eventually). Also, Remedy fans who might be familiar only with \"Alan Wake\" or \"Quantum Break\" might want to dig into the company's history; they might discover that the original \"Max Payne\" is still a bit of a treat."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506313811, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "35196220", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197982356894", "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1505879513, "num_games_owned": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 764}, "timestamp_updated": 1506313811, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Me doing a review?

If you don't want to read on because you're lazy, just know that I highly recommend it.\n\nPlaying as the titular character Max Payne, an undercover cop who has lost everything and everyone in a series of tragic events, you're really put up against it as you're forced to fight hordes of gangsters, mercenaries, and more using your skills and reflexes. Emphasis on that last part- Max can only survive a few shots before going down like any other human being out there, so you're forced to watch your step all the time and use the slow-motion 'bullet time' to hit your enemies with precision before they can get a shot off at you. There's a wide variety of weapons to help you with that, from melee tools such as a baseball bat to dual handguns to assault rifles. Nothing that particularly stands out- well, unless you want to count the Jackhammer seeing as that's a very rare weapon in real life- but certainly a wide range that will let you fight with a variety of playstyles. Go in with the big guns and try to be tactical with your ammunition, or simply go mad with your handguns and dance around the bullets being fired at you.\n\nThe AI on this game is very advanced at times. Enemies have sophisticated behaviours, such as standing around and chatting, or patrolling down corridors. They can work very effectively as a team, advancing on you in numbers if they feel confident or retreating and firing from cover if you start to thin their ranks. Admittedly the boss enemies in this game seem to deviate little from the philosophy of 'Just run at Max because we're bullet sponges' but you're going to have some very good gunfights in this game and die plenty of times if you buy it. Save often or risk being taken back a fair bit when someone jumps around the corner and fires a shotgun at your face.\n\nThe atmosphere, dialogue and effects are all as good as the gameplay and combine to form an immersive environment that really makes you feel like you're venturing the cold hard streets of late nineties New York.  As you explore abandoned subway stations, derelict apartments, seedy underworld dens and more on your quest to help Max get revenge, you'll be stunned by the level of detail and attention. Max will make idle comments on various objects you stumble across. Gangsters will talk about all sorts of things and seem human at times. You'll find junkies quivering and mumbling to themselves down back alleys. The attention to detail is amazing.\n\nAdmittedly there's some drawbacks with this game, the biggest one being the shocking state of the port which I'm surprised Remedy hasn't hotfixed. Whilst on a functional level it works relatively fine- I'm getting silky smooth performance and no graphical glitches or crashes which is a rarity on a lot of old shooter games- there's a big problem where no music plays. I highly recommend getting the patch on the community hub that fixes this: it's relatively easy to install and solved all my problems. Another technical problem is the Windows 10 issues with this game- but since I'm still a Windows 7 boy (gulp) I can't speak much for that. But there's patches for that too- like any old PC game with a cult following people have patched the hell out of it. I think there's mods which spice things up as well, but I've only played this through vanilla.\n\nAnother aspect what annoys me are the platforming segments in this game, simply because Max jumps about as well as any other protagonist in a shooter game. There aren't that many of them, in fairness, but there's some obnoxious jumps and precise platform jumping (particularly in the despised 'dream sequences' that occur between each of the three parts of the game) that really require a lot of saving and loading because you're more than likely going to mess them up a lot. Thankfully, it's unlimited saves unlike something like Hitman.\n\nBut anyway, if you dare to try this game, you're going to have a fun time. Maybe it's not for everyone and it might be a bit hardcore for filthy casuals, but I really enjoy it."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505206237, "weighted_vote_score": "0.420544", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34897303", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198019317826", "num_reviews": 32, "last_played": 1459654880, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 500}, "timestamp_updated": 1505206237, "received_for_free": false, "review": "discomfort in the rectum"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505962750, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499779", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35096195", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198057007855", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1488333792, "num_games_owned": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 9688}, "timestamp_updated": 1505962750, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Do you like painkiller addicted, alchololic, ex-cops that shoot criminals in slow motion?

I played the ever loving poop out of this game when it was released, and after seeing it here for a pittance, I decided to purchase it once more (my disk version, which I still have, doesn't work on Windows 10). I was not disappointed. This game is still fantastic 16 years later, and it has one of the best mechanics I've ever experienced in a game - bullet time. Great story, memorable characters, and fun gameplay make this a must-have game, in my opinion.\n\nA few caveats, however: first, you will have to install the community-provided patch to get the sounds to work correctly. This is very easy to do, and it improves your experience significantly. Second, there are a few minor glitches in the Steam version. These can be worked around, but the frustration level was real.\n\nGlitch one involves a chase involving Vince Gognitti - he falls between two buildings and cannot be harmed. Later, you can get caught in a death loop as he respawns during a cutscene, and his goons kill you instantly. To avoid this, just climb back up the stairs and the game should progress normally.\n\nGlitch two involves the inability of Max to jump properly during the dream sequences. You can get around this by performing sideways shoot-dodge jumps, which should solve any issues.\n\nOther than that, the game performed perfectly. It's a fun, smart, exciting ride, so pick it up if it interests you."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506121060, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498353", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35139452", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198422933891", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506979681, "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 507, "playtime_forever": 507}, "timestamp_updated": 1506121060, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Old but really good game IMO"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505867184, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497760", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35074689", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207608624", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505529805, "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 91}, "timestamp_updated": 1505867184, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Wouldn't even start, and couldn't get my money back.
