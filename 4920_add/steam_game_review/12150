It definitely looks better than the last one; in fact it looks great for a 2003 game. It's a bit weird how Max Payne's appearance changed though - he looks kind of like Nicholas Cage. (I know I'd pay a lot of money for a game like this starring him, that's for sure.) The gunplay is better as well, with more satisfying weaponry and ragdoll physics added to the mix. Bullet time also doesn't slow you down anymore, which is a major factor in making the game easier than its predecessor, although not too easy.\n\nIt keeps with the dark noir theme of the first game, but it seems to lean more on the serious side - the 'love story' - than that game did. That's not a bad thing per se, given how smoothly executed it is and how good the gameplay is, but it doesn't quite have the desperate, blackly humorous essence the first game did. Payne's voice acting is more on the overwrought side when compared to the first game and its tone, at least. That's not quite to its detriment and more of a personal taste thing for me, though: the game deals more with Max's journey as a person this time around, a person struggling with the violent and tragic aftermath of what happened in the first game.\n\nThe story takes more twists and turns than in the first game as well, meaning you actually have to pay attention if you want context for the fighting you're doing. Mona Sax gets credit for having enough agency to capably fight alongside Max at times, even if she's ultimately Max's love interest.\n\nIf you're in the market for a good third-person shooter, you could do much worse than Max Payne 2, but the story won't make a whole lot of sense unless you've played the first game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505373653, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498966", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34943845", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198049689075", "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1491690119, "num_games_owned": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 533}, "timestamp_updated": 1505373653, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1] A worthy successor to the critically acclaimed Max Payne.\t[/h1]\n\nNow what do I have to say about this entry in the series? Well I personally prefer the first game over this one but I still loved this game. In comparison to the first game, the soundtrack is just as good, the story is a little bit less strong than in the first game but it still is very good, and the gameplay and such is almost exactly the same as the first game making it home for fans of the old game but I still wish they could've changed the gameplay a little as to see a clear difference between the two other than the look and feel.\n\nIf you're a fan of the first game, you'll be pleased to see the story of Max continue. The love story is great and you actually switch perspectives between Max and the girl between different parts of gameplay. The comic book sequences are toned down a bit, whether or not that's to your liking or not I personally like it as I find it to be a little more engaging with what's going on in the game rather than to be presented with a comic section.\n\nAlso Max doesn't look like he's about to take the biggest crap in the world so that's a plus."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506785747, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500075", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35342990", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198049953608", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1505453634, "num_games_owned": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 556}, "timestamp_updated": 1506785747, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game really does what a sequel needs to do. It adds a lot of improvements from the original Max Payne, while also fine tuning old things. For instance, the graphics are a lot better and the controls are smoother.\n\nOverall the game itself is full of depth. There are many weapons to cycle through, from Molotov cocktails to grenades to sniper rifles to melee combat. You have many objectives in missions -- from peaceful ones without enemies where to need to simply figure out what to do, to oines where you'll have to guard someone or you'll need to take down a boss.\n\nThe story is the shining aspect of the game -- you follow a fully voiced adventure of Max Payne. There are noir style comics before each level, with each character voiced, while during gameplay Payne will comment about things you find and interact with other characters.\n\nIt's hard to describe how good the game is -- if you're there for the story and like a dark setting, get this. 89/100 for me, highly recommended."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505075540, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496064", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34870658", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291102400", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506535966, "num_games_owned": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 716, "playtime_forever": 873}, "timestamp_updated": 1505075540, "received_for_free": false, "review": "the game is best story also great.\nbut the worst thing is that i can't play it.\ni got win 10 enterp. and it won't launch even i reinstalled game. \nshit !"}]}
