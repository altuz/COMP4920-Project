Sign me up! It definatley shows its age but to be completely honest it really shouldn't matter at all. I'll admit I never played a Midnight Club until Los Angeles and was a little curious as to why there were no licensed cars and customization but that really doesn't matter. Pretty much every car in this game perfectly captures what was the style back in 2003 like the AbFlug Supra inspired Saikou XS or the Citi and Citi Turbo based on popular Wings West bodykits for the EJ1 and EM1 Civic. The game's soundtrack is pretty rad as well with most races playing songs based on the character your racing's personality. Probably the main selling point I could see the casual racing game fans however is the three cities you race through in the story, Yeah they aren't \"big\" but there designed around the idea of racing and fun. Not to mention you really can't ask too much from an early PS2 era game. I guess my only real complaint would be that you can't upgrade the performance of your cars, Even though the more desireable cars are unlocked at the end anyway. I still think it's something that does belong in a street racing game, but like I said earlier, MCLA spoiled me slightly. long story short, For the love of god buy it! Especially if you're a fan of early 2000's street racing."}, {"votes_down": 17, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505950107, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469215", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "35093822", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398977587", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505958020, "num_games_owned": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 39}, "timestamp_updated": 1505950107, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I accidentall bougt this games in 2017.
