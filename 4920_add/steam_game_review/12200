If you go outsides only wearing underpants,people you met will laugh at you.and so on.\n\n  + You can change your costumes and hairstyle.(the protagonist was bald at the beginning,I don't know how he can change the hairstyle)\n\n  + NPCs will change their clothes with seasonal alternation.\n\nCons:\n\n  - The bodies of NPCs who have been knocked out will disappear automatically after a while,that's really disappointing!\n\nIn short:\n\n  A classic open-world game with quite good quality and much fun.\n\n\u4f18\u70b9\uff1a\n\n

scholarship edition) and i now bought it on PC \n\nBully is one of the best game I've ever played, and the nostalgia. It is kinda like a high school grand theft auto but without blood and deadly weapons\nBully takes place in Bullworth, Bullworth Academy. A boarding school. The school is full of bullies and corrupt teachers. \n\nSo Jimmy as main character, your main goal is to bring peace to the school by helping and befriending the six main cliques: The Nerds, the Jocks, the Bullies, The Greasers, the Preppies and the Townies\n\nThe school? of course you will have to go to class lol. These classes are English, Gym, Shop, Art and photography.\nBut because this is a new edition so there is a new class ie Music, Geopgraph, Matemathic and Biology. Well you can skip class, but you won't get any reward and if you do so, then you will be chased by teachers and send you back to class if they catch you\n\nThis game has a very impressive map size. You can explore the entire school, the school grounds, the town, a theme park, an industrial park and a few more awesome places. There are many collectables scattered around the map too like Rubber band, etc. And also side quests that will come to you, it up to you, you want help them or not.\n\nThere are also weapons to fight. No, they are not guns or knife and no, you can't kill people. There's a slingshot,  firecrackers, stink bombs, etc that enough to make people dying lol\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n+ Good graphic\n+ Good Voice Acting\n+ Awesome story\n+ Great characters\n+ Weapons\n+ Interacting with students\n+ new class and mission \n+ Side quests\n+ Mini games\n+ Sense of progress (upgrades/new weapons)\n+ Character customizable (like buy and change clothes, hairstyle, even buy a bike)\n+ Gameplay is simple and easy as long as it is getting used to\n+ Good soundtracks, I even hit people and we were chased so that the music sounds out, LOL, i like this soundtracks\n+ You can kiss girls for health, which really gives an authentic high school feel.\n\n[h1] Mixeds: [/h1]\n+- Having low/negative respect with a clique can get pretty annoying, as they always pummel you wherever you are. but i don't mind, i will fight back LOL\n+- Frame rate is only capped to 30 frames but i don't mind, as long as my laptop does not lag\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n- Poor, Awkward controls with Keyboard\n- Bugs\n- can't ride motorcycle owned by police (?)\n- this game can't use steam overlay, so i can't chat with steam friends unless alt+tab to switch between game and desktop\n\nwell, i highly recommend this game , it's good game\n\nand still waiting for Bully 2 :D"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507140171, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35477400", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198176629074", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1492122817, "num_games_owned": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 49}, "timestamp_updated": 1507140171, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good Game but if you have windows 10 please don't get it as it crashes alot and controller support is bad...i rarely had a chance to use my controller  with it.  i spent most of my time trying to get the controller to work  than playing the game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505942024, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35092237", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198256832132", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505312613, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 874}, "timestamp_updated": 1505942024, "received_for_free": false, "review": "good"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506306904, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35194927", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198040949961", "num_reviews": 40, "last_played": 1505703370, "num_games_owned": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 92}, "timestamp_updated": 1506306904, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Love it xD"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506468367, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35232037", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198057491514", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1506447015, "num_games_owned": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "playtime_forever": 80}, "timestamp_updated": 1506468367, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game if you enjoy Rockstar Games other products including but not limited to the GTA series and Red Dead series, then you'll probably enjoy this game.
