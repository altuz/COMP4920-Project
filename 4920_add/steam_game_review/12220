Not as good as the full games, but that's to be expected.  These are both a lot of fun, very few issues.  Runs great, works perfectly with my xbox controller, took about 20 hours of gameplay for me to complete all missions and side missions.  My only complaint is the checkpoint spots, there are times where if you die you have to keep replaying through 20 minutes of driving and fighting and dying and losing your ammo as you go along.  Still worth it.  I think I liked the Lost and the Damned gameplay and missions more than Gay Tony, even though I thought the character I played in Gay Tony was much more interesting.  I wasn't a huge fan of the whole % thing in the Gay Tony missions, although I'm sure some players will love it for the replay value.\n\nToo long, didn't read:  Buy it."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506725886, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498258", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35315252", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091558361", "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1506725345, "num_games_owned": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 356, "playtime_forever": 991}, "timestamp_updated": 1506725886, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Episodes from Liberty City Review Part 1: The Ballad of Gay Tony\n\nTBOGT was exactly what not to do with a DLC. There is no need to talk about certain aspects as they are more attributed to the base game, such as controls. However the aspects that made the DLC 'its own' were underwhelming to say the least. It was a poorly written and executed story with less than mediocre characters, aside from Yusef. As well there were barely any new additions in the weapons and vehicles department and the only added 'mission type' was club management, which is unfortunatly one of the few things worth mentioning. As for now I can't reccomend buying this DLC, however I have not played through The Lost and Damned yet...\n\nEpisodes from Liberty City Review Part 2: The Lost and Damned...
