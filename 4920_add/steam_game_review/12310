This game is amazing. Great story (based on a book, if I recall correctly), nice characters, interesting puzzles, multiple endings (based on our choices).

Just a warning: see those black bars on the screenshots? Game doesn't run in widescreen. But the story is so amazing that, believe me, you won't even remember that after playing it for 30 minutes\n\nIf you're a fan of adventure games and a good, solid sci-fi story, give this game a chance. I don't think you'll regret it\n\nFor those wondering about those merely 4.4 hour of gameplay on my profile, Steam version is cut (it lacks a few sex scenes, like Fahrenheit), so I grabbed the full version elsewhere, and that's the one I've been playing"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1473103068, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471550", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "25369361", "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198049916848", "num_reviews": 45, "last_played": 1473151442, "num_games_owned": 1713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 93}, "timestamp_updated": 1474579338, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Public Notice: I made an uncut patch for Steam (the original uncut version is no longer available for sale) which adds full subtitles, decensors the game and has bonuses, here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=697262043\n\nMy playtime is low even though I finished the game because I played using the uncut version executable.\n\nNow the review:\nCulpa Innata is a fantastic and quite unique adventure game, it does a lot of things most games don't and really deserves your time and money.\n\nMany adventure games are set in criminal investigations but none succeed in actually making you feel like an official investigator going through actual interviews non-sequentially and piecing together the evidence like Culpa Innata. You have a limited amount of time - in the game that translates to the number of people you can interview based on travel time to location - and must choose wisely whom to interview, what to ask and which leads to follow up (and report) in the game's many locations. You also have a well developed private life after the day's investigations in which some other plot threads are explored. The game is non-linear and major reveals therefore happen in a way that is specific to how you chose to advance.\n\nAnother great success is the game world in which characters' scripts, motivations and way of life feel very lived-in and set in the new world order established by a subtly totalitarian regime very different from the one we live in. The main character herself sometimes says questionable things as she is an active part of the system up to a point. This does make you as the player explore this world on a deeper level than if you were controlling a detached completely-different-from-everyone protagonist meant to make you empathise with a corrupt society that cannot be accepted. The story is very interesting and while the game suitably ends the main plot there are some secret threads set up for a sequel that hopefully sees the light of day sometime.\n\nFor its age, the visuals are great and the facial animation is solid. Faces having an almost photorealistic feel at times due to the way it uses film grain without being excessive. The soundtrack is nice too, fits the mood well. The voice acting is also very good. I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs or crashes when playing the game (Note: I was using the uncut version patch shared on top of this review).\n\nAll in all, a fantastic adventure game I'm glad I played and highly recommend it to you all!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1416486477, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515006", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13015218", "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197990265102", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1480052860, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1484}, "timestamp_updated": 1416486477, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Oldie but a goodie.

The main character is an officer given the task of investigating a murder which is an event so rare in this world that everyone doen't really know how to start.\n\nThe best thing about this game is the detail of the setting. 'The World Union' where the main character lives and works is a society different to any of our own. In the game you not only carry out your investigation but interact with friends and colleagues to get a proper feel of what being in such a society might be like. There's also a lot of reference to the countries not absorbed by this society and how things are different. The writers have done an excellent job of giving a richly detailed picture of this world.\n\nThe main negative point of this game is that it is part 1 of 2 but part 2 never got produced. The principal aim of the game (ie solve the murder) is resolved nicely but so many more interesting questions appear on the way but never get answered. Very frustrating.\n\nOther important points:\n\nGameplay: The game is highly non-linear. There are day cycles and you can only fit a certain number of things into each day but other than that the choice is very free. This makes the game DIFFICULT, particularly if you can't find a trigger for an event.\n\nPuzzles: A nice balance of dialogue/persuasion, logic puzzles and inventory use.\n\nVisuals: The 3D environments are well rendered but nothing very special.\n\nVoice Acting: Very good on the whole with a few terrible accents.\n\nMusic: A futuristic dystopian nightmare.
