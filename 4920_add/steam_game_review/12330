This is my first time playing the game. That aside, I am a fan of all things space and the immersive space travel genres. After playing Homeworld Remastered, I longingly wanted that experience, but Homeworld's learning curve is too high. Once you drop it, it's a bit of a drag to pick it up again, mid-game. Darkstar is the perfect alternative. You fly between large ships, you get into dogfights with pirates and you travel at the speed of light. The controls are modern: it uses the ASDF and mouse. If you are a flight simulator buff, this is not that... and it will be a disppointment. I like it because you can drop it and pick it up, casually. I can get that experience.\n\nPROS:\nInexpensive\nClassic\nImmersive Space Simulator\nOpen-World\n\nCONS:\nBulky ship!\nPacing can be a bit off, especially when upgrading the ship\nHorrible Acting\nBad Plot"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502679022, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501534", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34227466", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971886225", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1503453959, "num_games_owned": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1523}, "timestamp_updated": 1503454475, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is a fun and pleasant space sim.

I loved Space Rangers 2 so I decided to update by trying some more recent Space Sims.

Darkstar One is a light and frothy but enjoyable space sim with relatively high production values and a high quality engine.

There are even official modding tools available."}]}
