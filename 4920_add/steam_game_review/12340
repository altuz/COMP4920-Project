Lots of pretty decent voice acting, even if it's all hammy and silly, but few of the belly laughs of the Monkey Island games they tried to emulate, only with too much heavy sarcasm and not enough absurdity. The graphics are bright and shiny, the characters even occasionally have a bit of real-life spark to them, and there are a hell of a lot of puzzles to solve (plus a few fetch quests). When the occasional hilarious moments clicked, it almost made it all worth it.\n\nMy biggest problem with it was the utterly plodding pace everyone shuffled at, and with such a huge world, you could catch a nap walking between areas. With zero in-game tutorial, there was no way to know that a double-click made you run, until a puzzle near the end through was unsolvable if you didn't, so I had to go online and find out that the game screwed me. Combine that with terrible pathing, where you take the longest route and walk in circles to get to anything, and it was a dull, frustrating game. The horrible camera contributes significantly; they tried to make it as cinematic as possible with fixed cameras that turn with you, but half the time that just means you have to click every two seconds to keep walking. Some of the swooping effects are nice, but interfere with gameplay whenever you want to click on something while you're walking. The cinematic experience was kind of broken anyway, when everyone looks off into space while talking to each other and  uses the exact same hand gesture.\n\nCompared to that constant irritation, the occasional insane puzzle (or insane chapter, as Amanda's seemed to be), and the expected heaping bugs that every adventure game has weren't as bad. They just meant I ended up leaning on a walkthrough at times to figure out what one thing I'd missed somewhere, and occasionally rage quitting for a few days when it crashed again.\n\nI think I truly came to hate it when I found a good fix, and Jack said, \"No, that would be the obvious solution. I feel like some challenge. Let's try it another way....\"\n\nUltimately, I grimly finished it just because I'd already invested so much time, but it became an endurance that I wouldn't wish on anyone. A little polish would have taken the game into the timeless classic realm, but instead it ended up average and forgettable."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1397747726, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515691", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "9841987", "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198058362859", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1341817200, "num_games_owned": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1034}, "timestamp_updated": 1397747726, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I spent a lot of time playing this game.

This game is practically the same as Ankh 3. There would be nothing wrong with that, IF Ankh 3 would not be exacty the same as Ankh 2 and Ankh 2 was any different from Ankh. This is just not funny anymore. To make long story short, buy this game only if You hadn't played anything else from Deck 13. You can enjoy like 5 hours of this humor. If You played all the Ankh games, you are likely to have spent 50 hours with Deck 13 and that is just too much.\n\nGraphics is terrible, there are MANY small bugs (especially comments of some objects that are obviously wrong, some labels are missing completely being replaced with some development debug macros and so on). The camera is horrible, in the menu I cannot see any cursor so it always takes quite a time before I guess it's position and highlight the option I want, and having multiple monitors adds some more problems like the cursor won't stop at the edge of the main screen and often you click out of the game's window making it minimized (from the technical perspective this is the worst game I have ever played) It also takes a really long time to go back to the game after this happens. And the worst of all: All the puzzles, if you can call it like that, are absolutely ilogical and just stupid and the obvious solutions to the situatation just do not work with no indication of explanation or whatever. Well you can call that funny only if it is your first game from Deck 13. The game is also pretty childish (you can't even hit a monkey, that the developers made sure you will learn to hate a great deal throughout the game, while it is tearing your airplane apart during the flight and you need to figure out a way to put it safely down while the very fate (of course) of the world is at stake). On the other hand there are quite a lot of erotic undertone and ambiguity - so you can't really tell which group do the developers really try to target.\n\nBUT even then I was somehow able to play the game till the end (although with some swearing and curses) and I must confess I kinda liked it so it was not all that bad.
