Things got worst.\n\nI explain. The designers tried to differenciate things more by building the races in a different way.\nIn this game we have ONLY two races comparing to the 3 plus the scourge we had in the first Perimeter, the Exodus and the HeartBack.\nSo, the story says that the new world those races were searching finally found. But the Exodus still can colonize the surface while the HeartBack can build in Water.\n\nIf you are a Perimeter Veteran please read the differences below, after the many dashes.\n\nFor the Newcomers to this game.\n\nHere we have a simple strategy game. You first build the energy cores and terraform the ground so you can move easily or build upon it. To do that on the easy way build every NEXT energy core to the change of the levels of the ground and press the terraform button of the NEW energy core. In other ways you'll get yourself saying some bad words if NOT smushing the PC or leaving the game completely. The manual terraforming controls are buggy so don't be frustrated. The only thing you'll need the manual terraforming is when you want to get some blue crystals and you'll need to dig the ground.\n\nEvery technology as the game says must be researched first. So if you want to build unit factories you need to research them first. So level 2 and 3 factories. The factories create the pop cap. But you can't have as many factories as you want as the preserve energy. The units from the factories have ground and air mode. You change them dependant on what you want to attack or defend because ground units don't fight air.\n\nGenerally is a very simple game that tricks your imagination. Nothing more.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you have played the first Perimeter....\n\nThe game differences are Massive.\n\n--There is no Frame here. No main building. No King of Chess. You start building like any other strategy game.\n--The energy cores can be built anywhere at start. The terraform process is included in them and can be set at automatic mode or manual. Manual terraforming is crap. You use it only to level the ground where you want and then auto. The controls for the manual are buggy. A very easy way to keep the level of the ground the same(but you lose space) is to build the energy cores to the gaps that the ground changes levels. When you press the terraform button the ground will be in the same level as the OLD energy core. But as you can see in this game you have to be occupied even to that.\n--Population cap is related to the factories and is NOT standard as in the first game. Every factory places about 2 more squads and the squad units number is about 1-4 dependant on the unit. Factories preserve energy like in Command and Conquer and NOT like in the first Perimeter when ONLY working. In this way the squad number is limited. \n--You have a Research Center to advance your technology. To build the 3-set level of factories you have to research them as much other techs like PLUS in Weapons or Shields for your units. The first level builds light units, the second level medium units and the third heavy units that are effective in buildings most.\n--So we have ONLY 3 units per race that can be changed from ground to air and vice versa depedant of the opponents offensive and defensive. For example fighters confront fighters and the vehicles other vehicles. There is NO unit from the ground to hit the air.\n--The chess game that we were playing in the first Perimeter with the capturing of the energy cores or buildings of the opponent is VERY limited here, because the Exodus structures are damaged from water and the HeartBack structures from the normal ground.\n--There are NO subterrastrial units on this game.\n--Ahh yes, I almost forgot. New power-ups like Nukes,mass terra destruction and such are coming from the blue ingame crystals like OLD techs that you find on the planet's surface. To get those crystals you'll need to build an energy core on them and MANUALLY terraform the ground in DIGGING mode.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhoever wants to read my review about the first Perimeter, he/she can find it [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/383854922/recommended/289440/] here[/url].\n\nThe AI is very easy even in skirmishes. Don't get amazed by the new graphics of the game. I was and there were NOT many youtube videos to see what is happening In Game.\n\nAs a result his game has NO FUTURE! If you want to relax by playing something ok.

Well nope, even if you have a pixel of uneven landscape, you are pretty much screwed since you won't have enough space, which Harkback doesn't suffer from this even if you build 10 aquacores close of which other and terraform to make a \"water mountain\" and uneven the water you can still build there.\n\n-Second [u]the Powers[/u]\nWell if the Exodus is land their powers will be earth related like the ability of scum disruptor to create volcanos. For some reason the devs missed this part or they had the brilliant ideia in turning the Exodus in the new Empire, because Exodus got a [b]freaking nuke[/b], Harkback got a meteor that blasts, annihilates everything and produces water, Exodus got a nuke the dries everything and [u]does damage equal to the distance of the ground[/u], if there is plenty of water good luck trying to destroy anything but if harkback is close. Clearly the devs missed the Empire. Atleast their secondary powers is to make a twister which is much, much better.\n\n-Third [u]the \"Special\" Unit[/u]\nThis is what I believe was the discussion of making the Exodus Special Unit by the devs.\n\nDev Group Leader: \"Who has some inovated ideias about Exodus special units?\"\n\nRandom Dev n\u00ba1: So the Harkback use water, the water level keeps raising, it would be smart to use some unit like the previous games, like the scum heater, a unit the flies and has a powerfull beam the could also dry the water.\"\n\nDev Group Leader: \"Nah scrap that ideia.\"\n\nRandom Dev n\u00ba2: \"Since the water level keeps rising, we should make a giant catapult like scum thrower, to one shot cores like the golem of the Harkback does.\"\n\nDev Group Leader: \"That ideia is stupid, you're stupid.\"\n\nRandom Dev n\u00ba3 that worked there and no one knows why: \"I know we should make a unit that makes the other units stealth like Empire had.\"\n\nDev Group Leader:\" I love it, you get a raise the rest of you are fired.\"\n\nYes the special unit of exodus is another copy from the Empire, a unit that makes the other units ([b]but only ground units[/b] stealth and the aoe is so tiny that you either use only on tier 3 with them above of each other or that thing is useless, even in certain maps although it's hovering it's many times buggedand just flies randomly. Even in the previous games the Empire stealth unit could hide flying units.\n\n-Fourth [u]Perimeter vs Golem[/u]\n\nDon't even bother to use the perimeter(or Shield) to protect you from golem because it won't work.\n\n[b] This is for both Factions [/b]\n\n-Only 3 units (light, medium, heavy) that have flying mode or ground mode.\n\n-The unit cap is related to the number of factories of both factions.\n\n-Since the moment a factory is built it starts to consume energy even if it's not working.\n\n-You only have a building that works like the many labs you have in Perimeter 1.\n\n\n\nSo, why do I reccomend this game you ask?\n\nI reccomend it for the simple fact that I always enjoyed terraforming and it's unique concept, even thought I wrote so many CONs, to me that concept outshines the CONs, this is why I spent hours of playing this game, trying to flood dry maps and dry flood maps."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1419298942, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502735", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "13536174", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198005329545", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1419298838, "num_games_owned": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 268}, "timestamp_updated": 1419298942, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Game is absolute garbage compared to the one it's based off of.\n\nDon't be fooled: this is a sequel to Perimeter in name only.
