'Ankh 2' is tagged on Steam as a comedy, but genuinely humorous moments are quite rare. It isn't a particularly intuitive game, and the narrative mechanics are far too inflexible.  I can remember one moment, for instance, when I had to shoo away an aggressive cat. I had in my inventory a piece of chicken but trying to use this to complete the objective resulted simply in my character shaking their head and saying, very robotically, \"Hmm... this doesn't work.\" \nThere are some fun moments in 'Ankh 2', but no more than can be found in any other average  point-and-click game. At \u00a33.99 you certainly won't feel cheated by the developers, but don't expect more than a few hours' enjoyment."}]}
