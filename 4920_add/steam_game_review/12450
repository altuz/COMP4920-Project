To be honest, in some respects  I like Ankh 3 more than Ankh 2. What about Ankh 1, you may ask? I've personally had enough to do with these games that I have no desire to see how it all started. But thanks for the offer, Steam. \n\nWhy do I like Ankh 3 more than Ankh 2? Probably only one reason- the worlds are more colorfully and creatively designed. They're prettier to look at. But Ankh 3 does about everything else worse than Ankh 2. The story is cluttered and messy, with tons of ideas picked up then dropped (you get drunk and have a random dream of shooting a chicken out of rocket launcher that has no context, no build up for the story, and no humor to it). The puzzles are even more incredibly strange and painful to solve because they make no bloody sense. The new voice actors are leagues worse than those of Ankh 2. And, as I complained in Ankh 2, Ankh 3 relies too much on it's predecessors. \n\nIt doesn't make any self-aware game jokes like Ankh 2, but there are a lot of reoccuring characters and ideas brought up you'll have no idea of what they are unless you've played at least Ankh 2. And the story tries to take all these silly shenanigans and cliche humor (especially from the ankh. Yeah, it can talk in this one and I hate the bloody thing. I forgot why it was so damn important halfway through the game, and just wanted to toss it), and make it seem big, climactic and important but seeing where everything was built off of, I had no reason to think anything like that. \n\nI despise Ankh 2 and 3, and they're currently my least favorite games in my library. I won't even call them the Ankh games anymore. I might as well call them the \"wankh\" games, because that's essentially was they are, and especially what Wankh 3: Butt of the Gods is.
