No online multiplayer. A short campaign. Annoying multi-level maps. Translation issues. There are just too many little problems in BC Kings that add up to one big headache.

Granted the gameplay at the time was similar to the \u2018big two\u2019 being Command and Conquer and Warcraft, it stands out due to its storyline as it ties in playing out our history. Personally, I loved it because you get the play out the Stone Age as no other games done this effectively since. Fast forward to 2008, another RTS game arrived where you can play out the Stone Age (with some twists) and filled the landscape with dinosaurs \u2013 and who doesn\u2019t like dinosaurs? This game, BC Kings, whilst kept on the traditional RTS formula (explore / build / conquer), it added some RPG elements and encourages exploration as well. A decent game considering it\u2019s an indie title however I wished there were more dinosaurs to play with.\n\nOverall, the game was a blast to play from start to finish with some twists and turns along the way. Yes it does feel like a rip-off from Age of Empires however it\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s a lot of love and care poured into this game. The UI is nicely designed with beautiful pictures that resembles cavemen paintings splashed throughout is an example of devotion. However I praise the developers for trying out something new to the ever-so overused RTS formula where it encourages you to explore, have multiple maps, a spray of RPG and even has a third person view option (well\u2026one mission has this). Some of these innovations plays well and others not so however that\u2019s not to discredited their efforts. It\u2019s a light hearted RTS that\u2019s very enjoyable to play until the very end. Let\u2019s put it this way, when I think of that title, it places a smile in my face and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\n8 / 10\n\nFull review here:\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/bc-kings/user-reviews/2200-12641425/"}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1390359261, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520662", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8803386", "votes_up": 25, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198009447731", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1370390992, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 720}, "timestamp_updated": 1390359261, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Its a fun quirky strategy game that is fun to play but I bought the game on sale when it was much cheaper.

Unfortunately in some missions it feels a bit overused, sending you back and forth between maps with no apparent reason other than \"it's there, so let's use it\"; some of the submaps could have easily been implemented as a single map with some \"natural\" boundary like a mountain or river and a same-map teleport.\n\nOne of the campaign missions constantly crashes, which needs a substantial amount of patience (and liberal use of autosave) to eventually work through in order to continue the campaign progress.\n\nAdding to the patience requirement is the speed of your units vs the size of the map vs the amount of back-and-forth required for some missions; basically, some of the game's mechanics result in artificially inflated playtime. One mission took me nearly 2 hours, simply because my hero unit had to walk from one end to the other of 3 different submaps, 2 to 4 times per map. While another mission has you waiting out the enemy's attacks--even if you've managed to gate off the spawn points with walls and guard towers--for what felt like an eternity (maybe it was only 20-30 minutes), before finally opening up a quest that lets you block the spawn points permanently. That quest itself then involves an [b]extremely[/b] slow unit, which you then have to direct to each of the furthest corners of the map before actually completing the mission.\n\nThere are a considerable number of glaring typos, which appear inconsistently, in various parts of the game. \"Got to map\" instead of \"Go To\", \"Ho11y Place\" instead of \"Ho1y\", \"Train Scuto Rider\" instead of \"Scout\", and others. And for some [b]awful[/b] reason, lowercase \"L\" is represented by the same character graphic as \"1\"; this can be seen as ear1y as the profi1e se1ect screen that appears before you can do anything e1se... where the defau1t profi1e name is \"P1ayer\".\n\nThese points aside, it's a pretty interesting theme for an RTS, with a fairly entertaining story; it was engaging enough that I stuck through the campaign to the end.
