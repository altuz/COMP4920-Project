Several technical issues. \n\nKind of like the patrician series, buy low sell high, zoomed in maps of a historical period village with little npcs and official buildings that serve as front end for UI. Had to browse local files and set compatibility to windows 98. Even with going in config and disabling water reflections there was still annoying artefacting and flicker. The mechanics, UI display, and general rules at play showed their age and it seems like a micromanagement intensive grind with high learning curve even if you did get it working."}]}
