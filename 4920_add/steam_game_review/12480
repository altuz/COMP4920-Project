People cite numerous bugs and balance issues as well as underwhelming physics and difficult controls.\n\nI personally could not get any progress happening because the engine would not recognize that I was rotating the camera in the tutorial. Camera rotation was extremely slow even with DPI shot to high heavens both on a hardware level and by going in settings and maxing camera rotation. I advise you get something newer in the genre rather than waste your time playing an obsolete and clunky experience\n\nMaybe check out the company of heroes series for example or men of war series\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/231430/Company_of_Heroes_2/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/244450/Men_of_War_Assault_Squad_2/"}, {"votes_down": 10, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1496842894, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492578", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "32238987", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198039525772", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1496842509, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 33}, "timestamp_updated": 1496843287, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game sucks. The tutorial is too difficult. I bought it cuz I watched the movie. Also the game cover art reminds me of airfix minature soldier set style painting. Cant dive into action. UI design is very bad, control is messed up. Soldiers dont do what you told em. What the f? How can you fight isis like that? No wonder Soviet lost afghan war. :(\nhttp://jobbees.net/img/catalogo/productos/MAF-72000.jpg"}]}
