Balanced classes that make you want to use each of them.  Smooth gameplay mechanics.  Awesome soundtrack.  Great blend of enemies.  Good cooperative gameplay.  Players are usually very friendly and quick to give money or guns if your late joining a match.  Mininmal lag issues and ping is usually great.  In short what isn't there to like about this game?  If you get bored of just killing Zeds there is always Objective mode, not to mention several mods like Toy Master and Defense Alliance 2 and a slew of player created mods, levels, etc.  I definitely recommend this game.
