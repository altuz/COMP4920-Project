A mix of puzzle and RPG sounds really cool, and it is. To start off with, the \"battle system\" is the puzzle portion. You take one turn between you and your enemy matching jewels. Doing this gives benefits depending on what you match. Colored gems give mana for spells, stars give experince, gold gives money, and skulls damage your foe. Matching four or more gives you another turn, and five gives another turn and a wild card that can match with any colored gem and multiply the benifits. It's very complex for a puzzle game.You have to think carefully since your enemy can take advantage of the board just as much as you, and you could give your enemy a really good move if your not careful, you can also have moments where you might want to risk damage for more gold or experince. \n\nThe rpg portion is well done and adds more layers to the battle system. You have stats, classes, spells,and equipment, and all this has massive influence on the gameplay. You can also capture cities for more money, learn enemy spells, forge equipment, use mounts(and level them up too), and complete quests. All of these things give diffrent variations of the battle system as well to keep things fresh. And yes, this game gives you a lot to do.\n\nThe controls are fine as you are mostly clicking, and I love the sound effects as they give matching gems a very satisfying punch, and the sound track is very nice with a middle age fantasy feel.\n\nThe game also has a story and this is where it starts to show flaws. It's cool that they did this for the game, as it gives the game an epic feel, and I do like the story altering decisions. But this story is very generic at best (evil lord bad, you kill him) to strange plot points (how is there an expert undead killer, if the undead hasn't  been seen in centuries?). The A.I. is also really cheap. There is nothing wrong with a challenging game, but an enemy that seems to know what gems are coming down(and responds acordingly) is a bit much. This can make even random encounters tedious if your just trying to get somewhere. You can counter this\nwith a well built charater though, so it's not game breaking or anything.\n\nOverall this is a very uniqe game with plenty to discover and enjoy. You may need patience at times but this is a worth while game that's diffrent from most and I think it's worth playing. 8/10"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501176288, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33837368", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198135380543", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1505570275, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5468}, "timestamp_updated": 1501176288, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Very well made."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501043747, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487576", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "33800960", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197972040704", "num_reviews": 455, "last_played": 1393878613, "num_games_owned": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 965}, "timestamp_updated": 1501043747, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Mixing match-3 gameplay and JRPG battles sounds like a cool idea, and it is for a couple of hours. The further into the game, though, obviously the harder it gets, and the JRPG side of things takes over, requiring more and more grinding if you're not otherwise skilled at the game. \n\nIf you don't love grinding, this game is more problematic than most JRPG-styled games in that at least with a JRPG, you can hit the same buttons super quick, typically even not even having to look at the screen, and clear so many encounters. With PuzzleQuest, however, you actually have to pay some attention to do the matching up of gems. I didn't need a game that made grinding even less enjoyable than it usually is, but I got one in PuzzleQuest."}]}
