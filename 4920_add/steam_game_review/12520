I drive a high roof Kenworth T680 and haul 53ft van trailers. This game has some good things but alot of bad things. \nFor the good you have a very large maps so the time it takes for you to get from say SC to CAli makes it feel like a journey.\nHave several trucks to pick from makes things interesting along with the options to upgrade. But to be honest thats where the good ends for me. \nOff the bat I have alot of issues with how the map was designed. Just poorly mapped out. The way you get your loads by having to drive up a sidewalk while your police meter starts to fill just kinda makes me wonder if Im gonna get nailed while trying to get a load.\nMy biggest issues are for one, the AI. Drivers on the road can get bad, but these were downright dangerously stupid. Like texting while driving and eating a subway sandwich stupid. Cant tell ya how many times i was sideswiped by a 4 wheeler in the game while i tried to pass. What the hell, are they after insurance money?\n2nd, No Hours Of Service. In the game after a while of driving your driver gets tired and starts to black out. Sometimes with catastrophic results. And its random. You will hear a yawn and the next thing you know your causing a 7 car pile up.\nWhy not have a logbook in game to see how long you have been driving for and make it so you have to follow HOS regs like us real drivers. You bought the game so you may as well get the real life expeirace. Hell have random DOT inspections.\n3rd, and for me it just broke the game for me. BRAKES. I mean the brakes that are suppose to be able to stop a fully loaded rig doing 45mph within a reasonable time. I've ran heavy loads before but I never had a truly hard time stopping. now IDK if its because im using a key board or what ut when i use the jakes and the foot brake, i expect to stop fairly quick. I have driven 55MPH and had a stale green change to red on me and even then stop farily safely. What im saying is the brakes in the game, even the upgrade ones, feel like a truck that just went down a steep grade while riding the brakes and contiued to ride em right before they caught fire. They felt soooooo faded.\n\nIn any case i know this company has moved on to some new trucker games and at this point I have just downloaded a new one that was on steam sale. I do have high hopes so we will see"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1492092396, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31117105", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198004114209", "num_reviews": 44, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 32}, "timestamp_updated": 1492092396, "received_for_free": false, "review": "it's a good game but these days it's dated and you should probably get something a bit more modern."}]}
