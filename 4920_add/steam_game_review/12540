Why does it always have to be fictional? I don't get it. Do developers fear lawsuits? Are they not aware how big the 'True Crime' business industry already is? All they have to do is go down to a book store and read. Alas the closest I have played so far to 'True Crime' is 'L.A Noire' and they took a whole range of liberties with that one believe me. \n\nMah-jong Investigations is developed by a company which disbanded in 2009 http://www.mobygames.com/company/zemnott-inc . The game is somewhat similar to 'Criminal Case' found on Facebook but take out the Hidden Object Games and replace them with Mah-jong solitaire and instead of watching the case play out entirely itself, here you have to do some very babyish deductive work.\n\nFor those that don't know this is 'Mah-jong solitaire' (mah-jong itself is a completely different game) its a puzzle game based on finding the same tile strategy. The goal is to match open pairs of identical tiles and remove them from the board, exposing the tiles under them for play. The game is finished when all pairs of tiles have been removed from the board or when there are no exposed pairs remaining.\n\nThis games biggest appeal is also its greatest flaw let me explain. You play as a detective whose ultimate goal is to raise yourself up 10 ranks in the 83rd precinct until you become a 'Deputy Commissioner'. Every time you\u2019re presented with a case and a map with several locations of interest. Once you visit a location a mah-jong solitaire game is laid down and as you match up certain 'special tiles' they have a direct impact on your case and also offers you an extra mini game here and there.\n\nMagnify Glass - Means often mundane information will be presented to you such as there was a country music cd found at the crime scene. Does this have any relevance to the case? No. So you just ignore it.\n\nDNA Pattern - This tile means that some DNA evidence needs to be analysed and you can match up a person's DNA with the evidence found if you would like. It means that you have to play a Tetris style mini game using arrow keys which feels somewhat awkward and long especially if you are checking it out against the wrong person. DNA evidence may not be applicable against perp 1 but it could be applicable against perp 2 or the other half the dozen suspects standing in your queue of queries. So more often than not you will learn to ignore this option.\n\nPolice Car - Not sure if this tile is connected but eventually you have to play a minigame each case where the police car is trying to a catch a suspected culprit and you have to link up matching tiles flashed in a trail behind the speeding car or the car gets away. This is actually quite fun at first, but the further you rank up it starts to get ridiculous in speed and time requirements and you soon learn it has no real bearing to the ultimate outcome of your case so you just ignore and let the car just speed away.\n\nSecurity Camera - Adds additional perpetrators of a crime to your case. Instead of just finding one guy you might now need to find 4. These tiles you can't ignore. The game will request you to find the perps whether you click on them or not.\n\nFingerprint - These tiles often reveal info more pertinent to your case such as 'perp 1 has blonde hair', problem is that you might have a dozen suspects in your line up with blonde hair, so more often than not you will just learn to ignore this.\n\nTelephone - Not sure if this tile is linked up, but your forever answering the bleeding phone and having people tell you mundane info like 'Barry likes Westerns'. Seriously I'm in the middle of a police chase and someone has to phone up and tell me that. Can't I hire a secretary? Since people lie on the phone, you will learn to completely ignore this facet.\n\nInterrogation - You can play a mini game on each suspect which requires you to play a memory match up game like you have 20 chance to find the pairs to 48 tiles. Basically ridiculously impossible odds and so you will learn to ignore this.\n\nAlibi - Finally the only tile that has a definite bearing on your case. Each time you match up one of these it takes a suspect off your line up because they have revealed a iron clad alibi. Collect enough of these 4 mah-jong solitaire games should do it, you have enough people off your suspect list to work out who committed the crime.\n\nThe game with all its additional add-on is dressed up to look like it\u2019s something more than just a mah-jong solitaire game which makes it appealing, but since all those add-ons really don't have a significant impact to your cases you\u2019re really just left with the realization that just playing mah-jong solitaire is your best option if you want to quickly move through the ranks. After about 50 mah-jong solitaire games you start asking yourself will this ever end?\n\nHence the game\u2019s greatest appeal it's mini games is also its greatest weakness since they have no true bearing and just begin to look like unnecessary clutter. The multiple perps behind this crime is Zemnott. You\u2019re looking for a blonde haired person, a dark brown haired, a bald person, and one who wears glasses, most average build, one tall, and one short, most normal height. Ok now with that info go get them. Wait it seems the culprits made a getaway back in 2009 speeding furiously down the highway, angry customers who hate mah-jong solitaire should start pursuit. HOLD YOUR HORSES! This just in \"BARRY LIKES WESTERNS!!!\"\n\n\n\n"}]}
