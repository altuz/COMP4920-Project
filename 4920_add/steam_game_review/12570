Perhaps this is the audience the game is aimed for.  And for young girls it seems to work well. I've played through and to me it seemed a bit repetitive, but kids don't seem to be bothered by that and just enjoy it for what it is. No necessary reading skills, so language isn't important really. There are a lot of graphics that do the explaining when its needed. And the graphics are pretty good. I haven't seen problems with bugs although the low screen resolution is a bother, but my computer handles it just fine. \n\nIf you have girls 6 - 12 I would recommend this. And good games for girls are had to find."}, {"votes_down": 18, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1412679870, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461082", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 9, "recommendationid": "12398302", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198016449120", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1412679870, "num_games_owned": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 9}, "timestamp_updated": 1412679870, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Waiting for the Game of the Year edition to come out."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1483129364, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "28842181", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011699844", "num_reviews": 35, "last_played": 1409288057, "num_games_owned": 1209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 472}, "timestamp_updated": 1483129364, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's a little ones click cooking game.
