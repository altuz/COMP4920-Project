Its hardcore as you take on the extreme world of puppies, kittens, and even lions, wouldnt be hardcore without lions right?  As Dr.Dasiy life and death must be weighed in your hands as you deal with sick animals who are sad, have broken bones and get sick.  Make life changing decisions such as what type of floor to have, or what kind of desk the secretary should have to maximize her efficient output so you can better work with the animals.  A fun story combined with changes in the scenery and types of animals keeps the game interesting.  Sometimes it felt repetitive at the end of the game, but all of that is quickly cast aside as you realize lives are on the line!  \n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $6.99"}]}
