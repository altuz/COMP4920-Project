It would have looked great on the original Atari back in the 80's, but in 2017 on a triple monitor setup the titles are almost unreadible. I mean it. I can barely read the menus at 6000 x 1080. I cannot believe that Steam would offer this game for sale and this now makes me doubt other Steam games in the library. I honestly feel a bit ripped off. This will teach  me not to automatically trust Steam but to look harder at the offerings, as Steam obviously doesn't."}]}
