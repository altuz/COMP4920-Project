The only hair colors availble are blue, blonde, brown, purple, and red.. wtf?\n-Crashes/freezes fairly often\n\n\nIf you want a fun game based on fashion, photography, and runways with good graphics and great gameplay, I highly recommened Jojo's Fashionshow 1 and 2 \nIf you want a fun game based on creating clothes for runways I recommend Barbie Fashion Show for the PC\n\nThis game is neither of the above and is incredibly underwhelming. I could not look past its horrendous fashion, outdated graphics, tons of unappealings options, no tutorial, and completely abhorrent UI. \n"}, {"votes_down": 44, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1297706414, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460612", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 10, "recommendationid": "150504", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963461450", "num_reviews": 27, "last_played": 0, "num_games_owned": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 0}, "timestamp_updated": 1297706414, "received_for_free": false, "review": "AMAZING"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1488928762, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30381598", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198060432714", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1463428381, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 65}, "timestamp_updated": 1488928762, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game crashes when you see the judges about half the time.
