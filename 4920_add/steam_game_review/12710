Rarely, if your mana levels allow it, you are able to cast some spells. The story and gameplay develop really slow since you first have to gather different types of minion hives to even be able to progress in some areas. The story is not really making out a big picture, instead you mostly get a small mission when visiting an area from your older minion. The missions and areas are definetely enjoyable on their own, but putting them into a connected story would have been far cooler.\n\n[b] Combat & Challenge : 4/10 [/b]\nSince the combat is quite passive in Overlord because you mostly just have to wait for your minions to trash everything or at least let them charge and support them by casting spells or hitting some enemies from behind with melee attacks. The game definetely lacked challenge since you always have enough minions to crush all enemies and even if you let them die, there are always enough waiting in the hives. The further I got into the game, the easier it actually became since some objects increase your HP, Mana and forging weapons allows you to progress even quicker without breaking a sweat.\n\n[b] Graphic & Interface : 6/10 [/b]\nThe graphic is neat - the minions look cute and evil at the same time. The humans have an oddly stupid look on them, besides the princess you will meet. The interface has almost no elements to keep it clean and the icons fit the play style of the game. Some areas are more detailed than others, especially if they are unique in the game. There are sadly barely any effects in the game, the game could use something more flashy. \n\n[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 4/10 [/b]\nThe progress - as mentioned in the gameplay section - is quite slow since you have to ignore multiple areas / objects that you have to retract later once you get different types of minions that help you either solve puzzles or simply are the only one that can reach certain objects. After few hours the game started to feel a bit like its trying to look like it has more gameplay time than it actually does by letting you slowly run around areas that you have visited before already. There are multiple puzzles, that especially in mid and later game require some trying outs till you can figure out the correct way to solve it. Besides that you sometimes have to control a single unit to grab an item, multiple minions to perform a special action or kill an enemy you cant reach yourself.\n\n[b] Audio & Immersion : 5/10 [/b]\nThe audio rarely felt impactful, mostly I was lacking audio feedback about my action. You still get a certain level of immersion, especially when playing with headphones and having all sounds on, but do not expect it to be some superior quality or give you any chills. Sound does its job, but sadly nothing more.\n\n[b] Side-Notes [/b]\n[list]\n[*]This game is single player only.\n[*]This game contains no steam achievements.\n[*]This game contains no steam trade cards.\n[*]This game offers minimal replayability.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Summary [/b]\nI would not call Overlord a classic, but some people definetely enjoyed it years ago. It is in my opinion a mediocre game that lacks a bigger story and action feeling. Still, it is enjoyable in its own way - being an evil overlord that commands hordes of cute minions is quite fun. There are multiple different looking areas where you also get the feeling of progressing in a different way, meeting different enemies and situations, killing some bosses. If you expect an awesome audio or graphic, deep story or total immersion, I would not suggest trying it, but if you enjoy oldschool simple but fun games, try it out.\n\n\nI hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game. Rate and leave a comment if you enjoyed reading it.\n~ForestWolf"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499920132, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504902", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 7, "recommendationid": "33495196", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198171951447", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1448144406, "num_games_owned": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1633}, "timestamp_updated": 1499920132, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Other people gets to do the work for you, 10/10\n\nLots of sheeps were harmed during this review."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501665294, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498691", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33966993", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079806306", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1463355844, "num_games_owned": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 264}, "timestamp_updated": 1501665294, "received_for_free": false, "review": "good game"}]}
