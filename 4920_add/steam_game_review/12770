It is a game that could have easily been better in many ways but it doesn't take away the fact that this is a great people. All the naysers are wrong, this game is great.

The positive review is there mostly because I think it's worth playing at least once.\n\n[h1]I.Form [/h1]\n\n[b]a.Graphics[/b]  \n\nFor a 2008 game, it's not that bad, of course the backgrounds are sometimes covered with a weird texture and most of NPC look awful but when it comes to the main characters, the cities or the equipment,they really looking good. I spent hours fascinated by the face of \"Jason\" the main character, the expressions he has on his face when he talks make him so human. We have the same treatment for most of the main characters. The cities are amazing, you can see they wanted to give an \"epic\" ancient greek background and for most of the game it's actually a success. \n\nHowever, the port of the game from the console version makes it a really bad-optimized game and if you don't have a good computer you're going to endure lags and slowing down because there's NO MENU for the graphics settings, the resolution and such. The game looks good but at a price. \n\n\n[b]b.Music and Voice Acting[/b]  \n\nThis is actually the best part of Rise of the Argonauts. The music is just fascinating, they tried to keep that \"epic ancient greek atmosphere\" but sometimes they add variations of other kind of musics like a tribal kind of sound when they arrive in a jungle or some dramatic chants when you arrive in ruins and/or dramatic part of the story. \n\nVoice acting is amazing, Jason is voiced by the incredible Brian Bloom (that is known for roles like Varric Tethras in dragon age and other series like COD or Silent Hill) that delivers a really convincing Jason that can deliver motivational speechs that gives you chills. You can also find Dave Fennoy (Lee Everett, Blue beard...) is the minor role of Daedalus. Overhall all the voicing of the game is good except for some NPC woman that just sound completly out of it.\n\n[h1]II.Content [/h1]\n\n\n[b]a.Gameplay[/b]  \n\nHere's the worst part in my opinion. The gameplay could be devided in two phases, the first is exploring, talking, walking around the islands and solve people problems with a weel of choices. That weel of choices are based on four gods, Ares (violent, brutal), Hermes (Cunning, Sarcasm) Apollo (Kind, true) and Athena (Justice, serious), you will spend most of the time doing that. Each time you choose a perticular god answer, you gain favor for that god that can be use in a Skill tree, each skill tree offer bonuses for one weapon and gods power. Ares offers bonuses for the Maces, Hermes for the swords, Athena for the spears and Apollo for your shield. \n\nYou can also gain favor by finishing quest and or killing a certain amount of enemy, once you did that you earn a title, you can then dedicate that title to one of the four gods and receive favor for that god. You can see all the titles that you can have in the \"stars\" map, each constellation is composed of stars that are lighten when you complete the task they ask. It's not a bad system at all but it could have been improve in a lots of ways.\n\nAnyway, what is really worse in my opinion is the combat system. It's just terrible. Sometimes you just have to mash the heavy attack button and execute your foe and sometimes, your spear just touch them and do nothing, when you're hit, your character falls in a awful way like no human could even do. The boss battles are just not that good, overall the combat is terrible and sometimes during the playthough I wanted fights so bad because I didn't had one in about an hour and then I get to the fights and wished they were over already, it's just weird whatever the weapon you choose. Also boss battle tried to use unique mecanics that no other foe use in the game and sometimes you just have to think to defeat them and it's good but sometimes it just make things worse. \n\nThere's in the game, a boss that project ghost and that you need to reach to kill, once you hurt him enough he send you back to the start and you need to repeat, but the game combat system is so weird that when he shakes the ground to send you back at the start, your character fall like a lifeless pupett and even if you mash the button to get up he stays on the floor for a long time and get hit by ghosts that the enemy send without being able to move or defend himself it's horrible. \n\nAlso Jason is not alone in his quest, you can recruit argonauts, what I thought would be amazing from the start, before I realize you recruit only 4 argonauts (like the 4 gods) in the whole game and it's a bit sad. I will come back to it in the writting section but I needed to mention them because you fight with them. Well the AI is not that smart but it's not annoying in the game except when you get to a particular place in the game where you need to kill the enemy out of the waters and that your two allies will always stay in the middle of the water no matter what. \n\nIt's also a bit sad you can't equip or change in anyway the argonauts, I would have love to see Hercules change clothes since he stayed dirty with mud on him the whole game but it's okay.Jason can collect five of each type of weapon and armor, each with some power on them, it's interesting but personnaly I just put on him what looked the best. \n\nFor me the gameplay is a bit of a let down because you need to do a lot of two-way trip, boss fight are not often enjoyable and sadly the game is short, you do the same thing on 5 Island and a special place (Exploring, talking, fighting) and some boss have to be done more than one time. I think the game had so much potential but this make it less good than it should be. \n\n\n[b]b.Writting[/b]  \n\nI saw a lot of people saying \"If you like Mythology, it's a good game for you\", well, not exactly, You can see big names of the mythology but there is a huge reinterpretation of everything.For exemple Pan devoted to Apollo when you know they have some kind of rivalry, or Medusa and Perseus in a weird Brother/Sister plot everything is messed up. Historical Accuracy is messed up too but it's hard to say the game is bad for that, you see, most of the mythological adaptation take liberties, it's like that and the important thing is to see if they hold things together on the run. Well they tried and it's okay, their liberties are huge but the whole thing is okay. A bit sad that the myth of Prometheus and Epimetheus has been a bit altered and Pandora is completely gone of the picture. \n\nI'm not going to criticize the choices for the mythology in the game anymore but I will talk about the writting of the story and the characters. The story is simple, Jason is the king of Iolcus lost his wife in a demonic attack, the gods (the four mentioned earlier) want to help him and give him some instruction, Jason takes the sea in the Argo and here it is the begining of the tale of \"Jason and the Argonauts\", You have to go to an Island, do some stuff for a god, go to the other search something until you find the golden fleece like in the legend. You can recruit four Argonauts and use two of them on each Island (when you have the choice and it's not always the case), each Argonauts is enjoyable in his own way, they all have a lot of personnality, however, this is ruined by how short the game is, for exemple one of the character has to discover the outside world but when you get that character, you almost visit nothing with her. That could have been so huge, so big as a secondary quest but instead the game says that everything happen after that. The whole plot of the game is simple but okay, side quest are either well written or forgetable, in any case the writting is not bad (maybe one death that was supposed to be sad but is just rushed since there's not enough talk with that character to get attach to it) \n\n[h1]III.Others[/h1]\n\n\n[b]a.Replay Value[/b]  \n\nEven with the choices, the game is pretty much the same every time you play it, you can choose to kill or spare a few foes but that's all. You can replay the same game and visit"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485726756, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512486", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29574109", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197989390503", "num_reviews": 81, "last_played": 1485648377, "num_games_owned": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 853}, "timestamp_updated": 1485726756, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A fun fantasy RPG set in Ancient Greece and follows a quest of King Jason and the Argo crew in search of the Golden Fleece. I was surprised to find out that the game was released back in 2008, considering how good it looks for its time. \n\nThe story takes you to a number of locations, in which you acquire some new party members and other allies to help you on your quest. 3 of the major locations in the middle part of the game can be done in any order of preference. The gameplay consists of combat sections, exploration sections, and dialogue/role-playing sections.\n\nCombat is really well done. You are able to swap between using a mace, a sword, and a spear, and each one has their own combos and special abilities. The special abilities and various passive bonuses are learned from skill progression trees attributed to 4 different Greek deities: Ares, Hermes, Apollo, and Athena. Overall the feel of combat is very fluid and visceral. Enemies get their heads popped by mace swings or get sliced in half by a sword, and so on. Only thing I wasn't too fond of were the boss fights. They weren't terrible, but most of them were somewhat frustrating and at times even cheap. A few required you to do something very unique and unintuitive, and hence a solution would be unclear.\n\nThe rest of the game you'd spend exploring the locations and completing quests, some of which are optional, but completing them gains you additional weapon choices or pieces of armour. There are a lot of the dialogue sections in the game where you get to make decisions and choose how you respond. Even if a dialogue choice doesn't have any consequences, it still has an alignment with one of the four deities, and acquiring a certain number of deity-aligned choices nets you a skill point to spend in their skill tree.\n\nOverall it's a pretty fun adventure RPG and anyone who likes Greek mythology should give it a try. It does change some of the stories and characters from the myths slightly, but it's still done in a fresh and engaging manner to keep things interesting. I'll recommend this game. It's quite underrated.\n\nI've done a 19-part let's play video series on Youtube of me playing the game with live voice commentary in case you're interested to see more of the game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUoAw8WDhqM&index=1&list=PLlpmhqJE5XfrciEZ4vf5BUEchaoBxsqjX\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1429118748, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509943", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "15388566", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990241420", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1429117950, "num_games_owned": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 979}, "timestamp_updated": 1429119999, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Bought this game yesterday since my Steam Library lacked controller friendly RPG's.

I'd say the re-inventing of the mythological tale is this game's strong point. Overall I say buy it.

In this version, Jason's bride Alceme is killed during their wedding, and Jason sets out to find the Golden Fleece in order to bring her back to life. The story is pretty straightforward, and being based on preexisting lore, you can immediately tell what will happen. But the writers manage to keep you invested with a number of interesting characters from Greek mythology whom Jason encounters along the way, and having all the elements you want from a Greek legend. You travel various colorful locations, meet and fight alongside heroes of legend, slay great beasts, and even take part in a philosophical debate(in my opinion, one of the best sections of the game).\n\nCombat is your standard action h'n's deal. Light attack, heavy attack, dodge, block, parry. You have three weapons, a sword, a mace and a spear, each with its own strengths, weaknesses and a distinct playstyle. You can switch them on the fly, and over the course of your journey you will find better weapons, even ones blessed by the gods themselves which have special properties. The combat is pretty good, but it is way too easy. Even on hard, the game is ridiculously easy, unless you refuse to level up, in which case it gets boring, not hard, because you lack the damage to kill enemies with more health while being able to dodge all of their attacks.\n\nNow, a bit on the RPG elements of the game, its by far best segment. This game has a really unique way of leveling up. Jason is favored by four gods: Ares, Apollo, Hermes and Athena. During conversations, all of your choices are favored by a certain god. Choosing one will grant you favor with that god, and once you accumulate enough favor, you earn an aspect point you can then invest in that god's skill tree. Also, the game keeps track of your deeds, which are a sort of achievements. You can devote these deeds to the gods in exchange for favor. It is a really unique take on XP, and I enjoyed it quite a lot. Also, the skills are varied and interesting, with each god granting you skills and powers which favor a certain playstyle reflective of his or her field of dominion.\n\nHaving discussed the three main aspect of the mix of genres this game covers, it's time to talk about how they work together, which is a bit...meh. The game's pacing and story/combat balance is really, really bad. There are lengthy sections where you do no combat at all, followed by either a short battle or a long, drawn out sequence of battles where enemies just keep on coming for you to oneshot. The story and combat don't really work together, they seem more like being thrown in together.\n\nThis is one of those cases where the whole is better than the sum of its parts. Though all of these elements have great ideas but more of an ok execution, and even work to mixed results together, the game as a whole is still really enjoyable. I had a blast with it, and the 12 hours I put in just flew by. Even with the easy combat, and bad pacing, I was never actually bored, and almost burned through it, without even noticing that I had played for that long, which is not something I can say for many other games.\n\nDespite its flaws, I would highly recommend the game, especially if you are a fan of Greek mythology. You may not get the greatest of stories, or challenging combat, but you can have a great time, which shows that with fresh ideas, even an ok game can be a great experience."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1410296368, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504015", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "12037608", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198029972608", "num_reviews": 209, "last_played": 1468049808, "num_games_owned": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 30}, "timestamp_updated": 1495267327, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[b]PROS:[/b]\n+ epic adventure feel\n+ boss fights\n+ multiple fight styles based on your weapon\n+ skills tree\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n- (after a while) repetitive combat with minions\n- limited customization options in the main menu\n- more difficult to play with keyboard & mouse\n\n[b]Comment:[/b]\nI will start off with the note that this game is definitely not for everyone. It is not something you will think about with a nostalgic feeling after years. It is clearly a port to PC and as that has limited video settings which have to be configured in the .ini file. But despite it all the important question to ask yourself when playing a game is - IS IT FUN? And here is why I recommend it as it brought me lots of fun. I played the non-steam version and even though it depicts the Argonaut storyline very loosely you cannot help but get that \"epic quest\" feel here. Henchmen combat is okay but it is the boss fights that really take it. Overall a mediocre game that can be a lot of fun ... if you let it.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1484089377, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501282", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29172328", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198271711524", "num_reviews": 25, "last_played": 1484382981, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 550}, "timestamp_updated": 1488633209, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I played this game back in 2009 and now bought it on steam to refresh memories of it one more time.

While there is much to be desired - not least of all varied facial animations - the story is stellar, the soundtrack is brilliant and the voice acting is wonderfully delivered.

The myths that the game draws on are greatly varied, and while some elements have been changed so much from the original myths that they are unrecognisable, there are plenty of references to Greek myths both well-known and obscure.

Yes, it's quite easy and not very long, the plot is kind of stupid in places, the loading times disguised as cutscenes (I'm talking to you, gates to the Acropolis of Mycenae) become tedious because there's much running back and forth, and it's not the best looking game out there. Why did I like it then?\n\nWell, I'm a sucker for Greek mythology and I think this game gets the atmosphere right. Mostly. Don't get me wrong, the legendary characters, places and stories of old are misplaced, mixed and butchered without remorse, when not completely made up. If you want a more canonical depiction of Greek myths go play Apotheon (seriously, go play it, it's awesome!), this is more like a fanfiction or an alternate reality but still feels Greek and mythological enough.\n\nI specially like the god alignment system. Dialog options don't influence the plot but they do influence gameplay because your dialog choices are aligned with one of four deities (Athena, Apollo, Ares and Hermes). Winning their favour by choosing their dialogs or dedicating your deeds (ingame achievements) to them lets you level up in their respective skill trees and unlock different powers and buffs. To me it feels very satisfying to devote yourself to a god (Athena rules and anyone who disagrees will eat my spear), it really gets me immersed.\n\nThe dialogs and characters are mostly well written. Each of your companions have different personalities, and they interact between them and with the enviroment in different ways (Pan is snarky and will go on about old legends and trivia, Achilles is obnoxious and will brag about being the best fighter ever, and so on). Like Mass Effect, you take your ship (the Argo, a steampunk-ish mechanical Greek galley) to different locations and decide which companions will go ashore with you. Of course it's much more limited and samll than Mass Effect, with only five or six main locations or so, and only four companions to choose from, although you collect a few other characters with whom you can speak while on board the Argo.\n\nThe combat, although not very tricky, is fluid, fun and bloody, and can get quite spectacular once you start throwing god powers all over the place.\n\nAesthetically, it's good enough. Some of the enviroments look pretty and colorful, like Iolcus palace (I really liked the guards openning the doors for you, I know it's probably there just to hide a loading time but it made me feel like a king and I've seen too many magical self-openning doors in games to appreciate the detail), while others are much more dull and uninspired. The bronze in your armour is shiny and many of the armours and wepons themselves are not too overly fantastical in design, which I like.\n\nI haven't experienced crashes or major bugs that I remember, as many reviews say, and I played for several hours at a time. I guess I got lucky. I bough this game on a sale for dirt cheap (1.75 EUR) fearing that it would be awful or crash on me, but I was pleasantly surprised and, after completing it, I woudn't mind having paid more for it."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1422271473, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498357", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "14176345", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198080772755", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1436009421, "num_games_owned": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2264}, "timestamp_updated": 1422596205, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I really enjoyed its unique leveling up system which is still very good even to this day standards and a retaelling of a greek story worthy of being told now admittly no new game + were you can keep you old abitly while leveling up new would be nice but when it comes down to it how many games let you be a greek king kicking ass form your dead wife's grave to hell and back again\n\nEdit \n\nI just complete the game on the hardest diffculty and have to say even though this game has a great leveling up system and bosses that are design with attack patterns instead of over powered attacks with high health bars and no instanted death and even though limit a varied range of wepoins and armour \n\nI will emit the game has some downsides like for some reason the carmea is some annnoying and theres never a map but to be fair it not like you get lost all the areas are small which kinda suck as well and alt tab some crases the game.\n\nNever the less after passing this game on the hardes diffculty a would give it a 8/10 and recommend it to many people"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1468740611, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504151", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "24367493", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197972805184", "num_reviews": 22, "last_played": 1391636143, "num_games_owned": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2232}, "timestamp_updated": 1468740611, "received_for_free": false, "review": "if you like GREEK MYTHOLOGY this is the right game for you."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1428542230, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496978", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "15272132", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198094533559", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1432009635, "num_games_owned": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 78}, "timestamp_updated": 1428542230, "received_for_free": false, "review": "itz a really good game just dont like the fact you have to run everywhere even if itz a very far distance to 1 ojective.\n\n\nId give it a 7/10"}]}
