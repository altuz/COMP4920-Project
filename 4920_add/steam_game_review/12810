Not a lot of story, but quite well written and voiced.\n+ Original. Sort of a puzzle game in disguise with semi-strategical combat. I haven't played anything quite like it.\n+ Visual design. Although the game is old now the visual style holds up well and reminds me of the good ol' Warcraft style.\n\nCONs:\n- Frustrating controls and puzzles at times.\n- Autosave system. I don't mind taking away our ability to quicksave, but this game just saves too infrequently and wastes your time if you're doing one of the aforementioned frustrating puzzles and you have to do a large section all over again.\n- Bugs. I encountered several, and, although nothing too bad, it's worth mentioning.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507075741, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499429", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35459166", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025196562", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1410147039, "num_games_owned": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 353}, "timestamp_updated": 1507075741, "received_for_free": false, "review": "From a mechanical perspective, the gameplay is a somewhat lower quality version of Pikmin. From a narrative and evil overlording perspective, the Evil Overlord features are insufficient at best - I lost all interest when, after taking over a town by force of arms, I couldn't open locked gates to entire parts of the town. Even though I was literally the ruler of the whole town. Not because of any sort of defiant holdouts still fighting against me, mind you - but for no reason given in game whatsoever. If you're looking for an escapist exercise in holding absolute power in your own hands, this game won't provide it."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505786099, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494759", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35056239", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198405095311", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1501879224, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 9}, "timestamp_updated": 1505786099, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Kevin approves."}, {"votes_down": 11, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504807493, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482125", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34799520", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198046002595", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1504809580, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2113}, "timestamp_updated": 1504807493, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I like the game played it a good while, but after playing for 30 hours.
