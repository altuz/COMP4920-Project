It brought fewer new elements into the game than the previous two and wasn't well acclaimed by fans. The game upon release on steam suffers from bugs caused by the engine changing and various other things. The game was also originally supposed to be an exclusive for the doomed Sega Dreamcast. The plot takes place during the events of half-life and Instead of playing as gordon freeman, you play as the ordinary watchman Barney Calhoun(the one you see banging on the door in the beginning of half-life). The story also features some new faces not yet seen in the series.\n\nPROS:\n-The story is very well paced and put together very nicely. You play as Barney Calhoun during the cascade and cover up operation in black mesa. Not spoiling the rest in case you haven't picked up a copy in the 20 years its existed.\n-The environment is very immersive as it is a long seamless road to the end of the game with, as the definition of seamless implies, zero cutscenes or immersion breaking interruptions.\n-The gunplay involves the same weapons from half-life with no new additions. The arsenal available is pleasently loud, very powerful feeling, and quite fun to use when eliminating the enemy.\n-The ending is great for what it is\n-Has an HD reskin to give a fresh coat of paint.\n\nCONS: (Not even half-life is safe from sin, sorry) Please note that i am extremely aware that this game is an oldy.\n-Controls feel floaty and thats not very great to say when this game is a puzzle platformer.\n-Same issues as the original, guns feel not very effective at some times and very effective at others. No idea whats going on here but it hasn't deterred me from playing.\n-Unlike the other half-life games before this one, this installment is the buggiest out of the bunch. Plentiful missed triggers and some doors not opening like they should all throughout the entirety of the game. Buy at ones own risk.\n\nThis game isn't a must have unlike the original but usually it comes bundled with it so give it a play(used to come free). I picked the entire series up in a frantic buy in a summer sale and it was worth it. if anything it's textures for gmod if you don't have much interest in it. With the bugs still not being fixed to this very day we have the second lowest score out of all half-life games that i'll be giving out.\n\n6 blue vests out of 10\n\nNormally i'd say Decay is up next but i've run into a snag...it's not on steam.\n\nThe game is very much available elsewhere but hasn't had an offical release on steam. Only thing i can do is go overtime on this one and plant my review here. DOUBLE REVIEW.\n\n*clears throat*\n\nHALF-LIFE: DECAY<\n\nThe fourth installment in the half-life series is once again the progeny of valve teaming with gearbox. It brought a handful of new elements into the game than the previous three with one being a choice of a protagonist. The game was never released on steam and still to this day is a playstation 2 exclusive minus the couple of ports to the PC. The plot takes place prior/during the events of half-life and Instead of playing as gordon freeman, you play as a pair of gordon freeman's colleagues. The story also features some new faces not yet seen in the series.\n\nBeing that this game is a platform exclusive i have not played it. My review here is based on the combine overwiki and gameplay footage.\n\nPROS:\n-The story is very well paced and put together very nicely. You play as either Gena Cross or Colette Green during the cascade and cover up operation in black mesa. Not spoiling the rest in case you haven't picked up a copy in the 20 years its existed.\n-The environment is very immersive as it is a long seamless road to the end of the game with, as the definition of seamless implies, zero cutscenes or immersion breaking interruptions.\n-The gunplay involves the same weapons from half-life with no new additions. The arsenal available is pleasently loud, very powerful feeling, and quite fun to use when eliminating the enemy.\n-The ending is great for what it is\n\nCONS: (Not even half-life is safe from sin, sorry) Please note that i am extremely aware that this game is an oldy.\n-Controls feel floaty and thats not very great to say when this game is a puzzle platformer.\n\nThis game isn't on steam as i've said before so you can't purchace it. Decay is available as an unoffical port elsewhere to download by the various european/eukrainian developers that made it so. Watch out for fishy links and enjoy.\n\n8 test samples out of 10\n\nNext is Half-life: Source......ugh."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506774198, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35335141", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198201289426", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1506773821, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 139, "playtime_forever": 675}, "timestamp_updated": 1506774198, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a extremely underated game.

The level design is incredible and the puzzles are never too boring. The game is a blast and in some parts is even better than the original in my opinion. I wont spoil the ending but it is one of the most suspensful moments I have ever played. You will see what I mean when you get there. I highly reccomend this game it is very short and extremely fun. Of course it has the cool easter eggs to the original everyone will love.
