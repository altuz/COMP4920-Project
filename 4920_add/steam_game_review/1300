SiN Episodes started with many interesting choices : episodic distribution, dynamic difficulty adjustment, source engine, but if the result is not \"bad\" it's not \"great\" either. The level design is somewhat inventive in the \"corridor shooter\" style, but the enemies have a smell of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and the combat is not that engaging. The storytelling is mostly done througth forced dialog and cutscenes which is kinda dated now. All in all, I think SiN Emergence actually lacks memorable moments."}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1493078576, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491475", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "31347982", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198028955341", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1493077685, "num_games_owned": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 442}, "timestamp_updated": 1493078576, "received_for_free": false, "review": "There were fleeting moment of clever levels design harkening back to 90's and that felt awesome. Inbetween those fleeting moments of clever level design were just complete awful set pieces that were miserable as fuck to go through. Add on to that there were gameplay moments that absolutely made no sense if you hadn't paid attention to the progress of the story inside SiN. (Srsly, green fumes will help you and not hurt. Just assbackwards logic in general.) At least the characters design is somewhat tolerable. But this game is just a fucking time capsule of FPS in the aughts.
