This game could be good if everyone would come together and do something tactical, realistic, and it may cost money while this game is free but just buy a game thats a good representation of our nations military, where theres a more active and possibly better community, its gonna be hard to find a game thats accurate, realistic and with a thriving friendly community of active players.
