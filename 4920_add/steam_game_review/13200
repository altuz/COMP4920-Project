This is a pure old school run n' gun game. No morality choices or complex social issues here. It's a simple game to unwind after office or a tiring day.\n\nPros:\nTight gameplay with lots of weapons\nMission variety\nWidescreen resolution works without any fuss\nGame is made on Unreal 2 engine and graphics are ok\nOne of the few single player games with a story in the Unreal universe\n\nCons:\nVery limited mod support\nNo multiplayer\nAnyone looking for next-gen graphics will be disappointed\nPlayer speed is very slow (can change with a console code though)\nGame length is short\n\n\nComing to the story, it does not appear to hold great promise at the beginning. But as you play on, something clicks in place and you begin to care about this band of outcasts who're patrolling the fringes of space alongside you. Each has their own backstory and a sad past. It all comes into place at the ending which is very well done imo and makes you wish there was more. However, one shouldn't go in expecting some heavy emotional stuff. Like i said, run n' gun! \n\nAlso, this game features one of the coolest intros(not a cinematic but a looping musical video). However, it refused to play on my system. There's supposedly a fix somewhere or you can go look up youtube."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499027633, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485616", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33151607", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197993464013", "num_reviews": 130, "last_played": 1467768240, "num_games_owned": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 84}, "timestamp_updated": 1499027633, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This had so much promise to it. I was highly disappointed when one of the games most known for its fast paced action had a sequel resulting in slow, lumbering combat that sapped all possible enjoyment out of it.\n\nThe game could have been so much more and fell right on its face.\n\nThis is one of those rare titles that desperately needs an overhaul. Someone needs to rebuild this game using a newer Unreal engine version and speed up the movements to enhance the fun of the combat. The game could still be great one day if it would just be done right."}]}
