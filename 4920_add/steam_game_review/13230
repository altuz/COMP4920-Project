Contrast  that with the modern world of pay DLC, maps costing more than the original game, and limited user input, you see what a barren, sterile world modern games can be, but I digress...\n\nThere are no classes for characters, so you are all free to blast away equally, but the maps are clever and engaging, and the bots intelligence is easily good enough to be a challenge.\n\nIf you have grown up on consoles and COD, you might find this lacking in story depth and graphics detail, many calling it \"old school\", but the playability is first class, and is a great pick up and blast away game that holds its own a generation after it first made its debut."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503716757, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538133", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34495155", "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197970632246", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1505486862, "num_games_owned": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 968}, "timestamp_updated": 1503716757, "received_for_free": false, "review": "13 years laters and still stands up.
