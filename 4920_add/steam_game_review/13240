Weapons feel good to use, maps are well-designed, the A.I. is quite intelligent for its time, friggin' awesome soundtrack by Alex Brandon (as always).

Weapons felt weak and didn't have much mechanics depth. But this game, sucked me in right on. Although I don't nowadays play the vanilla game really, more the numerous mods.\n\nPros:\n\n- Wide weapon variety, only 3 conventional firearms. Two weapons you spawn with are a pretty potent and satisfying sounding pistol, secondarily a pneumatic hammer device that can be used for jumping higher than without and it can deflect projectiles with the altfire. Third weapon shoots globs of volatile and sticky green goo, secondary fire loads up a larger glob that travels very painfully slow but can turn opposition inside out in a single hit. 4th weapon is a fully automatic plasma gun, altfire however is a cutter beam that is seriously deadly if you can keep aim on a frantically moving enemy. Fifth weapon is a minigun. Primary fire is slow but remains accurate on any range, secondary fire spews bullets madly but has high spread. Sixth weapon shoots sharp discs that are a one hit kill if they hit neck. Secondary fire has them explode on contact, handy for example so that you can push enemies over a ledge. Seventh weapon is a cumbersome shotgunish thing that shoots instead of pellets, about fist sized metal chunks. Secondary fire tosses the whole shell, it explodes on contact. Eighth one is a good old rocket launcher whose explosions seriously throw an enemy around nicely. Altfire lobs the rockets aa grenades. Ninth weapon is a sniper rifle. Nuff said. Last one is a mininuke missile launcher. Whoa, I wrote a book.\n\n- Bots' AI is impressive.\n\n- Lots of mods of all types kinds. I recommend Nali Weapons 3, Excessive Unreal 2, Xidia, Seven Bullets and Operation Na Pali.\n\n- Great map design. Most maps have beautiful scenery yet still perfect placement of pickups and smooth \"flow\".\n\n- Gunplay. While I told about the weapons already, what they do each, I didn't mention that they are satisfying to shoot. Loud and clear sounds. Proper viewshake.\n\n- Variety of gamemodes. Capture the flag, deathmatch, tdm. Then the less conventional ones are Assault which is an objective game mode, where attacking team must achieve the end goal before time runs out, and defenders have to prevent them from doing so. Another is Domination where you must set a control point to be in your team's control, then you start scoring every few seconds points. \n\nCons:\n\n- PVP isn't terribly active anymore.."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505261549, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34910672", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198047377844", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505099033, "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 44}, "timestamp_updated": 1505261549, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a must buy!
