The game came out in 1998 and was impressive for the time. \nThe games guns feel good and the the graphics are bad but the areas are still cool to look at. There are secrets to find. Theres a patch 227 patch it makes the game brighter because it's dark without the patch and also you can play on servers with the patch but the community is small very small. Now let's talk about the soundtrack. I don't know what the songs in the soundtrack are called but they sound great and fit the areas you hear the songs in. One of my only problems with the game is the level design. Sometimes you can get stuck and don't know what to do. The games a great game 9/10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505900938, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507239", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35080836", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198289884206", "num_reviews": 28, "last_played": 1498993709, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 11}, "timestamp_updated": 1505900938, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The original childhood gaming experience....would reccomend if you like old games but i couldnt play it again after all these years the gameplay was just to bad.
