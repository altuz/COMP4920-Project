This game' story was great - it is conected to the first game Sands of Time but is not nessesary to play it first to have a gameplay experience - just story would make more sense? - I guess. \n\nWhy I wrote \"a good experience\" with question mark was because many times I put this game on hold. Sometimes it was too confusing - got lost many times. The game is sort of open world which isn't really nessesary. Running backwards and not knowing where I had to go was a total waste of time (the map was just a picture where was a prince icon that changed location after moving a while and red cross as a mission  but which way I had to move - no idea). It wouldn't had changed a thing unless found a health upgrade secrets. Sometimes the game got too difficult. I was playing on the hardest difficutly - hoping for better game experience  - I love challenges.  After experiencing the difficulties I do not recommend it. It can ruin the game feel - too hard to kill the enemies. I am not sure how it is on easier difficulty but I assume it will be much more enjoyable experience. I still managed to finish the game on the hardest difficulty. But yeah - if you do play I strongly recommend to play it on easy or medium. \n\nCombat system in this game is great - lot of possibilities to attack. Main weapon kept changing to more powerful one throught out the game. There was a possibility to use dual weapons by grabbing dead enemy's sword, hammer, axe or whatever did they were using. The ways to perform attacks was incredibly high amount - use suroundings - jump off the wall - roll, spin, throw, combo slash etc. - very nice combat system.\n\nGraphically speaking it was pretty decent - it is pretty old game (2004) - in old days it looked pretty awesome.\n\nThis game was much more violent in every way than the previous one - music - graphics - animations. I liked it.\n\nI am strongly recommending this game if you did like Prince of Persia: Sands of Time.\n\nxTzharkz [Eric]."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499545118, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508543", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33384622", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198188286203", "num_reviews": 26, "last_played": 1471364912, "num_games_owned": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 883}, "timestamp_updated": 1499545118, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game seriously improved the combat from it's predecessor. The story is more dark than Sands of Time, which some will like and others may not. The parkour mechanics are still excellent. There are a few sections where I got a bit frustrated and had to put the game on hold for a while. If you power through moments like these it will be worth it later, they shouldn't last too long. You get to upgrade to a new sword every so often in the game, and you get to dual wield using the weapons enemies drop once they're killed. I really liked this dual-wielding mechanic. There are loads of combos you can learn off, and if you use the Sands powers simultaneously it can make for some really enjoyable fights.\nBe aware there is a fair bit of backtracking in the game, but it's not that annoying, as you often access new areas on your second time through.\nI would recommend this game for fans of The Sands of Time. If you're new to the series I'm not sure if you'd like it so much."}]}
