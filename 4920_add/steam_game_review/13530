There is a nice mix between combat, platforming and puzzle solving. The story is well done and fits as a nice conclusion to the series.  The inclusion of stealth mechanics is a nice touch forcing you to rethink certain scenarios, or you can just rush into battle if you prefer. \n\nThe Bad:\n\nLots of glitches and control issues. Gamepad doesn\u2019t work in some menu screens and key bindings are not saved forcing you to rebind them every time you start.  Using K/M creates an even more frustrating experience. There is one almost game breaking glitch near the end of the game making it almost impossible to complete the game. \n\nConclusion:\nAlthough one of my favorite Prince of Persia games, it is impossible to ignore all the glitches and bugs that makes this a somewhat frustrating experience to play.  I loved this game on consoles but the PC version leaves a lot to be desired. \n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501060259, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504384", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33804542", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198325261156", "num_reviews": 28, "last_played": 1501059613, "num_games_owned": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 548}, "timestamp_updated": 1501060259, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones is the favorite one out of the 3 games (Sands of Time, Warrior Within & The Two Thrones). \n\nGameplay was on spot, combat system perfect and graphics were fine (old game 2005). \n\nWhat could I say about it. The Two Thrones is connected with two previous games so the story is all connected. It is not nessesarry to play the previous games to enjoy this one as well - tho I do recommend to play them first. The game will make much more sense then.\n\nMain thing in this game is parkour, jumping around and progressing - puzzles in the game were not too hard.\n\nCombat system in this game is perfect. Charecter has the main weapon dagger but if want to can use also dual weapons by picking up dead enemies weapon. There are numerous combo attack possiblities - plus can use enviroment. There is also stealth possibility which made it much more fun. Numberous amout of enemies and 4 boss battles in which 3rd was the hardest while others were childs play - I was playing on the hardest difficulty.\n\nAnyway the game was really enjoyable - I recommend to play it.\n\nxTzharkz [Eric]."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502545218, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500930", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34191510", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197997430271", "num_reviews": 35, "last_played": 1502045016, "num_games_owned": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 600}, "timestamp_updated": 1502545218, "received_for_free": false, "review": "More than 10 years later, still fun, as I played it again in 2017.\n\n+ Coolest (although clich\u00e9) POP story.\n+ Good graphics\n+ Good gameplay\n+ Works with XBox 360 Gamepad.\n\n- Needs a hack to play widescreen.\n- No Cloud save support.\n- No Steam Overlay support.\n- Slow controls but for today's standards. \n- Sometimes it lacks hints to progress (but again for today's standards)"}]}
