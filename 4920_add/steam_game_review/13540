Games get older if you get older. But just like me, you may feel nostalgic for the time when you played the demo version of R6 Vegas for first time and played the same demo mission again and again where the news reporter is not exactly trapped at Downtown Vegas but at Dante's Casino, and after you save her you are ambushed by tons of terrolists and the demo is finished there. You may still feel like going back to the erra when you could enjoy R6 Vegas so much that you just do aiming and covering repeatedly even if no enemies are infront of you because it is just cool. You might have played too many shooting games the last ten years and then, cannot feel excited much by R6 Vegas any more just like you cannot be by a porn video after watching it hundreds times. Me too. I played R6 Vegas today again, but my mood did not last 1 hour. But it still does not matter. Everything is a part of my own memories. No one can abuse it. I can still play this game if I start missing again. I love nearly everthing about this game. Only one thing I am confused by this game is that we are basically not allowed to kill any civilians or it results in game over except killing one black guy at Nevada Dam who kindly tells us the dam is occupied by terrolists. Only god knows why."}]}
