Even tho this is the HD remaster which came out in 2011, that only altered the graphics of the game, you just have to appriciate how damn well the game has aged.\n\nThe game captures the essence of stealth games, no \"wallhack\" sonar mechanics which you have on any game released in the past few years, no overpowered close quearters combat mechanics, quick time events or anything like that. Just you, your night vision goggles and your wits. Of course i dont mind having all that stuff games nowdays have, but sometimes its good to go back to basics, It\u00b4s all about finding the right time to advance, staying in the shadows, moving silently and beign stealthy, you are equiped with a few guns, but those truly are a last resort, obvioulsy there are times where it is a good idea to shoot enemies too, but most of the time guns are used to diable lights.\n\nOne thing to note is that this game has probably one of the best stealth game keyboard and mouse controls, everything feels easy and precise to do and i do absolutely love the controls. The soundtrack is perfect too.\n\nAnd of course, i have missed that trademark Sam fisher humour.\n\nIf you like stealh games, this is one of the essentials."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505016246, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34852705", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198165560514", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505014496, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1080}, "timestamp_updated": 1505016423, "received_for_free": false, "review": "(Please give it a try. Ignore the negative reviews, those are just a bunch of children who don't know patience. You can refund after all)!\n\n\"Thats the name of the Game!\" \nSome backstory: When I was a kid I had the treyarch spiderman movie games and in spiderman 1 the 2nd to last final levels were all about stealth, getting codes in oscorp, hiding from robots and cameras, it was my favorite level! This is my first ever splinter cell and I bought in a discounted 4 pack bundle (I plan to play through them all). I have to say I am impressed by how well it's aged! This is those spiderman levels but as a whole game! \n\nThe 10 dollars are worth it! The story while a little cliche is actually quite enticing and realistic. This is the HD remaster from the original port and while this is the 1st game I've hit 200fps on the highest settings it actually looks quite alright. Definitely much smother than the original. \n\nSome Considerations\n-The controls feel very responsive but you might want to rebind some keys.\n\n-Seeing black and white the whole can be a little bothersome at times but that's the whole IP of splinter cell when putting on the tribonoculars and hearing the BWEE sound. \n\n-The BWEE sound is very satisfying <3\n\n-The soundtrack is fantastic and music changes depending on your actions (If your spotted, in the clear, dead, ect).\n\n-This is a game about trial and error if you play through it blind (which you should).\n\n-Tons of replay value as you can always handle encounters in different ways.\n\n-Like all stealth games patience and timing is key.\n\n-Tip: In order to open keypad locked doors check bodies you've encapacitated for a satchel. Those will usually contain the password.\n\n-Each mission introduces a new nice mechanic. \n\nI don't know what to say that could possibly be bad about this game! This was a fantastic experience and please try it out for yourself since you can always refund it afterall.
