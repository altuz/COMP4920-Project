Unless the Multiplayer I played YEARS ago was this, I haven't touched it.\n\nThat all said: This might be the best game produced under the Tom Clancy label. Even in 2017\n\nI love Ghost recon (Well at least up to GRAW 2, I need to try Future soldier one of these days), I kind of have a love-hate relationship with Rainbow Six. But this game is far less frustrating than the these yet still offers a signifigant challenge.\n\nAs far as graphics go, the animations, Over a decade later* still hold up, even if the models are obviously First Xbox quality. They really breathe life into this game and are just so darn smooth!\n\n*an aside: and hillariously just shy over a decade of the  \"fictional future of 2007\" The last newsreel was marked Aug 29 2007, I'm writing this 9/8/17...how fitting!\n\nWhat sold the game to me was Interrogations: In order to get them, you have to sneak up to a guard and grab him, then if there is one avalable (usually there is) use your context menu to do so. Not only are they useful but they are some of the most entertaining pieces of banter I've ever heard in a game. This caused me to do something I normally never do in stealth games that give me lethal options. Try not to raise an alarm!\n\nGameplay, while it does take some getting used to (like mousewheel to change move speed) and it could have used a better tutorial (all you get are some videos) controls well enough and gives you plenty of useful options, but it will not overwhelm you.\n\nGunplay works well enough, but sam isn't the most accurate shot most of the time, and the AI is usually a better shot than you, so you gotta get some kind of advantage over them, Be it positioning, lighting, or even a momentary distraction. This is a good thing! It prevents you from simply mowing down everyone but at the same time, if you do have to engage someone (and there are a couple times where you do), it's not painful to use. Bonus points for a realistic portrayal of suppressors here. Enemies will still hear your gunshots despite being suppressed, so don't expect to be a completley silent assassin while using your firearms.\n\nThis extends to the balance of difficulty It's just right. It's not ragequittingly difficult by any means, but it's by no means easy. Guard AI is reasonably intelligent, they will notice missing details, will search for bodies, and the same trick gets less effective the more you use it on the same guard, though it would be cool if they noticed that other guards are missing. As you probably know, the game has meters showing how much noise you are making, the background level, and the amount of light you are exposed to (light does seem to be a bit finnicky in some rare areas, but usually it was to my advantage). This mechanic does two things, First make it feel less unfair when you do get caught as the game gives you an exact reason, and secondly you can use it to manipulate guards to leave their posts, draw back into the darkness and set up an ambush. It's great!\n\nIn short, no matter what you do, you have to use your head. The game gives you the tools, it's up to you to use them intelligently, and the game rewards you for it.\n\nThe only other area I think where Chaos theory falls short is the story presentation, and even then it's uneven, some parts are great, one is a good idea, but needed a bit of work, some are kind of standard, and one...is quite honestly very poorly executed. I won't spoil which but I will say there is one part that leads you (or at least me) to believe you can interfere with a meeting, but the game goes out of it's way, breaking it's own rules even, to ensure you do not. \n\nRegardless I Highly reccomend it. It has aged very well and your enjoyment will increase once you figure out how to control sam, Take your time to learn how to traverse environments and use gadgets, you will be rewarded with intelligent use of them."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504640286, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510218", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34763278", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198151624419", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505080816, "num_games_owned": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 60}, "timestamp_updated": 1504640286, "received_for_free": false, "review": "hell yes."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504666322, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34768516", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027873867", "num_reviews": 61, "last_played": 1504472609, "num_games_owned": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 109}, "timestamp_updated": 1504666322, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I really don't even like stealth games, typically, but I'll recommend this one.
