The images are for the PS2/XBOX/GCN version of the game. (Notice the [current gen] in all the images.) However what you will buy is actually the PS3/XBOX360/PC version of the game.\n\nIn addition, the PS2 version of Double Agent is made by Ubisoft Montreal, but last time I check, the PC version you will be buying here is made by Ubisoft Shanghai. The PS2 version also featured different gameplay and levels than the PC version, but supposedly they have the same story.\n\n[b]So this page basically is one GIANT misrepresentation of the product you will be buying.[/b] This has been the case since this game has been put on sale on Steam, and is still the case as of Sept 5th, 2017, the date this review is written.\n\nUnder most consumer laws in the first world, you have every right to ask for a refund, because of the misrepresentation. But not me. I bought it before the days when there is a refund policy on Steam. So I got stuck with this turd.\n\nI'm not going to comment on the gameplay or the stability of the game, because based on the misrepsentation alone I would not recommend ANYONE to buy this game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505010729, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500431", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34851505", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198000971575", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1505004596, "num_games_owned": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 693}, "timestamp_updated": 1505010729, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Splinter cell: Double agent. Oh boy, talk about missed potential. I heard some bad things about the PC port before, which is why i never bought it, i got the game when it was included in a bundle with the older Splinter Cell titles + Conviction, which i wanted to replay and i thought why not play them all. After all, how bad can it be. Oh was i wrong, theres plenty of wrong with it. The game itself would be good, but its ruined mostly by the god awful PC port, if that wasnt enough, there is several things wrong with developement decissions about the overall gameplay too.\n\nLets start with whats done well with Double agent:\n\n- To this day, Double agent would be the only Splinter Cell game with somekind of replayability (other then playing on harder difficoulty), there are multiple endings and a bunch of big choices in the story. \n\n- The missions here are diverse, actually well done, with enough variety in locations, objectives and most of all, they dont repeat themselves. Only downside here is that the number of missions is pretty small.\n\n- Characters are way better, more memorable, better voice acted. \n\n- The consept of double agent is pretty good, you have trust meters for both the terrorist agency you have infiltrated and the NSA, each mission, and the \"sub area\" between main missions has objectives, some of them non mandatory ones, which will raise the trust with one organization if completed, or lower the trust with another one. Also stuff like killing civilians factors into play here. \n\n\nAnd then, the long list of negative...\n\nFirst the obvious quality of the PC port, its not totally unplayable like some ports but it has A LOT wrong with it.\n\n- First thing that caught my eye was that the game is limited into 1440x900 resolution, thats the maximum from ingame settings, which makes the game awful to look at, almost like looking it through a small fish eye lense, luckily the game can be forced into 1920x1080 with few minutes of config game files editing.\n\n- And then the Bugs, i encountered a lot of them, smaller and the more frequent ones like object and graphics glitching, audio bugs like guns not making any sound when fired, doors not working correctly, getting stuck on objects multiple times, safe cracking system only working when it bloody wants to. The list is endless and i had some bigger issues like few crashes and objectives not completing even if during the mission i get a notification saying it is completed. \n\n- I think graphically, Double agent is a downgrade from its predecessor Chaos theory.\n\n- luckily they didnt absolutely fuck up the controls, they are mostly how Splinter Cell controls always were, but few things suffer with the port, the maps screen while beign more usefull then ever, is absolutely horrendous to navigate with mouse and keyboard, the same goes for equipment switching.\n\nSo, thats all the problems with the actual port, now, even if the port was working perfectly, theres still great many things wrong here:\n\n- The gameplay mechanics are painfully simplified, some techniques are completelly gone, like how you could jump agains a wall and bounce into another direction mid-jump is just gone, visibility and noise meters are gone, so you are just guessing how well you are hidden or how much sound you make. They removed the HP bar completelly, so you basically have 3 stages: alive, wounded or dead, and you regain health from that wounded state, in a matter of few seconds, which means you can survive an infinite ammount of near fatal falls without having to use a medpack in between, it also means that you wont have to think about how much health you have left if you need to get into a firefight.\n\n- Even tho the actual controlls are almost 100% like they were in earlier titles, the game lacks that \"tight\" feeling with controlling the character, many a times was i doing actions i didnt mean to, slipping away from covers etc. Its a bit hard to explain this. \n\n- Less humour. Theres some of it still there, but less.\n\nso all in all. its pretty bad.\n\nAnd i did give it a fair shot of proving me wrong, i enjoyed the xbox 360 version i had years ago, when i started this one, i felt that it was not so bad, but as the hours went by, the more i played the more i grew to dislike many things about it. It would be a decent game if the port was done right, but even if that was the case, theres a bunch of stuff wrong here.\n\nPS: Steam stores schreenshots are from the original version of the game, not the \"next gen\" remaster."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505329231, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501142", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34925362", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198126975019", "num_reviews": 201, "last_played": 1505329049, "num_games_owned": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 345}, "timestamp_updated": 1505329231, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's fine, quite a decent game, problem is the pc version it's riddled with bugs, glitches, and problems, I resent not being able to finish it, but i'm not willing to restart a single mission that lasts over an hour simply because the game decided to crash at the wrong time and corrupt my save data.\n\nThere's also problems with lighting, textures that \"glitch out\".\n\nI also encounter problems with sound, lack of controller support.\n\nFinally the game it's not really the best in the series, I was really curious about this game because I like most Splinter Cell games, but this one simply it's one of those games filled with incredible concepts that get wasted in a terrible execution.\n\nPlay Chaos Theory for a bug free (for the most part) and better experience.\n\nChaos Theory also looks better if you can believe it."}]}
