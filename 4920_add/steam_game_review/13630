This one was released in 2002, in same year as the first pack. It still feels like yet another mission pack, not adding much. 8 more missions, more weapons, more multiplayer stuff. It also came out on Xbox. And there was some edition of Ghost Recon with content of this pack for PS2 as well.\n\nWell, seeing that multiplayer isn't a living thing, I don't think that you will care about whatever multiplayer new things, leaving us with single-player content.\n\nAs for new game mechanics, well, I guess it retains unblowable enemy jeeps from Desert Siege.  And that's about it. And I guess that new specialist that has grenade launcher as primary weapon, which teammate AI never bothers to use. Oh, and stationary grenade launchers that are placed in some levels, for usage by enemies. They just never place it to be useful for player, despite letting him use them.\nIt's not like you will count intro cutscenes of each mission where they come in helicopter or a boat as a new mechanic.\n\nAs for 8 more missions, then eh, at this point it's more of same. Not as fun as Desert Siege, it mostly has more of missions in style that annoyed me in original Ghost Recon. Like, having to know that there is enemy who is hard to see and can shoot you down accurately somewhere at the edge of fog. It's a bit harder, with tree covers and such. Still quicksaving like no tommorow.\n\nPlus it also got 5 more maps for Custom Missions, quite interesting ones. Actually, they put a new mode there, Defend, where you must \"defend the base\". I think that previous expansion pack had it, but it was multiplayer-only deal.\n\nWell, it's not amazing. But still good. Well, no, still fine.

It took me 3.5h to complete the whole game.\n\nI will do some pros and cons for the game\n\nPROS\n-The game graphics are pretty decent comparing the game to other games from '02\n-The mechanics of the game are awesome. It's not like shoot them up, you have to think of your own startegy to pass the Mission\n-This game is one of the more realistic games, when they shoot you 1 time, you'll probably die\n-In this game it is required to commander 1 or 2 teams(depends on how many teams you will take), and you can send your troops across the map with your orders because they will not move if you don't tell them to move\n-Max number of teams is 3(including your own team), so the game is not that hard to play\n-No bugs or crashes at all\n-The game is forgotten but it doesn't need any updates or patches\n-You can make a perfect teams of Ghosts waiting for your command\n-The game is 8 Missions long. Too short if you ask me but that doesn't bother me at all\n-Community isn't dead but there aren't many players that patrol through the Community Hub\n-Models for the game are ok, they have made some new ones and they added some new weapons to the arsenal\n-Enemies now drive other vehicles besides tanks and SAMs\n-They have added some Mission opening cinematics\n\nCONS\n-Multiplayer is dead, ubi.com isn't working for the game. Only GameRanger supports Multiplayer now, and I have found only 1 server online\n-You can't jump in the game\n-Enemy's A.I. is improved to the point where they scope you with AK-47 from the distance you even can't see them and your Ghost's A.I. is the same\n\nI recommend it. 8/10 Would save Cuba with Ghosts again!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1411174978, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502413", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "12154791", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198039782455", "num_reviews": 27, "last_played": 1451018375, "num_games_owned": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1411608039, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This \"Island Thunder\" expansion is more to my liking than \"Desert Siege\".
