You can't get pass the tutorial. I got stuck on the same spot for about 10 minutes and couldn't figure out what to do next. The game is slow. The AI is HORRIBLE. The aesthetic is inexistent. The audio is just annoying. From the tutorial you can see that the story is just as shit as the design of the game. \n\nHow did I got stuck you say? I had to teleport my \"squad\" using one of these radars. The tutorial kept saying me that I had to press on the radar to use it; however, you cannot unselect units on this game (or the tutorial doesn't tell you how to do it). Every time I clicked on the radar, the game thouhgt I was taking my units to the radar. I simply couldnt use it. \n\nI bought the game for $1.50 on a sale. It was super cheap, yet I think it's just shit and $1.50 is way too much. Even if the game were free, I wouldn't get it. This is just not worth your money OR YOUR TIME. \n\nI have played other games from Introversion. I have played uplink, Multiwinia and Prison Architect. I have a total of about 40 hours into their games and they are great. But Darwinia? Another story. Please do not sell this game anymore Introversion. You are better than this. If anything, this game makes you look REALLY BAD. If someone bought this game and played it, they would not even consider buying your other games. \n\nPD: Even though Introversion's other games are good, they are still really buggy. They are really enjoyable, but buggy."}]}
