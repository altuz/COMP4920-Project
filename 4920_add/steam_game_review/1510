And, on the immersion side, the game does it's job really well. The second you start up the game, onwards to the main menus and tutorial, all is already 'the game'. Uplink does not present itself as a game, but as a 'real' application to hack the world with. Bonus points here for the afromentioned immersion part.\n\nFollowing that however, is a... creative, and remotely realistic, yet horribly dull gameplay experience. You take missions from a central server, which tell you to delete file X, add 'xyz' to someone's college degree or steal someone's bank details to mail money elsewhere. You then click a button to set up your route that goes across every server you have ever found (because, without exceptions, more servers is always better, as it gives you more time), do the same 5 procedures in different combinations (or lack thereof), usually consisting of picking a program you bought, clicking on a target field, and waiting for the loading bar to finish. Then you do the thing, log out, delete the logs on a single public server to prevent anyone from ever finding out it was you, cash in the money, buy new programs. Repeat.\n\nI appreciate the style of the game, it's creative vision, but in the end it feels more like a mildly complex console-and-gui-based fetch quest simulator.\n\nOverall, I would argue it likely is one of the more realistic, maybe even better hacking sims, but it's simply not a really satisfying, or enjoyable experience."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506734326, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498154", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "35318299", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198170018923", "num_reviews": 65, "last_played": 1484967613, "num_games_owned": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 33}, "timestamp_updated": 1506734326, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Like minecraft with guns"}]}
