Alongside games like Grand Theft Auto 4, Mass Effect and Mirror's Edge, greatly shook up conventions in what action adventure games could really be. It innovated heavily in terms of technology, rendering highly detailed environments with dozens of npcs on the screen at any one time. And featured things we hadn't really seen before, like crowd dynamics where NPCs react differently based on how quickly you move near them. The 7th generation of consoles was like Santa's workshop for developers and we were all eager to see what was under the Christmas tree.\n\nNaturally the original Assassin's Creed is very overlooked today. The historical context of the title is long forgotten and it is considered very bare compared to its sequels. What remains is a very interesting relic of a different era, both in it subject matter and its gameplay.\n\nYou play as Altair, an assassin of the Levantine order during the third crusade. He is given the names of 9 targets, and upon killing them will redeem his name during a botched mission you observe during the prologue. Altair is noticeably less charismatic than the later main characters in the series and the plot is noticeably more low key. I will say it's to this games benefit if you are interested in the history of the time period. The game is steeped in atmosphere and the plot, while fairly goofy does keep your attention if you're invested in it. If you are fascinated by this period of history it is a very enjoyable experience all around but if you're interested in it more as an aesthetic it probably will not keep your attention.\n\nIn terms of gameplay Assassin's Creed 1 is the most bare in the series. Side missions are more mandatory and repetitive, constituting the same mission types over and over. Thankfully the PC version does switch things around with adding additional missions that involve races across rooftops and a few others that break up the tedium here and there. Combat is also noticeably less fluid than later games, relying much more on visually watching enemy animations to know when to counter and when to dodge. It's one of those things that you eventually get used to but if you've already played the sequel you'll find this somewhat jarring.\n\nAt the same time this is a game steeped in personality and is significantly more nuanced than later titles, which swerved more into high fantasy and high camp. If you're a history buff or interested more in the historical context of the title I do recommend this game. But if you're more interested in just another open world action game I'd direct you to look into getting the sequel instead."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506801191, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35352167", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198297543555", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1506711498, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 187, "playtime_forever": 187}, "timestamp_updated": 1506801191, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Im old enough to remember all the hype over the first game i remember seeing ads on TV which made it look like a button bashing side scroller that was 10 years ago i wasnt interesd at all OMG what did i miss \ni bought in sale simply to have a bit of a button basher to play on TV with steam controller\nThis game is epic so much more than a button basher it has the depth of an adveture game and the adictive qualtys of a beat em up if you havent bought it BUY IT NOW!!!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506679663, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506456", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35288292", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198213387056", "num_reviews": 43, "last_played": 1480684207, "num_games_owned": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 55}, "timestamp_updated": 1506679663, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Oh my gosh I love this series and I'm super happy I got it while it was on an AC sale"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506881119, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35391476", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198041912528", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1478052856, "num_games_owned": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 150}, "timestamp_updated": 1506881119, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Always loved this series and although not as polished as later versions still surprisingly good for it's time"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506687898, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503454", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35291776", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198113831812", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1487064403, "num_games_owned": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2596}, "timestamp_updated": 1506687898, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The great start of one of the greatest franchises of our time.

I didn't expect to be blown away, but I had read many positive reviews before actually playing it.  From my understanding, this is one of the more beloved AC games, and in all honesty I can't really tell why...\n\nSTORY BACKGROUND:\nAssassin's Creed is set in a fictional history that tells the story between two opposing factions.  The Assassins and the Templars.  Both of these groups fight for peace, but their contrasting viewpoints cause them to be at odds.  The Assassins want peace through freedom, and the Templars want peace through control.  AC1 begins in the modern era with a man named Desmond, who is forced to go back in time and live out the memories of his ancestor Altair.  \n\nSTORY OPINION:\nThe game gives an acceptable introduction to the story of the Assassin's Creed.  While Altair was pretty stale and devoid of character development, I was able to let this slide because his character is that of a swift and nimble killer.  The game successfully shows the player the motives of the Creed and the Templars while also providing some background lore.  Altair's story is passible.  Desmond's story on the other hand... Well, I absolutely hated it.  The concept of Abstergo is somewhat interesting, but it seems so forced and unnecessary.  Why not just make this series a lineage of the different assassins throughout history?  Why make it this complex convoluted mess that carries over to modern day?\n\nVOICE ACTING:\nThe voice acting in this game was pretty bad.  The only good voice actor was Peter Renaday as Al Mualim.  Everyone else sounded like they were just reading lines off the paper, in order to get their paycheck.  No emotion and terrible delivery.  Something that was truly immersion breaking was the fact that Altair had an AMERICAN accent.  It just didn't make any sense.  He should have had a middle eastern accent like the rest of the cast.  \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe map in this game is kind of odd.  It's this quasi-open world game with no real side activities.  The only thing you can do in the \"open world\" is collect flags and run into several enemy encampments.  The cities themselves are structured somwhat differently but they didn't feel that unique.  The combat is kind of entertaining, but the game is riddled with missions which are structured EXACTLY the same.  You go to one city, do a few quests to learn about your target and kill them.  Basically rinse and repeat for the entire game.  The end boss provided a cool, albiet predictable, twist to the narrative.  However, the fight itself was anti-climactic and disspointing.  \n\nGRAPHICS/ART DESIGN:\nBeing an older title, I thought the graphics and art design were pretty stellar.  However there are some isues.  This game has a TERRIBLE PC PORT.  Terrible texture flickering, and terrible screen tearing even with v sync and G sync (yes I'm aware the game probably is too old to even use the benefits of g sync but whatever).  UGH UBISOFT. \n\nSOUND DESIGN/OST:\nThe soundtrack fits the environments you visit, as well as the action sequences.  However, I wasn't blown away by it.  The sound design was pretty good for an older game.  The clashing of swords, and screams of the templars were quite enjoyable to listen to.  \n\nVERDICT:\nOld, outdated and bland is the best way to describe this game.  I'm sure when it was originally released it was a breath of fresh air for many gamers.  Unfortunately, as of playing the game in 2017 you will be disspointed and probably bored.  Unfortunately I just can't recommend it.  At last there was no Uplay.\n\n\"These are not children, but men and women full grown...\"\n-Altair"}, {"votes_down": 24, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506538449, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452561", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35247463", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032654499", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1506485784, "num_games_owned": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 122, "playtime_forever": 122}, "timestamp_updated": 1506623188, "received_for_free": false, "review": "First of all, the controls feel really awkward on a keyboard (even after some customization).
