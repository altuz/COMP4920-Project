Every airsofters wet dream\n2.) Basically Barbie: Tactical Edition\n3.) Controls feel good. Play mouse and keyboard. Controller is pretty bad.\n\nCons:\n1.) Hard to follow weak story\n2,) Dumb friendly AI\n3.) Dated graphics\n\nOverall pretty good. This game seems like it can run on a starter computer or some decent gaming laptop."}]}
