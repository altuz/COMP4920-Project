This interesting story combined with an original universe makes for an enjoyable experience. Something fun as well is traveling with a companion for 90% of the game. However, it's a shame they didn't expand the story. At times you'll get the feeling what you did the past hour could've been done in around 10 minutes and the universe has tons of opportunity's for extra content.\n\nWhat they did really well, is really make the universe feel alive and give it a character. There's interesting and likeable characters and some mini-games & side content to explore. The game itself is rather linear but if you really feel like it there's some places to explore that aren't needed for the main story.\n\nCombat is fun and well done, and ranges from melee combat with a mix of range and even hovercraft and space battles! The game isn't afraid to try out new mechanics either. Which is a good thing. The game does lean heavily towards stealth gameplay most of the time. However, I had no problems with this as i really enjoyed those missions.\n\nNow the game has a couple of cons as well. The camera can be horrible at moments and makes certain points in the game harder than they should be. And for some gamers knowing what to do next might be hard at times, the game doesn't always hold you hand and will require you to look around and use your brain at times. Instead of following a waypoint on your map for example. However I doubt if this is really a con since it's well done. \n\nOverall Beyond Good and Evil is a really solid game. It's a lot of fun and has a great universe. However, although i really enjoyed my time in this game, it's not a mind-blowing experience or a perfect game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505649906, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513055", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35021839", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198014435327", "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1505649552, "num_games_owned": 4269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 531}, "timestamp_updated": 1505649906, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Fun action adventure game with charming world and characters, with an intriguing story and some really cool music.
