Don't let the title fool you, this game is legit. This is not your ordinary, boring af, 3-day event competition with no story horse game. This game has a real story with a cast of very interesting, well rounded characters, each with in-depth backstories you can discover. Yeah, you heard me. A horse game with actual characters that talk about actual things with an actual plot. This is the real deal. Real talk.\n\nThe plot has got some cool mystery elements, lots of scandal, social commentary, romance if you choose, and it adapts to how you play the game. There are multiple paths and multiple endings. Do you mostly care about eventing and breeding horses? You can choose not to concern yourself with solving the mystery and the focus of the plot will shift.  The interesting side character backstories? You only discover them if you chose to interact with them. Very adaptive. Yes. Good. Encourages the player to interact with the in-game world. Yes. Good!\n\nSince the the story is a mystery it can get a little intense at points and might get a little bit scary for some younger players. \n\nThis game is pretty gosh darn ugly, but fortunately, it is very easily modded. The textures, text, sounds, meshes/models, and animations are all there for you to fiddle around with. Unfortunately, if you can't mod the files yourself, you gotta deal with the ugliness because there are no mods out there for this game. It was 2007. A more innocent time. A simpler time. An uglier time. Much uglier. Very ugly. Bad. Mouths do not move, some people don't blink, the saddle clips through the horse, the girl clips through the saddle AND the horse, the chestnut horses are not chestnut and the cream horses are NOT cream. Currently trying to find a way to upload some of my mods to the steam workshop for other people that are bothered by these things.\n\nThere's lots of neat stuff in this game. You got all sorts of collectibles, sidequests, and secrets. It's got a stat system, a training system, a breeding system, a rider skill system,  an affection/morale system and each of these systems effects your game in tiny ways. Very fun. Yes. good. \n\nOn foot, the controls can feel very clunky. On horseback, things are easy-peasy. You can configure the keys to your taste, but not all of them. Gotta go to the config.ini to change them if you can't handle the good ol' 2007 clunk controls. They are very bad.\n\nLike most horse games, this has a ridiculously long grooming sequence. Unlike most horse games from the time, you can actually rotate the camera and brush the ENTIRE horse instead of just one side. The shower option was actually developed in hell itself by the devil. I have proof. I can confirm this. There is also a hoof-picking sequence in which you have to avoid hitting the frog or else the horse will scream VERY LOUDLY. AMAZING! REVOLUTIONARY! Yes. Good! Oh, and get this, GET THIS: you get emmerse yourself in an AMAZING FIRST PERSON STALL MUCKING EXPERIENCE! YES! \n\nThere is a training and trust bar you can fill up. The activities you need to do to fill them up are awful. The lunging minigame is very confusing and very difficult. Actually had to look up a tutorial. Very hard. You need a good mouse. The other minigame is just memorization based but there is a very loud buzzer noise that plays if you answer incorrectly. Very scary. Mute your volume for that. You will pee yourself. I know this.\n\nUgly yes, but a quality horse game with a lot of depth and character, which is saying a lot because horse games are notoriously bad. The stat system is well made, but simple and won't confuse younger players. More realistic than most horse games targeted at a younger audience, but realism fans will likely not rejoice. This game has something for every age group. Good enough that you can genuinely enjoy it, and bad enough that you can still make fun of it the whole time. Very poorly made, but that's part of what I like about it."}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1362296764, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509309", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "3216712", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019049141", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1362297600, "num_games_owned": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 229}, "timestamp_updated": 1388305128, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I do not recommend this.
