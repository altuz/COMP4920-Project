Graphics are awful, levels are boring and linear. You use the same 3-4 weapons. Teamate AI and controls are awful. You'll target an enemy and instead of running to cover theyll stand out in oepn and die. If they aren't in range when you target someone to attack they wont run in range, they'll jsut stand there, and youll have to make them run to in range and then theyll attack. Weapon aim and targeting is awful. You will unload a full clip standing right in front of a guy and it will all miss and they will kill you in two shots. No real interesting story. Play COD 1 or any other FPS instead. 5/10"}]}
