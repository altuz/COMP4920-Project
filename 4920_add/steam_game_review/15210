Lots of guys on SubSim will help you if you are having problems with your game.\nNow, onto the actual review.\n\nThis is, without a shadow of doubt, the best submarine simulator on the market. 12 years strong and still going.\nIn this game, there's single missions you can do, as well as a very good dynamic campaign that will really immerse you as a U-Boat captain. Depending on what time period you start in (I always start in 1939) you usually start with a lesser U-Boat and as you progress and sink more ships, you and your crew get rewards like medals and promotions, which can help you and your crew perform better. You also get points to upgrade your submarine with, everything from your sonar to your coning tower, and even to what submarine type you have.\n\nThis game will seem very overwhelming at first, and the tutorials actually do an okay job at helping you get settled in too. There's also a lot of stuff on the internet that can help you out, but from what I've learnt, the only real way to get better is by practicing, trying new things, and being the most ballsy sub commander in the seven seas.\n\nOne more thing this game has over other sub sims is it's modifiability. There is an absolute wealth of mods for this game on the internet, from small changes like what uniforms your crew wears to total overhauls, which can make a huge difference. Find what's right for you, and always make sure to keep a backup of your game before you install anything.\n\nAlso apparently this game has a multiplayer, but I've never tried it, so I can't speak on that.\n\n\nOverall, it is definitely worth the small price tag, considering how many endless hours of fun you will have in this."}]}
