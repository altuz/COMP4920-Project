But it does have some problems, Like the camera and the final boss man that thing Sucked. and ending was okesh. But still this game was vary good and scary and I would like a remake of it someday. Like give the rights to the people that made dead space add more monsters and boesses and that game could be vary good.

After playing the game all the way through in about 2 sittings or so I managed to get to around 7 hours of gameplay and, honestly, had no desire to give it a second playthrough, and after thinking about it for a while, I personally did not like the game.\n\nTL;DR: I can understand how some people would like the game, but I personally do not recommed this game. The cons that this game has outweigh the pros a lot imo, and there are so many better games on both Steam and GOG, that i would just recommend finding and playing one of those (REmake, System Shock 2, CB Undying, RE4, Outlast, ...). 6/10.\n\nThe Good\n--The atmosphere is great. The entire time spent on the boat is actually really good and i really did enjoy a lot of the things that it had to offer, such as the constant moving if you are on the outside of the boat, strong waves can and will hurt you or even kill you, and the whole feeling of you being literally suck in the middle of nowhere. \n--The combat i feel is solid even if it does have some techincal issues on the controls side, but it does very much feel like the RE4 combat.\n\nThe Bad\n--Obviously i feel as if the game is too short. I have around 7-8 hours on record but some of that does come from me being idle and having to reload a previous save due to techincal issues (not the games fault). I would say that you can beat this game in 1 sitting and in about 5 hours or so with no problem, which for a survival horror game is pretty short imo.\n--The controls do have their share of problems but nothing too serious as some people might of had. I played this with a controller so maybe that had something to do with it because i think this game was made more for the PS2 than the PC so if you want to play it i HIGHLY recommend a controller.\n--A serious pet peeve of mine when it comes to survival horror is when a game tries to make a game \"harder\" by introducing random variables (or bullshit as i like to call it) or by removing things that at this point in time should be a standard. For example, you do not have a map in this game, and while i do praise the boat for its originality, some of the rooms do feel the same and the areas after following the boat are far too similar and you can get lost very easily. Also, and this really annoyed me, it violated the sanctity of the safe room with no warning. Granted it only happens once, but after playing many survival horror games the safe room is the one place you can fall back to. Even games like Silent Hill The Room that do turn the safe room into a dangerous place to be in, it does it over time as if it is warning you that the place you feel safe in will sooner than later become hostile. Finally, there are moments where the only time that an enemy is approtching or around a corner, is by trial and error. Sometimes you have to die to know what is behind a wall you cant see behind from your angle and if i dont forgive better games like Resident Evil 3 for doing this, i wont forgive this game for it.\n--The enemies I feel are bullet sponges, and can be too easy or too hard. Too easy in the way that they stay still and take the punishment, either by your positioning or by the game having issues, and too hard in the way that they charge you and they can take about 2 clips of ammo before falling. Also the final boss is a total pushover, super easy and the ending leaves you with that \"that was it?\" feeling.\n\nOverall i would give this game a 6/10. There are so many better games out there that the only way i would really recommend this game is if it were on sale for pretty cheap. Im glad that some can find joy in a game i didnt, and maybe i am alone on this opinion, but this game is not worth the \"cult classic\" hype people give it."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1493540013, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509289", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31458178", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117180258", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1498750080, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 953}, "timestamp_updated": 1493540013, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I am recommending this game for all gamers who are looking for excting old school games."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1495839810, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499485", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31983972", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198097761425", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1498610111, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 29}, "timestamp_updated": 1495839810, "received_for_free": false, "review": "i play this game when it first come out on original xbox and now i have this game on pc i going to play it and play the game till it done i love this game"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1495531179, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495947", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31914606", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198019458917", "num_reviews": 47, "last_played": 1504180730, "num_games_owned": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 446}, "timestamp_updated": 1495531179, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Awesome!"}, {"votes_down": 15, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498357477, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477032", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "32752165", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198151072687", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1498353229, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 207}, "timestamp_updated": 1498357477, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Spent three hours browsing the internet trying to figure out how to fix the game.
