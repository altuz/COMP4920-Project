The graphics arent the best but they arent terrible at all. The fun in  this game comes from how well you can manage your squads and keep everyone alive which is a challenge. When a squad member dies, they are gone for good and you have to recruit someone else. This can suck if you leveled a guy up alot then he dies. You learn to care for your squad mates.\n\nEvery action you take can have consequences. Just a quick story on how real this game can be. It was the first mission on the hardest difficulty. I had my two squads, Alpha and Bravo, on a mission to capture a vip. The mission was going great, no casualties or anything. But then, against my better judgement, i took both of my squads into the caves to capture the vip.  I got cocky and didnt watch my corner and it got all of Bravo squad killed by 2 enemies. I then took Alpha squad (my squad) out of the caves immediately. I almost got emotional that i lost my guys all because of me. We crept back in and took out the threat. On our way back to the extraction point it was smooth sailing! Mission accomplished! or so I thought.. I looked at my compass and it showed red (enemy close by). I thought I took them out? Then before i knew it, right by the LZ we were ambushed by 2 enemies and i lost 2 of my squad mates. And only my sniper survived. This goes to show you that in this game never consider yourself safe since most enemies roam the map freely. A smooth mission turned out a disaster at the very end and it was all my fault.  \n\nAll and all this is a great game with tons of replay value to unlock all the new soldiers and improve tactics. Dont let the small amout of hours played fool you I played the heck out of this while I was a kid! Great game then Great game now!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505353929, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34940461", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198360857893", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505147516, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 36}, "timestamp_updated": 1505353929, "received_for_free": false, "review": "love this game, its hard a all shit ut being someone who loed therainbowsix series nd jumping straight into this is definatly a challenge, would reccomend if your looing for a sence of satisfaction when completing every mission"}]}
