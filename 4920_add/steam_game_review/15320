If you are into WW2 Flight Sims, or WW2 Combat Air Combat then this game is for you.  Now it is not a \"NEW\" game, so the graphics are not what we see now (Think 10 Years Ago - Graphics) , but the playability is off the charts.  I do think you will want a flight stick if possible, and you can get by with a standard joystick, but this could be difficult with just a keyboard and mouse system.   \n\nI read a few other reviews, and none seem to talk about something special with this game, it is VERY VERY VERY modable. For Example:  The B.A.T Mod adds 2X the planes and some are the planes that never really got off the drawing board.  Also the mod adds jets, and does try and update the graphics somewhat.   Now with the mod it can change the requirments of your computer to need a more modern computer.   The BAT mod adds about 62 Gig of fixes, add-ons, missions, campaigns, and other good stuff.  (The Mod is not on Steam, you will have to google, find, then download and install it yourself)\n\nThis is my GOTO game, it is the game when I am board and just wanting to kill time.  I recommend it 10/10: But remember that it is a Simulation at heart, so don't expect the game to hold your hand as you fly around.  It does have a learning curve, so you have been warned.  \n\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506036412, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35116001", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198005986038", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1507157108, "num_games_owned": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_forever": 237}, "timestamp_updated": 1506036412, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Despite its age, still one of the best WW2 flight sims ever created.
