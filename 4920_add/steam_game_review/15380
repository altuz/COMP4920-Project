Pretty good. There are several new mechanics and abilities. Adds a lot of content. The story is interesting. 3 long campaigns with almost 60 hours of play time is quite a nice deal, specially compared to many DLC nowadays that provide so little in content and play time.\n\nFound no bugs or crashes. Runs troubleless on win 7.\n\nI think the game is really entertaining, as HMM usually is, so I recommend it gladly."}]}
