It's corny, it's raw, it's super futuristic, it's extra savage, it's a fun atmoshpere.There is a campaign with a story a lot of details but you wish there were even more lore, details and backgrounds living in the game, it's feels a little bit like a game is not a universe in itself but just a park for a all we know about Warhammer 40k (actaully the warhammer40k lore has several universe I believe). \n\nIt's a fun tactical game, they say this is a strategy game but if strategy there is is very minor. The gameplay is good , the melee combat is blast. It's awesome having the choices for some units using their chainsword or blasters, each unit has its own abilites and they pretty are the key to the win the game.\n\nThe graphics are not pretty but the special effects are omnipresent so it's not too bad, they will be able to hold the time.\n\nPlay it on hard at least if not very hard, this is a an action game, you should be taking deicsion very fast. Let me explain, last time I played the campaign I believe it was on normal difficulty and I regret a bit this lack of difficulty because it is when the game gets hard that you really have to use all features at your disposition to finally win and by doing so enjoying it a lot more."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504716739, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495245", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34779170", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198165749247", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1502701740, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2230}, "timestamp_updated": 1504716739, "received_for_free": false, "review": "amazing game had loads of fun playing it but its hard to find online matches"}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505779228, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475798", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35055085", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099967128", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505778128, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 50}, "timestamp_updated": 1505779228, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I bought this thinking it would be like the origonal dawn of war, got hype in the intro cutscene and even more so while the first campaign cutscene played then proceded to cry when the base bulding rts game I had grown up loving was set on fire and replaced with a game that plays like a crappy mobile game.
