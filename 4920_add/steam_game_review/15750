There are countless ways to use your Crutter Crossbow, and the game has one of the most fun and satisfying melee systems ever, especially for a psuedo-FPS game.

Originally released on January 2005, the HD remaster has done wonders to the game and it looks as fresh and stylised as ever. \n\n[i] Played on a GTX 1080 PC Build\nCompleted in 13.9 hours \nLast played on 22/09/2017 [/i]\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b] \n\nTo start with, I'd say this game is segmented in to two parts (due to story reasons). \n\nThe first part introduces you to a Bounty Hunter, whom is simply known as \"Stranger\", and a series of Wild West towns. Your goal is to capture criminals, alive or dead, using a crossbow equipped with creatures which are used as ammunition. The gameplay follows a formula, you go to the \"Bounty Office\" to pick up a bounty, you proceed through a level picking up creatures for ammunition that all perform different functions, you attack enemies (either killing them or capturing them alive for a higher bounty) and then you face the boss, whom you must capture dead or alive. \n\nThe second half of the game is slightly different, playing more like a adventure first-person shooter game, whilst still using most of the same mechanics - it plays more similarly to a game such as Half-Life. There is a good reason for this, but I will not discuss it here due to spoilers.\n\nStranger's Wrath, like all Oddworld games, outshines itself in ingenuity, character, charisma and charm. It's near to impossible to hate any Oddworld games because they are so inherently strange and lovable. \n\n[i] What I liked [/i]\n[list]\n[*] The aforementioned creatures that are used as ammunition are extremely creative, the game creates it's own twist on the first person genre making for a much more interesting game.\n[*] The addition of difficulty choices (which were not present on the original).\n[*] The enivronments, the characters and the writing are brilliant. If you've played an Oddworld game before, you know exactly what to expect. Everything leaves a huge impression on you, it is weird and fantastic. \n[*] The controls feel perfect, often when console games are ported to PC it feels much more intuitive and comfortable to use a controller, however, on PC this is not the case. As someone who has played the standard version on the first generation XBOX, I can attest  to how much more fluid,[i] more natural [/i], the mouse and keyboard feels. It's as if it were designed for PC originally.\n[*] The nature of being able to switch between first and third person. First person is exclusively for shooting whereas third person is for platforming and moving around faster.\n[*] Moving around doesn't feel slow at all, quite often games are padded with walking but this game gives you a swift dash to help your mobility which really makes the game far less mundane.\n[*] Plenty of upgrades and advancements which fuels a feeling of progression.\n[/list]\n[i] What I disliked [/i]\n[list]\n[*] There are some poorly designed bosses, whilst most are fun, a few were just completely irritating due to poor design. One such boss is the second to last boss, without going in to spoilers, if you get hit by one of it's abilities once it becomes impossible to escape, slowly ticking away your health until you die - clearly not intentional, but it occurs nonetheless. \n[*] Hit detection - often times I felt as though my gunfire would pass straight through the enemies, especially when up close or when the enemies are extremely far away. This clearly led to some frustrating situations. \n[*] The money system, probably my biggest personal gripe with this game. As I explained earlier, you can either capture enemies / bosses dead or alive - capturing them alive gives a bigger bonus when it comes to money. I captured nearly everything in the entire first half of the game alive believing there'd be some sort of reward for the money I have earned. The extra money you get from capturing enemies alive amounts to zilch, everything in the store is cheap and you can afford every upgrade and item just by killing everything. Obviously catching bounties alive is much more satisfying, but there is not even an achievement for capturing all the bosses alive. I waited the whole game for the money to come in useful, but when the second part of the game begins you do not use or gain money AT ALL. A system like in \"Luigi's Mansion\" where it gives you some sort of bonus at the end of the game depending on the money you earned would be nice.\n[*] The upgrades you purchase, although cheap, do not matter at all during the second half of the game.\n\n[b] Graphics [/b] \n\nThe HD rework on this game is fantastic, upgrading the aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9, allowing for higher frames per second and making everything, aside from the cutscenes, sharp and vibrant. \nThis games graphical style (cartoon / comic-like) makes it hard to believe that it will ever age after this remaster, it looks like it could've come out today and not in 2010. If you're a fan of the original Stranger's Wrath, it is worth picking up the HD edition just for the graphical upgrade and the fluidity of higher FPS. \nThe whole game is visually pleasing and I found myself constantly taking screenshots to savour later, the characters are crafted excellently and are extremely unique in many aspects - a staple of Oddworld games.\n\n[b] Soundtrack [/b]\n\nTruth be told, even being my second playthrough of the game, upon writing this review I could not remember a single thing about the soundtrack. Upon listening to it by itself, I can see why. The soundtrack is intentionally quite bare and empty, it's easy to see why they chose to do this though. Had the soundtrack been anything but, the  immersion in this fantastic universe would have been broken. The soundtrack consists of quiet songs with subtle instrumentation, not bad, but certainly not anything too special - but it's befitting. \n\n[b] Story [/b]\n\nThere's not much to the story, it certainly exists but is far from the main focus. I can't talk too much about it without spoiling it, but despite it being rather bare-boned it still had me itching to find out what would happen next. It boasts several twists which will genuinely take you by surrpise. \n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\n\nI recommend this game to everyone, it is a lot of fun and not once did I feel bored of the game. Despite that, it's still rough around the edges - this is mostly attributed to age but they are still things that could have been tweaked / fixed in the HD upgrade. If you haven't checked out any of the other Oddworld games I highly recommend those too, especially Abe's Odyssey. \nDon't feel obliged to wait for this to go on sale, because it's worth the full price.\n\n8 / 10"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505421816, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495511", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34957336", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198165689872", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1500118491, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1637}, "timestamp_updated": 1505421816, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Maybe the most underrated video game of the century!!!Words are useless!!Play it now."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505981962, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484359", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35099949", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197994494283", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505980844, "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_forever": 33}, "timestamp_updated": 1505981962, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I looked forward to play this game and my first 33 minutes went very smooth!
