The setting, while not entirely unique, does offer the player a wide variety of strategic options.  The music in particular is very well done in this title and along with the stage transitions keeps the gameplay moving forward smoothly.  The Steam Overlay and widescreen options are supported, so if you are a fan of Bejeweled or Tetris, you will find a lot to like in Planet Busters."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1323787370, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479274", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "1309771", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197991161976", "num_reviews": 101, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 4682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1393696993, "received_for_free": false, "review": "2008\ub144 \ub098\uc654\uc744 \ub2f9\uc2dc \uad6c\uc785\ud55c \ub098\ub2d8\uc740 \ub9d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.
