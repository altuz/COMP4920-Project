The most obvious is that fullscreen is not supported and you are limited to a very small 800x600 window on the screen. While there is a fullscreen option, it does not stretch the image and simply blackboxes the main content. Secondly, the Steam Overlay is not supported so you cannot screenshot your high scores. While the game is challenging and the levels are well varied with a long campaign, the flaws are significant enough to make Luxor Amun Rising among the weaker entries in this genre. I would recommend that most puzzle gamers and definitely the mainstream audience give this game a pass."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1480256085, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506045", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "27834096", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198323598985", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1480249821, "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1480256085, "received_for_free": false, "review": "doesnt work on win10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1369080240, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498446", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "3661284", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025726362", "num_reviews": 62, "last_played": 1369033200, "num_games_owned": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2390}, "timestamp_updated": 1369080240, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good little casual match 3 game. 89:100"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1488621171, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30311344", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198016692096", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 239}, "timestamp_updated": 1488621171, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Why do I have this game in my inventory? \nRate up because I have 4 hrs in it so it must be ok"}]}
