But this game is hard. Objects are so well hidden, that you regularly have to use the Hint button (at no real cost). I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Probably a good thing, but THIS hard... I'm not sure.\n\nAnyhow, I guess it can be fun with a couple of friends, but if you're playing alone, you basically have all the time in the world. That doesn't make it any easier, but it also doesn't make it any more fun. Still, you can't find a similar game like this on Steam, so if you're into these games this one is a must own.\n\n[Rating: 67/100]"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1419697439, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508106", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "13640220", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197970064749", "num_reviews": 206, "last_played": 1409840172, "num_games_owned": 3360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 246}, "timestamp_updated": 1419697439, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The difference between this game other Hidden Object games is that in this game you'll be playing in a some sort of game show.
