It's basically a mixture of \"find the listed objects scattered in the scene\" with some mild puzzle games, with a straightforward plot heavily inspired by a certain movie about a whip-toting archaeologist. The art is cartoony, which made finding most of the objects in the scene a pretty simple exercise as they stick out like a sore thumb. A few are better hidden, but nothing stumped us for more than a minute or two. The fact that the cursor sparkles when you hover over interactive areas of the scene where tools need to be used made searching somewhat redundant, and there didn't seem to be any means of turning that off. Still, it's all pleasant enough, and a fine diversion if you like this kind of thing. You'll know if you do."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1394571072, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501171", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9422791", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198085440890", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1394571977, "num_games_owned": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 48}, "timestamp_updated": 1394571072, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This hidden object game tries to be different but it falls in mediocre category.

The Mystery From Atlantis and Fountains of Fate are missing, and the latter is the most advanced and best of the series.\nRating: 3/5"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1418622605, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13374241", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198042562221", "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1405002660, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 730}, "timestamp_updated": 1418622605, "received_for_free": false, "review": "THey did a lot of RIGHT things in the is game.
