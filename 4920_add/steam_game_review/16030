It's before the games began breaking things up and adding extra challenge in the form of resource management/bonuses for \"better time\" or the city-building aspects, or variable difficulty, or the assistance of recharging powerups, but with the bonus irritation of \"hey, you know how you usually need to drop the key stone off the board? Now make it navigate a maze on some of the strangest-shaped boards in the series.\"\n\nThe problem with that is that while you might think it's an interesting variant on match-3 gameplay (the board rotates to assist in this), the time limit is INSANELY generous. I don't know if I ever went down further than a third of the meter, and that was while I was passing out and zonking out for a few seconds at a time every so many moves. It's ludicrously liberal on time. So the game is in no way challenging, just sort of annoying. I can see reasons to play earlier 7W games, and the later ones redefine things in their own way, but god, this one's a relic."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1413418357, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503972", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "12505533", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198063388194", "num_reviews": 37, "last_played": 1356768000, "num_games_owned": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1050}, "timestamp_updated": 1435555058, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Nice and easy game to play when you just want to relax or are on the phone or something.\nYou match 3 or more of the same colour in a row, you can turn the board."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1435090402, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500056", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "16658399", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198007039200", "num_reviews": 60, "last_played": 1435012970, "num_games_owned": 906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1045}, "timestamp_updated": 1435090402, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Basically this is a pretty decent time waster if one has time to waste.
