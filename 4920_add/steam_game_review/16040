Long lines of balls run along a track to a target (a pyramid in this case). By shooting balls to create rows of balls with the same colour, you can destroy them, before they get there. You get bonuses and powerups for creating especially long rows or for causing chain reactions. Powerups are things like explosive balls, special balls that match any colour or that change the colour of balls, static fields that collect bonuses for you or many different kinds of destructiv powers like the scorpion that kills those balls closest to their target. You'll have to kill a certain amount of balls/lines to pass a level and you'll lose the instant one of the balls touches it's target.\n\n[h1]My Original Review[/h1]\n\nThe best of all Luxor games. Quest for Afterlife features the original gameplay but is the only part of the series (I played so far) that has an upgrade-shop. With the Coins you collect in the game, you can buy upgrades for your power-ups such as making the scorpion smash another two orbs each time or increasing the fireball radius. Or you can personalize your wing and your balls with new designs.\nAnd the game features unique game modes such as 'Crossing the River'.\nIf you just want to play along the standard Luxor-gameplay, you might not like this part of the series. But if you like to see a progress in your game and not just watch the levels get harder, Quest for Afterlife is the part of the series you are looking for. It even has some kind of story and sort of 'Open World'-map.\nAll other Luxor-Parts are just new graphics and some different power-ups and maps, but nothing new. I really don't understand why they removed all the innovative parts from QfA in the newer parts..."}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1387806196, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504277", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8224028", "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198033431295", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1457322497, "num_games_owned": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 414}, "timestamp_updated": 1387806196, "received_for_free": false, "review": "All Luxor are exceptional love puzeling games,fun to play"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1429381359, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504641", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "15435545", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198055446632", "num_reviews": 66, "last_played": 1443639445, "num_games_owned": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 362}, "timestamp_updated": 1429381359, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I love all the luxor games, but especially this one since it has a cool upgrade system, a nice little campaign and just generally the fun, addicting gameplay one would expect from a luxor game.
