Each place you visit involves a number of hidden object scenes, finding things that are lying around, and using tools in mostly obvious (and sometimes extremely unlikely) places. Occasionally there's a mild puzzle to solve, such as solitaire, match 3, jigsaw puzzles etc. It's all very easy, the cartoony style makes the objects stand out quite clearly, although in each scene there's usually one or two objects that are hidden a little better than the others. However, the game really falls over itself to give you hints, clues and not-so-gentle nudges, so you're unlikely to get stuck for more than half a minute. Hover a tool anywhere in the general vicinity of where you have to click, and a shower of sparkles erupts from your cursor. No doubt there, then! There are an abudance of hints that basically show you exactly what to do, by the end of the game we'd amassed nearly 40 of them and didn't use one. I mean, it's all good, clean fun and best enjoyed as a group, but it was easier than the first game. It really needs a \"hard mode\" where you can turn all that stuff off. Still, a good time was had by all, and I'd recommend it if you like this kind of thing. Just don't expect much of a challenge."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1404042663, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508388", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "10937911", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025254064", "num_reviews": 22, "last_played": 1497817774, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1528}, "timestamp_updated": 1410192872, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Pretty game, but short and easy.

So far since I finally have it running on windows 8 it is a decent little game with plenty of hidden objects and some storyline, nothing elaborate..kind of a jump from here to there and find things and quick put this together...if you are looking for an elaborate and involved storyline and flow with the hidden objects game then this is not it..it's more like hidden object everywhere and oh by the way yeah we need that to propel the story forward...also the hidden objects are slightly lame because they will be like bust 1 and bust 2 all in all can't complain for a decent discounted bundle except for the whole we don't support 8.1 would have been nice to know before buying.
