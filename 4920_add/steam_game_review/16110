If you want a casual/simulation game that requires some puzzle-solving and villager care, this game is it. However, this game is not for everyone.\n\nPros\n+Four music tracks\n+Game progresses at selected rates even when the game is not running: paused, slow, normal and fast.\n+Customize villager outfits (after building the required shack).\n+16 unique puzzles to solve.\n+Endless replayability (game will never end unless you start over or every villager dies).\n+Multiple save files (tribes).\n\nCons\n-Beginning of the game is very tough, villagers are inexperienced, there is a lack of food resources, and only a few villagers are able to work.\n-Villagers can/will die even if the game is left off for so long.\n-Villagers need to be manually taught how to do things, like building and farming.\n-A villager must be 14 years old before they're able to do a lot of things.\n-Game can be extremely boring once everything is completed: puzzles, steady food supply, all tech upgrades, etc.\n"}]}
