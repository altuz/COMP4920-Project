It's also a better game, as it has more things to do while you are waiting for your plant DNA to fuse and create something super special or super-dead-already.\n\nLop bits off your plants, catch bugs off your plants, spray lightly-toxic substances over your plants - it's all here. Then cart them off to your broken garden centre and watch the crazy thoughts of your customers as they decide what (and whether) to buy,\n\nIt's all in real time, so don't show up one day and you will have a lot of dead stuff and the shame of knowing you killed a nursery of defenceless plants, you monster."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1496036007, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504659", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "32035561", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198199451153", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1502650408, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1063}, "timestamp_updated": 1496036007, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Tried to switch to fullscreen- game claimed my card did not support that format and forcibly closed game.
