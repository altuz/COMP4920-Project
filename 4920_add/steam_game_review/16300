I wasn't feeling the love the first go-round, and still can't really get into it. On paper, this should be something I love. An indie twin-stick schmup with a music mechanic/component? Sounds great. In reality, what I got was just too little game and not tight enough controls for a twin-stick, [b]and controls are everything with a quality twin-stick[/b]. To be fair, I'm also in the middle of playing [i]Nex Machina[/i] which is probably the slickest twin-stick of 2017. \n\nFor what I got, my main issue is with the price point. There just isn't $10 worth of game here. For those of you that love this title, please tell me what I am missing.\n\n[i]Essentially, the aim of this title is to hold on as long as you can.[/i] You battle through levels that each have different enemy/bullet hell mechanics. Yeah, that part is neat. A lot of it looks like a tie-dyed t-shirt. There are permanent unlocks. I played with a controller, but there are issues with the aiming. At moments it feels like you cannot shoot at every single angle; like the aiming angles are too coarse. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Great idea\n+Music is good, but not great\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Not really that fun\n-Too pricey\n-The static levels get boring after a while\n-Controls are not great\n\n[b]I've put in enough time, but still don't see the love.[/b] If anyone can shed some insight, I'd be grateful."}]}
