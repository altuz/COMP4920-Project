The game runs well at 1080p/60 FPS.  Visuals are good enough to still be immersive, which is important in a horror game.\n\nSound: Audio was good for its time, but most modern audio is good, so it is nothing remarkable now.  Soundtrack is not as haunting as the first FEAR, though.\n\nAtmosphere: Well done.  If they intention was to sow despair as you and your team attempt to stop a \"demigod\" from wreaking havoc on the world, they did well.  Destruction is everywhere, and creepyness exists in almost every level, to a certain extent.  Not as scary as the first FEAR though.\n\nStory: Competent at the very least.  It all makes sense and is somewhat intriguing, but not much different than your typical \"super secret agency doing super secret stuff\" exposition.  Ironically, I got many Outlast or \"Murkoff Corp\" vibes from this game.  I would not be surprised if those games drew influence from the FEAR storyline.\n\nGameplay: Solid.  More FPS than the first FEAR, with some less horror sequences.  Not enough to say this isn't a FEAR game, but a noticeable departure from the first.  Gunplay is alright, but the grenades are a nuisance.  I assume to immitate real life, but when you throw a grenade it doesn't always go where you aim--You will throw it either to the left or the right, a little up or a little down.  Annoying in a firefight as you sometimes throw it right into a wall to much frustration.  I played on veteran, and the difficulty is a little unfair sometimes.  Shotguns will usually one-shot you, even with full armor.  An NPC will randomly get off a few shots on you as you are filling his mouth with lead, which doesn't make much sense.  I've been sniped and grenaded through walls.  Certain enemy animations include invincibility frames, some animations don't.  Very frustrating to not know exactly when you can or can't attack an enemy.  There is absolutely no stealth factor, enemies will see your toe and within milliseconds be putting fire into you.  Sometimes you don't ADS when you press the right-mouse-button (this is an old game and I believe the default ADS is shift, so that may be the reason for this unusal bug).  I've fallen through a level before.\n\nIf you are a general FPS fan, you will probably find this game enjoyable.\nIf you are a FEAR fan, you will find this game enjoyable but not as creepy as the first.  It does certainly have its moments, but not as frequent as FEAR.\nIf you are a horror fan, you probably won't enjoy this game unless you also like FPS.\n\nThe game is on the shorter side, but that's not always a bad thing, as there is very little downtime.  You're either in a horror sequence, or a firefight sequence 90% of the time.\n\nFPS = 8.8/10\nHorror = 7.5/10\nFinal score = 8.2/10\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506883924, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507811", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35392834", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198038050700", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1507002525, "num_games_owned": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 371, "playtime_forever": 371}, "timestamp_updated": 1507172384, "received_for_free": false, "review": "F.E.A.R games are so underrated...\nI highly recommend this game.\nNot good like F.E.A.R 1 but it is worth buying."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505337563, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503641", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 10, "recommendationid": "34927405", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198012650407", "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1505337542, "num_games_owned": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 411}, "timestamp_updated": 1505337563, "received_for_free": false, "review": "There's a naked chick"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505617257, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504681", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35012684", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198012242218", "num_reviews": 40, "last_played": 1507158638, "num_games_owned": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 265, "playtime_forever": 1485}, "timestamp_updated": 1505854399, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I felt this was a fantastic sequel to a true classic named F.E.A.R. I am not sure if the AI in this game are the same as the extremely intuitive AI from the original F.E.A.R but the game still pumps out very fun firefights and somewhat challenging AI. \n\nF.E.A.R 2 brings F.E.A.R's original eerie and \"spooky\" dialogue back and does a rather decent job in my opinion. The story of F.E.A.R 2 was pretty interesting discovering more about the origins of Alma and explaining what has caused her to become so angry. The length of the story is adequate and will have you sitting there for a couple hours at least running through it. It certainly is not a boring game and I have beaten it multiple times on Steam and not on Steam. \n\nDLC - I kind of wish the DLC tied a bit more with the story but it was pretty cool playing in the perspective of the soldiers you have been mowing down since 2005."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506798906, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503194", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35350991", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198000579188", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1364713200, "num_games_owned": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1042}, "timestamp_updated": 1506798906, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Don't know what all the negative reviews are about.

The ai is brain dead and suicidal. soldiers with range weapons will run straight at you while shooting with no regard for their own livelyhood. Soldiers with shotguns will shoot at you from a football field away. Enemies also like to bunch up making them both easy to kill and instantly killing you because they have no delay and will shoot as soon as they line of sight you. Id also like to know whos stupid idea it was to make enemies that jump around and then latch onto you and throw you into a quick time event.\n\n2. slowmo ability (the main gimmick of the game). In the first game it was esential and fun to use. in this game you can play through on hard without ever using it one time and be completely fine. this game takes the more strategic gameplay from the first one and streamlines it into call of duty run and gun mediocrity.\n\n3. Story. Too much of it. The game isnt scary and it isnt even immersive. The gameplay is ripped away for cutscenes and qtes that do nothing but kill the pacing.\n\nCONCLUSION: Buy FEAR 1 instead. It is a marathon amount of steps forward in terms of satisfying gameplay and immersion. It has that old school attention to detail (proper glass shattering, Bottles with chemicals in them set on fire when you shoot them, bullets can create sparks that bounce off of multiple surfaces, enemies will try to get behind you and use tactics rather than charge into your line of fire.)\nBuy that one instead.\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506025036, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496915", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35113083", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026565390", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1506024543, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 138, "playtime_forever": 546}, "timestamp_updated": 1506025036, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is so undeniably \"meh\" that I'm not sure whether to recommend it or not. It has its moments, but if you're like me, the entire time you will be reminiscing about how absolutely amazing the first game was. Gone are the incredibly tense firefights where slo-mo changes the game. Instead, there is COD like gunplay that poses next to no challenge whatsoever, and a story which has moments where I was laughing rather than being spooked. And, the weapon selection is poor- gone are several awesome guns from the first game like the AUG, grenade launcher, and akimbo pistols, and in their place are forgettable guns like the automatic shotgun and a new variant of the beam cannon which is useful for about 5 seconds (the sniper is the one new gun that's actually really good). \n\nSo, for now, I am not going to recommend the game, although there were parts which were enjoyable. If you're interested in the series and are looking for a decent FPS to take 8-9 hours of your life away, then go for it. I'd honestly say that you're better off playing the first game through again though."}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506755919, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473711", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35326322", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175144894", "num_reviews": 59, "last_played": 1506755881, "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 44, "playtime_forever": 44}, "timestamp_updated": 1506755919, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Nope the gameplay is just, god no.."}, {"votes_down": 11, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506721735, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470064", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35313478", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198172435419", "num_reviews": 59, "last_played": 1506721499, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "playtime_forever": 17}, "timestamp_updated": 1507172862, "received_for_free": false, "review": "http://store.steampowered.com/app/21090/FEAR/\n\n*EDIT*:  Lotta salty peeps downvoting this review.
