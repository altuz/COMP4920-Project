This is a tank simulator. If your expecting the arcade and simple to use controls of world of tanks or war thunder than look somewhere else.\n\nAll in all this is a good game, a dam hard game but fun. The way it works is dont just control the tank outright but you control its crew. You can either take cantrol of a crew position directly such as the driver or gunner but you also give the crew orders when not in controll of them. So lets say your playing as the gunner, you need move the tank to a new position but you can leave the gun, so you order your driver to move. Ordering crewmen around is not as accurect nor as easy as controlling them directly but you will need to get the hang of it\n\nThe positions of crew are as follows\n\nCommander- does little in combat but is resposible for scanning for enemys and if you want to completly controll the tank via orders only, you play as him\n\nGunner- mans the main gun, controlls the turret and coaxile MG, nuff said\n\nDriver- drives the tank of corse\n\nAA gunner- mans the big MG on top of the tank to deal with infantry, light vehicals and aircraft.\n\nThis game is also extreeemly relistic as far as a simulator game from 2006 goes. Damage to your tank and is permanant so if you get your track blown off or your gun disabled part way through the mission, your done. Aiming the gun also reqiers you to find range and work with the flight path of the shell. While there is ways to have the details figured out atomaticly, for the most part you will be manualy calculating each shot. driving phsyics are heavy as well, go off a cliff, you break your track, go too fast around a bend, flip the tank.\n\nAs one finaly note you actully have three tanks not just a T-72. You have T-34-85 a T-55 and yes a T-72\n\nSo all in all Iron warriors T-72 Tank command is a fun game, It's extreemly hard and defently dated to an extent but if your looking for a realistic military themed game or just like advanced simulators in general, this game is for you.\n\nUPDATE- I should mention that I run this on windows 10 and it runs ok. People have reported problems with getting this game to run but for any older PC game running on newer operating systems thats to be expected. So while I have had no problems with it that is not saying the game won't have troubles depending on your PC set up."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1493678655, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "31496280", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198036596184", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1494105203, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 502}, "timestamp_updated": 1493678655, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good. I have no problems. I had problems according to the screen in Win 7 and Win 8 but now that I have Win 10, the game goes as any other one.\n\nThere are some stupid around here that are not even able to complete the driver tutorial, and then they mark low points. Those people probably thought they were going to play something like World Of Tanks but nope, this is a SIM!!!! This is for clever people.\n\nGood pointings on this and I hope this game stills upgrading. I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn and work while interacting!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498542780, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507342", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32843373", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_reviews": 1972, "last_played": 1498542703, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1505086642, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Tags: Warfare Vehicle Simulation\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Abandonware Grade\n\nReview: The control scheme is absolute madness.

The game looks a lot more dated and underwhelming than the impression you get from the low resolution screenshots on the store page.
