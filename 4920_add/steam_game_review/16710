Its a gem that had many problems when it was in production from theme and world setbacks to a rushed schedule on its release date of 2008. Though the only real problem with the game is its major downfall .The company that made this game was sold and this left the pc version unfinished because of the style they were going for in releasing the game.If you want to play this just for the voice acting and full cutscenes pick this up on a sale otherwise dont buy this. If you still want to play the main game get the Nintendo DS port of the game because it was the only version to be fully released. Over all this game is a solid experience and great change of pace from the usual format of games too bad this version wasn't finished because I always imagined it would be great seeing it at its best."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502122854, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501706", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34084825", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_reviews": 1972, "last_played": 1502121762, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 261}, "timestamp_updated": 1505085644, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Tags: Adventure - Console Style\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Take Grim Fandango. Take only the first few areas. Replace anything dead or mexican with anthropomorphized insects that wear clothes and have hair and a vaguely new york setting. Suspend your disbelief much more since the insect/humanoid races make no sense. Then as soon as you get used to it, remove that and throw in a bunch of oversimplistic action sequences that last way too long. Also make sure the story does not develop by cutting it abruptly after five chapters.\n\nGreat voice acting. Cartoony 3D has soft shadows and nice post processing that makes environments moody and immersive. Point&Click inspired sections make the title shine despite their simplicity. Unfortunately they represent less than half the game. The game is less than half story since it is Part 1. I was following a walkthrough and I could see solutions for the missing chapters so I do not understand what happened, guess it never got ported. Part 2 had even more action and even less point & click. I am not sure I would have enjoyed it. There are some missing dialogue lines which sometimes hurts the immersion or somewhat breaks the dialogue. The empowered female protagonist had some endearing quirks but was a little bit overplayed, especially when paired with good for nothing male characters. Weapon balance seemed a little off. Some of the platforming was clunky to execute because of poor depth perception and confusing level design on rooftops. Removing for declutter\n\nConclusion: You can get a couple hours of fun but it is ultimately too unrewarding to recommend or even keep around the Library. You never get to uncover the relationship between the Soda corporation, the police department, the humanoids and the bombings making the whole thing a complete waste of time. I would have played part 2 just for the story but thats not going to happen."}]}
