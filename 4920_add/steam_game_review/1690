I should be able to control the range thus denying the enemy ever hitting me with its weapons.\nWhen closing with the enemy my ship fires at long range and damages an enemy ship which turns to flee at speed 6\nMy speed 12 ship reduces its speed to 6 so it can maintain a maxamum range seperation between ship.\nMy ship never fires again because my missiles will be out of range as soon as the enemy moves a tad. Argh\n\ntry again, same ships but this time I choose fire at optimal range\nthis time my ship instead of firing at va range of 18 closes to range 6. At range 8 the other ship fires all its mid range beam weapons and my ship dies.\n\nNot being able to control your ships stratagy in combat is a game breaker for me as differnet opponents ship, starbases require you to adapt your combat tactics but the game won't let you.\n\n\nRecomend that you play Space Empires IV as it does not have these issues as ship combat is controlled manually."}]}
