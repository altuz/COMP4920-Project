It honestly pains me to see what has happened to it.\n\nI'd like to say I actually stopped playing Tribes for a long while. I heard they were updating it again, ignored it. Tried playing it again this January. I have a few words as a tl;dr I'll post here in the beginning and elaborate further down.\n\ntl;dr: \"What the fuck was Hi-Rez thinking? This game is a fucking dying corpse of what it was!\"\n\nNow let me elaborate. I'll start with some immediate key changes to the game that I personally do not understand why they changed.\n\n[h1]The Classes[/h1]\n\nGod just... what the fuck were they even doing. This isn't neccessarily a 100% bad change but it's not good either.\n\nBefore this game was changed a lot, you had three basic classes, each had three sub-classes of it. You have the light, medium, and heavy. For light you had the Pathfinder, the Sentinel, and the Infiltrator. Medium you had the Soldier, Raider, and Technician. Heavy the Juggernaut, Doombringer, and Brute. Each of these had their own specific set of weapons with a degree of loadout customization. To add to that there was this perk system which while it had it's own issues, is definitely better than what we have now.\n\nAfter the update, it was stripped down to \"Light\", \"Medium\", and \"Heavy\", all with their own loadout slots. The classes of before are all a legend of the past at this point. You could choose \"Light\", and give it any weapon & ability combo you want, which is one of the major downfalls of this game now. It removed the barrier between classes, or at the least severely lowered the gap. For reference, a Pathfinder trying to fight any of the heavy classes. It was possible to win this situation as the Pathfinder, but it would require concentration and the ability to out-maneuver the enemy. To any of the players playing post-update, they shall know that pitting a light against a heavy is a lot more \"even balanced\", in that the light class, if set up right, can easily dispatch a heavy when played correctly.\n\nThis is one of the things that really set this game's base floor, was that the classes used to actually be different in ways more than just movement speed & health/energy. You could argue that weapons are still class-restricted in that only the heavies can get heavy variants of the weapon, sure. However that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things when a light class player could just give themselves a bunch of explosives, or design a class loadout specifically for taking out heavies.\n\n[h1]Bases. You know where this is going.[/h1]\n\nWhat the fuck was the decision making in this part? Seriously?\n\nBase upgrading has been outright removed from the game entirely. Turrets, Generators, Sensors. Nothing can be upgraded anymore. In fact the credit system was removed entirely. This pretty much makes playing technician exceptionally stale & boring. I have no inspiration to sit around my generator room for the entire goddamn match with an enhanced repair gun just to repair a generator stuck at level 1 for eternity every 30 seconds it gets taken down by a rush, because our turrets are level 1 and even the worlds fattest heavy class can just ski right past them. I really don't have much more to say about this. It's a bad feature removal and should be brought back.\n\n[h1]Removal of the credits system[/h1]\n\nAs mentioned above, the credit system has been removed. From what I've tried, the call-in system just doesn't work anymore, even though you can still equip the call-in markers, which no longer have a display or show how much they used to cost. Of course this doubles in with the removal of base upgrading.\n\n[h1]Weapon (de)balancing[/h1]\n\nBullet guns have been turned into pepper spray. The shotguns may as well be literally shooting pepper spray canisters. Other weapons have actually received buffs and assorted miscellaneous changes, with other special variants also being introduced. Most of the new variants I personally think might have an interesting change on the gameplay, if only the gameplay of Tribes: Ascend was still the way it was. So unfortunately, they don't really do too much.\n\nWeapons have had inane changes to their stats that feel out of place, and alienate me from wanting to continue playing this game. Just the same as the developers did eliminate some of the weapons from the game that no longer exist.\n\n[h1]Closing notes[/h1]\n\nI cannot recommend anyone this game in it's current state. It feels like they picked up a game they abandoned at one point, said they'd update it some more, and then just tweaked a whole bunch of stuff to see how the community would react and then never change it back.\n\nAlso another huge negative from what I'm seeing in some other reviews and discussions, apparently people can no longer register to play Tribes: Ascend. So if you already have an account on this game, lucky you. You get to play it. Were you reading reviews to consider playing this game? Well sorry but you're out of luck. Even if you install the game, you apparently can't make an account from what I've read. If anyone can prove those dozens of claims wrong, by all means go ahead.\n\nOn a final closing note, I genuinely hope Hi-Rez realizes this game is dying, with population numbers declining still. With hope they'll revert the game to the way we all enjoyed playing it."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486769634, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541500", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "29834881", "votes_up": 29, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198073733926", "num_reviews": 37, "last_played": 1486917483, "num_games_owned": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3602}, "timestamp_updated": 1486814427, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Best game of 2012\n\nRest in peace"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1487522604, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534198", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30039238", "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025138667", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1499947085, "num_games_owned": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 12758}, "timestamp_updated": 1487522604, "received_for_free": false, "review": "As said in many other comments and reviews before my own, this game has lost it's touch.
