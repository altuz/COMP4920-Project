It combines hack and slash RPG elements with light city builder qualities to become something unique, though simple.\n\nThe graphics and sound aren't phenominal of course, but there is enough content to keep you entertained for a few hours. I don't recommend picking it up at full price but if there's a 50% sale give it a shot."}]}
