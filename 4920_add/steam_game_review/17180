But i very recently started playing it again and i approached it differently. Playing it the way the game actually wants to be played, stealthy, slowly, scouting ahead, pulling a few soldiers away and taking the time to save each man in your small unit.\nIt feels great, sure every battle you do is pretty similar and repetition is one of the major drawbacks but the progression is nice and working towards upgrading each town and getting as much hardenend and seasoned veterans is fun.\n\ndunno if the current \u20ac10,- is really worth it, id more likely price it at 7 or 5 considering its 8 years old.
