You can tell that Maxis was going for something very creative here. I have been playing a lot of Stellaris lately and after I finally got a decent start to my Jedi Order empire, I decided I needed a break. I had played a bit of spore off and on. It hadn't really \"caught\" with me. It felt like there was something there I WANTED to like, but it just wasn't clicking with me. I read a few reviews & posts and decided to give it another go.\n\n   I created my species and got to the tribal stage and was enjoying the game, then it froze... and no auto save...\nand like that I lost everything. I ALMOST turned it off again. I noticed I had a previous saved game and about the same level so I picked it up. I was just about to give up on it again when I finally got to the space age and...\n\nwell 10 hours later I wanted to start fresh with all the experience I'd gained with the game and realized it was 10 hours later. So I decided to grab the Galactic DLC and as I waited to DL it, I decided to leave a quick review. \n\nFor those looking for a 4x game, stick with it. You're used to grinding early game anyhow lol\nThis game is worth every penny. One of the most underrated games I've ever seen and I wish I'd played it sooner and possibly supported a sequel :("}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506635056, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501424", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35273758", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369109261", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506639659, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "playtime_forever": 706}, "timestamp_updated": 1506635056, "received_for_free": false, "review": "can you add mitipayer"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506453731, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35228488", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198165162615", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1503869613, "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2592}, "timestamp_updated": 1506453731, "received_for_free": false, "review": "foda!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506995089, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35432567", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198151882027", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1507080567, "num_games_owned": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 840, "playtime_forever": 3827}, "timestamp_updated": 1506995128, "received_for_free": false, "review": "59+ HOURS!!
