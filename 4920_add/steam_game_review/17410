I would just imagine how great it'd be to play it. \"One day\", I'd say to myself.\n\nAnd man, was it worth the long wait. \n\nIt was much better than I first thought it'd be. This game is just one of a handful that really made me feel... something (a great sense of joy, astonishment, perhaps?), when playing it for the first time. The others being the Half-Life series. I would have logged hundreds (even thousands!) of hours, if I had played them on steam rather than off.\n\nThe soundtrack really make this game shine, aside from the graphics (which are not too bad compared to today's standards). From the combat theme to the main theme, they're just fantastic. I think it helps to make you feel as if you're part of the game..\n\nThe successor, Mirror's Edge Catalyst, is also a good game, and I also recommend it."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506308646, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35195289", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198261381757", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1503860646, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6577}, "timestamp_updated": 1506308646, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Okay, straight facts first.\n\nThis game only has 11 levels, one of those being a tutorial and another being much shorter than the others.\n\nEach level can be completed in under 10 minutes, and the entire game can be completed in about \u2014 or under \u2014 two hours.\n\nYet,\n\nI've somehow managed to rack up over 100 hours in Mirror's Edge.\n\nAnd I still plan on playing more.\n\nThat must speak volumes for itself.\n\nHonestly, I don't quite know why I love this game so much. It might be the absolutely stunning views of the city from above and below. It might be the fantastic, complex but easy to learn gameplay. It might be the art style, which is very minimalistic yet bursting with color and character. It also might be the fact that I just want to strive to become better and better at a game which I love for all the reasons stated above. Whatever the reason is, I think this game is utterly fantastic, and if you've been considering a purchase, get this game. I know Catalyst is out already, but even if you have that, still get this game. It's a great experience, and even if you don't play it as much as I have, I almost guarantee that you'll still have loads of fun with it.\n\nAlso, another great but unintentional feature that makes this game great is its plethora of exploits. Yes, this game is very broken, yet in all the right ways. It allows you to, with practice, knowledge and skill, play the game faster than it was ever intended to be played. This leads to near-endless replayability as you find out new ways to complete the levels faster and faster. It gives you a great sense of progression when you remember back to yourself, before you knew that side-jumping and turning in the direction you jumped instantly gets you to your top speed, and realizing how slow you were back then. However, even though the game is broken, it's never unplayable. Every bug left in the game gives the player an advantage, and at no point in the game are you blocked from progressing due to something you didn't intend to do.\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely love this game. Why?\n\nNo idea, Faithy. I just go there for the pretzels. ;)"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506575443, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503858", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35255007", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198066224775", "num_reviews": 45, "last_played": 1456781674, "num_games_owned": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1136}, "timestamp_updated": 1506575443, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ninja Ninja"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505574000, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500618", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34999148", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198249835532", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1504252053, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 546}, "timestamp_updated": 1505574000, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good graphics, great gameplay, great storyline, but I was a bit disappointed by how short the story was."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506956114, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35419116", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198339196393", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1507174784, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 241, "playtime_forever": 241}, "timestamp_updated": 1506956114, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's good\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505890608, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35078943", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198149765671", "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1499876104, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 419}, "timestamp_updated": 1505890608, "received_for_free": false, "review": "noice"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505963361, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500620", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35096356", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198057007855", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1506378134, "num_games_owned": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_forever": 1452}, "timestamp_updated": 1505963361, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game will forever be one of my favorites.

The command to jump backwards from a wall you're jumping at just rarely worked for me and I had to walk away often because the game wouldn't react to the proper input with anything but me falling to my death for the 15th time. Sometimes you jump towards a ledge that's within reach and you grab it, sometimes you don't grab it and you have to do the exact same motion to get a different result. There's a guide button that helps you if you're turned around but it points your character in the direction of where you're supposed to go, rather than in the direction of how to get there, so you pretty much end up running the wrong way and doubling back looking for something to jump at. I finally gave up at a section where you have to fight guys with assault rifles. I would get on a high ledge and jump kick them, and the game would shoot me 20 feet in the air at a slow speed and the enemies would shoot me to death before I landed.\n\nGiven it's age, I'm not all that disappointed, but I would recommend only buying if it's cheap and you're curious about how the first shaky steps of first person parkour games were like.\n\n3 clay pidgeons out of 10. Would rather not fall to my death again."}]}
