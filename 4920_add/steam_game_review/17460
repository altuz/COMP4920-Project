Since its release 10 years ago (and during my first year of college, because of which I skipped a lot of class) I've beaten this game 17 times, and I'm working on my 18th playthrough now. I've heard every dialogue option, seen every quest and sidequest to its end, and played with every combination of squadmates. Still, to this day, no other game has given me that child-like sense of wonder. This game surpasses any game I played before or since. I have more love for this game than any game I was obsessed with as a child on the NES or SNES or N64. It's has a perfect sci fi universe, it has amazing writing and characters, it has an amazing story, and the exploration is awe-inspiring. The combat hasn't aged well but it's still serviceable, espcially since you can spam biotic powers. If I could only play one game for the rest of my life, this would be it. Play it, for the love of all that is good."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505179025, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519947", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "34893132", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198112350355", "num_reviews": 25, "last_played": 1505247691, "num_games_owned": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 181}, "timestamp_updated": 1505179025, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you dont like this game you're wrong."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505211644, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522013", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "34898335", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198041806393", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1457039500, "num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 11530}, "timestamp_updated": 1505211644, "received_for_free": false, "review": "ruined my life and turned me into xenophile"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505537205, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509002", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34987699", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198093157200", "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1507026844, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 480, "playtime_forever": 11440}, "timestamp_updated": 1505537205, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Unlike the sequels, Mass Effect 1 is one of the  few Sci fi  games where i feel like i'm exploring a Galaxy and not just a dozen of so rooms with a nice background."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505568090, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507695", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "34996840", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198084002198", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1507051092, "num_games_owned": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 162, "playtime_forever": 4806}, "timestamp_updated": 1505568134, "received_for_free": false, "review": "11/10 would [spoiler] punch that damn reporter [/spoiler] again."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506603679, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35261393", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198193427549", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505157762, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1321}, "timestamp_updated": 1506603679, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you want to learn the story of mass effect but dont mind the gaming and graphics you should play it."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504998252, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503529", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34848684", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198222832388", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506869695, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 566, "playtime_forever": 3249}, "timestamp_updated": 1504998252, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Mass Effect is still the best game."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504988306, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501066", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34845888", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198036437554", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1499109097, "num_games_owned": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2621}, "timestamp_updated": 1504988306, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Has the best story of any of the Mass Effect games."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505312305, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34920411", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002468544", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1505277900, "num_games_owned": 2513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2648}, "timestamp_updated": 1505312305, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I've had Mass Effect in my list for a long while and now I'm kicking myself for not playing it earlier. Mass Effect is now officially one of my all-time favorite games. \n\nThe writing and characterization in the game is superb. If you are an action junkie, this might not be the game for you because, while there is a lot of action, it is interrupted by a deep storyline with lots of cut scenes. While I loved the complex characters and breadth of story, you may not.\n\nThe scope of the game is amazing. There is one main plot, a few major plots, and a bunch of side missions. You can really spend a lot of time exploring and completing the side missions.\n\nAs you proceed through missions, you acquire equipment upgrades and new team members. While you eventually have quite a few team members, you can only select two to accompany you on missions. Each member has specialized skills and you have to use strategy when assembling your away team.\n\nThe combat is one of the weaker aspects of the game. It's just not that challenging. But that was a minor annoyance because the story, characters, and side missions were so good.\n\nI'm looking forward to playing 2 and 3 now!! What a superb game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506810249, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35356165", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198044999184", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1475919315, "num_games_owned": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6031}, "timestamp_updated": 1506810249, "received_for_free": false, "review": "My favorite trilogy hands down"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506372853, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500248", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35210476", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197024641", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506286576, "num_games_owned": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 87, "playtime_forever": 6241}, "timestamp_updated": 1506372853, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Well, after playing it the 7th time it gets kinda boring..."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504846145, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34808011", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198182096015", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505070779, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1457}, "timestamp_updated": 1504846145, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Super Awesome"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505069434, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "34868775", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198075204766", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1502992615, "num_games_owned": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3415}, "timestamp_updated": 1505069434, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Im commander Shepard and this  is my favorite game on Steam."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504975950, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34841792", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198151151278", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1486408145, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 523}, "timestamp_updated": 1504975950, "received_for_free": false, "review": "We will bang, OKAY?"}]}
