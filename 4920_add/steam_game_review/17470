It made me not get the game for something like a year, when I was trying to find a new game and said \"Heck, it's at least worth trying\". It was 100% worth trying. \n\nI firmly believe Dead Space is the best survival horror game to come out in the last decade, and an amazing IP. Granted, I may be biased by a love of sci-fi, but I like it even more than The Last of Us, if only because of the fact that the world Dead Space presents feels new (which is not a dig on the fantastic The Last of Us). I only recently bought it from Steam; I had it for Xbox for a very long time. If you like survival horror, if you're a fan of the original Alien movie (itself a \"haunted house in space\" movie), if you like the idea of dismembering mutated zombie corpses, this is a game for you. I'll probably write a review for the sequel soon, which is also a good game. The third game isn't, as of this writing, available on Steam, and is generally regarded as the weakest in the series. For what are, in my opinion, good reasons. Dead Space 1 remains my favorite Dead Space."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506364572, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35208308", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198001601916", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1506072189, "num_games_owned": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 404, "playtime_forever": 838}, "timestamp_updated": 1506364572, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Grabbed this game and DS2 on the steam summer sale.  I went into this game totally blind, never heard of it, never watched a trailer, so for me, this experience was very pleasant.  Fairly unique story and enemies (really enjoy the dismemberment mechanic).  This game had me fully immeresed from the start.  Some areas did feel a bit too much like a go fetch quest, but none of it felt out of place in context with the story.  The atmosphere was well made enough to where explore areas you had already been before still was unsettling.  My only complaint was the mouse aim being atrocious, but if you flip through the steam guides page, someone has a fix for it.

I read the negative reviews talking about bugs and it being a bad port. But after about 20 hours, I made it to Chapter 5 without any problems. No crashes and no glitches, no performance issues either.\n\nI suggest to try it out for yourself if you're thinking of buying this. I was almost lead away by the negative reviews but I was pleasantly surprised to see it's fully stable on my PC.\n\nGameplay is smooth and just as fun as I remember it. Runs a lot better on my PC compared to the PS3 version. I'm using a PS3 controller configured as an Xbox 360 controller for use on PC and Dead Space is able to recognise it. I have the large deadzone bug but doesn't bother me much. I wouldn't recommend using mouse+kb. This game is best played using a gamepad.\n\nThe general agreement on the forums is DS1 is scarier than DS2... So if you want to know which is scarier, get this game. DS2 is more like an action game but still rich with story as the first. I like both games.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to do a review on performance and stability and I can confirm it's very stable and fun to play.
