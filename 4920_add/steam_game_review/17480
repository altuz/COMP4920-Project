This game is no where near as nice as the previous game, it has had much less effort put into it, which shows on every aspect, I will highlight a few negatives comapred to the previous games:\n-The Campaign is very superficial, always the same scenario, no exiting plot-twists etc - basically the story is lame.\n-The game is very simplified. For example, wtf is with the specially allocated slots for the ore-mines, and the fact that ore-mines themselves have been 'simplified'. \n-Unit diversity has also decreased, oh what fun units Yuri's Revenge had. Those Scorched Earth Iraq soldiers, and all of Yuri's mindcontrolling units.\n-The comedy aspect of the game is overdone fueling the superficial feeling. The video acting is retarded. Okay, there are some big names such as J.K.Simmons and the High Sparrow from Game of Thrones, but it really is one big joke for them, you can tell.\n-There is no feeling of battle, the game is like a comedy legoland game played with toys. (Previous games were much better).\n-In battle, depending on difficulty, AI is either literally retarded and does nothing, or is tremendously overpowered and just steamrolls you.\n\n*Anyway I would've wanted to have liked this game after all these years, but I don't. I think its an insult to the Red Alert name.\n5/10.\n"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505949422, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501227", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35093677", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066086408", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1505223237, "num_games_owned": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1135}, "timestamp_updated": 1505949422, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Kirow Reporting... \n\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506780115, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499965", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35338605", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198056588628", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1420829179, "num_games_owned": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1698}, "timestamp_updated": 1506780115, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Whilst I enjoyed  previous command & conquer: red alert games, Red Alert 3  is a tedious, dismal game not worthy of its predecessors.
