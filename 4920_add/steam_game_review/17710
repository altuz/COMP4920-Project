There is a few small community groups and servers with a few players that you can join in on but you will have to base it on the time zone. Besides that the game had a lot of good ideas such as having a commander build a base in a RTS view while the rest of the forces act as infantry to defend or attack the enemy base. The maps are nicely made allowing easy ways to flank and take on base defenses without feeling like your being beaten down by a bat. \n\nThe only issue I do have is the bots as they are extremely useless in many cases...most times they just sit around base or charge a single area. If your going to play...make sure to aim for online or mods that improve the a.i a bit. Overall it was fun while it lasted but thankfully other games are out with the same feeling as this."}]}
