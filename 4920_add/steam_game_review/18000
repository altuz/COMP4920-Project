You play... um... [i]you[/i]. After having your house crushed by a giant fruit picker; you join Tycho and Gabe on a grim, yet backwardly hilarious, journey to investigate the mysterious stirrings besetting the city... and find a new house.\n\nThe immediate joy is that combat is more involved than conventional turn-based RPG's. You now have to block attacks (and even trigger a counter-attack if you time it right) and pull off combos in order to successfully execute special moves - which get harder as you unlock the stronger attacks. It's a simple addition but immediately adds more skill and fun into the combat. The turn system is also quite clever: Moves unlock as your turn bar fills up (better moves requiring more time) - so do you use your turn trapping a mime in an invisible box, or hold out that little bit longer to pull off that neat combo?\n\nCuriously they have also done away with random encounters, meaning there are a finite number of fixed battles in the game. Whilst a little unconventional, it actually helps to streamline the title and remove any levelling-up grind. Success is no longer about out-levelling your foes, but out-playing them. A nice touch, but equally can make things feel a bit 'sparse'.\n\nThe story is dark, yet daft; graciously letting you unceremoniously beat things up that you feel would be pretty funny, but know you shouldn't... Namely: Clowns, mimes and a barbershop quartet.\n\nPlayfully woven through comic-book dialogue; it's engaging, great fun and the combat is quite exciting for an RPG; Boss fights in particular. Not a massive game (good for a solid 7 hours), but a very well executed indie title!"}]}
