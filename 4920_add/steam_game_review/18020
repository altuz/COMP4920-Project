Nothing majorly new, but nothing taken away either. In many respects, this is simply a [i]continuation[/i] of the previous game than an out-and-out sequel. Safely then, if you loved the former then there is little reason this one won't also hit the same, delicious sweet spots. Same interesting combat mechanics, same humour and same style.\n\nOnly this time, you're now beating up lunatics, hat-spiders and rich folk. Balances out all that hobo-bashing you did last time...\n\nThough perhaps a bit grimmer than before, the new enemies are fun, the story continues to deliver and culminates in another epic boss finale. Though standalone, it's still better to play the original; for plot and for a neat unlockable that you can carry over."}]}
