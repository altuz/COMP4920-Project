The only exception to these are the weapons which allow you to use your Justice Meter, which also have tiered upgrades, but deciding which of them to use is actually slightly interesting - though I found the spinning swords to be the best of them by far, to the point where I didn't really use the others much. This also affects the stores in the game, which have very little worth purchasing until you're level 18 and can just buy the best equipment in the game - before that point, items are far too expensive, don't offer a huge benefit (unless, as it did for me, the game basically refused to ever drop crossbows for you) and will likely be replaced quickly with items dropped by monsters or found in treasure chests.\n\nWith the itemization out of the way, the game is on the simple side - except for a few difficulty spikes like the Pip Village, I found Normal to basically be walking through the early game and killing everything in 1-3 hits, and later doing it just as fast from range with the crossbow. There's a variety of consumable items, but I only really used the healing items because it didn't seem like I ever really needed any of the others, or had a clear idea of when element resistance potions or whatnot would even have been useful. So, yeah. The combat wasn't terribly interesting, and neither were the rewards for the combat.\n\nThe parody elements were occasionally amusing, but frequently fell flat for me - that you're going on a set of stupid fetch quests isn't made any better by the game calling attention to how stupid the fetch quests are, for instance. It's one of my gripes about parody RPGs in general, that they frequently seem to think that it excuses replicating bad game design for the sake of parody. Some of the more puzzle-like quests were amusing, however, and weren't something I was used to in this type of game.\n\nUltimately, DeathSpank is the kind of game I would mostly suggest trying if you think its style of humor would appeal to you. It doesn't really stack up well without that. (Unfortunately, it also seems as if DeathSpank never goes on sale any more, from what I've heard? So I can't even really suggest picking it up on the cheap, even though it's over five years old now.)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1290189626, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "1163161", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197988209745", "num_reviews": 84, "last_played": 1460453184, "num_games_owned": 2409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1253}, "timestamp_updated": 1385413170, "received_for_free": false, "review": "DeathSpank is a amazing little RPG, not as deep as other RPG's but its humorous and a lot of fun, pick it up if you are not so gready for a unique little adventure.\n\nI'll give this one 10 orphan's out of 10\n\n- Blaise Smith"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1293523239, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500486", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2093199", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198002162584", "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 780}, "timestamp_updated": 1293523239, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A comedy game, which is absolutely rare nowadays.
