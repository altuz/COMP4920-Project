A sequel that does nothing new whatsoever will often feel hollow and foolish.\n\nDeathspank Thongs of virtue is one such sequel. It's a very simple action RPG that relies heavily on a quirky sense of humor that attempts to poke fun at the RPG genre in general. Unfortunately while the humor and silly art-style could carry the first game both have been worn quite thin by now and you are left with just the shallow action RPG that form the base of Deathspank's gameplay.\n\nNothing has changed other than the story and if you have already played the original Deathspank this won't be much different.\n\nYou should note, this game has a game breaking bug that corrupts your savegame if you exit the game at certain locations. The developers fixed the bug but never shared the update on STEAM. You have go find it yourself on the Steam forums and manually fix your savegame. Guess EA is rubbing off on them.\n\nNot really a game I'd recommend buying if you already played Deathspank.

Also, this game has virtually no bugs (at least I have not noticed any), and the gameplay is extremely fun.
