It had everything going on for it: Excelent 60's sci-fi B-movie atmosphere, good graphics, good soundtrack and the right idea. This should've been a \"must play\" TD game, right?\n\nBut no, it's not. Far from it, because the gameplay is just utter crap. First of all the TD mechanic is SUPER restrictive and completely un-intuitive, sure it looked like a nifty concept, but the execution is below subpar. It's like the game is actually a puzzle and it's forcing you to find the correct and only strategy to win each map because god knows there's no room for having fun with different setups.\n\nOn top of it, the towers themselves are honestly quite boring and the game doesn't really add anything new to the genre, except for that awkward, weird and ultimately failed rotationary orbital system that forces you to find the correct solution and micromanage like crazy as well.\n\nAnd again, it's a shame because the rest of the package is really cool. I mean, it's cheesy as hell, but that's intended, and it really works... So in the end, I'm afraid I can't recommend this, as much as I'd like to, purely in terms of gameplay and fun. It's not very fun to play, honestly. \n\nBut hey, if you're a fan of weird cheesy 60's low quality sci-fi flicks, you might want to check this game and enjoy it on a purely aesthetic way.\n\nIf you're looking for your next TD fix, stay away from this."}]}
