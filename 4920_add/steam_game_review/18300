The camera angles constantly change, usually when you are in mid-air, which throws off the direction you are going and makes you continually fall to the bottom and have to start over from your last check point. Looking at the achievements, makes me wonder why this game has a positive rating considering that less than 20% of those who bought it have beat the last 2 levels and most haven't beaten the last 5.

And considering you\u2019re jumping around doing loopy-loops and other shit (that sounds fun but isn\u2019t somehow) you never see where you actually are. You could still be on course but chances are you're falling to your death.\n\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though the level design is far worse than the camera. Instead of having competently made stages you get something that looks like it was throw together in gmod using the freeze tool. The only exception being the first level and forth level. The game still had a chance to change my view of it but Sadly the controls were the nail in the coffen..\n\n\nThe game plays poorly....  In order to move faster than a crawl regardless if you\u2019re on a slope or not you have to press one of the w.s.d.a keys in any given direction. This simple action will immediately catapult you in said direction after one and a half seconds. \n"}]}
