SFM gives you better precision in making things do what you want.\n\nWith a little patience, you can make awesome animations and images. If you can imagine it, chances are you can do it in SFM. \n\nThere's a con, though:\n\nMaps and models: not enough. The selection of maps and models are tiny compared to Gmod. On the subject on Gmod, with a little work you can import Gmod models into SFM and they work fairly well when you just focus on posing. Animating, though, is a different story. It requires more work to make it animate correctly compared to the models specifically designed for SFM.\n"}, {"votes_down": 10, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485983905, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530146", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 42, "recommendationid": "29636402", "votes_up": 37, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172895191", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506969885, "num_games_owned": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 314, "playtime_forever": 90569}, "timestamp_updated": 1485983905, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Im bad at it"}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1487263255, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528192", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 7, "recommendationid": "29966134", "votes_up": 27, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217959645", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505888564, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_forever": 92425}, "timestamp_updated": 1487263255, "received_for_free": false, "review": "AMAZING PROGRAM TO MAKE ANIMATIONS!!!\n\nTho could you please make this for   Mac???

I currently only make posters with SFM not animations because I am still confused on how it opperates. One animator on YouTube, The Winglet, gave me a reason to continue my involvement with SFM. His animations are smooth, funny, and even a bit graphic at times. I believe that anyone who uses SFM can learn to understand it with both time and patience.
