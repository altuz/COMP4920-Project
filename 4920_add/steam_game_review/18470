It look much more like an expnasion that a new game. Its only change few things, also the graphics, is the same.  \n\nBut... There is few things, I dont like much:\n\n- all the soldier in the game, CNT be killed, if U kill one of them, u lost the mission (but as they see you, they just start shooting, and kill you). And this could be ok, but there are too many mission where there are soldiers, and that means that in most of the mission, u cnt kill your enemy, and this is really annoyng, and some times makes the game a bit boring.\n\n- There is only 1 mission where u can use all your 6 heroes. I think the average, is less than 3... And this is definitively too low. In many mission u just can use only 1 heroes, in some 2 and so on. And that make the game also boring. If I got 6 heros, I expect to use them, maybe not in all the mission, but at least in the majority.\n\n- The feeling is like, that at the ends of that game, there is somthing missing: In all the game, there is nothing special, or somthing particular. Even the last mission is a bit prosy. I was sure there would be something more, but I was wrong. And even in this mission, the last one, where u excpect somthing particular, or the most difficult mission, u just can use 3 heroes, and the mission is quite easy.\n\n"}]}
