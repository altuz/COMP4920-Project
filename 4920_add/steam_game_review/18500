For perspective, it came out only a year after The Orange Box did. When it was first released, it was undeniably the best tower defense game in the world, but that's not surprising, because its only competition was Desktop Tower Defense and a handful of other shoddy flash games that were starting to ride the trend.\n\nA lot of time has passed since then, and hundreds of weird and interesting tower defense games have been released. So, is Defense Grid still the best? No clue. I haven't played as many tower defense games with the exception of a few SC2 TD maps and WC3 maps.\n\nThe people who made Defense Grid understand where tower defense came from. Everything about this game is built to look, feel, and sound like retro StarCraft, from the isometric view, to the color choices, to the tower types and damage types. Gun towers are basically bunkers of marines, inferno towers are bunkers of firebats, cannon towers are bunkers of ghosts, and so on. They\u2019ve even borrowed some classic towers from other games, like the tesla coils from the Red Alert series. Even today, it still hits me with that old 2002-era nostalgia of searching for tower defense maps on Battle.net and that pumped feeling of starting the map with a full lobby of people (because, of course, you needed a full lobby to even have a chance!)\n\nDefense Grid also has a scoring system, which rewards even the tiniest improvements in performance with exponentially more money and score. It appeals greatly to the gamer's OCD, since the better you play the beginning of a mission, the more freedom you have to build deadly mazes for the remainder of the mission, the easier victory becomes, and the more often you can see your score skyrocket into the hundreds of millions. Fast-forward and checkpoint-rewinding controls make it simple to re-do every wave until it is perfect. It also creates an ultra-hardcore metagame with a massive curve of leaderboard scores, if you\u2019re into that kind of competition. You\u2019ll need to learn some really annoying advanced techniques if you want to break into the top 100 on any mission, or you could choose to compete in maps and game modes where the techniques don\u2019t apply. Or you could simply choose to compete with yourself and your friends, or just aim for the pre-set gold medals.\n\nThis game is the sole reason why future tower defense games had to start trying new things, because it got the basics about as perfect as they can possibly get, at least for those of us who still occasionally see hordes of zerglings filing through mazes of bunkers in our waking dreams.\n\nPros:\n+ Nostalgia TD map put into a modern form\n+ One of the better TD games\n+ Lots of customizability in gameplay and base formation\n+ Scoring adds an element of competitiveness amongst friends and OCD min/maxing\n\nCons:\n- TD is all the game is, if you're not into TD style games you won't like it\n\nTL;DR:\n7/10\nFantastic homage to old TD games, though the game is like 9 years old it still holds some rusty fun for me because it reminds me of old SC/WC3 TD games"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500919697, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509249", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33771148", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198006555408", "num_reviews": 47, "last_played": 1504744255, "num_games_owned": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 603}, "timestamp_updated": 1500919697, "received_for_free": false, "review": "it's a nice tower defence game\ni've seen some people say it's the best, I wouldn't say that. But it's definitely different. Some stages you can modify the path of the waves making it harder for the enemy to win. you gain interest on the money you don't spend which add a little money management aspect to the game as well"}]}
