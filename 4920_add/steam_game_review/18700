It's got a quirky concept, interesting art style, original puzzle-solving mechanics, and more. But I just don't like it. As Audish said, it's too punishing with its fall damage and momentum. The audio was also a huge problem for me. Years after uninstalling the game, I can still hear that aggravating death noise in my nightmares."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1493088033, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478604", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "31349681", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198024943675", "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1503780271, "num_games_owned": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 207}, "timestamp_updated": 1493088033, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game!"}]}
