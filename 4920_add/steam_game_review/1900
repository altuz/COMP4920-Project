The ED construct their buildings like a puzzle, connecting each building to the others; the LC construct their buildings by stacking modules like towers, the UCS use droids (the former two drop their buildings from spaceships) to build their buildings and then construct add-ons onto them, while the Alien race construct their units by cloning and mutating their units themselves, instead of constructing buildings to produce the units (though they can create defensive buildings).\n+The majority of the factions can customise their units - you research different weapons, armour etc. and can then design the units from those parts. Thus, the same unit can be fitted for different situations, such as anti-air support, siege, anti-armour role etc..\n+The graphics of the game itself aren't half bad, considering how old the game is.\n+Units don't have infinite ammo - conventional weapons need to resupply ammo, while energy weapons overheat and become less effective after repetitive use.\n\nCons:\n-The story doesn't have a proper conclusion. It just ends on a cliffhanger.\n-Unexplored areas on the map are covered in static, instead of just being blacked out. Not really a pleasant effect. Also, there's no proper fog of war - it's unclear how far it stretches, so units can suddenly appear like out of nowhere, because that area was actually covered by a fog that you can't see.\n-Cutscene graffics have aged poorly.\n-Some campaign dialogue between the characters locks down control of your units and builidings.... yet time doesn't stop, so your units will end up doing whatever they please until the dialogue ends... or you skip them to stop your units from getting themselves killed.\n-The alien race is the only faction without customisable units, limiting strategic options with the faction. Also, the faction's mechanics aren't so well done. Units need to be close to a water source to absorb a certain amount of water before they can be cloned or morph to a different unit and, since all ground units use the same resouce, the area around a water source gets very clunky. Especially since there's no option to select where the cloning/morphing should take place - the unit just does it on the spot it was standing at when you give the order. When more than one unit is being cloned/morphed, any other units blocking the way are moved away and can even end up on innaccessible terrain.\n-Most air units in the game are pretty useless. Bombers cannot be moved anywhere unless they're given a target... and then they need to fly to it all the way from your base.... and they're not all too fast, so they're unpractical for anything more than base defence. Other air units can usually be shot down in one or two shots even by anti-air troops, not to mention base defences, before they can really do anything, so their usefulness is limited.\n-On the other hand, ground units move relatively slowly and most of the campaign maps are large, maze-like, and with narrow passages, so the units have to move in single file. Not the best way to launch an attack when the majority of your units are stuck in traffic.\n-Lack of a decent manual or something of the sort on how things work, so quite a few things have to be figured out through trial and error. Such as, how to give a series of commands to your units, what weapons are effective against what and how ammo reloading works. Also, some campaign mission objectives are vague (e.g., in one level, it tells you that you need to free character X, but it doesn't specify that you need to bring your hero character there to do so).\n\nAll in all, at the time of writing this, the game costs 5 Euros and I got it on sale for just 1 Euro, so it's a sufficiently decent game for its price in my opinion."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499928138, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500572", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33496793", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197963783868", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1418618158, "num_games_owned": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2424}, "timestamp_updated": 1499928138, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Buy it on GOG.
