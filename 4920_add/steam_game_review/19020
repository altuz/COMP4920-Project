I think the Puzzle Quest series does a better job of engaging you with its story, and has similar mechanics to progress with.\n\nThat being said, it's nice to play a puzzle that isn't \"match 3\" and while the combat is repetitive (and despite what some think, you [i]can[/i] make a comeback from some very bad looking situations), it's different and interesting enough that while you're progressing the story and facing off against different enemies, it doesn't get tedious. It's worth a play, and will keep you engaged if you're after something light.\n\nI think the only unfortunate thing for me is that there is little incentive to play and get the final achievement (it's just grinding), and not enough of a community to really get anything going for the multiplayer since it's a little older now."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1302433978, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496788", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "885912", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197981047937", "num_reviews": 408, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 5406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 278}, "timestamp_updated": 1385414408, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have insomnia really fucking bad tonight so I'm reviewing everything I've played.\n\nUnfun and tedious.
