This game is not worth your time, do not play it, do not buy it even if it's on sell for less than 50 cents. It plays and feels like a cheap cellphone game, or even an unfinished prototype. In fact I believe that the game IS unfinished, because the enemy AI is mostly non-existent, the level design is atrocious and the animation is the bare minimal, with some of the enemies having maybe 2 or 3 frames of movement. The game has a lot of bugs and is very glitchy, I ended up using glitches to my advantage just to beat the terribly unbalanced final boss fight due to the game being obviously incomplete. I literally just hid behind the final boss and spammed him with the strongest weapon until he was defeated, that's it, game over I won.\n\nThe game has a whole one song that plays 90% of the time, it's a very generic rock song and it's set on an infinite loop, there may be a song that plays during the boss battles, I just can't remember and it was probably just as unmemorable as the fights themselves. The only good thing I can say about the game is that the backgrounds are pretty good, they're very detailed and really fit the overall tone of the levels. Someone obviously put a lot of work into them and it's a shame they were wasted on this game, I really hope the artist(s) moved onto a project that's more worthy of their talent. It's a shame really, becauuse this game could have been rather good, but for whatever reason it seems that the developers completely abandoned it and the publisher released it anyway.\n\nOverall: The game took me about 4 hours to complete, that includes all attempts and when it lost my save data. It is not worth your time, the fact that it's normal price is $9.99 is laughable and I feel for those poor few who purchased the game at full price on a whim. So please heed my warning, back away and spend your money on something better."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1420761873, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509950", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "13901655", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994799155", "num_reviews": 139, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 32}, "timestamp_updated": 1420761873, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Awful, ugly, and barely playable.
