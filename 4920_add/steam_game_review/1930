(I wouldn't spend my time trying to justify Eragon if I could just watch Lord of the Rings!)\nThis game really throws you in at the deep end without giving you a reason to swim. Barely an hour into the main story you find your map dotted with about half a dozen quest markers, each of which you need to visit in order to advance.  You have three ways of getting around in Two Worlds: you can walk, you can ride a horse, or you can teleport.\n Walking from A to B is the tried-and-true method, of course, but you'll soon grow tired of being swarmed by monotonous waves of enemies every thirty seconds; and the types of opponent you encounter are about as uninteresting as those in any MMO starter area (big spiders, wolves, shirtless bandits, etc.).\n Horse-riding was marketed as one of the major selling points of this game, and the fact that one of the core skills you can invest in relates to mounted combat demonstrates how highly the developers value this aspect. The problem is that horse-riding really isn't worth the effort. Gamers familiar with Red Dead Redemption and The Witcher 3 will be accustomed to having a mount that is only a whistle away; don't expect any such convenience here. Secondly the horses really don't seem to take to the terrain in Two Worlds, and attempting even a slight hill will cause your mount to hit an invisible wall. The mechanics of horse-riding are horribly clunky, and the mounted combat isn't very enjoyable either.\nThe teleports are probably your best option, but in order to use teleport sites you first have to travel to them -- by foot or horse, and so the above-listed problems really can't be avoided.\nSome reviewers seem to like the combat. It doesn't get much more complicated than click-click-click with the occasional use of a hotkey. The fighting animations are one of the better aspects of this game, I'll admit, and I found a fair amount of enjoyment in seeing how my character wielded and attacked using the various weapons on offer (which, again to this game's credit, are very numerous). \nI don't think anyone is going to be citing the plot as one of Two Worlds' must-try qualities, and amidst all the swarming and general tedium you'll probably have to refresh your memory of the story's events pretty quickly. The side quests are fairly average for an RPG; they neither make nor break the experience. \nThe voice acting is simply horrible and the writing isn't much better. These aspects, if not the ones mentioned above, will almost certainly prevent you from appreciating the plot of Two Worlds.\nOverall, the bad outweighs the good in my opinion. If you've poured thousands of hours into dozens of great RPGs and really can't find anything else to add to your wishlist, you may salvage some fun from all the monotony and second-rate gameplay. If there are other RPGs out there that you're even mildly interested in, on the other hand, I'd strongly advise *against* making Two Worlds your next purchase. \n\n"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506622155, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500507", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35267741", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198038262068", "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1506622116, "num_games_owned": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 213, "playtime_forever": 213}, "timestamp_updated": 1506622155, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Old and not gold"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505516566, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495175", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34983140", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198022820837", "num_reviews": 32, "last_played": 1505682666, "num_games_owned": 613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 135}, "timestamp_updated": 1505516566, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A game so bad that it's good."}]}
