The game has handsome graphics, a fun soundtrack and is challenging enough to engage an adult and simple enough to be grasped by a child.  The concept itself is unique, using anthropomorphized endagered animals to bounce of a trampoline to unlock seeds that terraform a barren piece of rock.  While the gameplay itself is a familiar breakout arcade mechanic, Space Ark uses 3D to put a spin on the standard sidescrolling challenge.  Both widescreen and controller enabled, Space Ark is a game that every indie fan should own."}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1406667042, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479048", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "11468817", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198068308196", "num_reviews": 48, "last_played": 1406666965, "num_games_owned": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 12}, "timestamp_updated": 1406667042, "received_for_free": false, "review": "So no full screen?"}]}
