Good impressions on the concept for the two characters working together, the decent art, and the occasional use of humor. The orchestral music that overpowered the action, the ineffective level design that often amounted to little more than broken staircases with a variety of monsterspam attacks while you climb. The right mouse/left mouse button firing modes and their interactions together were interesting but badly implemented with the enemy designs. You have 5 hearts and a life but usually the hearts dont matter because you die right away. Most deaths are caused by immediate death pitfalls. Some ennemies can drag you in the air and drop you randomly. Fishes come out of the ground to mess you up. Immediate drowning with no way to save yourself. No double jump. Jumping is very floaty and imprecise. People claim the game is not finished and abandonned by creator. I gave up after 20 minutes. The camera is zoomed in on the protag so much that everytime you jump the entire screen shifts up and down by way too much. Removing for declutter"}]}
