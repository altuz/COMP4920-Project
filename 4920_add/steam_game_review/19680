It is a work of art.  The action is fast and addictive.  The platforming is tight and rewarding.  But what really sets this game appart is the surreal visuals.  Each area is like turning the page of a story book.  The charactors are all well done too.  My one complaint is a glitch where it won't automatically swap you back to your mele weapon sometimes like it should.  This is fixed by just pressing '1' to switch back manually.  Annoying but it doesn't happen alot."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507060592, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35455435", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198040638889", "num_reviews": 27, "last_played": 1507059616, "num_games_owned": 1018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "playtime_forever": 60}, "timestamp_updated": 1507060592, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Alice seems like a game i'd love to enjoy, however the 30 FPS lock and awkward camera speed makes the game unenjoyable to play.\n\nJust a heads up for anyone who plans to purchase."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506134637, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500706", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35142442", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197960336357", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506134486, "num_games_owned": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "playtime_forever": 16}, "timestamp_updated": 1506134637, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Garbage since EA has forced this old game into DRM.
