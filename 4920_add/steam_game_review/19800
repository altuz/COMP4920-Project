In this game you play as Joe Hartsock, one of the members of Sgt. Backer\u2019s squad. In this game, you fight parallel to the story of Road to Hill 30 and get to see the story form another angle.\n\nJust like the first game, this one is still a slow paced, tactics based shooter with some of the draw backs from the previous game. No way to heal in battle, low weapons accuracy (although its more precise then it feels). Just like the other game, this title still contains a great story and top notch \u201chorrors of war\u201d.\n\nAs I said in my review of Road to Hill 30, if you are looking for a run and gun shooter this game is not for you. It is, however, a well done tactics based war game with a story that pulls at the heart."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498313220, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506090", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "32728171", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197987175590", "num_reviews": 79, "last_played": 1497902812, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 597}, "timestamp_updated": 1498313261, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[u]What I liked about the game[/u] \n\n[list]\n[*]\tNew weapons and a new tank to command (not drive). Who knew blowing up Nazi tanks with the panzerfaust could be so much fun. The FG 42 was probably my favourite new weapon to use.  \n\n[*]\tNothing has changed for the worse; still the same gameplay, and controls. \n\n[*]\tI like the little changes they've made, like the animation that shows red changing weapons and the ability to move around with the mouse in that battlefield view mode. \n\n[*]\tI like how you can climb onto tanks and use the 30 or 50 cal.  \n\n[*]\tI really like the levels; I like how the game focuses on D-Day and the battles that went on in France. The graphics still hold up very well today. \n\n[*]\tShows the dark side of war very well. Soldiers who you've trained with; fought with, had a laugh with; shot and killed just like that.\n\n[*]\tYou get rewarded medals, which unlock extra content. The higher the difficulty the more extra content you unlock. \n\n[*]\tYou don't have to equip the grenade, you can just press G to throw grenade. \n\n[*]\tA more likable character to play as; Sgt Red Heartstock.\n\n\n[u]What I disliked about the game[/u] \n\n[*]\tA.I can get on you nerves. If you order your men to take cover behind a wall, two of them will stand in front of the wall getting shot to death. If you tell your men to come to you, they will pick most stupidest route, like in front of an MG42. You put men in a place where they can flak the enemy, but there's always one who is unable to shoot at the enemy, because he is suck in front of a wall and they always moan about things. I wish your fellow soldiers were more independent, it felt like I was holding their hands all the way through the game.  \n\n[*]\tNo med kits, which becomes a problem later on in the game.\n\n[*]\tYou can take many hits by different Nazi weaponry, but when it comes to the MG42 you die instantly.  \n\n[*]\tSoundtrack wasn't anything special. \n\n[*]\tI wish you where able to use weapons like the 88, mortar and the flak cannon. \n\n[*]\tThere weren't really any memorable missions. I wish there were more missions which involved using the sniper rifle. I found that Earned in Blood was a much harder game compared to Road to hill 30. \n\n[*]\tWhen using the battlefield mode to observe your surroundings you are quite limit to how much you can view using the mouse. Looking around on the map using the mouse is quite limited; sometimes your enemies don't appear on the map at all.     \n[/list]\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u] \n\n\nWell it's certainly more frustrating compared to the first game. The A.I of your fellow soldiers really did piss me off. The game tried to be emotional, but I was more frustrated than anything. If you really enjoyed the first game then I recommend you play this. If you haven't played the first game then make sure you play that game first, because it was much enjoyable, especially the missions involving the Springfield rifle.    \n\n\n[h1]7/10[/h1]"}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1493528634, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483142", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31455593", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113014119", "num_reviews": 340, "last_played": 1493528140, "num_games_owned": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 249}, "timestamp_updated": 1493528634, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Brothers In Arms: Earned In Blood\nfast game with modern day graphics with easy controls that moves from location A to B to C and so on.\n\ngood game.\n"}, {"votes_down": 62, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1495719839, "weighted_vote_score": "0.391052", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 7, "recommendationid": "31951872", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090259142", "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1496782314, "num_games_owned": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 344}, "timestamp_updated": 1495719839, "received_for_free": false, "review": "To hard.
