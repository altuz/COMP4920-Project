I personally have always loved it. What are the flaws? Well, the biggest problem people have with it is the respawning enemies. You clear out an enemy checkpoint, scout it (thus marking it on your map), and as soon as you walk a little bit down the road away from the checkpoint every single enemy in it has respawned. A lot of people hate the game for this reason alone. I don't mind this at all though - it makes the game world feel constantly alive, populated and dangerous. After you've killed all the guards at a checkpoint you can sneak around it if you need to get past it from that point.\n\nAnother thing people hate is the malaria. Your character has malaria and you have to keep taking pills whenever it flares up. The pills never run out unless you do the main story missions, and when they do you get a mission to get more pills. If you only do side missions and explore the world however they never run out. Basically at random times your screen will go blurry and yellow and you have to press H to take a malaria pill. It can happen during a firefight and it can seriously get you killed. I find this quite immersive but I guess a lot of people hate it. \n\nAnother flaw is the mouse sensitivity. It's a pretty shoddy port-job. You have to turn on V-Sync and put mouse sensitivity all the way to maximum, this fixes the problem really. You get used to the high sensitivity pretty quickly.\n\nAI sometimes have superhuman aim. Snipers and rocket launchers especially. They can see you from a mile away. There aren't that many enemy camps with snipers or rocket launchers in them though so it's not that big of a deal. Plus you can just use a sniper rifle or dart gun of your own to take them out from a distance.\n\nI've only talked about flaws so far so let me tell you why I recommend the game and why it's my favourite of the franchise. I'm walking around the war torn African country one day searching for rough diamonds (the only currency worth anything - you have a little gadget that flashes a green light when you're near a diamond stash), listening to the nice music, admiring the scenery. I sneak past one enemy checkpoint. When I'm close enough to hear the guards talking the music changes, it's now very tense, alerting you to the nearby danger. I follow the road, quickly diving behind a tree as a patrol jeep drives past me. I cross a bridge and soon enough I'm out of the forest I was just in, before me is desert with hills and mountains and a train track going through it. I follow the track, looking at my gadget for the green light to flash and tell me there are diamonds nearby, when I see another checkpoint. The guards are smoking, one is having a pee. I suspect they are hiding diamonds and need to get closer to check. I find a nice sniping position, I count 4 guards. I shoot one of them in the head from half a mile away and the rest run and hide. I'm staring at the camp through my sniper rifle for 4 or 5 minutes, waiting for the other 3 to show themselves so I can send them to the afterlife. Then, behind me I hear \"I think he's over here somewhere, I'm sure he's here\".\n\nClever girl! They actually used cover to hide and sneak around behind me. So I burned them with a flamethrower. The end. Good game, easily worth buying if on sale."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504849682, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511497", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34808612", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198015089986", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1504837218, "num_games_owned": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1445}, "timestamp_updated": 1504849682, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Recently replayed it.

Now a negative to me is that there isn't anything in the settings to change your FOV.  I assume one can change that in a configuration file but I would prefer to do that in the game.  In regards to gameplay the idea of finding and saving people and them coming to your aid when you are about to die / die is kind of cool and if you don't keep them from being killed you lose them I believe.  In regards to weaponry in this game I haven't seen much variety but I know there are ways to upgrade things and that is good enough for me. As for the day and night cycle it is there making the game more realistic.  The sounds in the game are really good and I swear though that there is a mix of bad language in one or more areas where nobody is there talking but it is just muffled in the sound of nature. Ubisoft having some fun hiding something but able to be found if one listens closely?  Yes or no Ubisoft.

But i could put this aside if the game wasn't as repetitive as it is! You literally go to multiple locations multiple times to kill a target or threaten him to give you something that will help you kill the actual target! And what's even worse is that you can't modify your weapons and your only options for stealth is your machete (which spoiler alert: doesn't work, when you hit an npc they'll scream in agony alerting the other npcs), silenced makarov and MP5 (silenced makarov is good but can't do much with just a pistol the range is shit and MP5 has shittier accuracy than that) and dart rifle (which is a special weapon and special weapons have like 5 shots!).

You choose your player character at the beginning of the game and it influences which group you are indebted to at the beginning and other parts of the story.\n\n- Interesting mechanics. Stuff like your gun jamming or breaking if it's not high quality encourages the player to actually use their money and not hoard it and adds a layer of realism. For example (in real life), you could buy an AK47 for approximately $69 dollars from an out-of-home gunsmith in the Middle East and it would be pretty shoddy, or you could pay a decent amount more and get a consistent and reliable AK from one of the many mainstream gunsmiths who have the rights to produce AK-based firearms. In game, the enemies would have the shoddy $69 version and you would rock on up with one fresh off of the assembly line.\n\n- Realistic(ish) Map system. Your map in this looks like an actual pocket map and is equippable, instead of other games where your character sits still and does nothing whilst you consult a map on a pause menu or the like.\n\nThat being said, this game has a worse story (not terrible, just worse as FarCry 3's story can be read into in a lot of interesting ways) and smaller map than FarCry 3, so I'd recommend FarCry 3 over this unless the price gap is large enough to justify it."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506765116, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35330567", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198100637800", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506770682, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 102, "playtime_forever": 311}, "timestamp_updated": 1506765116, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a pretty damn amazing game, just look at the graphics, it's so good graphics for an old game, it's ahead of time cause no other game had this good graphics then.\nThe physics are really good, I mean you can break your weapon for using it too much and it isn't like any of the other far cry games where it is hard to die litteraly."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506842860, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35368096", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198049134462", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506842965, "num_games_owned": 1277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 255, "playtime_forever": 1865}, "timestamp_updated": 1506842860, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Far Cry 2 is tedious and full of garbage time.

I play a LOT of retro games, so I am forgiving on antiquated interfaces, and even more forgiving on outdated graphics.  With this in mind, I found Far Cry 1 to be incredibly underwhelming.  Trust me when I tell you that I am well aware of and a frequent purveyor of the phrase \"For it's time, it was amazing.\"  With Far Cry 1, however, I did not feel this way with the exception of two details: 1) It had an open-world angle to it, and 2) the graphics, for it's time, were really good.  With that said, to me it still felt like just-another-first-person-shooter.  \n\nSo when I decided a year later to play Far Cry 2, I wasn't really sure what to expect.  I've read numerous claims that \"It's the best in the serious,\" yada-yada... but as an incredibly picky gamer, I've learned that you can't really trust anyone's opinion but your own.  With THAT being said, I found this game, even being nine years old, to be nothing short of excellent.  The only detriments to the game are the sped-up voice clips (to save disk space) and the AI being able to see and shoot you through all manner of cover (grass, metal sheets, you name it; though it's not QUITE as bad as Far Cry 1 was for this).  The music was great (if you appreciate styles like African-Tribal, as I do), the graphics hold up, the gun play is fun (this coming from a guy who doesn't really like gun play, but more of a Serious Sam/Killing Floor/Left 4 Dead shooting hordes of bitches that run at you type of gamer), and the way that you weave your own web in the story to a very satisfying extent is fantastic.  What an extraordinary game. In my opinion it COMPLETELY blows Far Cry 1 out of the water; it's not even comparable.\n\nOn to Far Cry 3... whenever I get back in the mood for another Far Cry game. :)"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505222578, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499365", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34900967", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198059249595", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505409294, "num_games_owned": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1949}, "timestamp_updated": 1505222578, "received_for_free": true, "review": "It was good when it came out and it is still good"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506385629, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501478", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "35213079", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198058622815", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1506462162, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 517, "playtime_forever": 3671}, "timestamp_updated": 1506385629, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I don't know what technical witchcraft was conducted to make a game this large and pretty into a 4gb download."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506403986, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500384", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35216264", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198121769859", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506402092, "num_games_owned": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 876, "playtime_forever": 1726}, "timestamp_updated": 1506403986, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Repetitive, boring, repetitive, annoying, stupidly broken ai, repeptitive, no stealth, boring story, did i mention repeptitive, chararcters with personalities thinner than a sheet of paper, repetitively boring, desparately needs quick travel to circumvent running into 100 guys along the way to your next destination all the while shooting your car to bits, player can't run more than 5 meters, driving into another car that has a mounted gunner shooting you for the 6th millionth time, the camo in this game literally does nothing and is the most expensive thing in the shop, malaria is a hindrance rather than an interesting threat the player has to look out for such as jamming guns; it just forces you to do more stupid missions to get malaria pills.\n\nTL;DR: Play any other Far Cry game for a much, much better time."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505392136, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499545", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34947521", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197960693835", "num_reviews": 69, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 893}, "timestamp_updated": 1505392291, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Bitesize Review - Far Cry\u00ae 2: Fortune's Edition\n\nThe Good:\n- Plenty of guns and strategies to try out\n- Plenty of camps and items to fight in or collect\n- Story is ok, and I like how you as the player has to keep taking pills to stay alive, it's a neat idea\n\nThe Bad:\n- The only guns worth using are your own, all enemy guns are rusted and get jambed easily\n- Cars that you drive take 2 shots and then you are forced to get out and fix it\n- Enemy camps respawn way to fast!\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nFor those interested, this was the far cry game in the series that started the trend of how the far cry games play now.

There is a reason that in the sequals to this game they added camp liberations to remove all bad guys for good etc. \n\nThat all being said though, this game is fun, I recommend it.
