I really love playing this game. Everything about it is just so perfect. Sure, the graphics are outdated and there may be some sound glitches here and there, but overall, the game is amazingly well done. I definitely recommend playing this if you haven't. It's only 5 dollars, it runs on almost any PC (because of its primitive graphics and engine), and it's a fun, addicting 90's gaming experience. And I also think it's a little better than Team Fortress 2. I also recommend that you play the game because there aren't a lot of players (last time I was on, there were less than 100 players playing on a total of 73 servers) and we NEED more players! PLEASE buy this game! I definitely recommend this game."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504939959, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502267", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34830640", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996188090", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 18}, "timestamp_updated": 1504939959, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Nostalgia!
