The voice of John de Lancie is an absolute delight to hear, and makes a huge contribution to this game's charm. Unfortunately, it is somewhat let down by its occasionally stark and repetitive aesthetics: a lot of areas often end up feelinfg the same. I suspect that the game's ambitions were perhaps larger than its budget, which is a shame. If you're a fan of puzzle games such as the Talos Principle (very highly recommended!) and Portal, you'll probably enjoy this!"}]}
