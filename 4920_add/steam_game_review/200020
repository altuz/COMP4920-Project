I once used to play alot of First Person Shooter's, but went abit away from it, given i wanted to try out some other types of games -a choice i'm glad i made- but lately I've been missed it, so I asked around and some of my friends recommended this, so I checked it out in the store, and it was on sale at the time, so I figured, might as well give it a try.\n\nStoryline:\nGlobal Ops: Commando Libya is based on the typical evil communist/terrorist and good americans that's saving the world, this time they are stopping the Arab terrorists from getting their hands on- and using- an atomic bomb which will lead to a catastrophe, the idea might have the slightest potential, but they do not take advantage of that in this game, it feels abit like it's just shooting non-stop, dialogs is to be honest pretty bad too, i know that's not the main focus in a FPS(3rd person shooter in this instanse) game, yet i like when a bit of effort has been put into the storyline, so it's not too uniform,\n\nthe AI is just terrible, even at veteran difficulty, at one point i got up, and slowly walked through a small passage with 5 gunmen shooting directly at me, without any trouble. oh, and when they realised just how pointless their shooting was, they saw it fit to run directly up in front of me, to block my way.\n\nand as the top of the iceberg every now and again glitches happened, and finally the messed up controls didn't help much.\n\nTo sum up:\nI do not recommend this game, the AI is aweful, controls are bad (and can't be changed) and storyline is terrible.

There are none. It's not diverse at all. Run in and kill everyone. That's every single mission. EVERY SINGLE MISSION. They are completely lying that there is any stealth.\n\n\n-\"A massive arsenal of different weapons and vehicles: use all the means available to you to catch the criminals!\"\n\nThere's like six weapons. That's it and I'd hardly call that \"massive\".\n\n\n-\"Hours of gameplay fun: either solo or with friends: complete 9 single-player levels and show what you\u2019re made of in 3 different online Multiplayer modes!\"\n\nHours as in five. That's about how long the game will take most players. It's only taking me longer because of a lag/optimisation issue which results in a lot of restarts.\n\n\n-\"Detailed graphics: fight in realistic settings from Greenland to Libya!\"\n\nThey're completely mediocre. Boring and bland. And so many boring hues of brown terrain.\n\nWell. That's me disputing the description. Onto the review.\n\n\n\nFinished the game on toughest or whatever and got all the achivements so let's start this trainwreck of a review.\n\nLet's start with the good. The graphics aren't terrible.\nThe achivements are all relitetively easy.\n\nThat's it. On to everything else. In otherwords. \n\nTHE BAD.\n\nFirst for me is LAG. For some reason at least for me, It was horrifyingly laggy. everytime I tried to move the camera ended up with a huge lag spike. It finally fixed itself when I changed the affinity to two cores and back to eight while the game was open. Who knows if that fix will stick though.\n(Update. It didn't. Seems like it's a texture issue. A very poor one.)\n\nFacial animation. There is none. At all. If they speak it's a blank face. ALL THE TIME.\n\nThat brings me to the next point. Voice acting. It's HORRIBLE. They sound bored and not at all natural. And even though the game involves a russian and libyan in a cutscene they both speak english with really poor accents.\n\nWeapons. They don't feel like they have ANY impact. It's like your shooting marshmallows. And on top of this the weapons themselves are kinda crappy for accuracy. Have an enemy a bit of a distance away? Be prepared to waste half your magazine hopeing that one of the bullets hit the enemy you're aiming straight at. Sniper isn't bad but obviously a pain in close quarters.\n\nThe story itself. Completely and utterly forgettable. Bland and boring.\n\nA.I. - Utterly horrid. Half the time they just run past my ally and run to me. Sometimes they'll just APPEAR next to me. As you play harder difficulties the game doesn't make their AI any better. Just stronger weapons. That's it.\n\nIn game dialouge. It's like they got a bunch of teenagers to write it. Every other word is either a swear word or a ridiculously stupid joke. It's not even fun to listen to.\n\nUPDATE\n\nThey didn't pay any attention to detail. There was one moment where I noticed that the character's head was the SAME height as the doorhandle. The couch nearby reached up to his waist. The turret gunners, if you get close to them you can tell that the character's are only standing there with their normal guns in their hands. There was no attempt to make it seem like they were holding it at all. \n\nThere was a few moments where enemies came in a car and the door opened and closed. No one came out or anything. The four enemies just appeared outside it.\n\nThere are some parts. The vehicle parts. They aren't nearly as good as some say. The enemies are hard to hit while moving and due to the lack of impact you don't know if you hit them. There is no on screen reticle while fireing in a vehicle aside from the first one. UPDATE.  When you're in a tank later you actually have a reticle.\n\n\nOverall. This is a painful experience that I urge no one to attempt."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1408207498, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500398", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11741115", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198092579524", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1388699612, "num_games_owned": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1408207498, "received_for_free": false, "review": "wasted money control is very bad\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1320048405, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500398", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "103388", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197961902264", "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1319871600, "num_games_owned": 834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2}, "timestamp_updated": 1389817652, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Whilst this is a recommendation, it is a recommendation to avoid this piece of shit game and save your money.

The plot is as generic as can be: some bad guys found a nuke, and some tinpot dictator wants to buy it (for what, exactly?) and the good guys have to hunt it down. The plot's pretty interchangeable, and the things you can do in this game? They try to do a bit of Call of Duty type game where you get both third-person and rail shooter sequences, but not that interesting overall. \n\nTo be honest, graphics are not that bad, but the result is you can't really tell where the ammo and such are. Also, while I like a commando who's properly armed (an assault rifle, AND a LMG? Please) the enemies are hilarious... As they are armed with... Apache gunships? and Blackhawk choppers? Shouldn't it be Hind gunships instead? Also, right at the beginning, they are showing an Antonov An-255 Mriya, pretending to be a B-52?!  This game is a generic shooter that was hastily put together to take advantage of the death of Moammar Ghadaffi. \n\nWith that said, the game is below average. The levels are kinda... meh, feels like MOH redux (the EA revamp) but with clear levels instead of lots of up and down slopes and hints of \"uneven\" terrain. There are ways to flank the enemy... sometimes. \n\nYou are limited to two weapons and grenades, but then, there only are like, well, M-16, AK-47 (or 74, can't tell), Dragunov sniper rifle, shotgun, UMP (submachinegun), and rocket launcher. There are attempts to make a cover shooter, as \"space\" is context sensitive enough to let you slide into cover and peek out and so on. Occasionally you get to use a mounted weapon, but that's about it. \n\nYou do have a shadow... I mean a fellow shooter, who will tell you the obvious stuff like \"turn right here!\" or \"let's go through that warehouse!\" but he's actually impervious to damage. At least he will occasionally kill an enemy. However, he gets stuck on the weirdest things, then materialize out of thin air. AND he doesn't shoot the enemies that comes between you and him... and the Enemies mostly ignore him too! However, you have to follow him around, since there is no map, no nav marker, nothing. Only by following him will the plot advance. If you lost sight of him, well, good luck, but generally the game is a rat maze... single path. It will open a path for you if it appears you have nowhere to go. \n\nEnemies... Heh, you get everything from generic \"towelheads\" to generic \"balaclava goons\" generally armed with AK's, and only later you see some \"red berets\" (armed with UMPs? In Libya?)  and some security goons (wearing \"suits\") And they all sound the same and die the same... From a Russian renegade ship to deserts of Libya. And the random comments by your guys? Are just as bad, or perhaps, worse, as they seem to be written by some amateurs, who thought Rambo and Arnies are actually representative of US military, would write. And they *sound* that way too. \"Don't f*** with Pope (call sign for your character)\"... Yeah, right. \n\nAll in all, it's a cheaply made game, and at 2.50 it's... barely tolerable. You can find better games for that 2.50. And if it's any more, forget it. \n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1409059521, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497911", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11872777", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198019754682", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1409059162, "num_games_owned": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 43}, "timestamp_updated": 1409059521, "received_for_free": false, "review": "it feels like a game from 2000 without smooth controls no keybinding or keyboard layout\nthe story is the only redeeming thing about it \ni wouldn't recomment it even when it is free"}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1389989971, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497865", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8744144", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197982115133", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1335250800, "num_games_owned": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 38}, "timestamp_updated": 1389989971, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Unentertaining, dull and repetitive combat.
