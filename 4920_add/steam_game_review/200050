I have seen AIM120D hitting a Su35 after flying 1000+km with the speed of 4M on 100m height.\n5) Neither torpedos nor ASM (Air to Surface Missile) can hit surfaced subs\n6) Passive sonar mechanics utterly broken: it seems just a random dice roll if it detects a sub or nor. \n7) Damage mechanics are broken too: nope, most frigates cannot survive a hit from a Harpoon II missile. Nope, it can really happen that an aircraft survives a missile hit. \n8) Aircraft rearm/refuel timers are mad. Landed aircraft can be checked, reloaded, refueled in 30 minutes (no matter how  big the fire is on the base), while fueled aircraft rearming always 1 hour. \n9) You cannot outmanouver anything. It will hit or not hit and seemingly it was decided at launch time. \n10) Aircraft fuel range is madness as well... F22 and F35s sometimes can fly from Canada to the UK with afterburner. Air refueling sometimes garbled, aircraft get seemingly too much fuel. \n( 11) Comparing Harpoon II. In Harpoon II you could read about the missiles, ordanances - these are also crap in this game ofc - ships, aircraft. Read the story, the capabilties etc...

Do not listen to the haters who played this in the past.  It has now been fixed. \n\nPros:  I have played the tutorials which make the game very easy to play.  I have not found any bugs so far.  This game is very like Jane's Fleet Command, but a little more modern.  I am now playing one of the campaigns and have also played one of the single missions.  There are loads of missions/campaigns on Steam and elsewhere.  The AI is very good and the game can be quite tense, though a bit slow for any younger gamers who love lots of action and shooting, etc.  This is a sedate game for older players like me who are middle-aged and no longer have the reactions of the younger generation (no problem, as most Admirals are middle aged!?).  The Steam version has obviously been heavily patched and seems to work a dream.  I have no problem with gameplay/framerates, but I must admit I have a fairly high-end machine and can run it on full graphics without any problem so far.  Far from being quirky, the interface is a doddle to use, despite reports from other reviewers.\n\nCons: The graphics are rubbish!  They are better than Fleet Command (which I own, so they should be now after all these years) and a bit better than Dangerous Waters (which I also own).  However, unlike Dangerous Waters, though the models look much better, the ships do not even have wakes behind them!?  The use of towed array sonar and dipping sonar is not animated!!!  I have yet to see a ship moving up and down with the waves.  The music is mind-bendingly monotonous as well as being completely inappropriate - it is gentle guitar music during a battle which involves Billions of Dollars/Pounds and countless lives!!!!!\n\nConclusion:  I bought the game for less than \u00a34.00/$7.00.  Well worth it during the 'Lunar' sale.  It is now \u00a315.00/$19.00.  Worth it, probably not.  However, for Naval Strategy fans, this is still a gem and a bit more updated than Dangerous Waters/Fleet Command whose graphics are atrocious.  I will definetely be buying the DLC and downloading the many workshop missions/campaigns"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1386276471, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499048", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "7929849", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198086674804", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1428008316, "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 312}, "timestamp_updated": 1386276471, "received_for_free": false, "review": "cool game with accuate tech and specs. make sure you have a computer capable of processing the game before you get it. and make sure you have a fan strong enough to cool down your laptop if you use one otherwise your computer will surely overheat. controls are a little confusing at first, but the more you play arround with it the easier it will become to navigate through your options."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1336799616, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501069", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2354223", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198006235472", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1484419444, "num_games_owned": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5475}, "timestamp_updated": 1336799616, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A good Navy   simulator in real time .\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1437995666, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "17247892", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197970592598", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1438006832, "num_games_owned": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 311}, "timestamp_updated": 1437995697, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Very interesting game, if you played and loved Janes Fleet Command, you will get this game straight away, feels like an updated version of that, with lots of promise.
