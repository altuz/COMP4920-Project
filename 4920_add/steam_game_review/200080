It will not download correctly on the Mac, and I have my software completely up to date. I tried to contact steam support, but it sent me to the game's website, herinteractive for support instead. Then all that herinteractive told me was to try to get ahold of steam. Seriously, no one would even try and figure out what was going wrong with the game. I tried uninstalling and re-downloading the game countless times. I tried to even re-install Steam, and the game still would not work. This was a terrible experience, as no one even tried to help. I submitted for a refund, so hopefully that helps. If you have a mac and want to play this game, please be warned."}]}
