The game has a variety of enemies, traps, and skills to keep you on your toes.\n\nThe game is short. There are some noticeable problems that would frustrate you, but if you do get the game working, it is an enjoyable game. If I recall, the game does not like multi-monitor setup, so you will have to disable all other monitors to play the game.

What bothers me about it is how bad they communicate anything to the player. I didnt even realise until the 4th level that I had a punch attack and I never needed it in the game, because i could just use the jump kick to kill anything. Another example of bad communication is the slug thing that you can stun and jump over. Any other enemy you can kill, but not this slug! Frustrating to say the least. It's also very hard to plan how to jump when you cant move the camera and just slightly see behind the next corner. The game is basicly a 2D game in 3D space, which is very awesome in theory. But it's also in some places frustrating when you the game dosent communicate very well what corners you can and cannot cross by, although I did realise there was a little indicator through what looked like a green 3D box sticking out. If you could move the camera around the corner and see what you're supposed to jump to, that'd be great. But you have to go around the corner, go back and then make the jump instead, in some places. The first boss also didnt come with a tutorial for me, so I had no idea what to do. I found out that I could jump on his head to stun him, and then he'd charge (ridicoulessly) fast at me. I ended up looking up on the net what to do, and even with that done, I got annoyed at how I didn't even have a split second to make the jump. I don't recommend this game as a result of that and what really felt like terrible level design to me."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1447462196, "weighted_vote_score": "4.992099", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "19061689", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198034432813", "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1384484256, "num_games_owned": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 273}, "timestamp_updated": 1447462196, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Fun game and very imaginative.

Using the buildings themselves as the levels you traverse across the walls and roofs of the skyline itself collecting items, abilites, and fighting spray painted enemies along the way.\n\nThe level design is incredibly well thought out, because you platforming along the side of a building or roof, which generally have four sides to them, the perspective and orientation of the level is constantly being rotated and flipped as you slip around a corner and switching your axis. This makes the maps very dense and tight, you never get bored going through a level because you'll be attacking it from several directions in very quick succession. \n\nThe art direction is perhaps one of my favorite part of the game, a vibrant, bright world of Graffiti and spraypaint pops out from the muted, cool coloured canvas of the urban environment. The character design is eye catching and organic, with its fluid animations further complimented by the smoothness of the camera as it rotates around corners as it follows the character. Everything looks like a urbanised flash cartoon, or Adidas commercial. \n\nThe music in the game surprised me a lot. As some one who isn't in any skretch a fan of Hip Hop, I quickly came to love the rythyms and tones they set while I parkoured on the side of a high rise. The soundtrack, which was prepared by SkullCandy (headphone maker) and Hip Hop artist Mr. Lif, is unforunately reused a lot throughout the game, but they're good enough tunes for me too not mind too much. Though I wish the game developers would sell the soundtrack as a whole on itunes. \n\nSubway New York is a great game, an fine example of how a platformer should be made. But it has one GLARING, UNEXCUSABLE FLAW. It has got to be the sloppiest, half hearted console port I've ever seen. It becomes abundently clear this was first made for the Playstation 3 with its terrible default keyboard layout, its jump right in two player coop, its \"do not turn off console\" while saving messages, and sometimes refering to a controller instead of a keyboard. This game was made for a joystick and it shows, you'll struggle it make jumps and get inexplicibly killed in the environment, not to mention confuse your keys in the middle of a fight and suffer a cheap death, AGAIN!! \n\nIf you grew up playing Super Mario Bros you owe it too yourself to give Sideway a try! \n\nBut be sure to use a proper controller!!"}]}
