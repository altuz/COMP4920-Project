You aren't given enough storage space without spending a ridiculous amount of money on in game currency as well. This game feels like a cheap trap for kids with their parents credit cards. It'd be fun if it wasn't so hard to get decent gear and collect things but the game really isn't. No, you either get really good at running around and dodging and never make a mistake or you die and lose everything. You only get eight inventory slots in your storage to try and keep items for when you do but that's not even close to enough to have fun. And am I going to pay $10 USD for one more of those eight slot chests in a game like this? Hell no, I can buy a better game or an older game that's more fun for that."}]}
