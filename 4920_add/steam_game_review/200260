I was bored, and got upset when I couldn't find the correct way to waypoints. After mad logging, and trying once more the next day. I realized with the map it is actually quite easy to navigate to next waypoint. I kind of don't like how long it takes to knock out a enemy when fighting head on. 7 goons seems to take 5 minut5es to kill/ko. I hope it gets more on the edge of my seat fun. I have very little patience, and like games I can play for along time, but not a long time by creating little time wasters such as bat hooking to every over hang in the city, or fighting enemies for 10 minutes only to move into the next room, and fight a new group. Im still optimistic that the game will draw me in with the story, and advancements for leveling up. So far I am struggling to get into it. Like I said before \"I have very little to no patience for pointless parts that just add to the total gameplay hours, as to say by the company \"Our campaign is 100+hours\". This review is very early into the game, and my first impression. If you are like me, then maybe wait until it goes on sale to buy. It is only 20 bucks, but still. So far NOT Goty fun for me."}, {"votes_down": 16, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506850877, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465408", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "35374659", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "7", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210359313", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1487974314, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 469}, "timestamp_updated": 1507143812, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I wasted my time and money on this awful game the performance and the storyline was bad and i =t wasnt the best quality compared to some of my other games"}, {"votes_down": 29, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504927420, "weighted_vote_score": "0.176982", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "34828063", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053843750", "num_reviews": 241, "last_played": 1451660441, "num_games_owned": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 486}, "timestamp_updated": 1504927420, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Dc comics suck.
