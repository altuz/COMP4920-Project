Factories auto-produce units, there's not really any resource gathering (aside from capturing oil rigs), and you can only command your units to attack specific points rather than move freely about the map.

You have to decide which points to leave units at to defend and which ones to leave basically defenseless (aside from fortifications) so that you can capture more points. In the later missions this becomes a nightmare but I enjoy the challenge. I still haven't finished it (I'm about two missions away from the end) but I've enjoyed the ride thus far. The voice acting and script is slightly terrible as it is all translation (I still don't understand why game dev's don't just hand their script over to a native English speaker to proofread before they record the voice actors) but as it only occurs before and after missions in most cases it doesn't really take away from the game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1400893387, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500014", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "10213069", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198059719489", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1423360211, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1723}, "timestamp_updated": 1400893387, "received_for_free": false, "review": "AWESOME GAME, it may cost alot but it is worth it. first of all, it has great graphics. second, there are tons of units so you can create a huge army then attack and capture the next factory to get even more units. third, there are tons of cool things at the tech tree like naval mines, napalm strikes, spawnable submarines, spawnable repair ships, and finally the best part, wait for it, ok here it is, NUKES. finally, it has great gameplay.
