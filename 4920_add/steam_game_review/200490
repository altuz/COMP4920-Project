It was intriguing and immersive. The graphics were wonderful,  I  really liked the voice accents and found the animations amazing. \nSo much work went into this game and it shows.\nTotally unexpected ending and I now feel like playing it again soon to see what differences occur with different actions...."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506591810, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35258321", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198312746645", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1506540677, "num_games_owned": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 625, "playtime_forever": 625}, "timestamp_updated": 1506591810, "received_for_free": false, "review": "honestly, i liked it. :D nice detective work, interesting locations and a good, dramatic soundtrack (which felt a bit weird sometimes though as it was looped and didn't fit in a 100%). the voice-acting didn't bother me at all - i enjoyed the character's accents a lot tbh! as the puzzles were easy to solve the story continued in a good pace. yes, this game is a bit buggy and not for everyone, but if you're able to enjoy point & clicks that are not so well polished, i'd recommend it when it's on sale. (i got it for 1,99 \u20ac - that was totally worth it!)"}]}
