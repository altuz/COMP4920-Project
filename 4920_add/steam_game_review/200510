Although I enjoyed all the hours I spent on this game, there were just too many factors that prevented me from finishing it, much less giving it a definite thumbs up.\n\nFirst off, let me enumerate what this game gets right:\n- Punishing gameplay that rewards smart and patient planning. The best defense is almost always the best offense. Rushing in blindly will most likely get your squad wiped out.\n- The base-building, time-management, juggling of funds, and taking risks on missions all make this game a very oppressive experience. In a good way. You're constantly poor and struggling to get by, you make a choice to sell things you might need just to get a bit ahead. You take gambles with every decision you make, each action requiring intense deliberation.\n- The difficulty is comparable to having a job. There is absolutely no way you're ready for this shit but you HAVE to do it, you HAVE to be ready. The game grinds you into the dirt, giving you little time to pull yourself together, so you either give up and get a new job (new game) or soldier through it, licking your wounds and dragging your reputation through the mud because daddy didn't raise no quitter.\n- The skill progression of characters provides more and more combat possibilities and new strategies, and each new rank gained could give you a massive tactical boost in battle. Furthermore, you can't help but be attached to your characters, especially if you've given them names, and customized their appearances. Which makes seeing them die all the more devastating.\n\nAnd now, the bad stuff:\n- Allowing the player to save at any point in the battle isn't a very good design choice, since the goal is to force players to deal with their decisions. \n- So I can't help but save-scum. It's so easy to do. If it's in the game, then I don't see a problem with using it. But it gets bad because I tend to overuse it. It really sucks having to place your all your trust on an RNG. Mistakenly put your faith in a 90% hit chance only to have everything backfire and go horribly, horibly wrong. In a single move. It punishes you for things completely out of your control. Which is why I feel like it's fair to \"cheat\" with save-scumming, as I feel like the game \"cheats\" me with its ridiculous percentages.\n- I was doing pretty well until I came to a mission that had 2 of those massive robots that have a million health points, 2 cyber discs, an ethereal, several mutons, and like a hundred armored floaters. And not even my save-scumming could help me get through the level. I pretty much gave up at that point. Turns out daddy raised a quitter after all.\n\nNo, I understand that these \"bad\" things are what people love about the game. Perhaps it's not about completion but getting as far as you can with what you have. And reaching the endgame for the first time could be the ultimate accomplishment, something akin to earning a Platinum on a PS game.\n\nNevertheless, I found it exasperating to persist under a system that screws you over with absurd RNG and ridiculously imbalanced enemies. The odds are always stacked against you. But unlike games like Dark Souls, XCOM doesn't give you any hope to recover, and whether or not this is permissible is up to you, as a player.\n\nAll in all, I give this game a cautious Thumbs Up, albeit slanted at around 35\u00b0."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505533638, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504956", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34986932", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968573161", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506808347, "num_games_owned": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 494, "playtime_forever": 1925}, "timestamp_updated": 1505533638, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I am a huge fan of the original X-Com, I used to play it for days at a friend's house.  I've had this in my inventory for a couple years now and finally sat down to play it.  There are hints of that game here... then it falls apart. \n\nFirst off, the game is linear.  It feels like it's walking you through a tutorial for a looooong time because of this.  You get this awkward hand holding mission to mission.  Meanwhile my whole team is ranking up and getting real powerful. \n\nThen I realize why.  The mechanics in the game are awful.  I'll have an enemy surrounded, make a kill with my sniper, then miss the last guy with the remaining 5.  Then I get to watch as the enemy kills my sniper who is way at the back of my crowd and behind the smoke screen (doesn't count though because he isn't actually in it).  Makes literally 0 sense. \n\nThe movement aspect SUCKS.  I'm sorry but you get two moves, only one is allowed to be a shot (with few exceptions). You can't adequately crawl out.  I've had times where a unit see an enemy mid run and I would have taken the shot there, but they keep going and end up in a position that is somehow out of sight.  I don't get another move to correct this because if I move, I won't get to shoot.  Not at all like the original X-Com. \n\nTeam sizes are too small.  Really, 6 people, AFTER you train up?  \n\nMissions are very linear, as in it's usually a straight line with little lateral size to the maps.  You just crawl across the map. \n\nSometimes mission triggers (did I mention the whole game is linear?) occur behind you based on the mission mindlessly.  You just cleared an area and the enemy literally gets to drop in behind you.\n\nThe spawn mechanics are bad.  You find one enemy, usually it's 2-3 instead. Hope your team is ready to kill them this turn or you are going to take damage, possibly die to a random crit. \n\nOutside of the missions, the strategic global aspect, once again with linear missions, pushes you along.  SO much terror happens you will continuously lose members and you will lose them right away in the first month. \n\nThe base map resembles Fallout shelter or a tiny tower rip-off.  It's not interesting.  Mostly because you only work on one base, so there's no strategy to building bases globally.  It's replaced with uninteresting satelite programs, which you have to focus on to get more scientists, engineers, and to prevent countries from dropping funding.  It's such a linear goal in the map screen and by the time you realize you should ONLY be making satelites and more satelite uplinks you lose a country at the end of your first month because it takes too long to build a satelite to keep them around (or if you built one, hopefully you didn't place it blindly).  \n\nI miss full teams, I miss building up stats, I miss having to get my team off of the skyranger(or whatever craft you had built up to to carry your team), I miss buying robotic tanks.  I miss having large maps to cover.  I miss being able to do more than one thing a turn, I miss a base system that requires proper coverage on the map, I miss being able to build what I want and sell it to make large piles of money.  \n\nThere's so much this could have been and it really just has the tech tree and name of the original, but it's a shell of that game."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505266829, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505673", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "34911523", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197991061581", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1505836997, "num_games_owned": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1471}, "timestamp_updated": 1505695409, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Before I played:\n\uff3c\uff3c \uff3f\n\u3000\u3000 \uff3c( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) \n\u3000\u3000\u3000 <\u3000\u2312\u30fd \n\u3000\u3000\u3000/ \u3000 \u3078\uff3c \n\u3000\u3000 /\u3000\u3000/\u3000\uff3c\uff3c \n\u3000\u3000 \uff9a\u3000\u30ce\u3000\u3000 \u30fd_\u3064 \n\u3000\u3000/\u3000/ \n\u3000 /\u3000/| \n\u3000(\u3000(\u30fd \n\u3000|\u3000|\u3001\uff3c\n\u3000| \u4e3f \uff3c \u2312)\n\u3000| |\u3000\u3000) /\n`\u30ce )\u3000\u3000L\uff89\nAfter I played:\n\uff0f\uff8c\uff8c \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u30e0\uff40\u30fd \n/ \u30ce) \u3000\uff09\u3000\u30fd \n/ \uff5c\u3000\u3000( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0\uff09\u30ce\u2312\uff08\u309d._,\u30ce \n/\u3000\uff89\u23127\u2312\u30fd\u30fc\u304f\u3000 \uff3c\u3000\uff0f \n\u4e36\uff3f \u30ce \uff61 \u30ce \uff64 |/ \n\u3000\u3000 `\u30fd `\u30fc-'_\u4eba`\u30fc\uff89 \n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u4e36 \uffe3 _\u4eba'\u5f61)"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507077706, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503677", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35459572", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197968254063", "num_reviews": 56, "last_played": 1507077497, "num_games_owned": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 729, "playtime_forever": 2081}, "timestamp_updated": 1507077706, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I had fun playing this and then replaying it several years later.

And so I did. A week before math classes ended, in early February, I beat the whole game for the first time. An endless struggle, trying never to save-scum, having my heart ache when a favorite soldier was KIA, building up their own stories in my head, how each soldier was like in battle and off battle. To me, each soldier had a life in that game, and that's what made it hard for me to play the game. When I said it was hard, it wasn't difficulty.

As Ususal.\nYour one soildier SUDDENLY PANICKED for no reason when just being posioned? AND CRITICALLY WOUNDED NEXT SOLDIER WHICH STARTED FREAKING CHAIN PANIC REACTION ON WHOLE SQUAD. WHAT???? I mean freaking really? Why the freaking FARK there are people on deadly missions who EASILY getting panicked from one shot or being poisoned and start to kill their partners? WHY? I HATE THIS GAME. It is unbalanced, it is random and it has whole lot of shit that designers get rid of in sequel.\nDon't play this. Play XCom2 instead. It is so much better in any way possible. \n\nEvery missiion is a frustration. GUH. I just only want to know the lore. I even don't care about anything anymore."}]}
