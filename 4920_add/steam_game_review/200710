However, some part of me feels like it'll always be seen as the younger brother so to speak in reference to the Diablo series or even the more aesthetically [i]dark[/i] Grim Dawn. Being much more fanciful, cartoonish and boisterous in it's color palette. It seemingly takes on the persona of something less daunting.   \n\nI've heard many scoff at ARPG's citing things as though they should not have an 'endgame' as if the player should not expect the character they've spent the last 30+ hours with to no longer progress after what within the genre are traditionally very lite narratives. Stating that proper MMO's need only this often proverbial [i]endgame.[/i] \n\nFor a genre that is inherently a sort of active real-time loot driven clicker, to deny the similarities between it and how a traditional instance based MMO behaves is a bit of an asinine claim. They are inherently just slightly more repetitive than your average game. All games are repetitive. ARPG's offer repeated clicking, number crunching, finding synergies between abilities, armor and weapons. The very essence of this genre is a glorified clicker. Of fucking course it should have an endgame. I realize Path of Exile is more integrated online but aside from the towns being populated by non-NPC players the actual minute to minute is remarkably similar. \n\nBut that is neither here nor there, I bring this up only to illustrate that after a hard fought campaign with your chosen class; there are a plethora of options available to continue leveling your character. Not only is there NG+ and NG++ but there is also the Mapworks. Which essentially is a place where you can use in-game gold to purchase randomly generated maps often with qualifiers like monsters have increased damage or 25% of your max health is capped. The campaign is about 30 hours give or take and will land your character in the 50's as far as level. With each level increasing in XP reaching a maximum total of 100. There is additionally difficulty levels placed on top of these increasing difficult challenges. \n\nThere are also a ton of mods in the steam workshop. Overhaul mods, class mods, UI mods, custom dungeon mods for use in the mapworks. I personally have an Engineer, EmberMage and a modded class of Dread Pirate I'm currently leveling. \n\n[i][b]THE GIST\nAs the genre goes it can be a bit of a grind making it good for a palette cleanser game in between larger perhaps more story driven games. On the other side you can delve very deep into applying gems to sockets and applying enchantments and making good on every bit of synergy you can extending the gameplay that much further.[/b][/i]\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25764029/][i]Follow my curation page for more.[/i][/url]\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505352200, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505685", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34940162", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197990155409", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1448434036, "num_games_owned": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7001}, "timestamp_updated": 1505352200, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is brilliant, while not taking 100% from the diablo style it does have a great feel to it and i love the spells and how they've been put together, it's a really solid game and deserves more like it.

(That is, if you have 100 fire resistance, it reduces each instance of incoming fire damage by a flat 100 points.)\n\nIf you are at all familiar with the way that RPGs, particularly RPGs with significant player power scaling, work, you will understand why this is a problem; in TL2's case, it becomes a problem by the end of one playthrough, so it's not even a case of badly chosen stat weights.  If you want an ARPG to get really deep into, pick one of the other big ones like PoE or Diablo 3, which do not have this problem.\n\nFor the rest of you: Most similar games use an effective HP-based system, where a point of resistance increases your effective HP against damage of that type by a fixed percentage.  For example, if you have 100 fire resistance, you might take half damage from fire, and if you have 200 fire resistance, you might take 25% damage from fire.  Notice how the second 100 fire resistance still gives you the same amount of mitigation per point, and notice how you could scale this infinitely if you wanted (if you have 9900 fire resistance, getting another 100 will still halve your incoming fire damage; likewise you can increase enemies' fire damage and it'll all scale smoothly).\n\nFlat damage reduction causes two undesirable side effects.  One is that each act jump is a big difficulty spike (because your flat damage reduction doesn't scale up) until you get new gear, at which point it becomes easier again.  The other, particularly later in the game, is that enemies start to sort into two categories: small enemies and big enemies.  Small enemies do zero damage, because they're intended to swarm you with small attacks which are now entirely blocked by gear.  Large enemies do big attacks that one-shot you, and no amount of gear will help you because they just hit that hard.  And so this distorts the endgame (of a single playthrough of TL2!) into basically ignoring the small enemies and desperately kiting the big ones.  If you were to continue to scale both the player and the enemies, this problem becomes steadily worse.\n\nSo yeah.  It's probably okay if you get this off a heavy Steam sale or Humble Bundle or something and just want a fun diversion for a couple hours, but this is going to be a problem for you at some point."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504607464, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34753647", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197972922454", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1354435200, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3385}, "timestamp_updated": 1504607464, "received_for_free": true, "review": "1111"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505929482, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500266", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35088907", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198032541409", "num_reviews": 54, "last_played": 1429500432, "num_games_owned": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 9941}, "timestamp_updated": 1505929482, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Pretty fun.
