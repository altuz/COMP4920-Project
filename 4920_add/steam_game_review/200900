Amazing story, soundtrack is GODLIKE (the best I've ever seen, tied with Duck Game for me), interesting and innovative weapons, challenging, multiple endings, and generally just amazing. What more can you ask from a game?\n\nNow, to go more in depth on all of these reasons:\n\n-Story is very compelling and translates well into gameplay. Sad, funny, and serious, all mixed together to form a great experience.\n\n-The soundtrack is the best I've ever heard. What else can I say? Go listen to it. It's amazing.\n\n-The weapons are interesting and not completely boring, with the leveling system making them varied and making you think more about your choices, as well as certain weapons being good for certain areas. For example, the fireball bounces along the ground and is good for bumpy terrain, and at close range can be spammed for massive damage, but if it's at a low level then only the first option will work well. The snake is obtained by trading in your beginning pistol and the fireball to make a floating fireball that goes through walls. The spur is obtained by trading in your pistol but waiting untill the very end. All fun, amazing, and they dont get boring.\n\n-The multiple endings make for extra story, replayability, and extra challenge. The good ending is extremely hard to complete, but is rewarding. The bad ending is easy, and makes you feel bad for taking the easy way out. And the normal ending is a mixture of both.\n\n-The difficulty is perfect. Not easy, but not frustratingly hard to make you want to stop playing.\n\nOverall, this is the best game I've ever played.\n\n10/10."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504863003, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503657", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34810827", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198056200178", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1498544505, "num_games_owned": 1483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 814}, "timestamp_updated": 1504863003, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Cave Story has always been an amazing game, but many people forget that the original is still free.\n\nDownload it from the tribute site here: http://www.cavestory.org/download/cave-story.php\nand if you like it, buy this updated version! \nIt comes with more music, better graphics, and a couple other cool things."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504569611, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498208", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34746443", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198149208409", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1504687341, "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 423}, "timestamp_updated": 1504569611, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is simple but charming and the art is really good. I love indie pixelated games and this is one of my favorites. The chiptune soundtrack is cute and suits the atmosphere of the game. It can get a little repetitive when you have to go through areas multiple times or when you keep dying and have to redo a level (although that doesn't happen that often since there are a lot of save points). It's still a fun, cute game and I've been meaning to play this game for the longest time- and now I finally have! If you like pixel graphic games with good art/music then I would definitely suggest purchasing CaveStory+"}]}
