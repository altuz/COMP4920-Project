Before the Echo is what happens if you take DDR and make the player use the controller (So Stepmania), approach it from a multi lane system (like frequency or amplitude) and then add in RPG elements (puzzle quest). \n\nAnd the end result is... well pretty impressive.  The game is played like an RPG, with the main character exploring floors.  Well \"Exploring\" in reality he chooses one of three monsters on each floor to fight, and is sent to a combat screen. \n\nThe combat in this game will be recognizable to anyone who has played a rhythm game before.   You press buttons to trigger different directions on three grids, each doing a different task.  If you are on the defense grid, you're blocking attacks, if you're on the mana grid you're gaining mana, and if you're on the spell grid you're casting your magic.  And you'll be switching between the three grids as you play the game.   \n\nThere is also a similar mini game to learn spells.  The entire time there's quality music being played, a selection created specifically for this game, and while I won't be humming these songs later, the music is enjoyable.\n\nThere's also a rather solid story to this game, the player is locked in a tower with 7 floors and must reach the top level to ... well honestly I don't know because I never reached there, however the first 6 floors had a relatively engaging story, even a few twists that worked well.\n\nHowever the first problems with the game is around the 5th level the game gets annoyingly tedious.  Enemies get too much life, and there's a time limit to every battle (the length of the song) but they also start throwing VERY powerful attacks that the player.  Wait long enough for a really good spell? Well you might have to choose between taking massive damage (20 points where you might have less than 150 total points) or skipping that spell that's lost forever and needs to be recharged\n\nOn top of this, the enemies start having 3 digits of life, usually more than the player, and they will be punishing. \n\nThere's even four difficulties of the game which is a good start, it does add notes and movements to songs, and that's a cool feature, but even on easy, the sixth level is tedious.  In fact it's always tedious. It's not impossible, but... well then there's the other part of the game, crafting. \n\nAt first the crafting system is cool and new.  You kill monster get items (up to three different items per enemy, though on item per type)  and then can make stuff out of it.  On Level 1 there's only 4 or 5 craftable items.  Each level adds 1 more recipe, so level 6 has around 10 recipes, by that point you either have played entirely too much of the previous levels, or you got sick of them and have a ton of unmade recipes in your inventory.  \n\nBut the problem is every drop only comes from one monster.  If you don't like fighting the insect on level 6 (A decently fast and hard fight)  too bad, you have to.  And the other side of that is you don't fight him once, you will have to fight him two or three times just to progress because the key to the next level is craftable to, and even more if you want to make everything.  \n\nSo even if you somehow beat him you'll have to go and grind him again and again which is where the real tedium comes in, and that's assuming you don't get unlucky and miss a potential drop (as each drop has a percentage chance to appear).   It artificially lengths the game in the worst way.\n\nThe other side of this system is that while the player gets more powerful as he plays, he doesn't feel more powerful because the enemies on each floor are significantly more powerful too.  When I went back and fought someone from level 1 I realized how much of a god I had become, but you only get that feeling if you return to very early floors, on level 6 you feel like you're the same weakling you always were. \n\nHowever with that being said, I LIKE the core gameplay of this game.  I like the concept, I even like the story, I really like everything in it, that it hurts me that I just didn't want to finish it.  It is a really terrible feeling to say \"I wanted to see it, but I can't stand the monotony. \" Yet that's where I ended up. \n\nSo I recommend it, because I did put in some good hours into it, and it is a really fun game and concept.  Just realize if you aim to beat the game, you WILL be grinding, and not in a mindless way due to the combat structure. \n\nSad but overall a good game."}]}
