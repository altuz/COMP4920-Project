Finally, after years of wating for the official release we get it. The game itself is great, no doubt. The question is though whether it is a good port or just a quick buck for the company we all love.\n\nIn short - it's a mixed bag.\n\nIt's nice to see that SEGA hired Christian Whitehead to make this port and initially I was prepared for some top-notch level content. Despite the fact that Sonic 1 and Sonic 2 mobile conversions strived to enhance the experience of the original works, this very port barely does anything to make playing it worthwhile. \n\nPros:\n- At it's core, it's still Sonic CD with it's unique level design that caters for speedrunning if you put enough effort into it.\n- You can choose between US/JP soundtrack.\n- Tails is avaiable as a playable character.\n\nCons:\n- The input lag is noticable but managable. Going for the best time might be extremely difficult at times.\n- Sonic's acceletaion is slower and he feels somewhat heavier than in the original. The input lag is probably the reason why.\n- The first two cons make Collision Chaos Zone a chore to play.\n- Hitboxes for most of the enemies were changed which may result in you accidentally running into one of the badniks (although you might think you are far enough from it).\n- Bugs. Metallic Madness Act3. The laser bug room. Many times so it happened that I could not hit an enemy despite it being super close to me and at its vulnerable state. This is sad.\n- A lot of cuts and other engine-imperfection moments were fixed which is bad if you want some fast-paced experience without compromises just like in the original and good if you're willing to play the way it was intended.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this port to people who are going to play Sonic CD for the first time. Being unable to control the game with immediate output can negatively impact your playthrough and form a negative opinion of this highly praised entry in the series of the blue hedgehog. \n\nP.S It's an ~okay~ port."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506306042, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35194749", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027389667", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1506389386, "num_games_owned": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "playtime_forever": 33}, "timestamp_updated": 1506306042, "received_for_free": false, "review": "what can i say, i like little fast blue men"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505927892, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503745", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35088426", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198250769752", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506182424, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 32, "playtime_forever": 206}, "timestamp_updated": 1505927892, "received_for_free": false, "review": "JPN or USA its an amazing game.
