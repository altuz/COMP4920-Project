While the gameplay itself is pretty simple, and (let's be honest) quite repetitive. The heart of this game is in its story. Most notably in the moral crux that it presents, which pretty much boils down to:\n\nIf you have the power to create and end life with the literal wave of a hand, are you morally obligated to grant your creations any rights that you yourself cannot take away?\n\nSome creations treat you as a god, some see you as an equal, and some hate you because they never asked to be created. It's an interesting and thought-provoking concept that's well worth the price. It feels more like a book than a video game, and that's not a bad thing."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499741144, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33446209", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198016650106", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1500144995, "num_games_owned": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1098}, "timestamp_updated": 1499741144, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I bought the game out of nostalga, like I'm sure many of prespective buyers are as well.
