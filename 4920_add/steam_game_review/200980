Expect to die many times, the game is challenging and I like it this way. Expect to read too, and I mean read a lot. Geneforge is a well-written story heavy RPG where your choices will matter, with diplomatic situations filled with gray areas (it's not at all your classic good vs evil scenario), tactical turn-based combat, several different ways to play the game (I choosed a solo Agent, but you might as well play a Shaper with an army of creations), I think there are 5 different ways to \"win\" the game and complete the story.\n\nI did not enjoy the story as much as the first game of this saga because the moral choices and the diplomacy were not as entertaining in my opinion, but they were far from being weak! Probably because of some similarities with Geneforge 1, it lacked the surprise and excitement to discover more about the whole plot. The first few maps were rather boring and linear, so it took me some time to get into the story. However areas turned out to be much more balanced than Geneforge 1 and the hand holding of the first maps didn't last long. At some point I became addicted and put some other games aside in order to see where the Geneforge 2 story was going to bring me.\n\nIf you are able to disregard the basic graphical quality when playing a game offering a rich world, deep story and a challenging yet enjoyable gameplay, the Geneforge saga and Spiderweb games in general are meant for you and will give you a great gaming experience, you should not hesitate to give them a try.

They sent me a new authentication code within 24 hours with no additional questions, maybe they had my email on file idk. But that's the kind of publisher i want to support.

Starting off, i know it may say i only have a couple hours on record with the game, but id like to stamp that out now. I played this game years back off an old game engine before steam was a thing, buying it again now is more comfort and support for me, like buying an old book that you read years ago. I have well over 200 hours in the game, and about a thousand in the series. So let me dive in, and let you know what this game is about.\n\n   Geneforge is more than a game, its a book, an experiance, a choice, and a beautiful combat system all in one. It cries out to the imaginiative, the 3 am readers, the DnD players, the indie game searchers. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up 10 fold in story. The game puts you in the middle of an entire world and has you influence the outcome of it. In the first game, you find yourself in this estranged world, where the game gives you a brief history of it, then immediately tears that away. It isolates you, shows you that you must survive, and asks you what to do to survive. But that is only the first part. once you gather your bearings, you have to forge a path. At first the paths seem clear, good or evil, but the more you progress the more you realize there is no good. there is no evil. This game makes you question everything, with the only clear progression being that of power. You single handedly experiance the start of a world rebellion, and reitre as a god or a soldier by the end. The same picks up in each consquensial title later on, each putting you, a young shaper, smack dab in the middle of the biggest points in history of this new world. The hours, weeks, months of text painstakingly put into this game alone makes it a solid game, but the combat is fantastic too. You play a tactics style turn based micromanaging comabt system, sort of like fallout: tactics or final fantasy: tactics. But instead of pre determined abilities, like everything else you determine your path. Conjure up an army to fight for you, use magic and objects to trick your opponets and take them out one by one, or don a helmet and sword and slash your way through hoards, the choice is yous. My by far favorite part of it however, has to be the fact that nothing is safe in this game from you. It emphasizes that your choices can change the entire reality. No npc cannot be killed, although it may be hard. The world will form to what you want it to, if you are brave enough to undergo the task. Dont take this as you cannot lose, for the wrong desicion will put you in a spot where you cannot escape. But understand that you are free to make that deicion, you are free to make any desicion. This is the closest i have ever come to DnD Freeplay. \n\nPro's: Excellent story line, worth of a novel of the highest value.\n          Freerealm as hell, you are free to make any desicion you want, nothing stops you, you shape the future and history alike. \n           LOTS and LOTS of content, as said earlieri  have over 1000 hours in the series as a whole. thats a lot for a single player non grind game.\n          Decent combat tactics system, many ways to play out combat.\n          Can easily engulf you in for weeks.\n          Lots and Lots of Text\nCon's: The graphics are subpar at best, must be able to use your imagination \n           Game doesnt hold your hand at all, in fact quiet the opposite. This may be a con or pro.\n           Again, a LOT of text. again, could be a con or pro depending on your preferance.\n\nOverall i would rate this game a 9/10, Despite the horrid graphics. i honestly believe that if ther were better graphics, there wouldnt be enough reasources to make everything else so amazing.
