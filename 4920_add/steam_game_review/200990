Yes there are only two factions this time around compared to the previous game's four and it's structured in a much more linear fashion, but what the game loses in freedom it gains in complexity of plot and ethical dilemmas. With only two major factions to choose from, neither of which are perfect, the game's universe approaches \"The Witcher\" levels of moral ambiguity at times. This is a game where goodness is often shown to have a steep price and evil often has justifications which sound strangely good. In a time when gamers are known to petition studios when the ending to a game isn't as upbeat or things don't turn out exactly as they wanted them to (see: fan uproar over \"Mass Effect 3\"), it's kind of refreshing to play a game so brazen about the fact that even the best of intentions to do good often turn out much less than good."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1398228852, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528073", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "9906185", "votes_up": 18, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198084875254", "num_reviews": 45, "last_played": 1398661010, "num_games_owned": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1607}, "timestamp_updated": 1398228852, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I am enjoying the third installment of the Geneforge saga.

The design is partial due to a specific wish on the one hand and the very barebones graphic engine on the other.\n\nOverall I'd recommend the game on the basis of its setting: On the one hand if you're tired of derivative Tolkienesque fantasy, and on the other in virtue of the fact that it isn't mindless escapism or entertainment, it isn't decadent drama just for the sake of drama, it isn't slapstick humor.

Kyle makes most of the games for Spiderweb almost single-handedly, with occasional help from other devs. The Geneforge series is probably the best game series Kyle has ever made. Geneforge 3 is my favorite (And one of the few I've played so far) I bought the entire series less than a week ago and I do not regret it one bit. In this game, you play as a special wizard known as a \"Shaper\". You have the ability to forge monsters using your very mystical essence. You can sink points into specific stats to make one really strong monster, or just have a small batallion of weaker monsters in order to overwhelms your foes. The game is all about strategy, though sometimes rushing forwards without thinking will grant victory.\n\nGeneforge lets you choose from three classes, which are your typical Warrior, Ranger, and Mage classes. The game also boasts an amazing story that will probably take you 40-50 hours to complete. As you can see, I still haven't completed it yet. I'm still on the second island and I'm probably only 25% done the game as this point. Spiderweb makes some massive games and they always have great stories throughout. Geneforge features rather dated graphics and no soundtrack though. Again, that's typical with Spiderweb games. The graphics may be meh, but the gameplay makes up for it. And despite lacking a soundtrack, the game makes up for it with some great ambient sounds whilst exploring. \n\nI highly reccomend getting this game, it's currently only 4 dollars for the entire package. I reccomend starting with this one though, it's one of the less difficult of the 5 and is a good starting point. Summoning monsters and having them fight for you is the real draw of the game and you'll spend hours upon hours trying to master your Shaping skills and create the perfect minions. Just a warning, if you decide to break cannisters in order to attain more powers only break 6. Trust me, you'll thank me later. Enjoy, and if you like Geneforge I recomend trying Spiderweb's newest game, Avernum 2: Crystal Souls."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1455190358, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499892", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "21124732", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032001052", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1455187319, "num_games_owned": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1940}, "timestamp_updated": 1455190358, "received_for_free": false, "review": "While Geneforge 3's gameplay is very similar to Geneforge 1 and 2, the variety of the ideological viewpoints present in the game world have been narrowed extremely. Instead of a variety of pro-shaper and pro-servile factions, there are two factions: shapers who enslave serviles, and serviles who are ostensibly fighting for their freedom but are now Actually The Villains. \nThere's no reason to roleplay as a pro-servile shaper - the game doesn't seem to act any differently, other than punishing you by locking off dialogue options with shapers. Expressing opinions in this game doesn't mean a thing - it just matters who you decide to kill. I imagine a pro-servile rebel player character who expresses distrust in the canisters will be treated the same way. \nPro-servile NPCs are now indistinct from the typical Big Bads you get in RPGs, where there's a vague reason why they're doing horrible things, but no reason that justifies it other than maybe \"the ends justify the means\". They've become indistinct from your typical goblin, skeleton, darkspawn, etc - meaningless beings that exist solely for the player character to come in and destroy with righteous protagonist fury. \n\nThis game suffers from the same problems the last two did, too: the ideology of the factions seems entirely skin deep. You can't, say, probe a servile leader about what I perceived as a ruling class within the servile faction, and you can't ask the head shaper in this game why sympathy for serviles is considered anathema to the ~shaper way~. There is no way to learn more about or even influence a faction's politics - as soon as you get to the second island, you've seen all there is to see, and what you see is what you get - the narrative doesn't do anything interesting with faction politics. \n(This isn't a gripe I have with Geneforge 3 in particular - it's a disappointing thing that, as far as I can tell, is common to many Spiderweb Software games. It's just more noticeable in Geneforge.)\n\nI've never really played Spiderweb Software games for the combat - I enjoy the story, and exploring the big, nuanced worlds. The total simplification of factions and faction politics removes one of the most compelling parts of the Geneforge series, and I hope the later titles in the series bring back the ideologically distinct factionalism that made Geneforge 1 and 2 so great. \nHaving the choice of fighting for the serviles, who want emancipation from slavery but will do so by killing innocent non-shapers with hordes of rogue monsters, or the shapers, who fight against those monsters while mistreating and oppressing serviles just isn't that fun for me. \"Choose the side that is the objective lesser evil\" does not make a compelling or entertaining narrative for your video game. It just looks like a desperate attempt to make a \"morally grey\" world.

I'm not sure why my PC becomes incapable of learning from his battle experience at just these particular moments, but it makes what can already be something of a chore into an absolutely horrible experience, if you'll pardon the pun. \n\nI really don't understand why developers feel the need to put in these kind of \"features\".

Starting off, i know it may say i only have a couple hours on record with the game, but id like to stamp that out now. I played this game years back off an old game engine before steam was a thing, buying it again now is more comfort and support for me, like buying an old book that you read years ago. I have well over 200 hours in the game, and about a thousand in the series. So let me dive in, and let you know what this game is about.\n\n   Geneforge is more than a game, its a book, an experiance, a choice, and a beautiful combat system all in one. It cries out to the imaginiative, the 3 am readers, the DnD players, the indie game searchers. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up 10 fold in story. The game puts you in the middle of an entire world and has you influence the outcome of it. In the first game, you find yourself in this estranged world, where the game gives you a brief history of it, then immediately tears that away. It isolates you, shows you that you must survive, and asks you what to do to survive. But that is only the first part. once you gather your bearings, you have to forge a path. At first the paths seem clear, good or evil, but the more you progress the more you realize there is no good. there is no evil. This game makes you question everything, with the only clear progression being that of power. You single handedly experiance the start of a world rebellion, and reitre as a god or a soldier by the end. The same picks up in each consquensial title later on, each putting you, a young shaper, smack dab in the middle of the biggest points in history of this new world. The hours, weeks, months of text painstakingly put into this game alone makes it a solid game, but the combat is fantastic too. You play a tactics style turn based micromanaging comabt system, sort of like fallout: tactics or final fantasy: tactics. But instead of pre determined abilities, like everything else you determine your path. Conjure up an army to fight for you, use magic and objects to trick your opponets and take them out one by one, or don a helmet and sword and slash your way through hoards, the choice is yous. My by far favorite part of it however, has to be the fact that nothing is safe in this game from you. It emphasizes that your choices can change the entire reality. No npc cannot be killed, although it may be hard. The world will form to what you want it to, if you are brave enough to undergo the task. Dont take this as you cannot lose, for the wrong desicion will put you in a spot where you cannot escape. But understand that you are free to make that deicion, you are free to make any desicion. This is the closest i have ever come to DnD Freeplay. \n\nPro's: Excellent story line, worth of a novel of the highest value.\n          Freerealm as hell, you are free to make any desicion you want, nothing stops you, you shape the future and history alike. \n           LOTS and LOTS of content, as said earlieri  have over 1000 hours in the series as a whole. thats a lot for a single player non grind game.\n          Decent combat tactics system, many ways to play out combat.\n          Can easily engulf you in for weeks.\n          Lots and Lots of Text\nCon's: The graphics are subpar at best, must be able to use your imagination \n           Game doesnt hold your hand at all, in fact quiet the opposite. This may be a con or pro.\n           Again, a LOT of text. again, could be a con or pro depending on your preferance.\n\nOverall i would rate this game a 9/10, Despite the horrid graphics. i honestly believe that if ther were better graphics, there wouldnt be enough reasources to make everything else so amazing.
