I've spent 51 hours on this game at the time of review and i've only gotten 1 of the 7 endings as 1 of the 5 classes. The story of the game takes place in Terrestia, a land in the middle of a war between the rebels, and the shapers. The shapers have the power to create life, and use magic in helpful ways, but also in unhelpful ways as well. They made creations and serviles for slavery purposes, to do their work for them. After hundreds of years of slavery and mistreatment, the creations and serviles finally had enough and decided to rebel against the shapers. At the height of the war, you are called in to fight by Greta, a rebel. You take a boat to Southforge Citadel and use the Geneforge, a hidden rebel way of making someone capable of shaping and magic. You then decide what side to fight for as you make your way through Terrestia aiding the shapers, rebels, or another sect hated by both rebels and shapers alike. The end is flexible and can change, and the gameplay can change as well with the classes you can pick from. Even though the graphics are primitive, it is an indie game, so it is actually very good for just a few people. Text in-game also adds to the game by providing a description of the land that you are in, as to help with imagining it better. The sound does get a bit repetitive, but it still fits the mood of wherever you happen to be, whether it be a town, cave, or the woods. Overall, this game is an indie masterpiece, as well as my favorite RPG of all time, and i've played quite a few. A hidden gem in gaming for sure."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1478485838, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499707", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "26468229", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198118748978", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1478486217, "num_games_owned": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1996}, "timestamp_updated": 1478485838, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have never written a review on here, but considering this is one of the best games and one of the most underated games ive ever played, ive decided to try my hand at it. Starting off, i know it may say i only have a couple hours on record with the game, but id like to stamp that out now. I played this game years back off an old game engine before steam was a thing, buying it again now is more comfort and support for me, like buying an old book that you read years ago. I have well over 200 hours in the game, and about a thousand in the series. So let me dive in, and let you know what this game is about.\n\n   Geneforge is more than a game, its a book, an experiance, a choice, and a beautiful combat system all in one. It cries out to the imaginiative, the 3 am readers, the DnD players, the indie game searchers. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up 10 fold in story. The game puts you in the middle of an entire world and has you influence the outcome of it. In the first game, you find yourself in this estranged world, where the game gives you a brief history of it, then immediately tears that away. It isolates you, shows you that you must survive, and asks you what to do to survive. But that is only the first part. once you gather your bearings, you have to forge a path. At first the paths seem clear, good or evil, but the more you progress the more you realize there is no good. there is no evil. This game makes you question everything, with the only clear progression being that of power. You single handedly experiance the start of a world rebellion, and reitre as a god or a soldier by the end. The same picks up in each consquensial title later on, each putting you, a young shaper, smack dab in the middle of the biggest points in history of this new world. The hours, weeks, months of text painstakingly put into this game alone makes it a solid game, but the combat is fantastic too. You play a tactics style turn based micromanaging comabt system, sort of like fallout: tactics or final fantasy: tactics. But instead of pre determined abilities, like everything else you determine your path. Conjure up an army to fight for you, use magic and objects to trick your opponets and take them out one by one, or don a helmet and sword and slash your way through hoards, the choice is yous. My by far favorite part of it however, has to be the fact that nothing is safe in this game from you. It emphasizes that your choices can change the entire reality. No npc cannot be killed, although it may be hard. The world will form to what you want it to, if you are brave enough to undergo the task. Dont take this as you cannot lose, for the wrong desicion will put you in a spot where you cannot escape. But understand that you are free to make that deicion, you are free to make any desicion. This is the closest i have ever come to DnD Freeplay. \n\nPro's: Excellent story line, worth of a novel of the highest value.\n          Freerealm as hell, you are free to make any desicion you want, nothing stops you, you shape the future and history alike. \n           LOTS and LOTS of content, as said earlieri  have over 1000 hours in the series as a whole. thats a lot for a single player non grind game.\n          Decent combat tactics system, many ways to play out combat.\n          Can easily engulf you in for weeks.\n          Lots and Lots of Text\nCon's: The graphics are subpar at best, must be able to use your imagination \n           Game doesnt hold your hand at all, in fact quiet the opposite. This may be a con or pro.\n           Again, a LOT of text. again, could be a con or pro depending on your preferance.\n\nOverall i would rate this game a 9/10, Despite the horrid graphics. i honestly believe that if ther were better graphics, there wouldnt be enough reasources to make everything else so amazing.
