This thing has a whopping 23 levels and almost as many lines of dialogue, and features a great cast of characters with such interesting personalites as \"Old lady in space\" and \"Old cowboy in space\" and \"Guy with a banjo\". Literally the dude has a banjo and calls himself the banjo king. Because banjos are inherently funny I guess. \n\nAnd the gameplay, you send your dudes to take planets that make more dudes for you. There's typically some sort of gimmick like your opponent has invisible dudes or one of your planets blows up every minute but this barely adds anything. There's vastly more strategically interesting options in this genre for free all over the damn internet, with a lot more than 23 levels. Like Phage Wars.\n\nDon't be a dumb idiot like me, don't waste your money. I beat this in an hour.
