There are A LOT of reasons to play this game...HOWEVER, there is one really big reason not to play this game. It's age, and let me clarify. Because of the age of the game, new players aren't really welcomed in. As a new player you won't find anyone to run relevant content, you won't find a fair and forgiving economy, you won't find a lot of help learning your class..Also, most of the content has been obsoleted. Quest lines, and loot from lower level dungeons, both give useless loot, and little to no reason to waste your time. The community and player base consists mostly of quiet and solo players, OR, trolls and abusive arrogant jerks. The quiet solo players keep to themselves and run the markets, whereas the pompous players tend to get carried through content based on popularity. If you can't solo, and you don't make a name for yourself, there is a chance you'll spend a lot of time alone.\n\nOverall, there is a lot of fun to be had, but if you go in expecting a fulfilling and social experience, you'll be disappointed. At this time, just based on the games age, the lack of a welcoming comittee (bad community), irrelevant content, over inflated market, and the cash shop (which does offer some very slight pay to win features), I can't recommend this game. It had it's day, perhaps 5 years ago, I'd give a different review, but the game is and has been on a decline."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1487946354, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530811", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30142178", "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": "13", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036257992", "num_reviews": 45, "last_played": 1464630681, "num_games_owned": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 842}, "timestamp_updated": 1487946354, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Daybreak, is like EA, but they are QUICKLY killing all of their IPs.

The amount of content in this game is overwhelming. You can play for many, many hundreds of hours and barely scratch the surface of all the different things that you can do, see and achieve.\n\nOf course there is the straght-line play, go from lvl 1 to 100 as fast as possible then do raids for great gear and accumulate riches that will allow you to play as a subscriber without paying real money, thats a perfectly viable playstyle, but there is an ocean of content that you will miss. In this game, it is worthwhile to visit all zones, levels and content during any time and level of your character. The whole world is being put to use, not just a small percentage as you level or when you reach max level.\n\nThere is a lot of easily available filler content, mostly aimed for fast leveling or casual fast play, but there are also tons of hidden stuff and elaborate quests for the players that are more curious .. for players that can stop dead in their tracks, and just take one moment to look around them. Players who like exploring and investing more effort into straying off quest lines or not simply just power level.\nMore often than not, the rewards for pursuing some of the strange questlines found in remote areas are quite surprising and with such an immense, ambient sprawl of activities to do from the moment you start and all the way up to max level - is to me what an \"MMO\" or \"Open World\" should be.\n\nIndeed, not only is the game very lengthy but also, broad. Playing Everquest 2 is like getting lost in a jungle. No matter where you decide to go and what you decide to do, you will find adventure....or adventure will find you as the case may be.\n\nThis game offers lots of content for every taste.\nYou want to solo from start to finish and still get great gear and do dungeons? No problem, game offers plenty of ways to do just that.\nYou like direction and hand-holding, gps quests and casual stuff? Lots of that in the game.\nYou like to break your head with difficult quests that require some inquisitive thinking, time and dedication? Unforgiving challenges that makes the rewards all the more worthwhile? Hundreds of hours worth of this kind of content.\nYou like crafting? You'll be overwhelmed, crafting is insane in this game, its more content in the EQ2 crafting sphere alone than in the whole worlds of other mmos and depending on your attentiveness while crafting - the quality of the product and outcome will reflect in your performances. For instance, if you fail to flatten a bubble in the iron of a blade or miss out on cooling it in time, the blade may turn out Crude in quality.\n\nThe character progression and roleplaying features has no equal. Just the alternate achievement skill-trees alone are way and beyond the whole progression system of other games. You decide how you divide the experience gained between the character leveling and the AA (alternate advancement) level, which works like talent points. There are over 400 talents and lots of trees to work out as you go. Personally i like to channel all the exp into AA, that way i get quite overpowered at low levels, which for me is quite satisfying. \nFor instance you can be a very powerful level 20 with lots of talents, who can tackle higher levels simply because your character is much more trained than a higher level might be. There are many parameters to your characters. Skills has to be trained to perfect techniques ect. \nSpeaking of talents though, there are different talent trees in every class too and you can earn talents from all kinds of directions, from solving puzzles to simply exploring.\n\nThis game was never very appealing to the younger players, nor to the ones that only come to talk random stuff in world chat or expect the game to be like most other mmo out there, as is the case in other mmo that are different from the typical themepark mmo.\nAs a result the game seems quiet and tranquil, which for me is a good thing. I dont need a lot of players jumping around aimlessly in the start areas and talking smack ( i call them cheerleaders because thats what they really do in these games). Sadly there are a lot of players who need these cheerleaders to consider the game as being \"alive\" and not \"dead\", or every mmo game in existence to run the exact same way Wildstar or World of Warcraft does - many whom i assume has rated this video game as Negative on Steam.\n\nThere is a lot of poison thrown around on the internet regarding this game, many of whom I have opened conversation with only to discover they know not what they talk about or have even played the game to any extent at all.\n\nThere are a lot of big and hyped features being released in the more popular mmo titles today, that have existed in this game since the very beginning .. it is a shame because many players will miss out on one of the most underrated, best mmos ever made, way ahead of it's time and definitely the biggest one yet.\n\n\n- Scrawny old veteran since 2005."}, {"votes_down": 10, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486914335, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518288", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 22, "recommendationid": "29876011", "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197986241042", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1488251494, "num_games_owned": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4167}, "timestamp_updated": 1486914335, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I can play as a frog."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485649059, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504705", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "29553231", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198062629695", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1486318557, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 277}, "timestamp_updated": 1485649059, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good game, just gotta get past the old graphics.\n\nI can tell the developers spent a lot of time on this game, it is truly a piece of art after you explore for a couple of hours.\nHere's what I got out of it.\n\nPros:\n\n+Tons of Job Classes\n+Lots of Skills to experiment with\n+Huge Map, Like Extremely Huge, really feels like an adventure.\n+Good UI, easy to learn, simple combat.\n+Tons of play value\n+Crafting System & Economy\n+Voice acting decent\n\nCons:\n\n-Graphics are a bit dated.\n-Server Population Currently a bit low\n-Combat is simple.. but, then again, im just a warrior\n-Dialogue sometimes a bit cheesy.\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1487928320, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507175", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30137181", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198093067407", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506215927, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 49, "playtime_forever": 135026}, "timestamp_updated": 1487928320, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I've been playing everquest 2 since 2011. \n\nIf I could rate the game out of 10 it would be 6.

The EQ universe was my home for the next 6 years, shared only with what I consider another great MMO, Dark Age of Camelot. It wasn't until 2005 and I peeled myself away from those games to embark on a new journey in Everquest 2. \n\nI will admit, the first couple of years were very hard on EQ2. The steep computer requirements, the very hard game-play and the rise of a much lighter MMO in World of Warcraft created a challenging future for Everquest 2. Yet, the game persisted; made changes and continued to grow its content until now; it is probably of the largest if not the biggest MMO (content wise) out there today.\n\nI view EQ2 as a soler or even duo (couples/friends) MMO dream. All the content below the newest expansion is doable solo or small group; long as you have the superior level. This allows people to go back and see everything the game has to offer without problematic scaling that would prevent such a thing as present in a game like Lord of the Rings Online.\n\nNow don't let this fool you, the current content at maximum level is hard; offering a good challenge for players who wish to partake in that field of play.\n\nBut EQ2 has something for everyone.\n\nThe best player housing. Bar none. No other game even comes close ... no really, none.\n\nCollecting. Love to collect stuff? Well, EQ2 has some of the best collecting available in an MMO. A library worth.\n\nQuests? More than I can remember. Thousands. Enough for you to lose much of your remaining years on this Earth playing. Now who doesn't love that in a game.\n\nHuge zones, enough that even flying doesn't make em seem overly small unlike a game like World of Warcraft which seems very small once you hit the air.\n\nNow, that being said I will stress there are some problems with this game. A big one or two as well.\n\nPerformance. The game suffers from a very old engine. With that comes unsolvable bouts of lag, crashing, playing in a window you can find your game display just stops working until you ALT-ENTER to set it full screen again. \n\nPoor player models. Still using the same models since release and it shows. Half the males in the game look like they are suffering from MONO. The females are not much better. Even the Asian models aren't great, looking more like expressionless dolls than they should.\n\nPopulation. Small ... not that this is a bad or good thing; really depends on what you want out of a game. I happen to like EQ2 being a bit on the small side. Makes gathering, questing and such easier and more relaxing. But to each their own really.\n\nJust based on the sheer number of things to do, the amazing housing ... EQ2 is worth the cost of a subscription. Especially if sitting in LFG queues all day isn't your thing.\n\n8/10 ..."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1487483956, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499730", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "30026529", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198166423679", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1506559233, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1155, "playtime_forever": 74335}, "timestamp_updated": 1487483956, "received_for_free": false, "review": "the gathering stuff can get a little annoying but thats just me support is prompt&helpful"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486584560, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494905", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29788549", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197996229051", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1501816319, "num_games_owned": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5147}, "timestamp_updated": 1486584560, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I do like this game I wanted somehting different from the whole WoW stuff.
