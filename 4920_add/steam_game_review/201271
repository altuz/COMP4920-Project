Anyone who was having trouble running the game beforehand should give it a go.\n\nMultiplayer has basically gotten a huge expansion too given that the game's added well over 60 new land and naval units plus a 19th Century avatar skill tree.

Basically it boils down to a mix of all the great things in the last couple of total war games.  You get the infantry gun combat of empire, the melee armies of shogun 2, and some of the few (Good) gameplay mechanics of napoleon total war (namely good artillery).  The best improvement by far is the tweaks they have made to navies.  They can be used to bombard improvements and armies, and in combat near coasts they can provide offshore artillery strikes making it worth while to have large navies other than to transfer your troops around.  One thing that bothered me though was the AI and balance in autoresolve.  The AI builds lots of units, but namely a lot of old school units instead of modern ones.  A real time battle is a tiny challenge, but an auto resolve results in a win with you losing LITERALLY no units sometimes.  Overall a decent buy worth picking up though.
