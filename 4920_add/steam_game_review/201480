Broken. The process for this game stays open for way too long after exiting in the background even when exiting correctly without crashing.\n\nI replicated the sstre.exe crash on swapping to the shotgun weapon in the second fight 2 minutes into the game. No workarounds that I know of. This game is dead in the water. It did not have Xbox360pad support. The music was epic, and the tone seemed like it might had been good. Liked the strange real time combat illusion that the RPGMaker style turn based window displayed. That was a very original idea. \n\nConclusion: If you really must play something with a similar flavor audiovisually, I wonder if you should get this?\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/272620/Serious_Sams_Bogus_Detour/\nI saw on the news page that it has the Dev of hammerwatch whom worked on it, and the featureset looks solid from the store page. However, I dont know what you guys think, but I get a little cold feet about geting Serious Sam products given how support for them varies from radio silence to free remasters with seemingly no way to predict which way they go. What do you guys think?"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502878070, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499954", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34273212", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198018035343", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1502884872, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 60}, "timestamp_updated": 1502898518, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I can get a shotgun and the game doesn't crash, I wish I could change the controls though. \n\n\nshotgun/10\n\n\nextra note: It took me longer to write this review than it took me to finish a level.
