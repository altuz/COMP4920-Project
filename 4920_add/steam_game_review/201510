Yes I know I played 9 hours on this crap but it's because I play lot's of very bad games I played over 30 hours of Sonic 2006 (God help me) but Sonic 2006 has redeeming qualities but this game is just all bad the soundtrack is completely horrible except for 1 song and all of the game modes are not good at all. Especially if 4 of them are fucking racing. They released updates that didn't fix a thing wrong with the game proving that they do not know how to make a game or they just don't care. I have never heard of Team6 but I know that I will not ever buy a game from them ever again."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505998272, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35103569", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182491075", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505997977, "num_games_owned": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1505998272, "received_for_free": false, "review": "No no no no....\nThis game is nothing like the old Flat Out this is just piece of crap put together.\n- Crappy grafics\n- Terrible physics\n- Bad race selection\n- Like 0 upgrade options on cars\n\nDon't buy this game if you're planning to you should buy Flat Out 2 or Flat Out not this crap...."}]}
