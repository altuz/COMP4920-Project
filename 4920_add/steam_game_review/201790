Despite all that, nearing the end of the game I'm finding it a big slog.  Traps and Items have too many upgrades, each with at least 5, and by the end of the game I find myself with only about half the traps unlocked and maybe 3 traps fully upgraded.  And because it seems more effective to upgrade traps instead of unlocking new ones, you end up playing with the same smaller pool of traps throughout the game.\n\nPart of OMD1's charm was having a lot of different trap types and experimenting in different scenarios, with only one upgrade per trap, each was not a huge investment and you had a lot of variety at the end.  But this game it seems you need to play endless mode to unlock skulls in order to unlock more gear.  The weakness shows when you start seeing something like a Frost Ogre and you have no fire items, instead shooting the guy literally 40-50 times in the head before he goes down. \n\nI also find the map design underwhelming. The game also has an annoying tendency to introduce a map which seems like it needs a certain strategy to be effective, and then they throw in enemies to stop that strategy. Like barricade-dependent maps get tons of sappers who blow them up, or maps that require guardians get gnoll hunters to take them out, some maps have environmental hazards but they take too many shots to activate.  And the levels are too long, the later levels seem to all have 12 waves! Just goes on and on and on. I do suspect that some levels are designed for co-op because geographically, some levels are just so spread out that it's impossible to put down all the new traps you want in the 15 seconds or so between waves and there are not enough teleports.\n\nIn closing I find this game's biggest problem is the attempt to extend gameplay through unnecessary unlocks. To give more value, or more content, they add a bunch of unlocks so you need to play multiple times to get all the traps and gear and items or new costumes that cost 50 skulls!  And to be honest I have more money than time so when I play a game I want to play it once and be done, games that extend their play time in this manner just give me a subpar experience.  Sometimes I'll put 50 or 100 hours into a big AAA game, but I don't want to put that amount of time into an Indie or a game like Orcs Must Die"}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504983761, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489302", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34844404", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198014275278", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1505356737, "num_games_owned": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 934}, "timestamp_updated": 1504983761, "received_for_free": false, "review": "its not orcs must die 1, this game let me down."}]}
