The multiple technical difficulties I encountered due to owning an AMD card were very frustrating. Once those were conquered, it was on the the game, but the beginning didn\u2019t inspire. A pretty boring intro sequence was made worse by the more egregious screen tearing I\u2019ve ever encountered (I had to disable V-Sync to progress through the intro). For a first-person-shooter, it certainly took its time in giving me a gun. What does it think it is, Half Life?\n\nBut then I got a gun, and another, and things kept improving from there. The shooting felt great, the guns were fun, the levels varied and allowing different approaches - everything from being sneaky to running in with two guns blazing. What most impressed me was how competent the game was at things you wouldn\u2019t typically expect in a first-person-shooter, let alone a Wolfenstein game.\n\nFor example, there was stealth, and it worked really well - sneak up on soldiers and you can take them down silently with a knife, or shoot them with a silenced pistol. With in-game rewards for stealth kills, it made not-shooting in a shooter fun, and I had a blast sneaking around levels and silently dispatching enemies one by one.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the story - a bizarre alternate history with sci-fi elements that was surprisingly good. I never would have imagined a story about the silent meat-head of Wolfenstein being good, but the writers worked wonders, and the voice acting was great.

Blazkowicz once again, fighting the nazi forces, which have taken over the world. A simple and maybe overused premise, which here works pretty well since these nazis have new technology (making them feel fresh), in a semi-futuristic 1940. The setting is confusing but great, it's a futurised past, and it works like a charm.\n\n[h1]First Impressions[/h1]\nI'll start saying that the first impression might've not been the best, the beginning felt overwhelming with a lot of things to digest in such a short period of time: From what's happening, the scale of the war you've just been introduced in the middle of, the characters and mechanics. However, once the prologue ends, the game reintroduces you to it's world and to the actual main storyline, and from there, you have time to learn from the characters, and the game mechanics better.\n\n[h1]Story and writing[/h1]\nI didn't really know what to expect from a modern FPS's storyline, but I was gladly suprised. The story is engaging, well written for the most part, with a great cast of likable characters, I never felt like a character did not fit or was bland, they all have their personalities, pasts and motivations. The only thing I felt is that they could've been developed even further in the story. But nonetheless, the game achieved to make me care for them, which is a good indicator, of good characters.\n\nAlso, the villains: It's been a looong time since I genuinely HATED and wanted to EXTERMINATE a character. Villains in this game are cruel, resourceful and smart, and they won't waste a oportunity to let you know that.\n\nGood main cast, great villains and a great turn of events. The story might not be groundbreaking, but the execution is really well made. Made me feel a lot of things: From joy, to sadness and even anger.\n\nAlso, as for game length: It took me 15 hours to beat the game on \u00dcber difficulty dying 135 times. Length is fine, and might take you more or less depending on the difficulty and your skill.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nFirst i'll start with the things I liked, and then I'll proceed with those I didn't so much.\n\nThroughout the game we'll adquire a reduced but widely different arsenal (7 weapons in total). However, we have an interesting twist here: You can not only dual wield them, but also almost every weapon will have alternate firing modes, which can come really in handy depending on the situation. It gives more options on how to approach different situations.\n\nAs for the dual-wielding, it can come as a silly gimmick at first, but later in the game it proves to be a fun, satisfying and even useful mechanic when combined with the alternate firing modes. You can have an assault rifle in one hand shooting bullets, and in the other hand, another rifle with a rocket launcher attached to it.\n\nWe're also introduced to the Laserkraftwerk, a laser tool (and also weapon) that can be used to get us through the levels. At first it might feel like an annoying gimmick to try to make \"puzzles\" out of carving holes in linear paths, but then there are levels that utilize this in a way that can be used in combat, and also to solve stealth situations in different ways and can be really useful.\n\nLevels are well designed, detailed and also destructible, meaning that you are forced to move from cover to cover in order to survive. Lesser enemies will not cause much trouble, but bigger ones will prove dangerous as their blow your cover away.\n\nThe design choice I liked the most -- having a mix between new and oldschool mechanics:\n[list]\n[*] Shooting can be done from the hip or aiming down sights. Both ways have proven accurate and efficient, presenting two different playstyles to the player to choose from at any moment.\n[*] Health and armor pickups are scattered around the level, and you'll need them. There's regenerative health but is well used here: It's neither too forgiving and allows you to get out of really hard situations if you know how to use the chance. Health will only regen if you have less than 20% of health, and if higher, it will only round up numbers (if you're 25% it'll go up to 30%, etc.).\n[*] As mentioned before, there are alternate firemodes for different weapons.\n[/list]\n\nTo wrap up I'll add a silly detail: The gore is balanced and detailed, nor too over the top and not too forgiving. If you blast someone with a shotgun, a hole will open in their torso, a limb might fly off, etc. but this doesn't happen with weapons like the pistol or the assault rifle (only thing is that with the AR you have a chance of decapitation). I feel like having realistic gore in a realistic styled game is important for the immersion and it's appreciated.\n\nNow onto the things I disagreed with: \n\nFirst of, there's a *checkpoint system* meaning that you're at the developer's mercy of how and when your progress is saved. This means that you cannot leave the game whenever you want without losing progress and this problem is more apparent in later sections where the checkpoints are too far from eachother and the sections in between are tougher. Some will argue that this adds to the difficulty but I feel like it's an artificial way of doing it.\n\nAlso, there's a point mid-game where you'll be introduced to new and stronger enemy types, the problem is that you're thrown into a bunch of them without having fully understood how to counter them and it causes a sudden difficulty spike that might be frustating (you'll die a lot). Fortunately from there, the game decides to calm down and let you learn how to combat them, making the rest of the game more enjoyable.\n\nAs for item pickups, I felt that the basic ones (like ammunition, armor, and health if you're below 100%) could've been picked up just by touching them, instead of having to spam E all the time to pick everything. This makes resupplying slower and tedious. However, for overcharging health it could work perfectly since it's a optional thing to do and can allow the player to use the enviornment resources however and whenever they want.\n\nThere is a vehicular section where you'll be controlling a mech, the only bad thing is that you're totally exposed to enemies and it's a matter of shooting everything off before your health drops to 0, there's no strategy offered.\n\n[h1]Graphics, performance and sound design[/h1]\nThe graphics are great, with a plethora of options to regulate graphic fidelity however you please. You also have other options like FOV sliders and such. The game for the most part went really smoothly and it was just on a couple of cases where fps would drop. (I'm running on a i7 at 2.8GHz with a GTX 1050 at 2GB and 16GB of RAM).\n\nGood sound design: Weapons sound powerful, and the environmental sounds makes the world belivable. As for the music, it was great but went kinda unnoticed since the SFX were always on top, and it was in these cases where I missed a lot a Music volume slider which isn't any. \n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nWolfenstein: The New Order is not a perfect game but it's a really enjoyable experience, with fun gameplay and good story.
