Good. So you know and like Jurassic Park or you've played previous Telltale Games...games. Or both. If you only know and like Jurassic Park but you never played a Telltale adventure game, please please look at gameplay videos before you buy!\nIf you already know Telltale Games adventures, then be advised: they were even easier than you may have thought! As you can tell by previous reviews and comments, this game is not like the typical Telltale adventure. I have only played the Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us games, but man is Jurassic Park a different beast. Like one other reviewer (Disdainus Maximus) put it: [Welcome to] Quicktime event hell.\nSo you played some other Telltale Games adventures, you know its basically a visual novel with some Quick Time Events (QTEs). Ok. Good. But you never had any trouble doing them, did you? That's right! Prepare to mess up, repeatedly. While there are only a few scenes you can actually die in, it is way too easy to mess up QTEs and get downgraded. By downgraded I mean you only get a silver or bronze medal for completing a specific scene - nothing gameplay or even achievement related but it does put a dent in your ego :P\nSome QTEs are on such a tight time constraint that you will fail them easily, at least I did. Seeing how others had the same complaint I believe it is a fair point of criticism. Also if you have previous Telltale Games experience, this game right here has no choices to make. There are no alternate outcomes, no good/bad decisions - so keep that in mind as well. Oh and one more thing: you cannot move around. Remember how Tales from the Borderlands or The Wolf Among Us let you move around at least a little bit? Yeah that's not gonna happen here. You can tilt your head and look around a scene sure, but moving around in it? Nope. To be fair you can change places within a scene and even change characters in some but movement goes out the door with this game.\nOk then, what will you get with this game? I'll tell you what: A nice wild romp through Jurassic Park at the time of the first movie. You won't see familiar faces (maybe other body parts though?) but you will see the park as it was in the first movie with a side story that is like a B movie popcorn flick. As many others will also tell you: do get this game during a sale, otherwise the 20 EUR (or whatever your region's full price is) may leave you feeling cheated. The length of the game is good even for 20 of your hard earned currencies but the production value (dialogue especially) leaves something to be desired.\nAgain I suggest looking at gameplay footage first, but contrary to many negative reviews this one isn't a stinker from start to finish. It has its weeknesses (bloody QTE time constraints in some parts) but it isn't fundamentally a bad game - give it a chance! Give it a chance and maybe it'll tide you over until season 2 of the Game of Thrones Telltale series ;)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504462145, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514381", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34718153", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198164613014", "num_reviews": 21, "last_played": 1504737125, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 579}, "timestamp_updated": 1504462145, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Man, this game is definitely from when Telltale was figuring out their shit.

However, I am a HUGE Jurassic Park fanboy, and I liked this game, I liked the system where you had to control multiple characters, you can see where  the Telltale games, no pun intended, evolved from here. This was a great and fun addition to the Isla Nublar incident. The story's unpredictable and has a little bit of that Telltale charm to it, The characters are likable. Is it as good as other telltale games, like say, The Walking Dead? No its not, but is it still a good game? Yes. Definitely. Especially if you're a Jurassic Park fan. So yeah, I recommend this one.

Unlike Wolf Among Us and Walking Dead, you do not feel the responsibility or burden of your choices too much in this game.\n\nThe story is pretty straight forward. There is a group trying to survive through trex kind of things. There is not much to remember about the story except some key tragic moments.\n\nGameplay involves too much listening and talking. Most exciting moments of the game are button mashing parts. And the game involves couple of mandatory and easy puzzles.\n\nThe characters are stereotypes. A rebelious teenager, a soldier, a divorced father or the teenager, a local costa rican angry vengeful woman, a hypocrate scientist, a hero soldier to do crazy things.\n\nThe end of the game is not worth 5 hours of gameplay. The only pro of this game is the action scenes. They are all button mashing but still effective enough to cause you hold your breath.\n\nGo buy Wolf Among Us or Walking Dead games.

It's easy to slip up, making the game feel more realistic. The first and second episode truly do pull you into the story. It was pleasant to hear familiar voices from other Telltale games, in addition to the voice of the courier/Sven/Onmund from TES:Skyrim. The visual detail of the dinosaurs is beautiful. The game serves some educational purpose as there is some information about dinosaurs thrown out here and there. The storyline picks up directly following the aftermath of the first Jurassic Park movie, which was a lot of fun and made the nerd in me happy.\n\nSadly, the negatives outweighed the postives for me. Nearly all of your in-game conversation is pointless and doesn't affect the game. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for your performance during the cutscene, but they have no purpose. With the exception of achievements surrounding perfect scene playthroughs, you recieve no achievements and no feedback at the end of the game. Unlike many other Telltale games, you're never shown how your decisions weigh up to other players, which is one of my favorite features of Telltale games. The storyline is ridiculously linear, with your endgame decision being the only major, storyline changing decision you get to make. Characters change their behaviors uncharacteristically and at the drop of a hat. A \"protective father\" doesn't question helping the woman that holds him and his daughter hostage. A mercenary calls in his millitant group to come rescue him and the others via boat, but when you come across him the boat is empty. The only mention towards this is one character asking \"Why is the boat empty?\". Like much of the storyline, many of the actions and results are left largely unexplained. If they can't clone aquatic animals (mentioned by Dr.Sorkin), how does the final ocean dwelling dinosaur come to exist? Furthermore, why is there money just sitting in an empty boat that was only designed for rescue? This game starts out wonderful, but it seems like the seemingly conflicting ideas on where the storyline should go leaves the story feeling patchy and unresolved. If you do decide to buy it, please buy it on sale. This game feels neglected and leaves much to be desired. I struggled to complete the game as it just becomes downright boring and repetitive after the second episode.\n"}]}
