You work and develop your dungeon and squads of units but, even though you have a single entrance to your level, the heroes create ladders that can appear anywhere in your dungeon and enter through there.  You then have to deploy all your troops to the ladder to destroy it.  As you lose the level if they get to your vaults and escape with any gold, and as the ladders can appear right in front of vaults; it can end a level with little warning.\n\nSecond, the overworld missions require you to split your forces between a defense force and an assault force as the time spent on the overworld continues to pass in the underworld and those ladders keep reappearing.  It becomes a scripted game:\n1) level everyone up to level 3 squads, \n2) wait til the ladder or ladders appear, destroy the attack, \n3) take your least damaged squads and send them up to the surface to attack the nearest enemies; likely to die.\n4) While 3 is going on, retrain your defense squads.\n5) Create new squads then start at 1 \n\nEventually you'll either break the back of the level or die and have to try again, reliving the whole hour you spent on it.\n\nFinally, it's just a bad game with hit/miss humor and bad implementations.  In the original release, there is a puzzle that you click on a book and it reads a logic puzzle to you to solve to arrange 5 colored lights on pillars.  Somewhere during th production of the game, they decided that you'd only get to hear the text once and you couldn't reactivate it to even read the clues to solve the puzzle.  So, if you didn't realize clicking the book would trigger a puzzle; you were forced to hit the forums or brute force the puzzle (while being attacked by ladders in your main base).  Since then, they added a text wall to read the puzzle and added symbols to the lights but, this reflects the lack of quality that I saw in the game.  I played for 20 hours and completed probably half the campaign but, I was completely and utterly underwhelmed by the lack of polish, the frustration of bugged levels forcing me to repeat missions that wouldn't trigger properly.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend you avoid this game."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1496295851, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499679", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32100789", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197996972957", "num_reviews": 43, "last_played": 1496435765, "num_games_owned": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1897}, "timestamp_updated": 1497121871, "received_for_free": false, "review": "TL:DR;\nPoor man's version of Dungeon Keeper. Eye candy graphics, but without any depth or substance to keep player engaged, full of bad design choices. Worth 7$ at the most.\nPerfect sale material.\n\nReview:\nA game with a nice graphic that suffers greatly from bad design. It's 6/10 at the very best, and that is being generous. Horrible grind and micromanagement, Very odd controls and menus, music and voice acting that bring a tear to the eye in the same manner as an onion does.\n\n\nGraphics 7/10\n- nicely done rooms\n- all the monsters look the same\n- horribly unoptimized, taxing even most modern graphics cards\n- due to the above, small game area\n\nSound 4/10\n- nice ambient\n- music that plays like a list of random tracks from Jamendo\n- annoying voice overs. Baal is the only unit you can click and he says anything, but he has like 3 sentences to say.\n\nGameplay 5/10\n- horrible UI design. counter-intuitive, difficult to navigate, some actions require clicking the right, not the left button etc etc\n- bad camera. at maximum, it gives you very limited view. in dungeon building mode you have a top overview, but can't see most units and perform most actions\n- grind boring as fukk. every single level is doing the same thing over and over and over again\n- dungeon progression tree! most stupid idea ever, in order to be able to unlock the ability to summon a creature, you need points, which are gained by actions taken, like using mana, obtaining resources or summoning the creatures.\n- squad-based combat, limiting you to a maximum of 20 units you will ever use\n- squad-based skills, that require every member of the squad being of a different class, otherwise they will not work\n- very average story line. set in Ardania(meh, Majesty is now another exploited franchise), \n- dialogues full of cliche jokes that are mostly not funny. mostly.\n- dungeon building is extremely limited. The area is small, rooms are too big and have pre-defined entry points. \n- worse, you can't cancel build order, once given. So if you just changed your mind, that's bad!\n- limited unit experience and squad experience\n- very little usable magic, no artefacts, no enhancements, no turn-into-chicken spells etc.\n- very low maximum trap limit making traps useless without a brewery\n- important options are hidden in menus, no pre-battle arrangement screen, like equipping runes\n\nConclusions:\nWhile this game might look good, looks and average storyline are the only redeeming qualities. \nThis game forces player to be small by imposing very arbitrary rules on pretty much everything player can do. \nCoupled with weird camera action and counter-intuitive UI, this is the game that will not hold your attention unless you are a Majesty and Dungeon Keeper fan like me. \nRecommended on sale only."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498439119, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496942", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32795026", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198010423636", "num_reviews": 31, "last_played": 1361952000, "num_games_owned": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 844}, "timestamp_updated": 1501259587, "received_for_free": false, "review": "As much as I love the way they managed to weave a million classic heavy metal song titles into their script, the game falls flat as soon as you step away from their snarky humor.
