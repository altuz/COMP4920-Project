I honestly feel like someone took what was Ridge Racer (A rather good racer) and then said. \"What we need is for this game to be more like Burnout, but I don't want you to change anything about our physics engine\"  And off the designers and programmers went to try to do it, and ultimately we have Unbounded. \n\nBut this game is just damn odd.  The oddest thing about it is the last burnout game was made in 2008, this game came 4 years later.   It's possible this is trying to be like Need for Speed Most Wanted but even then, I don't think that's the goal. \n\nThe game is really split between three modes.  First there's the Time attack mode, that's existed in every racing game ever made.   The second is a drift challenge, where the goal is to drift, gain boost and race past enemies.  And finally, the third, Domination mode, where you take down enemies (Called fragging.. ugh) and blow up buildings to get short cuts. \n\nOn the surface that last one sounds great.  In reality.... well honestly the entire game is a bit of a mess, it'd be wrong to just call just that one mode a problem, when the game itself really stands out as the biggest issue. \n\nThe core issue I have with this game is I really don't know what it's trying to be.   The game seems to revel in the destruction the player does.  Breaking a wall gives you points, killing people gives you points, there's the whole boost/frag system that seems good, and a frag also auto drives your car a bit.  But the real problem is momentum. \n\nYou see hitting a wall or driving through it, smashing into cars, and boosting is all great, but the game doesn't \"cheat\" physics much.  If you're going slow at 60 mph and another car is at the top speed of 200 mph.  You don't accelerate to 150 without a question, instead you slowly start to go faster, and faster and faster.  The acceleration on the cars is shockingly bad.   So mistakes are costly.  Problem is mistakes happen all the time, and getting taken out does as well.  In fact smashing into anything seems to slow you down and for a game build on drifting, the drifting isn't exactly fast. \n\nThis coupled with an attempt to be like Burnout where fighting enemies is encouraged really hurts the experience.  That means you're encouraged to do all those things that Burnout made fun, rubbing, smashing, and just being a nuisance.  But the problem is if you slow down (by rubbing against an enemy for instance) you're penalized because you're going slow.  If you get hit into a wall you're taken out of the race, and if you try to get aggressive, you seem penalized. \n\nThis is the opposite of how Burnout does it, rubbing is rewarded, you might go smash into the wall, but you got boost to go fast, and you don't need a full bar.  In Ridge Racer one mistake and you can go from first to last, in Burnout that happens and then you can go from last to first quickly.    Ridge Racer isn't Burnout, so the real question is why does it try to be in this game, because it doesn't even try to explain itself other than a VERY short (two line) tutorial about drifting and boosting.\n\nThe fact is the game ultimately isn't fun.  It's not just that it's not Burnout, but it's not really anything else.  The game starts out annoying and hard, and ... well I didn't really feel the need to play more than 6 races because as I said they aren't really fun.  The game doesn't welcome you with a tutorial or a couple easy races or anything, instead it's just annoyingly hard from the first race on, and with no difficulty options and no really interesting gameplay, I didn't know why I should have stuck around. \n\nNow I heard complaints about story, or a reason to race, and guys, it's a racing game, it doesn't need a story.  What it DID need is a reason to really exist, because it's not to drift like the rest of the games in the series, and it's not to frag each other.  It doesn't have the style of other games, because even split second was pretty fun for what it was, and it doesn't even have the gameplay that Most wanted had.  Ultimately Ridge Racer is a game with out a reason for existing. \n\nAnd what's really sad is this is the last game in the Ridge Racer franchise, it's also the only one which didn't have a Japanese release, which is a bit telling in my opinion.   If Ridge Racer had just made Burnout Paradise, or just Burnout semi efficiently, we'd be singing it's praises because Burnout stopped making Burnout games.    Hell, we've seen the Crew, Driveclub, Trackmania and every Need for Speed.  So racing games are still popular.  The problem really is that Ridge Racer didn't stand out at all at a time when it probably would have been relatively easy to stand out.  That's a real shame, but ultimately there's a reason this is the last Ridge Racer.  It shouldn't have been, but it is the end of a great legacy."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505512490, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552238", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34982108", "votes_up": 29, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197963676960", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1505512382, "num_games_owned": 826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1505512490, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Single player only, even though it's tagged with multiplayer.

Story mode is all there is to this game since the multiplayer servers went down years ago, so that means you're playing the equivalent of a dreary version of Burnout with some Split/Second shortcuts and explosions thrown in. Earn boost by drifting/drafting/being mean to the AI, then use that boost to speed up and blast through buildings/walls/gas tankers scattered around the track. This is around 50% of the story mode, with the rest split up between no-destruction-allowed shindo racing, no-opponents-allowed time attacks, no-racing-allowed drift attacks, and no-fun-allowed frag attacks, which is the most difficult, frustrating event type in the game.\n\nRRU is obviously Burnout inspired; the game is about winning races while destroying opponent cars while blasting around a course at 150mph with the catchup-AI right on your tail, but it misses the parts that made Burnout great: the varied environments, upbeat punk-pop soundtrack, and the excellent career mode with all its unique objectives and landmarks. In RRU, you're always racing at night through a grimy version of New York City, crashing through the same landmarks over and over in a story mode that takes itself really seriously when it shows up after beating each batch of events. \n\nThe biggest complaint is that it's not what people think of when they hear Ridge Racer at all, and it isn't. It has a lot in common with the PS4's Need for Speed and its 'grimdark perpetual night motif in a series that didn't take itself too seriously before, but now is for whatever reason' reboot.

Yeap, how they messed it up this bad I don't know, but drifting is completely broken in the game. Simply press the button and witness your car careening to the nearest wall or spin completely. I tried it at full speed (like I would in the main series), I tried braking and then attemting to drift but nope, the car will become uncontrollable. Maybe there is a trick to it, but it's so far from the original games that it shouldn't even be called Ridge Racer at this point. \n\nOther than that the game is decent. It's fluid, it has some neat ideas like destructible enviroments that create shortcuts or destroy opponents, but games like Blur or Split/Second did this way better.
