Or atleast love screaming at you. This game is more of a Bullet Hell Lite though, Still great fun but with none of the insane difficulty of a screen full of things really trying to kill you. \n\nGameplay-wise, this game handles with all the grace and maneuverability of a twin-stick shooter... So, depending on how good you are at them great to middling. I always manage to lose my grip on one of the control sticks whenever I play, but I still manage to suvive somehow.\n\nGraphically, the screen-shots speak for themselves. Bright, vibrant colours, varied enemies and stages, a third thing... I think this is one of the prettiest games that I own.\n\nThe music in this game matches the gameplay perfectly, so much so that I forget sometimes that the sound effects and the musical score are seperated.\n\n\nI may be somewhat biased in this review, because I have always been a sucker for games like this, but I do fully recommend this game if you enjoy pretty colours with a laid-back feel... Well, as laid back as a Bullet Hell game can be.\n\n\n\nA small bit of self promotion now, I have a Youtube channel where I do Let's Plays, and this game just happens to be one of the games that I have done on it. Who would've thought it? Anyway, if you want to see some gameplay footage of this game, please check out my Let's Play of it here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frDdujwgOo8"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1454276528, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513889", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "20882073", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011289000", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1454246151, "num_games_owned": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 495}, "timestamp_updated": 1454276528, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I recommend this but with one major caution, the score tables are not and have not been functional for approximately three years. Does this make it a bad game? For me no, but this is considered by many to be an essential feature of this type of game. I did contact the developer about this and he responded quickly and did say that he still intends to fix this, but three years really is a long time for anyone to wait. Still I have to credit Charlie for this!\n\nThe game itself is good. Not one of the absolute best twin stick shooters in my opinion but well above par for the most part. For casual twin stick players it may well appeal far more than some other twin stick games that I would consider better. If you are just after a fun casual blast then download the demo and if you like it and are not bothered by the high scores issue then get it, you probably won't regret it.\n\nFor twin stick pros cracks do start to appear in the execution of the play mechanics. The expert mode relies on chasing down the gun power-ups in order to give the metered close combat bomb attack a chance to recharge a little, when it runs out you will die on the expert stages. This would work perfectly if you could actually see with any amount of ease where the power-ups are, the little glowing yellow icon is lost amongst a sea of glowing yellow bullets. This combined with power-ups not spawning from the bomb attack and coming from any random enemy mean that you can easily kill the one with the much needed drop via the bomb instead of shooting it. The end result being that it comes down to luck rather than a tactical deployment of your weapons and skill. So close to being great but ultimately flawed...\n\nSome other problems have become apparent too. I can't unlock the third exit from level 3c, even though my combo was 106 above the third level requirement. This seems broke so any achievement hunters are going to have a problem getting the \u201cMr Perfect\u201d award. Likewise I can't unlock the challenge for this stage on either normal or expert setting despite having spent more time repeating this stage than I spent unlocking all the other 42 challenges available in the game. This again seems either broke or a very misjudged difficulty spike.\n\nAll in all a good and enjoyable game with some issues that stop if from being a truly great one."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1403495947, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502088", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "10694989", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197995966848", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1436083321, "num_games_owned": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1153}, "timestamp_updated": 1403495947, "received_for_free": false, "review": "An enjoyable bullet hell experience for people who are horrible at bullet hell games.\n\nIt's tons of fun and challenges add tons of replay value.

The principle is the same as it's always been: kill tons of enemies and avoid bazillions of missiles. Screens are confined by boundaries so the action is tight and restricted and incredibly intense. Its main gimmick, like Waves, is a slightly overpowered special attack which kills anything within a small radius around your ship.  Each level lasts about 40-60 seconds. Most enemies have one hit-point but with power-ups aplenty the usual sight is to see a monumental stream of bullets issuing forth from your ship and swarms of enemies exploding into smithereens. \n\n[u] PRESENTATION & DESIGN [/u]\nThe start-screen doubles as the level-select screen so moving your ship to the right scrolls through and uncovers the map of levels. Be warned though, it's a badly designed mess with no explanation or description given as to how navigating through the game actually works. Sound is a mixed bag as well; pumping, trance-like tunes get you into the zone but while in the menus the peculiar soundtrack coughs and splutters like a badly distorted fart. Graphics are fine, comparing similarly to the game's closest competitor, Mutant Storm Reloaded. The progression system in Scoregasm is disorientating to say the least. You get a score at the end but this gets lost to a broken online connection. However the high-score, best combo score and rank (S, A, B, C, D, E and F) for each individual level, if beaten, are stored and can be viewed on the stats page afterwards. \n\n[u] CONCLUSION [/u]\nScoregasm still remains one of the most intense Asteroids-inspired / twin-stick shoot \u2018em ups of all time. Clearing tricky levels by a split second through skill and dexterity is always greeted with satisfying relief. Although it may not have the polish and class of a Geometry Wars it gets a lot more things right than other games of this ilk such as Bullet Candy, Gran Vitreous or Death Ray Manta. On the other hand it would benefit from giving the player the option to play individual levels (like in Mutant Storm Reloaded). The alternative Challenge levels are also too ridiculously tough for casual players. Still, the sheer enjoyment gained from the main part of the game is immense and largely makes up for these minor quibbles.\n\n3/5\n\n\nFor the full review of this and other games please check out or follow my curator page at:\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26108770-Parsons%27-Garden/]Parsons' Garden[/url]"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1406476847, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502598", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11435726", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197966998424", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1433025640, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 160}, "timestamp_updated": 1406476847, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This satisfies the crave for wacky Shmups gamers - \n\n[b] Pros: [/b] \n- Very Responsive controls and intuitive play style.\n- Levels and difficulty unlocked by how good the player performs on the previous stage.\n- Very Creative set of level themes and boss designs.\n- That music gets stuck in your head.\n- Plenty of levels to go through including bonus difficulty sets (Unlockable by.....)\n- A clear feeling of scoregasm when the target hit is achieved (You'll see in the video)\n\n[b] Cons (Mostly Nitpick): [/b] \n- At times very hard to see what hits you (Especially during the target hit moment)\n- Wishing for more power ups\n- Could have gone further with the witty messages from the commander. \n- Leaves me wanting more music tracks.\n\n\nThe game can give you a vibe close to Every Extend Extra crossed with a Tohou game but slicker in graphic and level design.\nIve done a quick title check of this game at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI8K2GLEiGc \n\nDefinitely worth a shot for maximum Shmup scoregasm !"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1412220239, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500447", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "12321574", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198134539767", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1430151863, "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 300}, "timestamp_updated": 1412220239, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Awesome game, loads of level variety and lots of very interesting challanges, excellent difficulty progression, very nice controles.\n\nI Do recommend this game!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1474736175, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501134", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "25674270", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198041017157", "num_reviews": 49, "last_played": 1480126027, "num_games_owned": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1032}, "timestamp_updated": 1474736595, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Very fun twin-stick shooter, amongst the best I've played.\n\nThe goal is to survive long enough, all while trying to get the best score, hence the name.  If you've gotten enough points, you can enter some Frenzy mode, where enemies go all out and further increase your score.  Depending on your performance, you unlock paths to new levels, categorized by difficulties.\n\nThe big twist in the controls is the Close Range Pulse Attack, an explosion that destroys enemy ships and bullets, which uses your energy bar that can only be replenished by letting it recharge or blasting away enough bullets, absorbing their energy.  This explosive attack is of utmost importance in your success, as it can get really tense when enemies start cornering you as you desperately try to manage your energy, and there's an heavy risk/reward factor, which helps boosting your score further.  It's a very fun mechanic.\n\nThere are 43 levels, all of which are set on 3 lanes, ranging from easy, normal, and hard.  Each of them has a Combo Medal to get and a Challenge with a specific objective, like leading an enemy mouse through a maze for cheese.  You can also unlock Expert Mode, where enemies leave an explosion of bullets upon death, making things much harder.  The game keeps your best scores for each levels, so part of the fun is trying to do even better in each one of those.  There's a massive amount of replay value.  An issue though is that the online leaderboards doesn't work anymore, and there's little sign that it'll ever come back, but I honestly paid little to no mind to it, and Holy Christ Challenge 2B is one of my worst experiences in my gaming life.\n\nThe presentation is stellar.  The use of bright colors, reflective surfaces, intricate patterns of flashy bullets (such as big waves-like motions), and a varied array of strange enemies like DNAs and happy faces, gives the game a great art style and an unique identity, it's fun to just look at the action going onscreen.  The electronic soundtrack also is fantastic, sporting a variety of styles; the main menu has this ominous feeling to it, and \"Tower Of One\" feels like shit's about to go down, but then \"The Revenge Theme\" has this much more upbeat vibe.\n\nI'm very glad I got the chance to try this game out, it even made me interested in Charlie's Games' other works.
