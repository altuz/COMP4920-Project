The interface is dreadful, particularly for the inventory, a collection of tiny indistinguishable icons with no labels or tooltips or anything. Puzzles tend to be poorly placed and are tedious and overcomplicated. The idea of multiple characters is interesting, but ends up being more of a hassle than anything, with each character locked out of certain tasks and a need to call Nancy between each and have her call the next person to take the case.\n\nStill, for all its problems, it's rarely a hassle for long and drops entertaining new conversations on you often enough to keep you going.

This game has so much potential. The writers did a great job with the themes, the characters, and the storyline, but this game is so frustrating for all the wrong reasons. ND games can provide a little frustration in the form of challenging puzzles, but that's not the problem here. The puzzles are great! Heck, I went out of my way to play the mini-game in the ice cream parlor multiple times. Sadly, it's the whole mulitple detectives thing that screws it up. Switching between them and driving around gets really tedious fast. Although I did enjoy the different reactions you get from suspects depending on who is asking the questions. Based on the trailer I thought this game would be fun due to the good old fashioned detective work. Filling in the board and gathering fingerprints looked like fun. Yet, switching the characters around kills it because you constatly have to go through Nancy. The backgrounds are nice, but are undone by the very repetitive soundtrack. Trying to advance really feels like a chore sometimes. \n\nI want to like this game. I want to recommend it, but I can't. I'm neutral. While the story saves it from being an awful game, there are much better ND games out there (like Shadow at the Water's Edge). If you really loved the books, you might like this game due to the hometown setting and familiar characters. If you want to play every ND game, go ahead.

The setting seems pretty cool at first but gets repetitive traveling by car from location to location. The locations you do go to are fairly small with not a lot to do, most of the game is running between 3 different locations, retreiving one item, going back to the police station to drop off the item for Nancy, have Nancy analyze it, then trade off to another character... You are Nancy's errand boy in this game. The running back and forth (you use multiple characters outside the jail, and one can be more capable than another at certain tasks) makes the environment less immersive than past games. I prefer the more exotic locations, not boring suburbia. \nWhile at first the ability to play multiple characters  outside of Nancy (Ned, Bess, George) sounds new and different, I agree with a previous review that it gets very tedious very quickly. You have to go through Nancy everytime to make a switch, you can't switch freely between characters. \nThis game had less puzzles than previous games, and was furthered more by conversation/dialogue prompts. Add that into the fact that you have to leave each location, get in a car, watch the car travel to a new location, and then talk to the character at the location...it becomes boring. \nOverall I'd say the plot and environment of this game is weaker than others. This is probably my least favorite ND game that I've played, and was shorter than some of the others. \n$6.99 is not a terrible price for the game however, and if you're a fan of ND and want to try it out anyway, you should.\n\nLastly, the puzzle in Alexei's shop murdered my eyeballs.
