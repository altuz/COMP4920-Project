Game mechanics are fine. Sometimes there are even puzzles with more than one solution, because you can [b]bomb your own way forward[/b] (i mean, literally - you make path in terrain with your bombs).  Even though I suffered frustration, I blame my fat clumsy fingers more than the game itself. \n\nNot a long game, though, 8 maps pieces, 28 levels. You can finish it in about 5 hrs. \n+ Community maps. Over 100 of them. \n\nIf you are into Achievements, you can make most of them easily - 12/13, 92%. \nHowever... if you want to collect all 100 percent, there are people who say it took about 3 more hours, but I still believe you have to be buddhist monk with russian acrobat skills and timing of a p0*nstar. The horror part is you see you [b]can[/b] do it, but then you make a tiny, tiny mistake..."}]}
