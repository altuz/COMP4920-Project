For me, one of the biggest things was the change of pace. I prefer the faster paced gameplay opposed to the slower one seen in the base game. I also enjoyed how they gave you even more of an incentive to collect the manuscript pages now, as they unlocked weapon crates not just in the story mode, but also the arcade more. Amongst other things I also enjoyed how the controls were smoother in [i]American Nightmare[/i]. Now when you go to pick up items or trade weapons, you don't have to worry about holding the button down and it dropping your input, or Alan just deciding to derp around and not pick up the weapon.\n\nThere's nothing I can really say that I disliked about the game. I feel like the story was good, the gameplay was on point, the manuscript/tv/radio collectables were all to standard and so on. I would have to say, that if you were a fan of the base game for it's style, this isn't the game for you. This feels more like an action/adventure game then a thriller like the first game. It's much faster paced, which like I said, doesn't match the first game. I would also point out this game is much lighter in both brightness and atmosphere. Taking you out of the [i]Alan Wake[/i] element and putting you into this new action/adventure [i]Alan Wake[/i].\n\nI would [b]DEFINITELY[/b] recommend this game to someone who would enjoy seeing [i]Alan Wake[/i] in a faster paced environment!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506192981, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504505", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35161338", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198041998485", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1506192355, "num_games_owned": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 200, "playtime_forever": 234}, "timestamp_updated": 1506192981, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you enjoyed the original Alan Wake and want to see conclusion to the story, go ahead with this expansion.
