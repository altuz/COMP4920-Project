The nice add to this title is the camapign map which is played like Mount & blade system, all in real time, where you can recruit & upgrade your army, and also trade and seige castles, and many other things. There are RPG elements which are good add, you can enhance your hero abilities and thus can be reflected on your army or other aspects of the game, siege battles are fine but could be better. Graphics and overall atmosphere are great for such theme.\nHowever, the campaign map adds a lot as I mentioned previously, but the excution is really poor, the campign map feels so buggy, not realistic at all,for example robbers are like organized kingdom army that can crush you, the trade system feels unreal, the upgrade could be much better, and after sometimes you will feel extreamly bored from campaing and you just want to play those epic historic battles which were in Real Warfare 1242, thats why I would give 6 just because of the campaign, and I think if they make it like Total War game campaing but in real time it will be much better"}, {"votes_down": 19, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1390173255, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505564", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "8776256", "votes_up": 30, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197979293676", "num_reviews": 37, "last_played": 1469136144, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 15368}, "timestamp_updated": 1392381140, "received_for_free": false, "review": "AWESOME war game ( early Middle Age in East Europe ) ,  great RTS : long campaing,  random maps , random battles , several battle types ,  sevaral factions .... not wasted money .
