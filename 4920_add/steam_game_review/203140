Some may argue that it is not a \"true Hitman game,\" but that doesn't mean it isn't fun as heck to play! [/h1] \n+ Great level design with plenty to explore, challenges to complete, and options on how to approach targets\n+ Responsive controls and mechanics\n+ Graphically, it looks great\n~ Storyline was meh, but it was enough to tie each mission to the next\n- I didn't find \"contracts mode\" all that great\n\n[h1] Comparison to Hitman: Blood Money [/h1]\n+ [u] Disguise effectiveness: [/u] In Absolution, NPCs with the same disguise as you can slowly see through your camouflage.  In Blood Money (BM), a disguise basically gave you unquestioned approved access to some areas.  Although many disliked this change, I found it to make things more engaging, challenging, and a tad more realistic.\n+ [u] Instinct bar: [/u] The ability to see through walls, fool NPCs by blending in, and shoot in rapid succession was a pretty cool feature.  Admittedly, it was very over-powered on normal mode since you had near-unlimited use of it and the game gave you too obvious of mission hints.  However, I found its limited use in higher difficulties a lot more balanced (I recommend playing through on \"Hard\").\n~ [u] Level variety: [/u] This was a hit-and-miss for me.  In BM, all missions pretty much followed the same format: you have a giant puzzle box of a level and it is up to you to find one of many various ways of getting in, assassinating your target, and getting out.  In Absolution, some levels follow that formula, but others involve some non-lethal objectives.  Some of these levels were a great break from the mould, but others felt less than stellar in their linearity.\n~ [u] Challenges: [/u] I rather enjoyed the lists of challenges for each level, but at the same time the way they were presented took a bit away from the magic of discovering a creative kill on your own.\n- [u] Checkpoint vs. save system: [/u] This was my major gripe with Absolution.  In BM, you could save checkpoints wherever you wanted throughout a level.  Based on your difficulty, you could checkpoint a certain number of times.  THIS WAS AN AWESOME SYSTEM.  In Absolution, checkpoints really took away from your ability to take risks and explore different options since you might have to end up doing a time-consuming section of the level over and over."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505992880, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511771", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35102209", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971880699", "num_reviews": 71, "last_played": 1505992524, "num_games_owned": 1803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 61, "playtime_forever": 1264}, "timestamp_updated": 1505992880, "received_for_free": false, "review": "\nDuration: 20 hours for main campaign.\n\nFirst Time Played. \n\nThis is a fine game.

Neither do the contracts, which are missions played on the same map where you try to maximise your score.

For a game that came out 5 years ago (upon writing this review in 2017), I'm utterly surprised at just how great everything still looks. There is so much detail in every level, right down the leaves on the trees. Bump mapping used properly making the \"shine\" on each piece of texture look realistic, whether it be a light shining off of a concrete floor, or Agent 47's reflective head due to being wet. It all looks fantastic. Well Done.\n\n\nSound/Music: 9/10\n=============\nOur classic hitman theme is intact and still sounds great. Other scores of music introduced fit well into the presented levels. Sound effects all sound fantastic, from walking down a street/carpet/wood service to the guns firing and richocheting off walls. Excellent +9\n\n\nPerformance: 9/10\n=============\nGame ran fine for the most part, with zero crashes during my playthrough. +5\n\nRuns great in Windowed mode. +2\n\n60 FPS on a good machine. +2\n\n\nStory: 3/10\n========\nNo point in a brief synopsis for this one. It's just terrible. There is an attempt at a story, which is good, but the writing is attrocious. +5 for effort\n\nCollege level cinematography during cutscenes. Possibly worse. -1\n\nAll characters are boring and dull, even Agent 47. There is little to no personality to anyone other than the game's antagonist. Regardless, you'll find yourself not liking or hating anyone. It's just boring. -1\n\n\nGameplay: 4/10\n===========\nYou are a Hitman. You get to kill your targets throughout various levels in different ways, depending upon certain variables for each level. Some levels are less open than others. +4\n\nNo Uplay required. +1\n\nFor the levels that have many different options, it's great. Maybe you'll garrote your target in a darkened alley because they decided to take a piss without their bodyguards. Or maybe you'll just shoot them in an open street with a pistol while fireworks are going off. It's up to you! +4\n\nSome levels in this version of the game have very strict requirements on how you proceed, which is honestly annoying for a hitman game. This was a downer for me. -1\n\nClimbing on walls gets \"stuck\" sometimes and you won't be able to shimmy left or right. You'll just be stuck, hindering you from a path you chose to take in whichever level it may or may not be required in. Very annoying. -1\n\nThe AI is dumb as fuck. This AI is worse than RE5 Sheva (for those that understand that reference). I understand that the AI is basically a computer thats been programmed to function a certain way. That being said, the way the AI acts is just like a computer, but it shouldn't be. It should be more fluid, and even forgiving at times. If one guy spots you, then (sometimes instantaneously), all enemies in a given area will suddenly \"sync up\" like a bunch of women on their menstrual cycles and they'll all know where you are, and begin shooting at you (or running from you if civilians). Also during this chaotic situation, sometimes the AI will turn and attack each other. I shit you not that in a very level, a guard spotted me, the \"sync up\" happened, then this same guard turned away from me and started shooting his buddies, all while they continued to shoot me. Wtf Developers. -2\n\n(If you found that comparison above offensive, get over it. It's a joke. Laugh and enjoy life.)\n\nEnemies have super Hearing and sometimes super Sight, seeing right through walls and containers/closets. Yes, this is a bug. -1\n\n\n\nOverall: 7/10 (35/50 = 0.7)\n===================\nYes, the game's score gets a 7/10, but I still don't recommend it. A pretty looking turd that doesn't smell bad is still a turd. This game runs well, but functions horribly. Go play Blood Money instead. I have yet to try the episodic Hitman, but I'm officially skeptical after completing this one.
