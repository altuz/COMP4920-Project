This was in big part because of Lara herself. She was more or less a man with boobs, offering very little in any sense of actual character beyond the action hero with two guns and an unbreakable attitude. I was always left soured by the lack of depth to the character and lack of actually feeling she was human.\n\nThat all changed with this game. Some complained she was too whiny, too much of the helpless woman in this game. That is hardly the truth, heck- at  no point from start to finish it did seem Lara was at all, weak. Regardless of having self-doubt and making mistakes- all that did was make her appear far more life-like and opened up a massively missing human side to the character. This Lara is the best Croft ever created, on any medium. She is strong, but still a woman. She isn't scared to be afraid, yet she goes on. Isn't that the truest definition of courage? She is one of the best game protagonists I've ever had the pleasure of playing in a game. Absolutely brilliant.\n\nThe graphics were stunning and the character models were fantastic, even by the standards of 2017 compared to its release in 2014. Lara herself was perfect. Healthy, strong without seeming manly. Her movement was great and her face was utterly beautiful without looking like an overdone plastic barbie doll. TBH, I found her very compelling and it was a pleasure to watch her interact with every cut scene.\n\nThe game-play was incredible, if not nerve wrecking at point; but you got used too it. It was heart-pumping almost the entire time, that when it was quiet ... you got nervous. The action was amazing, reviling the best Hollywood blockbuster in its scale and scope. \n\nThe only downside to the game can be Lara's movement; trying to just jump on a small crate or rock can be annoying at times, but you adjust- much like you had too with Witcher 3.\n\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played. Bar-none.\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507106977, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504902", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35466507", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198103838482", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1507106715, "num_games_owned": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 819, "playtime_forever": 819}, "timestamp_updated": 1507106977, "received_for_free": false, "review": "easy review . buy and play !"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504717658, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34779420", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198172092483", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506448981, "num_games_owned": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 54, "playtime_forever": 2385}, "timestamp_updated": 1504717658, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The graphics are absolutely amazing and I would definately recommend this game to anyone who enjoys action adventure games."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504804084, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34798491", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198338961636", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1506668732, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "playtime_forever": 380}, "timestamp_updated": 1504804084, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Love this game, as with all the Tomb Raider Series.
