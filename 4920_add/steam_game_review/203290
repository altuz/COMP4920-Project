Boy was i... wrong? You see, this game is nothing revolutionary, but i just can't not like it, i don't know why.\n\nThe 3 main reasons i play this game are not what you would expect:\n\n1 - The community. This community is amazing, no exageration. Everybody is nice, people actually talk quite often, i've met and seen about 5-6 cool guys in my 4 hours i played this game the first day i got it.\n\n2 - The viewmodel and crosshair. If you played CS:GO before, you will love them. They just feel and look so good, you don't have your weapon shoved in your face, and the crosshair is nice and clean, excellent.\n\n3 - The gameplay. It's actually pretty good, and fun too, you would expect a low killtime in this game, but that's not the case. You can revive teammates 2 times! And you can heal your 'bleeding' damage with bandages.\n\nThe only complaints i have:\n-Not many people playing, i sometimes can't find a server close to me with players on it.\n-And the fact that i got my first kill after i died like 8 times. In other games i get my first kill first, then my first death, here it was VERY hard to get my first kill, as there is no tutorial shoved in your face when you start the game for the first time, you have to look for it to find it, so yeah, i didn't look for it.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a game really worth trying out!\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485459690, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29507905", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247935986", "num_reviews": 31, "last_played": 1487904085, "num_games_owned": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 154}, "timestamp_updated": 1485459690, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Possibly the best free FPS there is."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1487180302, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514163", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 11, "recommendationid": "29946001", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198321102733", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1496662149, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3114}, "timestamp_updated": 1487180302, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good community, apart from some french guy screaming on the mic.\nFun.\nServers are either full russian/german/english\n"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486204363, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472502", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29689690", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198354171692", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1504204153, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 23546}, "timestamp_updated": 1486463617, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is the best free FPS game you can experience really nice realistic motions.

Uninstalling.\n\nI used to play version 2 of this game and even after they added PunkBuster to it, it still was full of hackers. After 10 years I gave this new version a try and they still use PunkBuster. Hackers just block PBScreenShots while running their hacks and don't get kicked or banned for it on official servers. The only chance of you having a remotely hack free experience is by playing the servers that use the ACI on top of PB as these servers actually ban for not producing screen shots and actively administrate their servers. \n\nThe game doesn't allow the players to vote kick any player anymore since it's been \"abused\" in the past. And when you do come across someone blatantly hacking there is nothing you can do, other then trying to teamkill and even then you'll get sent to Leavenworth and be banned from the server for 5 or so minutes. The game literally doesn't give you any means of fighting against it.\n\nFor those who'd like to tell me to \"git gud\" thinking I was probably owned by some very experienced players who know these maps in and out, save your breath. I have just gotten out of a match with a hacker getting kills from across the map with a pistol and running around finding people within the first minute even if I hid in the least expected locations. When he was being flashed and teamkilled once people realized he cheated he'd leave, change his name and come back.\n\nTo the people saying this game gives a realistic military experience I'd like to ask when have you seen a sniper be successfully used by the military in close quarter combat to snipe enemies off from behind a corner while standing/crouching? The sniper class is even more OP in this version then it was in version 2. There is not enough aimpoint sway when standing/crouching and you have a hold breath button on top of that making the aimpoint freeze in place while you stand. Doesn't seem realistic to me."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486669991, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504633", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "29808908", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052800435", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505785068, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "playtime_forever": 7923}, "timestamp_updated": 1486669991, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Welcome to the Army guys! This game is used as a recruitment tool for the U.S Army, I was a little skeptical to try this game since it is a \u201crecruitment tool\u201d and being a Navy veteran myself I know how \u201cGung Ho\u201d those tools are. Between every match there is a short video explaining different parts of the Army and what they do, that\u2019s where the recruitment ends! Once you start playing there isn\u2019t any advertisements or annoying facts. The game itself is incredibly entertaining, you are split up into different teams (Alpha, and Bravo), There are certain mission types like defuse the C4, ambush VIP, extract classified documents, and several more. \n\nThis game is focused in TEAMWORK, if you land in a great team where everyone talks and plans their routes it can be incredibly fun, but if you are in a team where people just rush out without coordinating you will have a frustrating time, this is not a game you can \u201cSOLO\u201d. \n\nNow where this game truly stands out for me is the community, for the most part the people you will meet are polite, helpful, and just fun to play with. Most servers have rules against racism, vulger language, and exploits, those rules are ENFORCED! It all adds up to a great community to play with and once you get into the rhythm the hours will fly on by. I found myself spending hours completing challenges just so I could get a cool looking skin for my M24.\nOnly drawback for me was that I was hoping for a more diverse selection of weapons but IT IS A FREE GAME, so I cannot complain too much. \n\n\n9/10\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486602464, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503403", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29792556", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198276408569", "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1496154964, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 287}, "timestamp_updated": 1486602464, "received_for_free": false, "review": "decent army game"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486909572, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500915", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29874215", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198126854628", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1486999897, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 13461}, "timestamp_updated": 1486909572, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Best FPS Dianamic."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1488300612, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508250", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "30243754", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198089271804", "num_reviews": 51, "last_played": 1488300506, "num_games_owned": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 234}, "timestamp_updated": 1488300612, "received_for_free": false, "review": "In this game two commands.
