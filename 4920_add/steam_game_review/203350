It's cheap. It offers a lot of play time. But at the same time the time actually spent with the game is rather boring and it's worse than the 2 predecessors, so \"meh\".\n\nAnyone who has played King's Bounty and Armored Princess will feel right at home after starting up the game. And this is exactly wherein the problem lies. It's just more of the same. I pretty much completed all of the side quests I encountered and battled all the enemies I could find, and in the end I clocked in about 50 hours, which is WAY too much for what the game offers: moronic side quests and the same fights over and over again. Heck, there is pretty much nothing new in this game. All the mechanics are the same, the troops are the same (the only new troops are the Vikings I think...and a few \"icy\" reskins of existing troops). Instead of a demon box or a baby dragon you now get help from heavenly valkyries (which you unlock throughout the game), but the abilites aren't really all that interesting or new. Oh, your warriors now level up after a while...up to level 10. The bonuses they get are quite substantial later on (10% more HP for example and several points in attack, defense, crit, heal, etc.), which is on the one hand pretty cool and on the other pointless, since you will need to exchange your troops eventually. Viking troops will not readily be available for a long time for example. Same happens to human troops later on. This is quite irritating of course.\n\nThe quests have you running from one end of the world to the next way too often. I think half the time of the campaign I spent backtracking and retracing my steps. At least you can still put notes on the map. It's really not so bad in the beginning, when you can sail to individual islands, but once you get to the mainland...and then Demonis...oh my, fuck you Demonis and your stupid elevators. You might wonder why we're back in Demonis...well, that's the whole mainland and Demonis are reskinned as well. I didn't even know this was taking place on the same world. It's all a bit confusing, but basically this is King's Bounty the Legend with a few additions. Armored Princess/Crossworlds was better by far. Even some of the bosses have been rehashed.\n\nThen there are the bugs and constant crashes and no auto-save feature. Do yourself a favour and press F5 every few seconds. The game pretty much crashed once every hour on average. Only get this if you really want more King's Bounty...and devs? Please, for the love of God, if you don't speak English well, hire someone who does. The dialogue is terribly written, the quests are mostly boring stuff and spelling and grammar are atrocious. Not to mention that somehow you've managed to write the names of characters in 2 or 3 different ways in ONE dialogue window! How? That's a really unpolished product in that regard."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501610764, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503497", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33954331", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198033978802", "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1501610660, "num_games_owned": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4089}, "timestamp_updated": 1501610764, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Crashes and quest bugs."}]}
