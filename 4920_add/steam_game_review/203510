The problem is its combat mechanism is sometimes horribly hardcore... I am playing on easy (after one or two chapter with normal) and it is still difficult like 2D kawaii dark soul.\n1. In some narrow places, two yellow slimes are unbreakable as hell if you are alone. \n2. Crowd control monsters such as mothbees are OP as hell. If there are two of them or more, they can put you whole team on slumber. they can sting everyone once or twice, and spray more goddarn sleep mist... and the CC duration is so long that  \nI can go grab a beer and finish it, and Arche might still be sleeping. There isn't something that helps against CC skill it seems.\n3.Cannot customize arrow key.\n\nDespite defects above, the mainplot I have played so far is pretty solid. There are lots of funny dialogues and side characters  and bring dfferent chararcters triggers different reactions sometimes, too. It requires some grinding through character levels and better equipments to smoothe the gameplay, though."}]}
