How long would the cakes and cookies in Starbucks stave off my hunger?  Would I really be lucky enough to be in a mall when the zombie apocalypse strikes?\n\nThese are the sorts of questions that keep me up at night but rarely do I have the same thoughts about other supernatural beasties.       If I\u2019m out at night and there\u2019s a full moon, I don\u2019t check my pockets for silver bullets.\nOn the rare occasion that I\u2019ve seen a bat, I don\u2019t reach for the crucifix and the garlic.\n\nWerewolves and Vampires don\u2019t stalk my waking thoughts but zombies...  the \u201cwhat if\u201d of the undead apocalypse is always there, shambling beneath the surface of my mind.... but enough of my problems...\n\n\n[b]Apathetic Fanatic[/b]\n\nSeemingly random questions at the start of reviews are great, but why am I sharing my aversion to puzzle games and my unhealthy zombie obsession?\nIt\u2019s because these particular personal preferences have presented me with a dilemma.\nYou see  I\u2019m about to play through a game called \u201cContainment\u201d, a zombie themed puzzler which means I should both love it and be completely disinterested at the same time...  \n\n\n[b]Survival Flavour[/b]\n\nContainment certainly takes an interesting twist on the puzzle genre, instead of having colourful gems, blocks, fruits etc. to play with, here your puzzle pieces are zombies and survivors.\nThe survivors themselves come in various different flavours from chainsaw wielding punks to gun toting cops.\nEach level presents you with a block of these survivors and some zombies mixed in for good measure. If you do nothing the zombies will infect the survivors around them, turning them into zombies too!\n\nThis encourages you to play through quickly, spend too much time mulling over your decisions and your group of survivors will turn into a shambling horde, so expect some frantic and rushed decision making as you play.\n\n\n[b]Shuffle Around[/b]\n\nThe game mechanic itself is a fairly simple one, you swap the positions of the different survivors by clicking on them, and your goal is to reposition the survivors in such a way that a zombie is surrounded by the same survivor type.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve got a zombie that already has a couple of redneck survivors standing next to it, you\u2019d quickly want to scan the closest survivors for more rednecks, if there are some close by, you\u2019d start clicking on them to slide them into position around the zombie.\nAs soon as our red necked buddies have the walker surrounded, they\u2019ll take it down.\nThat\u2019s one less to worry about, time to move on to the next.\nIt\u2019s a simple rinse and repeat formula that makes this, like most other puzzle games, quick to learn, initially addictive but ultimately a little repetitive.\n\n\n[b]Touches[/b]\n\nThere are lots of nice touches in Containment.\nDifferent survivors have different attack animations when they take down a zombie, it\u2019s a fairly simple thing, but this variation really does add to the experience, you\u2019ll find yourself looking forward to taking a zombie out with a group of survivors you haven\u2019t \u201cexperienced\u201d yet.\n\nWhen you complete a level, instead of the screen fading to black then loading in the next challenge, the camera will move away from your last victory and rush through the city until it focuses on the next group of survivors waiting for your point and click salvation.\n\n\n[b]Migraine Free[/b]\n\nWith regards to the aesthetics, it\u2019s refreshing to play a puzzler that isn\u2019t all bright primary coloured eye candy and flashing lights.\nContainment knows its setting and has a palette appropriate for its post apocalyptic theme.\nEverything is pretty good looking too in its own top down, mostly static kind of way.\n\n\n[b]This isn\u2019t just any puzzle game...[/b]\n\nThis is a refreshing entry into the genre and one which I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would.\nIt avoids the migraine inducing bright cheeriness which infects most other puzzlers, it\u2019s gritty, it gives a nice \u201cend times\u201d vibe and if you\u2019re in the mood it can be genuinely fun to play.\n\nIs it the sort of game that will make me want to rush through my working day to get back home and play?\n\nNo, puzzle games don\u2019t do that for me, too shallow, remember, but it is a fun distraction in short bursts and one which I\u2019ll definitely load up again.\n\n\n[b]This is a post apocalyptic puzzle game.[/b]\n\nIf puzzle \"match up\" games are your thing and you\u2019re looking for something a little different in the genre, then Containment should fit the bill.\nIt\u2019s a stylish, quick hit, post apocalyptic puzzler and there aren\u2019t many games you can say that about!\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit [url=http://www.review-well.com/] review-well.com [/url]"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1423456080, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512646", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "14398441", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198006176581", "num_reviews": 109, "last_played": 1500016210, "num_games_owned": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1595}, "timestamp_updated": 1423456080, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you like matching games and if you like zombies, then this game is for you.
