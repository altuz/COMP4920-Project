I've seen others with Nvidia cards having similar issues. So far the only thing that seems to improve things is having the video in windowed mode rather than full screen.\n\nI quite enjoy this as a simple kart racer in time trial mode or racing with friends, however the criticisms you will read in the reviews are valid. Your ability to win races is almost totally dependant upon getting the right power up. It would be so much better if there were more options on controlling powerups - a race planning window with tick boxes for the various powerups would be ideal so you could eliminate the overpowered ones or even race without power ups at all.\n\nIf it didn't crash and had some better options I'd recommend it but unfortunately can't. It's a pity."}]}
