Absolutely not the case.\n\nAlso, having consistent DLC is fine, but they MUST know that it's way too expensive for what it does, which ultimately is just to tide players over until the next one and really doesn't add much at all (or should have been part of the base game in the first place)."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506182589, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506037", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35157382", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198023082933", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1495400319, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 8999}, "timestamp_updated": 1506182589, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Where to begin...this is a legacy game with the most advanced political system I've ever seen in a game. Your goal is to accumulate the most points through the years, which means you may be assassinating your current \"character\" in favor of a more worthy ruler. You'll marry to secure de jure claims on territory, and you'll get aggressive only to find your neighbors uniting to curb your bloodthirsty ways. You'll see a kingdom collapse and be frustrated because you just spent 100 years uniting the clans only to see some weaklings tear it apart. This isn't a conquering game (you can form a kingdom or even empire, but it's not easy, and you will NEVER conquer the map , if you try you'll see why).\n\nPros:\n- Complexity. Once I learned what I was doing, I was constantly arranging marriages, ferreting out naysayers, and so on. \n- Historical accuracy. You might inadvertently learn something. Detail is amazing\n- Musical scores\n- Endless gameplay styles. Incest, murder, intrigue, trickery, pagans, drumming up religious wars, blowing up a rival with an inn packed with explosive manure...\n\nCons:\n- Immense learning curve. The tutorial doesn't really begin to teach you what it takes. You'll think you have a line of succession only to find out your heir controls one county instead of five. There can be a very high degree of frustration with not knowing what's going on. I quit the game a few times before coming back. Finally, I set to it and began to get an idea of the diplomatic play and the lines of succession.\n- The AI plays unfair at times (like a tiny island with no ships and no army magically generating a heavily armed, monstrous sized religious army which must have flown or teleported there to aid it against your naval invasion, and with no income somehow maintaining that army for decades).\n- Sea to land attacks are horrific. You'll land 10,000 soldiers against 500 and somehow lose.\n\nSo, insane learning curve will drive you at first. Then you'll get rolling for a century only to get spanked, see it all fall apart, and quit again. Then you'll come back and begin to realize you like this game quite a bit.\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506466362, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506984", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "35231750", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039072088", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1507152046, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 490, "playtime_forever": 32982}, "timestamp_updated": 1506466362, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Not enough DLC."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506085496, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508069", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "35127330", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299840344", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1503117948, "num_games_owned": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 815}, "timestamp_updated": 1506085496, "received_for_free": false, "review": "1 start as a count of Iceland 1066 \n2 conquer the duke of Iceland\n3 start building stuff to get more men than your liege\n4 somehow conquer southern Ireland \n5 start conquering more of Ireland \n6 when you have half of Ireland wait for your liege to go to war \n7 liege goes to war against rike and rebels \n8 your chance is now for independence\n9 declare a war for independence \n10 win the war\n11 conquer all of Ireland \n12 become king of Ireland \n13 make Allie with england and Scottland \n14 live happily ever after until the Mongols invade"}]}
