You have multiple weapons to choose from and unlock more the further you progress. It is not a bullet hell as enemies fire reasonable amounts of projectiles, at least in the first two unlocked difficulties. You have a basic fire and two alt fires which you can switch between, all which can be switched for different unique weapons to make your ship like one of a kind. One shot will kill you if you don't pick up a shield power up but scraping into the environment will kill you regardless. One thing to be noted is that the game worked perfectly fine from the get go with my 360 pad even though it doesn't say that it has controller compatibility on the Steam page\n\nThe one thing that was weird with the controller was that you can not bind the pause button to it which  can be problematic. No dpad support either which is not too great considering the environments require pixel perfect navigation. On top of your already massive fire power you have a special rechargeable move which is really helpful against bosses. There is also powerups scattered around the level to further increase your damage and speed. All this makes you sound overpowered as heck, and you are actually pretty overpowered and the devs know it.  They will constantly sucker punch you with things you had no way to see coming instead of offering a fair challenge.\n\nYou are offered 9 continues each which grants you three lives a pop. Most of my deaths felt pretty cheap and made it into a trail and error type of game until you memorize the level. If you don't enjoy flying through very narrow insta-kill environments with little time to react this is not the game for you. Being only 7 levels long means having a high difficulty is kind of necessary but knowing that doesn't make it any less annoying when you have to traverse a ton of hazards, get sucker punched and have to repeat that section again. Each time you die you are thrown back into a previous checkpoint instead of simply respawning. It does lengthen the game and it does feel like an arcade game for better or worse.\n\nGraphics are nice and have a decent amount of detail to them. The explosions and debris flying around after you shoot down enemies look great as well.  It runs at 60fps which is another point in it's favor. Even the music is pretty catchy. Outside of the main mode you have a \u201cpractice\u201d mode where you can choose any level to play but you don't have any continues which makes it harder than playing through the actual game. Do not press the escape key or you will shut down the game. The key to pause the game is \u201cQ\u201d for some reason. This game does feature cool looking giant bosses but most get absolutely devastated when you use your special move making them kind of a pushover.\n\nSatazius is by no means a bad game. It's just that if you are expecting some fun shooting there is very little of that here. You will just be holding down the fire button and trying to navigate the environments which pose a far greater threat to you. And having to control your ship with the analog stick or keyboard makes it far more difficult than it should be. It is difficult and unfair but it is still fun to mix and match your weapons to blast through levels. Overall this is a solid title if you are in to arcade like shoot em ups and is recommended to those that can deal without a dpad."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1361429668, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501289", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "1925930", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197999823834", "num_reviews": 99, "last_played": 1446168273, "num_games_owned": 1773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 128}, "timestamp_updated": 1361429668, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I like horizontal shooters, but I've never really been a huge fan of how punishing the bullet-hell genre can be. \n\nThis game is a nice solution to that tiny problem.
