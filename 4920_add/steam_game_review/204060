However, playing (trying to play) Superbrothers on PC in 2017 was a very unpleasent experience for me. Oh, \"experience\" indeed. The puzzles are mostly silly (\"click a couple of object in a correct order, if you make a mistake - repeat\"), the majority of game is waiting for your character to walk from one area to another and infamous \"wait 11 days or cheat with your OS clock to proceed\" mechanism is, in my opinion, a failed experiment.\n\nThere are, of course, great pros to Sword & Sworcery, such as one of the most impressive pieces of pixel art made in the gaming history, great 80's-inspired sythwave music and clever writing. However, annoying attempts of adding some humor and teen-like quality to the dialogues (or rather - subjective pieces of narration) can be absolutely immerse-shattering for some. \n\nMy probably most hated feature was the constant reminder that I totally can and should twitt about my in-game progress. These suggestions were popping off in both dialogues and HUD. I should be able to decline once, not have this meta-garbage visible all the time whenever I play. I hated it.\n\nFor many people these issues are completely irrelevent and if you're one of those people, you may have a blast reaching for this piece of art. I'm glad I played it since I like pixel art a lot, but I wouldn\\t recommend it to anyone.

Everything is simple and minimalistic. The music is it's best feature, it really gives the game a sense of rhythm that I have not gotten from any other game since, except from Super Hexagon. \n\nThe story is simple, but quite enjoyable. It is also short, the entire story can be played entirely in a day if you really want to. It is divided in small chapters that last about 30 minutes each, so you can play one chapter each day if you don't have much time to sit down and play.\n\nThe game was developed to be played on a smartphone. Most of its gameplay mechanics are designed to be used with a touch screen, and there are some others that were designed to use the tilt controls from a phone. Because of this, the PC port doesn't play right. I prefered not to play the PC port, and play it again on my phone. That is why I have such a small play time on Steam.\n\nI definitely recommend anyone to play this. If you can, play it on your phone instead, the PC version is not as good. \n\nAlso remember to play it with headphones, audio really is a huge part of the experience."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503312427, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34392523", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198257006582", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1503309618, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 267}, "timestamp_updated": 1503312538, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a very cute game! I enjoyed it immensely, after the first ten or so minutes confusion about what the heck is going on. I had no idea what to expect but the laid-back language and the music drew me in pretty quickly. It becomes clear that the game is mostly about the mood, it has some easy musical puzzles and a half-told story, but for me, these all built up to a good little adventure. I will even re-play it for the rest of the achievements. :D I liked that it was a bit meta and the narration was pretty fun too. The pixel art is weird at first, mainly the characters but I got used to it quickly. I liked the dream mechanic and the lunar phase thing as well, especially that you have a way of going around the whole cheat or wait a lot thing. My fave part was jamming with Jim Guthrie by the fireplace. <3 The spectre thing was pretty scary and the fights were okay, if a bit too easy after I got the gist of them.

The first two hours were amazing - and obtuse point and click adventure that might be a bit too hipster for its own good (you can totally play this in your samon-pink shorts while sipping a dairy free vegan friendly latte in a poxy cereal cafe in Shorditch).  However, around the time you get the trigon the game really tanks, and puzzles stop being logical and more of CLICK EVERYTHING ON THE SCREEN TILL SOMETHING WORKS. which  sucks as its not really a puzzle anymore - its just wacka mole until somethng happens.  Oh, and don't get me started on the combat...\n\nBut all in all i would recommend this because it costs less then that non-dairy vegan friendly latte that you'll wanna drink when your playing this, and the music and art are gorgeous, like Gwen Stefani in the 1990s gorgeous, plus the good puzzles in the game, especially musical ones, are pretty cool.   And generally the writing and dialogue was witty and interesting, even if it is trying way too hard to hipster.

If you're looking for action and excitement, this is NOT for you...but, if you're looking for an interesting experience of a game with retro early 90s graphics, you'll probably want to give it a shot.\n\nGame play is mundane - a LOT of senseless walking, with a \"double click to move\" interface. Combat is literally non-existent except for certain checkpoint scenarios where you have to enter combat mode...which consists of clicking the shield or sword at the right moment, and nothing more. It's strictly a methodical game with moderately difficult puzzles to solve.\n\nThis game is the definition of \"linear.\" There is one path and one path only, and when you've finished this game, there is no purpose in ever playing through it again. Unfortunately, the only way to get the final achievement, and 100%, is to play through the game in its entirety twice, which is nothing short of a cruel joke and complete torture. \n\nExpect to finish the game in about 4-5 hours. With that being said - get \"Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP\" when it's at a deep discount only."}]}
