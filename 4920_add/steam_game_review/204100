Got pretty close to the end but a hard drive failure resulted in me having to start over (no cloud saves). It is testimony to how good the game is that I started over and played through again. This is not a FPS or a third person shooter in the usual way. This is more of an interactive movie with some cool gunplay and slow-mo shootouts al la the Matrix.\n\nThe story twists and turns and takes you through the world of the rich and the favelas of the poor. The game describes the setting as \"Bagdad with G-strings\" and that sums it up pretty well. Flash-backs flesh out the story and Max's own personal journey from the first games. The graphics are great, the sound is awesome and as long as you go in knowing it is an interactive movie you will enjoy the gameplay as well.\n\nThe whole game is fairly dark and definitely not one for the kiddies. Age rating are there for a reason and this game delivers on the adult rating being justified. The setting of certain sections of the game is \"adult\", the levels of violence and pretty much the entire feel and theme of the game make this not suitable for kids. I also doubt they will enjoy the story which is rich and details the fall of Max into depression and the corruption of his environment (trying to avoid spoilers here). I enjoyed the story but you get out what you put in. If you relate to Max and his situation then you will enjoy it. If you view Max as just a means for you to jump around in bullet time and make that sweet headshot, you might not enjoy it as much.\n\nLocations are varied and the gameplay changes up accordingly. Sniper sections, On rails (spoiler) ride. There are collectables which I didn't enjoy as looking for the gun parts took away the immersion for me.  The ending is fairly clich\u00e9 but it still managed to be satisfying.\n\nI didn't experience any crashes as other reviews have mentioned. Maybe try playing it on a PC and not a potato?\n\nIt is a good game and being able to slow-mo shoot a guy in the groin never gets old.

Since then he has retired from the NYPD and since became bodyguard to a family in the city of Sao Paulo.\n\nMax Payne 3 is a lot different from the other games in the series, for a start it was made by Rockstar, not Remedy, and the gameplay has evolved and changed quite a lot while still keeping the same overall feel as the previous entries in the series. Now with great gameplay often comes with the sacrifice of at least something else, this is where the story and soundtrack don't manage to be as great as the older games. The soundtrack isn't as memorable and the only pieces I did find to be pretty good were the last mission songs and the revised main theme of Max Payne. The story isn't as half as strong as 1 and 2 and it just isn't as engaging as it was in those games.\n\nBut in turn gameplay has been revised and edited for the better. Since Max is a little older than his previous incarnations in 1 and 2, he is much more slower than before which adds a sense of some realism to the feel of movement. As far as I've been able to see there are a lot more variety in the guns than 1 and 2 (although I could be high so hell if I know).\n\nThe biggest change overall has been the addition of multiplayer, which actually is quite good if you can manage to find other players online. The multiplayer is quite fun and they somehow managed to work the bullet-time system into it, adding a lot more diversity to it than in other muliplayer games. The maps are pretty good and such as well. But unfortunately it is really difficult to find anyone to play with, as this game's multiplayer is nearly dead. Maybe you could have some friends buy the game as well and do some deathmatches in multiplayer but it still doesn't cover up that the game's community is dead.\n\nOverall, this is still a worthy entry in the series, and while I personally prefer the older games to this it is still awesome to play through and explore some of the last chapters in Max Payne's sad life."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506586156, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506527", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35257032", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970331302", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1470148879, "num_games_owned": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 849}, "timestamp_updated": 1506637352, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ditching any semblance of parody that was present in the last two games, Max Payne 3 tells a straight-faced and not-very-good-story in a setting completely unrelated to the first two games with a polar opposite look and style. \"Crime\" and \"Brazil\" go together pretty well, but bright sunny environments do not mesh well with Max Payne. This isn't a tongue-in-cheek, dark and rainy Neo-Noir game, this is \"Max Payne Takes a Vacation (and shoots people while monologuing).\"\n\nThe iconic art style that helped to make Max Payne so unique is completely gone. Most notably, the graphic novel story segments have been replaced by long and sometimes tortuous cutscenes, with epilepsy-inducing, pointless flashy screen effects and words appearing on screen when characters say \"important\" things. They're unskippable for the most part, often telling you the level is still loading when you try to skip them even after several minutes, which is a dirty lie. The first time you load the game, it opens straight into a ridiculously long unskippable cutscene before you're even allowed to do so much as change the f*cking graphics options; which I can only assume is meant to prepare you for how long-winded and obnoxious this game can be.\n\nGameplay wise, it does a couple of interesting things with animations, but all at the expense of player freedom:\n\nQ: Shall we let players carry as many weapons as they want, like in the first two games?\nA: Well that would be fun, but I have this idea of how we can create unique animations so that Max carries three weapons at once realistically. So let's do that instead. But no more than three! That's too arcadey.\n\nQ: How can we make the cutscenes more dynamic?\nA: Well, let's make it so that Max always takes his sidearm out during a cutscene, whichever one is currently in the players inventory! For added realism, we should make sure it's always equipped when the cutscene finishes, even if the player was using their assault rifle before, and even if we throw them directly into a room full of enemies. So they need to spend a few seconds changing back to the weapon they actually wanted to use while they're busy getting shot at from all angles! Sometimes, if players insist on using Uzis instead of pistols, we'll remove those from their inventory and switch them with pistols, just for the cutscene, because f*ck 'em.\n\nQ: Shall we make the player movement feel smooth and intuitive at the expense of realism?\nA: Hah, no! Let's make sure Max's animations are extremely realistic so that he can smack his head on walls when he dives around, fall over randomly, and won't respond immediately to the controls because our super realistic animations need to catch up first! We need to go for that \"human tank\" effect.\n\nQ:......\nA: Oh yeah and lets not include any grenades or molotovs, no one liked those in the other games. By the way, whats your opinion on cover systems?\n\nI feel that Rockstar, having taken the development reigns from Remedy, didn't understand what made Max Payne so good. So we're left with this... It's not terrible, it can be fun, and it's superficially Max Payne, but under the surface it's a fairly generic shooter. A shell of itself. This is a game that forgot its roots and starting taking itself way too seriously."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505258459, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494704", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34910091", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198085682131", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506620624, "num_games_owned": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "playtime_forever": 955}, "timestamp_updated": 1505258459, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Max Payne is a game in which you play a depressed alcoholic who is literally only functioning thanks to his drug consumption.
