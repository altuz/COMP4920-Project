The gameplay is about adjusting the form of the wave with your mouse to navigate through the 'maze' and accumulate points. Music is relaxing. Game difficulty increases with each level rather quickly. Not quite a point and click game, but utilizing the curvature of your waceform by figuring out how to move the mouse in a way to follow the trail of bubbles. More of a fun, casual game to play when you just need to something to occupy your mind after so many action based games. Yes, I would recommend this game, but not highly. On scale of 1 - 10, this would be around the 7.5/8 range."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505072161, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34869676", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_reviews": 1973, "last_played": 1505070406, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 40}, "timestamp_updated": 1505084677, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Tags: Clicker - Slow\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Terrible \n\nLoads of polish all around. Nice space theme. Audiovisuals hold up well. Good resolution support. Core gameplay is the absolute pits. Seems like a straight up tablet port. Hold mouse button and drag in different directions emulating a swype. Interactivity limited to changing amplitudes and frequencies on a wave. Wave is placed arbitrarily and it becomes very finnicky to slide around correctly to catch the little coins. As in you cant choose where the wave starts and ends and sometimes it seems like coins are just placed out of reach of the bracket the wave is in. Just not satisfying or fluid at all. Removed for declutter."}]}
