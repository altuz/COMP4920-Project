Although the entire game being built around the use of the camera, the levels still bring something new until the very end. The first few levels can be a little repetitive, you practically just uses your camera to move boxes around, but after that the game introduces new objects  (disappearing clouds, fireball throwing flowers, elephant trampolines and many others) constantly, just giving you enough time to learn how to use them before introducing something new. The majoraty of the objects are used only in a handful of levels before being dropped for something new, keeping the game always fresh. The game is very easy if you finish the level without completing any secondary goal, so I recommend to go after the secret objects and the stars for maximum enjoyment.  The graphics, although simple, are a delight to look at, evocative of the 16bit era platformers: they are exactly how you remember them being at the time, not  pixelated and low resolution as they truly are.  If you try to complete secondary objectives, the game will give you at least 10 hours of fun, more than enough to justify the $10 price."}]}
