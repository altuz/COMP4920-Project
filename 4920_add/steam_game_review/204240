When it comes up, it does do that very well, but it's not the main feature of the game, it's not even present in most levels - it just shows up about 25% of the time more as something cool, and yes it gives you something to get your head around but not as much as you might think.\n\nThe real meat and potatoes of the game is the fact that you can rotate the level around, and your dude can't jump, and everything is based on physics with gravity pulling downward - and then spices it up later with white versions of things where gravity is inverted on them.\n\nI enjoyed the puzzles but the game didn't pull me in like Braid, and it's the atmosphere.  I appreciate the art style of this is pencil drawing, but unfortunately the black and white and lack of character in the levels makes it very bland.  By contrast, Braid is so beautiful to look at, and it throws some different creatures and interesting dialogue to make you wonder where the story is going.  Whereas here, the only dialogue is just the main character thinking about the mathematicians he met - just as bland as the rest of the atmosphere!\n\nI'm in the middle of Chapter 3, and I have certainly enjoyed working out the puzzles so far.  But I'm not much of an arbitrary puzzle person (pure puzzles frustrate me, I like atmosphere in my games) but Braid's dialogue was so captivating, it actually spurred me on to complete a few puzzles I didn't want to, just to see where the story would go.  There is no such drive here, and I'm up to a puzzle which involves both black and white hazards and quite a convoluted scene, and I can see is going to require a lot of thinking (or in my case, a lot of trial and error) and that is where someone like me gets turned off.\n\nI think there's something in here for everyone, but up to a point, mid Chapter 3, if you're not really into puzzles, you might start to lose interest."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505929071, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497573", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35088773", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198032541409", "num_reviews": 54, "last_played": 1405043432, "num_games_owned": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 338}, "timestamp_updated": 1505929071, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you enjoy puzzles, you'll probably like this game.\nIf you don't, why are you reading the reviews?"}]}
