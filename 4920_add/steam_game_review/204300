You have the control over character, which is for me, is one of the essential elements in MOBA games. \n*Character designs, their voice actings (It deserves a special applaud), their background stories are all well done. \n*Champions' skills and difficulty are balanced (with some slight exceptions) \n\nCONS: \n*Unfortunately matchmaking system is really problematic. You are forced to match with people with at least 500 Wins whereas you only got 20. There is nearly no balance in matchmaking, either you easily win or you easily lose.\n*The community population density is decreasing, It feels like there will be 20-30 people left, playing the game in near future.\n*New heroes (maybe as a means of advertising) come quite unbalanced and buffed. It takes time to see them get debuffed.\n\nLast comment: I would suggest you to play the game to make your own comment. It is free in the end and it deserves a try. Who knows, maybe you would get engaged with the game so much that the cons would not matter to you."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505933641, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502582", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35090112", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198063368550", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1506010624, "num_games_owned": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 44, "playtime_forever": 426}, "timestamp_updated": 1505933641, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I 100% support this game.
