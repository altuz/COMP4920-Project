It is a real shame considering how good the First and Second Encounters are, but reality should not be denied. This game is trash. Between the lackluster quality of level design and trying to make up with it by the variety of throwing many many many gimmicks randomly into how levels work in the game, the game just sucks. It\u2019s not worth your money. On sale for under $2 it was not worth mine. Avoid at all costs.\n\nFull review is available at http://redsectorshutdown.blogspot.com/2017/09/serious-sam-ii-pc-review.html"}]}
