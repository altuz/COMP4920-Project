Originally bought this on the Xbox 360, had a blast there and the PC port just delivers the fun on better graphics and higher framerates.  What's not to like?\n\nOnly thing that I still dislike the game for is the experience system, mostly due to it basically saying \"Don't put any points into strength.\"  How the experience gain works is that, for every hit you make on an enemy that's alive, you get 1 experience point.  Doesn't matter if your swing does 30 damage or 90, you only get 1 experience point, so in order to get a decent amount of levels, you have to spend your points elsewhere.  Apart from that, it's still an amazing game nonetheless.\n\nMake sure to grab a 4-pack though.  Nothing's more fun than fighting a boss to free a princess, then fighting each other to see who gets the kiss.  Protip: Focus Red Knight, especially if he's put points into his magic.
