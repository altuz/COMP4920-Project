The game is colorful and loud, with frantic twin-stick, top-down shooter controls (i.e. left stick moves your squad around with aiming/ shooting taking place via where right stick is aimed.) Fans of retro chiptune style music will find some enjoyment from this soundtrack, as hefty explosions fill the rooms from the various weapons you throw out to annihilate the enemies including screen-filling grenades and various missiles and turrets. \n\nWhat bothers me about this game the most is that it seems like you are more often a victim of friendly fire and exploding barrels more than the minimal attacks from enemies, making for a somewhat clumsy feeling level of player interactivity. I think this is somewhat intentional with the game, however.. as you seem to be making a mad dash through the levels to complete the various objectives before a timer/\"radiation\" begins to automatically do damage per second to your party until they are dead if you take too long to complete the objectives, which some players may find annoying to be racing against a clock to complete the levels and not able to explore freely.\n\nThe game could use more boss or objective variety, with objectives ranging from pushing puck-like objects into incinerators on the map or eliminating all enemies, but the main gameplay of running from room to room and eliminating the enemies is fun. The gear you can buy your characters seems pointless and very limited to just a few helmets / hats that don't seem to affect their stats or weapons at all and are cosmetic-only(?). You may end up unlocking more gear as your characters level up, but I'm not certain as I haven't had any characters live for very long. \n\nI got this game on sale and enjoy 8-bit design aesthetics, and enjoy booting it up now and again to try to progress through a few levels and see how long I can have my guys live for. I'm uncertain if there is an end-game or if it's endless levels, but it's fun to boot up and mash through a few stages with its frequent explosions and enjoyable chiptune soundtrack. I think 9.99 for its default asking price is a bit high, and would feel better about snagging it under a 5$ pricepoint."}]}
