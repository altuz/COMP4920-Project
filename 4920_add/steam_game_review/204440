You can unlock an endless mode, but it is specifically hidden object.\n\nThe core gameplay takes place over the course of 30 games, and in the different difficulties you can either not compete against other (npc) \"Pickers\", or increasingly difficult \"Pickers\" in order to make the most money.\nIt's a fairly interesting game, and (as previously stated) the hidden object function is optional. In each location there is a hidden object mini-game, which you can play for a free item to sell. But, though it can be played in each subsequent visit to a location (once per day), once you've located an item on the list you it's gone, and can't be grabbed again, so each time the mini-game gets easier. And on my second playthrough of the game, I realized that the items are always asked for in the same order each time, and the items are always in the exact same spot, so once you've done it once, you can do it really easily again, unless you don't have a very good memory.\n\nWhen you go to a location to find things to sell, you can choose to get the items apraised (a limited number of times, for a fee), but the value of the items doesn't change from game to game, meaning that if you take note of the value, you never actually have to bother getting them appraised again.\n\nIn fact, the only thing that seems to change is what the \"Hot Item\" will be that day, and which items will sell in your store on a given day.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you can get it on sale, it's fairly worth it, you can play it through in only a few hours, but for the $3 I paid for it, that meant that it was roughly .50 cents an hour worth of entertainment, which is about the same as going to an arcade.\nIt could probably be played again later, once you've forgotten the prices/locations of everything."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1386105646, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506847", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "7901386", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035098247", "num_reviews": 54, "last_played": 1422125069, "num_games_owned": 1475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 884}, "timestamp_updated": 1386105646, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is surprisingly entertaining and can be addictive."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1405056946, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503371", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11177978", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198044036860", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1446880118, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 384}, "timestamp_updated": 1405056946, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This could be a lot of fun, if I could see and work with the inventory.
