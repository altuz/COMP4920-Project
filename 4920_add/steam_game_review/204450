The main story is filled with great adventure and action having a great story telling. \n\nThe story of Silas Greaves is narrated by himself and has great sense of humor.\n\nI wish it had more guns. Duel mode is awesome and has different challenge to face with differemt opponent.\n'Nuggets of truth' reveal some greatest outlaws of wildwest that had existed so it is worth looking for.\n\nOverall a great shooter, 8/10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505019879, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34853507", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198085093968", "num_reviews": 130, "last_played": 1485060041, "num_games_owned": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 808}, "timestamp_updated": 1505019879, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A must-have for gunslingers of all ages."}, {"votes_down": 14, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504972581, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485366", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34840577", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "11", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125545259", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1504958832, "num_games_owned": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 233}, "timestamp_updated": 1504972605, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I played on NORMAL for a couple of hours without facing much of a trouble. Graphics are good, the feeling of the wild west is there, and the duels reminded me about reading comic books. The story, and voice acting are top notch for this kind of game.\nSo why NOT RECOMMENDED you ask?\n\nI run into sheriff Plummer... I spent more than 30min trying to deal with the guy, but for no avail. I believe the game is pretty immersive, and challenging on its own, and there was no need for such a difficulty spike :( This is the biggest thing I hate about games. You play it, it's great, you want more, but the SPIKE happens, and you're left there hanging.\nDon't get me wrong I'm pretty sure it's just my lack of skill, and maybe I got discouraged too early.\n\n...but take it from a man who got Platinum Achievement in the first Bioshock game (perserverance FTW), and finished a couple of decent FPS games recenlty (Doom, Wolfenstein to name a few).\n\nSo it's more a warning if you're like me, preferring a smooth (NOT EASY!) gameplay over difficulty spikes.\nSee you Pardner!"}]}
