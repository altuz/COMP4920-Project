The initial game starts strong, where you have a small squad and you're slowly unlocking more powerful gear as the campaign unfolds while the aliens get stronger and more varied. And for an RTS mixed with a tower defense, I have to say the user interface is a lot better and more responsive than many other indie games I've played.\n\nHowever, it all goes off the rails very quickly. The first problem is that several campaign stages are escort missions. Escort missions are never fun and, frankly, people who make them should be publicly shamed. Defense or tower defense missions can be made well. It is simply not possible to make a good escort mission. That might seem like a petty complaint, but it's 2017. Everybody should know better at this point.\n\nOtherwise, Infested Planet's economy is completely and utterly screwed up. You can research more powerful gear, but you always start with a handful of almost useless basic guns and the better stuff is prohibitively expensive. The only way to get more resources is to take over enemy bases, which gives every enemy a random beneficial mutation, but you only get enough resources to upgrade a single guy or put down one turret. The turrets aren't strong enough to actually defend anything, while after two or three bases you need to have a fully kitted-out squad to even have a hope of blowing up the rapidly upgrading swarm of foes. The best you can do is buy one-time upgrades at the shop to use in the next mission, but all that means is that you now have to replay levels multiple times just for cash.\n\nThen you can also be screwed from the very first second of a map by the map's procedural generation. I repeatedly had it spawn my starting base right next to multiple enemy strongholds, who instantly started overwhelming my grunt's peashooters with sheer numbers. The RNG will also frequently put multiple enemy bases right next to each other, so by the time you are through one line of defense the others are already shredding your squad. You can, potentially, get through this kind of situation if your squad has a bunch of powerful weapons but we've already talked about the problem with getting to that point.\n\nFinally, I just gave up on the levels where the enemy bases sent out a respawning bug when they were destroyed. You will not be able to kill that bug with your starting weapons, so it will escape and the enemy bases will eventually all be crammed right next to each other, with a ton of overlapping defenses and shields and a truly massive amount of bugs heading towards your pathetic little squad.\n\nI don't know what kind of person enjoys the type of grind you have to engage in to get through this mess of a game, but I wish them well and I hope I'm never trapped in an enclosed space with them."}]}
