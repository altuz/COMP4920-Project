Maps I tried were hero centric not sure if this involves towns, units, and ressources at all, but it does not appear that way.  I only played a very short time and it looked reasonable and played stable. Story seems like your generic, evil has grown strong, heroes of the griffin faction struggling for the light kind of situation. Conventional RTS conventions for most movement and camera related needs. Abilities are handled through HUD buttons, are kept small in number with strict upgrade paths and varies on character class. Possible to pause game and issue orders while paused. You can queue orders by pressing shift. I found it confusing to figure out which icons were for targeted spells, which auto-activated after a time, and which were a toggle."}]}
