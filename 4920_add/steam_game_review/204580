Tempted to use this as a measuring stick by which I can eliminate lesser smashbroesque and lesser angle snapping tablet port titles or object routing clickers with physics elements.\n\nReview: Xbox360 pad supported. Single player is 60 levels, levels are fairly short paced and involve swinging around like tarzan around pegs to collect coins, fight the odd boss battle and do the odd brickbreak bonus area. Combat is deterined by whomever is closest to the peg that they are swinging around, upon catching up on the rotation with a foe, will cut their rope sending them flying down to their death. Controls allow rather smooth ability to switch direction you swing in and the way the game handled the bouncing and aiming of the protag from peg to peg felt fluid and well implemented. The audiovisual presentation is line with what you would expect from a somewhat quality indie small scale project, and reminds vaguely of the early consoles, but unfortunately the flash game/tablet feeling still holds the title back.\n\nConclusion: Between a substantial single player, an intesting local co-op couch 2D combat game, Xbox support, nice audiovisual package for the genre and solid mechanics this is not bad at all. Replayability is encouraged with a few unlocks of character skins and additional levels. There is also a leaderboard VS Steam Friends. They could had tried to come up with additional things to motivate player progression. Still a worthy addition for couch VS and casual object routing."}]}
