Within your arsenal you have a host of powers, and tricks to stop the humans from building the tower.\n\nI got this game when I saw how good it looked. History has always interested me, and the tales, and myths of an era gone by leaves me wanting to learn more. I don't know much about the history, or tower of babel, but History tells us that it once existed.\n\nTo put it simply - This game is a great idea that the developers nailed. I love the powers you receive, and the game reminds me of 'lemmings', as the villagers/slaves building the tower look like lemmings.\n\nThe game itself Isn't long, but It's a nice way to burn a few hours. The game is aimed at the casual gamer, and someone who likes to game on a phone, or tablet rather than a PC. It's not a game that wants to be taken seriously, but something you can laugh at, and enjoy in small doses.\n\nI have nothing bad to say about this game. I liked it, and I'm sure you will too. If you like history, and historical based games, then you will like this 100%."}]}
