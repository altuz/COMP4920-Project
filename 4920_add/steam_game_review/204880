Plenty of things for you to do in base game.  Six factions all of which have a decently different play styles (I prefer to play as Advent Rebels).  But base game can get a little borring and repetitive but is overall a good game on it's own.  But, the games true colors come out with the modding community.  Mods ranging from Star Wars and Star Trek to Halo and Battlestar Galactica.  With mods that have been in development for years (especially Star Trek: Armada 3.) These mods are superb and have an entire system and there own art styles that give you the feeling you're playing a game for that franchise.  So with the base game itself being great on it's own, the mods add hours or days of replayability. Overall the game is a 10/10 for me and it scratches that franchise itch you might have (especially Star Trek fans.)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506590306, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500369", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "35257920", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198057284283", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1506920666, "num_games_owned": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1370, "playtime_forever": 1370}, "timestamp_updated": 1506590306, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Launch game for first time. \nChoose Vasari Rebels based on aesthetic. \nAmass a fleet of over fifty ships and think I'm hot shit. \nPirates whisper \"This is gonna hurt\" \nI think \"Nah I've got like fifty ships\" and engage at my capital planet. \nFive pirate ships warp in, I think \"Hey that's not that bad\" \nAbout one hundred more appear out of nowhere. \nohshit\nAlly whispers \"Your help has arrived!\" \nHe has sent literally one fucking ship. \nMore pirates warp in, there are at least two hundred of them now and I'm getting destroyed. \nMy fleet is completely annhilated in moments, with only my one capital ship left. \nI don't think the pirates have any idea how fast I am. \nCapital ship blows up. \nwellfuck.jpg \n\n10/10 would do it again. \n4X in SPACE with lots of space battles.
