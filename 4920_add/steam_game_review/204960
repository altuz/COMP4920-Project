The game will then play a five-sentence \"conversation\" between your character and your opponent that is poorly-translated and nonsensical (ex.: \"How are things? Is everything going well? Eeeeeek!  (cough cough)  BITTER!\" \"AHAHAHAAA!  Whoa, I did it!\").\n\n- You will then have to sit through [i]another[/i] lengthy loading screen for the match itself, as the first loading screen was only for the Babelfish banter.  To \"entertain\" you, the game's frequent loading screens will be adorned with unfunny game non-hints (ex.: \"My Engrish translations are hilarious!\").\n\n- You will then arrive at gameplay.  Um, sort of.  You have to trudge through a slow-as-molasses tutorial first.  No, you can't skip it.\n\n- OK, NOW gameplay.  Unfortunately, the takeaway these developers got from Japanese games was, \"boy, the characters sure yell a lot\"  -  so they had the onscreen characters scream [i]every single time you or your opponent make a match[/i]. This adds another challenge to the game: can you concentrate on the gameplay against the backdrop of a [i]constant and intolerable shrieking cacophony?[/i]\n\nOh, you can?  Congratulations, enjoy [i]Magical Drop V[/i]  -  what you're allowed to play of it between loading screens, that is.  \n\n- But, wait  -  the game crashes 3/4 of the way through your run, because this is a slapdash iOS port.  Hold on, the game allegedly has an autosave feature!  ...That works just as well as the game itself (i.e. it doesn't).  Back to the beginning for you! \n\n- And back to the [i]tutorial[/i] for you.  You have to play through it every single time you start up Story Mode!\n\nAnd, of course, loading screens for that [i]hilarious[/i] banter are forever. \n\nI love the [i]Magical Drop[/i] gameplay, and I thought I could weather a bad port if the core game were still there, but this is atrocious.  It makes you wait forever to plays snippets of the game against a headache-inducing soundtrack and might at any time crash and wipe your data anyhow.  Yeah, I know it's just a buck.  It ain't worth the frustration at any price."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1494450765, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31672666", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198081498833", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1470586164, "num_games_owned": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 91}, "timestamp_updated": 1494450765, "received_for_free": false, "review": "As much as I loved the concept of a game staring Tarot cards, This let me down. \nThe controls are very clunky, and that's a huge turn off for me on a game.\n\nOther than that, the art and characters are adorable, the music is nice.\nGive the game a chance to earn your own opinion from experience, because what is clunky to one might be comfortable to another."}]}
