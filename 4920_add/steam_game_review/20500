Any building can be reduced to rubble through brute force or precision demolitions, and you are given the tools to use the environment to your advantage. Is there a captive nestled way at the back of a military compound? Run a truck through the back wall and create your own door. Is there a highway checkpoint that is too tough to crack? Load up a mac truck with demolition charges and turn it into an explosive battering ram.\n\nThe weak points of the game are the storyline and that the game world doesn't rebuild at any point. I believe in this version you can use a Reconstructor tool to rebuild items, but I haven't tried that out yet.\n\nI remember the multiplayer being a unique blast on Xbox 360, but I don't think there are many people playing now so don't grab this if multiplayer is your focus.\n\nI grabbed this for $60 when it came out, and again for $30 for PC. I consider this a 'required play'."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505460286, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489418", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "34966133", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022160541", "num_reviews": 25, "last_played": 1505447535, "num_games_owned": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 891}, "timestamp_updated": 1505460286, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The only noteworthy thing that RF:G has going for it, and that you should have any interest in, is its destruction system. As fun as it is (even today), it does not make this game worth \"full price\" ($20US), nor does it make it worth playing all the way through. To be honest, once you've got your hands on the tricked out rocket launcher and have had a few spins wreaking havoc in a mech, you've really seen all there is to this game. \n\nThe missions are dime a dozen, being repeatedly copied and pasted throughout with next to no exciting set pieces or unique concepts to make them memorable or give them substantial variety. The gameworld is very uninteresting and is a visually monotonous blur of red, grey and brown; seriously lacking flair in its landscape or manmade structures. The story is an absolute eye-roller, it is so unpleasantly familiar; far too cliche and predictable for it to be worth your time seeing it through. I will give credit where it's due for the very decent soundtrack and decent weapon line-up, but as a sum of its parts the game is highly mediocre. Destruction is not enough to make the rest of the game somehow magically good. \n\nI have no major complaints about this game as a PC version. KBAM controls are fine for the most part (though I don't like the mouse camera controls in cars) and it performed fine on my system, mostly over 100fps at max settings 1080p. Played on an i5 4690, 16GB 1600, GTX 1060 overclocked, 840 Evo 250GB and Win 10 Pro.\n\nIf you want a few hours of dumb fun, then pick this up heavily discounted on sale. It's nothing special, otherwise.\n"}]}
