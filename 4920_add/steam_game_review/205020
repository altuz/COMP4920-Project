You solve puzzles and click your way across a beautiful handmade city looking for your lost grandfather, meeting a couple of interesting characters along the way. The puzzles are mildly difficult, but there are some which are nearly impossible to figure out without a guide or walkthrough, such as the [spoiler]morse code puzzles and punch card password[/spoiler]. The visual style is cute and carefully crafted and the soundtrack is quite peaceful and relaxing.  \n\nPros-\n-Adorable hand-made visuals\n-Not too challenging puzzles\n-Funky and relaxing soundtrack- I purchased it and listen to it frequently\n-Simple, feel-good story with bits of dry, British wit interspersed within it\n-A generally enjoyable, relaxing, casual game\n\nCons-\n-Quite a few bugs, some crash-inducing.\n-Restricted movement- Any place you wish to reach must be clicked.\n-Some impossible puzzles, with little to no hints on how to solve them, I.E. [spoiler]ROPE on the second morse puzzle, \"Mary\" being the password in the punch card puzzle[/spoiler].\n-$20 price tag- It is a bit steep for a game like this, but had I known how much I'd enjoy it, I would've paid the full price.\n-One of the most point-and-click-ey games out there- If you aren't a fan of the genre, you won't enjoy this one (I daresay it is much better than the entire FNAF series combined, no offense to FNAF fans).\n\nOverall, I would give this game an 8.5/10. It would be better without the little annoying bugs along with the crash-inducing ones, and it would be perfect with less restricted movement and fewer impossible puzzles. The game's creators really poured their souls into this little game, and the effort has been rewarded with a mostly smooth and visually appealing experience.\n\nOn a side note, this game made me want fish and chips very badly."}]}
