The graphical and musical style from Beat is carried over from Core. In this game though, the graphics are not as crazy but still are trippy and weird, while the music is a lot more subdued. The story and cutscenes tend to revolve around Commander Video and 2 figures that look a lot like Commander Video.\nThe gameplay consists of controlling an object in the middle that can fire up, down, left, or right. The goal is to hit each block as it passes through a line. This felt a little bit like Guitar Hero in trying to match a block with a direction and firing the laser. Just like in Beat, blocks move on the screen and with different patterns or in huge groups. Bosses exist at the end of the level with 2 more Atari references, and included to the game are bombs to remove difficult blocks onscreen.\nCore feels a bit flawed though. There are times when I was interested in the pattern of the blocks and the level designs, while other times I felt bored. Sometimes I would easily get the hang of a pattern and be in sync to the music, while other times I wouldn't and try to button mash my way out. The mellowed out design and more abstract gameplay in Core makes the game a bit harder to enjoy. As a whole, the game is roughly harder than Beat, although there are points where the game is easy and then it suddenly ramps up in difficulty. The time to beat Core is also roughly the same as to finish Beat as well.\nBit.Trip Core will be fine for players who played some of the other Bit.Trip games like Beat or Runner and want more Bit.Trip action. The game itself isn't perfect, but gives a different kind of game that isn't the most amazing, yet offers some interesting things to check out."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1385506908, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508462", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "7776053", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198036250157", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1405216290, "num_games_owned": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 210}, "timestamp_updated": 1385506908, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Along with the rest of the BIT.TRIP Saga, this game is definitely unique.

Note that I have played the Wii (and 3DS) version of this game a lot more then I have on the PC so I have a lot more hours in the game then it shows.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nThe way CORE works is, you are playing at the + in middle of the screen. When a beat (square things) comes you have to take aim in one of the four directions and shoot the beats. The beats are in-time with the music and you will need to use the beat of the song to hit these accurately.\n\nA staple to the BIT.TRIP franchise is the zones. The higher the zone, the higher your multiplier will be, thus more score. You zone up by hitting a certain amount of beats while not missing too many. Staying in higher zones results in more score, but it is really easy to fail out of it. The higher the zone, the better the music gets which is another thing to keep you motivated to keep doing better.\n\nTo fail a stage you will have to drop out of the Nether zone (the lowest zone) and there are no checkpoints. If you don't have experience then this game will be really hard at first. The difficulty curve is steep and the first level (Discovery) will be hard for first-timers. However once you get the hang of the game and mechanics, the next two levels will not be as hard.\n\nPersonally, once I pick up a good rhythm game I will spend too much time in it and this game is no exception. I find it very addictive to try to improve my score more and more.\n\nAlso, note that there are only the three 15 minute levels; Discovery, Exploration and Control. Playing through the game without failing will take just 45 minutes, but if you're motivated to get further improve your scores (like me), it shouldn't be a huge problem.\n\n\n[u]Music/Sound[/u]\nAs a rhythm game, the game is partially dependent on the music, so is it good? Definitely, CORE probably has my favorite music of any of the BIT.TRIP games, though that is subject to opinion. Also as I said before, the higher zone you're in, the better the music gets. Exploration is my personal favorite. (*^\u25bd^*)\n\nAs far as sound effects go, they're solid and they do the job well.\n\n\n[u]Versions[/u]\nBetween the three versions of the game (PC, Wii, 3DS) I feel that if you have the right controller (the Xbox 360's circular D-Pad design does not go well with CORE), PC is the best because of the increased resolution. Also, the challenges which flip the + 90 degrees are actually challenging on the PC cause you can't just flip the controller like you can on Wii. Don't bother with the 3DS version, it's basically broken as the music de-syncs after the first section of Exploration and Control.\n\n\n[u]Final Thoughts[/u]\nBIT.TRIP CORE is up there in my all-time favorite rhythm games. The great music and addictive gameplay keep me coming back to spend even more time in it.\nDespite the difficulty curve, this is a very solid game. If you are a fan of rhythm games, definitely consider picking CORE up, and check out the rest of the franchise for that matter.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you'll like this game as much as I do if you decide to pick it up!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1404081193, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500955", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "10956525", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197992801270", "num_reviews": 90, "last_played": 1407521507, "num_games_owned": 1800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 21}, "timestamp_updated": 1404081193, "received_for_free": false, "review": "BIT.TRIP CORE is much easier than BIT.TRIP BEAT, but has many similarities as far as game styling.
