As with the other Bit.Trip games, it has its pixel based graphics and chiptune style music. However, this game's aesthetic is more chilled out with the backgrounds being mostly solid colors and gradients and the music having a more relaxed beat. The story brings Commander Video with other people who look like him and interacting some kind of aura or ball that makes them bigger or smaller. That brings us to the gameplay, which indeed revolves around a kind of ball.\nOn the screen is a black circle that can be controlled around. The goal is to get black blocks and avoid white ones. There are different patterns to react to with differing amounts of black and white blocks and some powerups that will be useful to finish some sections. The end bosses tend to reference other Arcade games from the 80s and fit in with the gameplay. In a way, this game feels like Katamari as the goal is to collect objects and in doing so, increases your circle's size. There is a button that allows you to reset your circle to the smallest, which is important to avoid white blocks or move faster. Hitting white blocks can make the ball smaller, but you do lose some points that way.\nThis game tends to be easier than the last 2 in the series, which is evident by the more relaxed style rather than the more energetic visual style of previous games. Simply controlling a black circle to collect other things and avoiding white lends some precise player control like in platformers or shoot em ups. The rhythm element is still in this game where collecting black squares make a sound, but the player has more control and can somewhat vary how each set of sounds play. Regardless, the unique gameplay makes this fun yet relaxing to play. That isn't to say this game is very easy, since the game does throw some challenging things that may cause a game over.\nBit.Trip Void is overall less energetic to give some relaxed gameplay with a slightly easier difficulty. The idea of collecting black while avoiding white is simple, yet lends itself to some complex patterns to tackle and has some difficult challenges that can appear. With a simple yet original gameplay idea and more mellow design, Void is both fun to play and not as taxing on reaction time while having some moments of difficulty to mix things up."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1388147784, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507829", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8332160", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198055338667", "num_reviews": 47, "last_played": 1388147627, "num_games_owned": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 40}, "timestamp_updated": 1388147784, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Bullethell.

I can't say I've been on good terms with the rest of the Bit.Trip games seeing as they utilize fake rhythm based mechanics that don't get you into the groove like actual entries into the rhythm genre, but I found Void to be the most enjoyable out of this series.\n\nVoid can be considered more as a \"bullet hell\" type genre, as most of the gameplay revolves around avoiding many small white pixels that are flung towards the player while at the same time collecting black pixels. The graphics are rather simple, but compelling as well, however it also serves as the biggest hinderance of the game. You see, while playing the background fades in and out from time to time, and during the those periods of blackness it becomes nearly impossible to see the pixels you are supposed to collect, which results in quite a bit of unfair score drops if you end up missing some. However looking past that the rest of the gameplay is pretty solid, each level is unique from eachother, the gimmicks of the bosses are quite amusing, and the music is by far the best element of the game. I do recommend it, however I can't promise it'll be enjoyable until you actually get a grip on the game's difficulty."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1426313698, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "14877200", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198110762989", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1471181084, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 151}, "timestamp_updated": 1426313698, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This was quite fun........"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1489742123, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30565638", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198022227319", "num_reviews": 27, "last_played": 1489738658, "num_games_owned": 1507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 70}, "timestamp_updated": 1489742151, "received_for_free": false, "review": "TL;DR Below.\n\nI love the BIT.TRIP series but for many reasons this title failed to satsify my rhythmic needs. The music compared to the runner series, Beat series, and Core, seems to be all beat/bass and no melody (In my opinion). There is no exact or specific time you're required to collect dots which kind of defeats the purpose of a rhythm game. The game is by no means horrible, but it does not fit into the category of rhythm games. \n\nThere is also no indication or anything that notifies the player that they're near the next phase, near nether, or shows them their total score... why may I ask? The BIT.TRIP Runner series had it, so did the Beat series, why not Void?\n\nAs for controls, BIT.TRIP Void is the one title in the series where you are not required to tap a certain key to the beat of the music. Instead, you are required to MOVE in order to collect the beat, regardless of whether it is to the music. This makes the whole concept of \"rhythm\" obsolete, as you are not required to collect a dot in time to the beat of the music. (There is no consistency). The game doesn't allow you to choose how you control your orb. It's fixed on keys. Being a rhythm game, precision is a vital component. There are times in the game where getting a dot requires you to be pinpoint accurate. Not being able to fluently move is a big no-no for rhythm games where you are able to move freely. Even just a tap of a key can cause you to overshoot ending your combo and possibly even sending you into the nether... how would you know? There's no health bar! \nBeing able to use the mouse would've definitely turned the tables around, although it wouldn't help with the musical aspect of the game. \n\nLong story short, BIT.TRIP Void isn't a horrible game, but for a rhythmic game, it does a horrible job trying to accomplish what it set out to achieve. It is tagged as \"Rhythmic\" but I would not call it that at all, but rather survival. I find myself focusing more on surviving than enjoying the music as I cannot or can barely hear it. Since the game doesn't require you to pick up dots on a constant beat, you can just run around picking up black orbs that are in safe reach regardless of listening to the actual music. I would not call this rhythmic as there is no rhythm you're creating. As opposed to the other series, where you HAVE to be rhythmic in order to successful pass the levels.\n\nTL;DR: Interesting game, but bad controls and no engaging rhythmic music that actually requires you to be rhythmic. \n\nIn my honest opinion, just get the other titles, they are way better and are actually rhythmic."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1373664731, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501519", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2682893", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011012558", "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1504333106, "num_games_owned": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 230}, "timestamp_updated": 1373664731, "received_for_free": false, "review": "easiest bit.trip game in the series and still a lot of fun. reminds me of club music and atmosphere."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1357681794, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505145", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "811483", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197979084213", "num_reviews": 921, "last_played": 1401979287, "num_games_owned": 3515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 189}, "timestamp_updated": 1402221242, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Move a black dot over other black dots to increase in size while avoiding the white ones.
