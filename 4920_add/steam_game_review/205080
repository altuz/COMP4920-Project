It's on-rails and you shoot enemies and objects to let them produce sounds, while collecting power-ups to keep yourself alive long enough to survive the boss fights. The worlds and main character aren't as detailed though, and Rez is still the better game between the two (play it if you ever get the chance!), but I'll be honest, Fate is not bad either. It's simple in its presentation, like all the other Bit.Trip games (ok, maybe not Runner 2) and they're never expensive. But, except for Runner 1 and 2, the games never manage to capture my attention long enough. I usually get bored of them within less than 2 hours.\n\nThat, and the fact that there are no checkpoints make it difficult to recommend this game. Sure, it's challenging, but it's too unbalanced. if you die during a level you have to replay the entire level all over again. It can be frustrating because you can usually make it to the boss fights without getting hit (too much). \n\nYup, the boss fights are tough. 'Aren't boss fights supposed to be tough ? And doesn't practice make perfect ?' Well, yes, but only if it's fun to play in the first place. Fate just isn't fun enough.\n\n[Rating: 68/100]"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1405626657, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516448", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11293032", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197997031234", "num_reviews": 89, "last_played": 1405621035, "num_games_owned": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 124}, "timestamp_updated": 1405626657, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Bit.Trip Fate is somewhat different in terms of incorporating music than other titles in the series, but is still a fun game to play. This game is a literal rail shooter as players control Commander Video and shoot enemies. There are some musical elements when firing at enemies, but this is not a rhythm game. Also, enemies fire in patterns reminescent to bullet hell games, making this game a mix of these three genres of games.\nGraphically, this is similar fare to other Bit.Trip games, but has a design similar to Runner with mostly 3d objects. The backgrounds are somewhat trippy, yet have enough detail to stand out as three unique locations that are traversed in the game. The story continues from Runner as well, with Commander Video and his buddies teaming up to destroy Mingrawn Timbletot. Overall, the story is darker as well with the Commander wanting to fight the enemies with anger as shown in some of the cutscenes. Dubstep style music adds to this dark feeling while playing the game, and the music does sound great as well while not being as dynamic in other games. Music cues are made when destroying an enemy, but they are not in sync with the background music as in other games.\nEssentially, the gameplay is a literal rail shooter with bullet hell and musical elements. Players control the Commander in a set line path, only being able to move left and right along this path. Like in other Bit.Trip games, the player can increase or lose rank, and this powers up or down Commander Video. The game is lost if Commander Video is in Nether mode and gets hit. Powerups are in the stages, each with varying effects. Enemies shoot bullets and occasionally lasers, some of which have their own kind of pattern to dodge. The meat of the difficulty lies with the bosses at the end of each level. Usually, these guys start out with hard patterns at first, then tend to get easier with the next parts of the boss. Most of my deaths were up in the boss areas, although the levels tend to be easy when repeating them.\nThis game can easy or hard depending on those who played bullet hell games before. Many enemies will fire a lot of bullets, so it will take some replaying to follow the pattern and dodge the bullets. For me, the first half of the game was pretty easy, but the second half give me a bit of a challenge. It is definitely shorter than Runner with a total of 6 levels that are each around 10 minutes.\nBit.Trip Fate doesn't have strong rhythm elements in the game. However, it is good in making a different kind of shoot em up game that plays great and has some of the style of the series with its art and music. In essence, this game follows some of the same art and music style, but breaks away from being mainly a rhythm game to deliver a shooter game that delivers its unique and engaging gameplay well."}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1387622400, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515766", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8163976", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025048349", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1415634815, "num_games_owned": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 170}, "timestamp_updated": 1387622400, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Pros:\n* the music\n* the visuals\n* the gameplay\n\nCons:\n* it's a terrible, terrible port: for example many users (myself included) [i]cannot aim at the lower third of the screen[/i].

I did that with this game, and it worked well except I was trying way too hard to dodge things for a long time.\n\nYou play as Commander Video and you're on a rail type deal (that's the technical term) so you can only move forward and, by moving forward, you'll maybe go up and down depending on the rail. Your goal is to shoot anything that moves because it might shoot you first. I think.\n\nThe game has a very relaxing ambiance to it, despite it being pretty similar to many \"bullet hell\" games. The music was relaxing and the voiceovers for powerups seemed very relaxed too. This is very interesting because the tone of the game seems very casual but you can die and take hits and lose points by losing your combo status thing (another technical term) very easily by being shot through the heart. \n\nI can't say I enjoyed this game particularly, though. I think I got to the second boss before I got all the cards and moved on to a new game? Something like that. That's not to say the game isn't fun or anything, it's just the game lacked anything to suck me in.

It is the fifth game in the BIT.TRIP series, and pretty readily the easiest of them all. \n\nLike other BIT.TRIP games, as you string together a number of successful hits without a miss, the game will move to a \"higher\" mode which has more graphic effects, and as you miss enough without getting an appropriate number of successes, you will move to a \"lower\" mode, which has fewer. FATE continues the pattern of adding a new mode with each successive game, adding GIGA. In addition to the modes, there is a series of powerups which the player can pick up which will modify their weapon in one of four ways. Additionally, the power-up, when combined with GIGA mode, gets extremely powerful.\n\nHonestly, compared to other BIT.TRIP games, the music has less impact, as it's ultimately up to the player when to take care of enemies instead of being sequenced to the music. It consists of mostly easy levels with more difficult bosses, but it never strays into the \"I'm not sure if this is unfair\" territory that other BIT.TRIP games can sometimes reach.
