The graphics are stunning, the music is breathtaking, and when you add those two aspects together with the beats and game modes, it creates a concoction that was powerful enough to bring me to tears for the first time in as long as I can remember. I have not played all of the games in the series, but I have seen videos. None of them compare to this one's beauty.\n\nBut, through all of the aforementioned aspects of the game, there are several problems that I have heard people talk about:\n\n- Lighting errors that affect backgrounds; I have personally no clue how bad this is compared to the console versions, since I have not played any of them, so I cannot confirm how bad the lighting errors really are. Notwithstanding, I can assure you that I was able to see the games astounding visuals just fine, well enough for me, at least.\n\n- Timing bugs/lag that affects gameplay, e.g. beats going through paddle and powerups running out too early; I have also yet to confirm how true this is. In the almost 3 hours I've played this game (which will soon be more), I have not once encountered stuttering or powerups running out before they should. I am able to concentrate fully and nothing breaks that concentration.\n\n- Input lag; Again, yet another problem that others faced with this port that I have not. I can play it just fine without such issues.\n\n- Framerate issues; I have no complaints about the FPS, since it runs astonishingly well. \n\nHowever, despite all of those upsides for me, amongst other things, the most obvious and glaring problem is the simple fact that the first boss is impossible. You can try all you want, but you will never be able to make it past. It was aggravating for me, but I was forced to turn to having to download someone else's save file. I have heard news of a new patch yet to come, but I shall keep my expectations low to prevent the suspense being illegitimate. My only other major complaint is that mouse sensitivity options are practically a necessary option. It was stupidly difficult to get a hold of how the paddle moved compared to BEAT.\n\nNevertheless, I cannot express in any amount of words or any kind of expression/emotion how much I love this game. The soundtrack completely blows that of any other BIT.TRIp game away, the visuals demolish any other game you can find, and the game itself is a finish to the meaningful\u2014albeit through metaphor\u2014storyline contained within the BIT.TRIP series. \n\nDespite the horrifically broken bug that makes the first boss impossible, I highly recommend this game. It is one of the best games I have ever laid eyes on, and one of the best games I have ever let myself enjoy. I assure you, if you manage to get away from the horrible problems pointed out by others, and are able to fetch yourself a save with the first boss beaten, then you will enjoy this game too."}]}
