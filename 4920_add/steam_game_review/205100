How could I have waited four years to add this game to my Steam library? I can describe Dishonored in one word: immersive. This game absorbed me into its gameplay from its prologue to the very end. Many games have a strict, linear path that you must follow to complete your objectives. Dishonored is totally nonlinear, as it allows you to play the way you want to play by choosing your playstyle. It is much like the Deus Ex and Bioshock series.\n\nDishonored is a game in which an Empress\u2019 bodyguard is framed for her murder. You play Corvo Attano, the first bodyguard of the Empress born in a foreign country. The game is set in Dunwall, the capital of the island of Gristol. Dunwall is a port city that has profited from the sale of whale oil, but has been under siege by a rat plague. It feels like London, England in the late 19th or early 20th century during the industrial revolution. There is political corruption, gangs making power grabbing moves, and Corvo trying to vindicate himself and avenge the Empress\u2019 death.\n\nYou can choose to play the game in High Chaos, meaning that you can kill all enemy guards like a mass murderer. You can also choose to play in Low Chaos, which means that you can stealthily move your way toward completing your objectives without killing anyone or being detected. Killing your way to the end of the game has consequences on how the game will progress and how the game will end. More kills mean more rats on the streets and more alert guards. It even affects how the Empress\u2019 daughter draws on her pad in the pub designated as the home base for Corvo and his conspirators.\n\nEach of the nine missions is unique and never boring. Some of the locales include a prison, a palace, a high-class brothel, and a flooded district filled with slums. There are many hidden alleys and secret areas that can be useful to avoid enemy guard detection or to find items like bone charms, coins, and runes. You can also hide to listen to conversations about what is going on and what plans are being made by some characters. Runes are the currency used to purchase supernatural powers, both active and passive.\n\nCorvo\u2019s arsenal includes traditional weapons and supernatural powers. Traditional weapons include a sword and a variety of ammo that you can use according to your playstyle. You can shoot bolts with your crossbow to kill if you decide to play in High Chaos. You can shoot sleep darts to render enemies unconscious if you want to go through the game without killing anyone. Supernatural powers are magical powers powered by your mana and can be upgraded to level 2 and include Blink, Dark Vision, Bend Time, etc. Blink is the most basic power that allows you to move in the blink of an eye to reach otherwise inaccessible areas that are above or below you. One very interesting power is Possession, a power that allows you to take possession of a rat and move through tunnels humans cannot move through. When upgraded to level 2 you can take possession of humans for a short period of time. I remember taking possession of a guard so that I can move to another room without being detected. Bone charms are perks scattered in each mission that enhances your abilities, including the ability to choke someone faster, the ability swing your sword faster, and the ability to increase your max health.\n\nAs you progress through the game, there are new factions introduced to the story. The new factions introduced can lead to numerous side quests. Like the main quests, you can choose to neutralize a target by lethal or nonlethal means. The more time I spent playing the game, the more I enjoyed it because the game truly encourages exploration and experimentation. The save system allows you to save anywhere, so you can create multiple save files to see which gameplay you prefer in certain scenarios.\n\nThe artistic design is awesome and contributes to the immersive nature of the game. The locales feel very real and aesthetically look like an oil painting in motion, whether you are on urban streets, industrial warehouses, fortresses or regal palaces.  The character models are excellent also.\n\nThe AI of the enemies is very good, as enemies will enter search mode when they see a dead or unconscious body. It is fun to use Corvo\u2019s pickpocketing ability to steal pouches from unsuspecting guards while crouching behind them. Stealth can be enhanced by finding a blueprint that makes Corvo\u2019s boots very silent while moving in stealth mode.\n\nI played and completed Dishonored three times and I played like a mass murderer the first time. My second playthrough was pure stealth and managed not to kill one person and was not detected once. My third playthrough was Low Chaos, like my second playthrough, but I killed a few people. The purpose of my third playthrough was to play without using any supernatural powers except Blink. I think this game encourages players to experience the game multiple times to find alternative paths or to take on challenges they did not take on in a previous playthrough. The mouse/keyboard control scheme worked great for me as I climbed ledges, blinked from the ground to nearby rooftops or balconies, and neutralized unsuspecting targets from behind.\n\nMy only criticism of this game is Corvo Attano\u2019s lack of personality. Much like Gordon Freeman of Half-Life, Corvo never says anything throughout the game. I wish Corvo could say something in the game to inject some personality into himself. Of course, it does not ruin the overall experience by any means.\n\nMy experience with Dishonored is one of the best I have ever had in my life. It is a genuine classic game that I strongly recommend to anyone, regardless of the video game genre they prefer. The vast number of ways to play each mission makes for high replay value. If you have not played this game, you are missing out on a classic.\n\nMy Score: 9.5/10"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505586099, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513955", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35003831", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198259441163", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1506786490, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 434, "playtime_forever": 2365}, "timestamp_updated": 1505586099, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Behind every action there's beauty in it."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505624528, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512159", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35014432", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001019446", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505668209, "num_games_owned": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 752}, "timestamp_updated": 1505624528, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game!\n\n+ Game mechanics \n+ Good story\n+ Runs good\n\n- Way too short game"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505701774, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509585", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35037316", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198087544319", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1480659960, "num_games_owned": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 671}, "timestamp_updated": 1505701888, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One of my all time favorite games.

I've heard great things about it, and when it went on sale recently, I decided that I should at least try it out. I'm glad to say that it was well worth it.\n\nAs a basic summary, this game revolves around Corvo, the bodyguard of the Empress who was set up to make it look like he killed her. Set in an industrialized city called Dunwall, a couple of militant characters make his arrest, sending Corvo to jail after some time. A group called the Loyalists help you escape, and ask you to help them save Emily, daughter to the Empress. The story evolves from there, depending on how you execute each mission, giving you a either a grade of high or low chaos. This will affect the story and what happens to the players within it. \n\nAs soon as you boot up the game, you can tell the game is a little dated, but still great. I should probably preface that my computer is rather old and can't take much, but the game runs smooth enough with no screen tearing or graphical difficulties. First impressions is that this game was well made, and accomidates the power well. There are also plenty of options for the player, like if they want to play with a minimal hud for a more immersive experience, and most of which can be adjusted on the fly. Speaking of adjusted, I must praise the musical score for this game; absolutely fits the setting, mood, and tone of the story as it plays out. \n\nMy first go around was the classic stealth and full murder-spree on every area. I found the plot to be simple yet effective, and though it may not be the most complex, it did it's job well. The character arks feel very fleshed out, and the small sidequests never really deter from the main story. What this game really hits a homerun on is the setting; it feels like there's history to the world, history that I would actually read more on, and I could with the in game books they provide, scattered across the plague ridden world. They certainly hold the niche for best first person steampunk stealth game.\n\nThe acting is rather well done as well; characters like Emily and Grandma Rags, with the few lines they had, really showcase their innocence and craziness (respectively). Overall, the characters are believable and well done; however my favorite part about them is the perfect ragdoll effect and throwing bodies. I'd consider buying a body throwing simulator if you could throw them like you could in Dishonored. \n\nReally my only complaints against this game is the mana using abilities are deceptively costly, and how short the game is. However, Dishonored is so good replaying it is, for a casual player like me, is just as enjoyable as the first go around. I guess a complaint could be made that the combat is rather sophisticated for a stealth game; I never once fired my pistol or dueled someone after the first mission during my first playthrough. How that could be a complaint bewilders me, as it feels almost second nature for the bodyguard of the Empress of the kingdom. I recommended this game to all my friends, and I recommend this game to you."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505140179, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34883801", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198100375984", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505116524, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1146}, "timestamp_updated": 1505140386, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1][b]A dark themed game that will enlighten your day.[/b][/h1]\n\nThis first person shooter/hack n' slash game is full of intense action combined with stealthy mechanics.
