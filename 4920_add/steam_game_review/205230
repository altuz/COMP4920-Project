The bosses in the game are just weird in their appearance. The levels vary. The game has a very direct and partially dark humor that I couldn't get in touch with much. Killing a boss forces the player to perform a finisher, otherwise the boss restores some health and the character receives damage as if hit. Those finishers may be something new and unique but imo they weren't required and not making them optional but forcing them on the player was a mistake, especially since they get repetitive after some time. Devs: Just because you think a feature is cool don't force it on the players. They may not like it, they may not always be in the mood for it, allow the players to decide how to enjoy the game more.\n\nMixed feelings on the controls. Imo using one button for two distinct actions (jump & wall jump) led to an inaccuracy of what action is to perform and accidental mistakes as result. The character also tends to slide a little until stopping which led to falling down numerous times for me. Should imo slide only at high speed but not anymore when at walking / slow running speed but just stop.\n\nThe enemies require a certain approach to be defeated, which the player needs to figure out to succeed. This can lead to being stuck. An example for this is the boss \"Irish\" who requires the player action of zooming the view / camera out to kill the boss. Another example are the smoking creates in one of the other levels that require to shoot the smoke so that it catches fire and damages objects above it, even through the ceiling. The game doesn't make that clear. Enemy projectiles also tend to come from off-screen and most often can be fully evaded. Yet player projectiles are deleted once the leave the screen and thus always have less range then enemy projectiles and are unreliable to hit if being mobile and I guess that was a design decision to make sure the player doesn't snipe enemies from the corners of the screen. For boss fights there rarely may be situations in which a boss becomes immune to damage. Games like Megaman had the *glows red* indicator to make that clear. This game just doesn't give any hint for any immunity on / off. You have to know and guess but it's only a very minor issue. Enemies may also move inside the level's terrain sometimes, rendering them unkillable as they can't be hit while inside the terrain.\n\nIn the game world I sometimes had trouble realizing that some of the darker objects weren't just background objects but actual movement blocking main world objects.\n\nThe economy to upgrade gear and buy new stuff is about gathering coins and gems. Aside from that money can be gained by boss kills, missions, slot machines and \"the island\", with slot machines breaking the economy: I made so much money there that I didn't have to worry about anything for the rest of the game.\n\nA strange economy, research and upgrade objects is \"the island\": Bosses you defeat are sent to that place to work for you. You can assign them to 1 of 4 tasks but what these actually do to which effect / degree in the game I haven't figured out yet because this feature isn't explained at all and any bit while also not being accessible from within the current game. Instead to access \"the island\" you have to quit your current game, go to the main menu, access \"the island\" from there to make your settings and then you can continue with your regular game. Imo that made it into the game too late and lacks an actual use.\n\nWithin the levels there are reusable checkpoints. Usually autosaves also happen after defeating a boss but not always. This leads to issues:\nIf dying after gathering money / items from hard to get areas and before being able to save that'll have to be done again. Because checkpoints are sometimes very far away and there are enemies and obstacles to avoid to get to them that can be burden just for saving progress.\nAnother issues is with boss fights where saves didn't happen and repetitive, unskippable dialogue and after succeeding forced finishers again.\n\nI finished the game and all it's missions in one run and I doubt I'll be playing it again. While I didn't dislike it I also can't say I really enjoyed it but that it's been one weird trip. What kept me playing were the game's core mechanics that worked but imo other games I have are more enjoyable at that. If I could I'd give this game a clear mediocre rating but with only the decisions of recommended or not remaining I wouldn't recommend it even though I didn't encounter any bugs and it's well playable.\n\nIssues for me:\n-double binding of wall jump & jump (one other button pressed to make use of wall jump would've been more accurate)\n-unreliable projectiles: player projectiles being deleted off-screen\n-broken economy (slot machine)\n-badly integrated \"the island\"\n-lack of explaination where it was necessary (camera zoom out; how to access \"the island\"; what anything on \"the island\" does or any progress or anything there)\n-instead of making the character invulnerable for a very short amount of time after being hit the character remains vulnerable and is pushed back a large distance, leading to unavoidable being hit chains at times\n-projectiles don't accelerate with the player's movement\n-weird bosses instead of functionally interesting bosses (most of the time)\n-forced finishers\n-no \"skip\" for dialogues\n-some weapons are just the same as others and aren't really needed (should be upgrade paths of one weapon instead of carrying very similar ones around)\n-clunky save & healing mechanic (sometimes had to run back a large distance just to gain health back and/or save); manual saves every x minutes and a slot regeneration would've done much to combat this\n-a lot of new gear but aside from wall jump (only usable in areas with gear restriction) no new / advanced character abilities\n\nGood:\n-no bugs encountered\n-most often level design and soundtrack\n-core mechanics work\n-upgrading makes things interesting\n-the game allows to figure out how to deal with enemies (but should tell if it's not about combat and explain all non-combat things)\n-good key bindings (aside from that jump / wall jump double use)\n-tendency of weapon mechanics but sadly not fully eplored\n-map (but should show items within explored areas)\n-teleporters to avoid huge travel distances"}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504201352, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483950", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34639524", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198051187378", "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1465067112, "num_games_owned": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 811}, "timestamp_updated": 1506282398, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I don't recommend supporting Sega. Even buying their good games supports bad practices. Hell Yeah is just passable.\n\nIf you don't care whether you support DRM that may repeatedly force you online for re-validation; or make games that use it eventually cease to work for all legitimate owners; or you only care about this particular piece of software then it's safe to ignore the preamble & \"score\" of this review. I believe the rest of its contents are fair criticism.\n\nBuying any of Sega's products, even older ones that lack that DRM like this one does, will support the inclusion of said DRM in future products. As someone who does a lot of gaming offline I can't support a company which does that.\n\nIf that doesn't bother you, again, feel free to ignore my preamble and \"score\".\n---\n\nHell Yeah is a perfectly functional game, though I've heard that on PS3 it was too unstable to even claim that much, but it's almost surprising how forgettable it is. Other than the intentionally aggravating \"cute world\" (you'll know when you find it) most of the rest of the game kind of blends together.\n\nIt's technically a Metroidvania if those are your thing but it's a very linear one with surprisingly few secrets to find. It's more like a collection of mini-Metroidvanias like Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia. Don't take that as a recommendation though. It's not nearly as good or as polished mechanically.\n\nThere's very little incentive to keep playing after you beat it.\n\nMost of its sense of humor isn't to my taste but if you like references to things then maybe you'll laugh at all the references to things.\n\nI get the feeling the game was considered for a mobile release. \"The Island\" \"\"\"minigame\"\"\" works like a lot of f2p games with a ton of real time waiting minus the ability to pay real money to speed anything up or upgrade things. Maybe it's supposed to be a parody of f2p games but in practice it just \"plays\" like a real one.\n\nThere are some (unimportant) rewards like certain outfits you can only get by messing with it & it's best to set it up ASAP if you intend to touch it at all because Hell Yeah is such a short game that otherwise you can beat it without even unlocking your first reward from it.\n\nThe dev went defunct not long after the game launched so I doubt you'd be supporting them if you buy it.\n\nThere's little wrong with the game itself so it could be worth a look for 2D platforming fans during a sale; however Sega did give the game away for free at one point (I paid for it) so I find it hard to believe there's many in its target audience who haven't already played it."}]}
