The benchmarking tools in this software really push your computer to its limits. The software is easy to use and doesn't take a brain surgeon to understand. Just pick what level of computer you think you have and the software will tell you if you have a decent rig. You can check your scores against other people from around Steam which is fun. I like it that you can compare your system overtime to see where it is lacking or what needs to be improved. This software has helped me to understand my system more each time I use it. This has helped me to understand my RAM frequencies and see that they were not running at the same frequency which helped me save alot of money. I really recommend this software to any PC guru that wants to get the most out of their system. I would first try the DEMO first since you can get a basic idea of what your computer can do from that but if you want to mess with settings then get the full version of this software. I wouldn't recommend this at full price, make sure to wait till this one goes on sale."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1402120603, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513034", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "10376782", "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197964134361", "num_reviews": 344, "last_played": 1402807207, "num_games_owned": 802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 143}, "timestamp_updated": 1402120603, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Heyyo, Futuremark has been an extremely popular benchmarking software developer for a long time... and 3DMark shows us exactly why. 3DMark 11 shows how beautiful and effective DirectX 11 is with the latest and greatest hardware. The launch on Steam for 3DMark 11 was rocky (couldn't get it to run on my notebook with nVidia Optimus tech enabled GTX 650M) but after direct contact from Futuremark they asked me to test a few different .exe files which worked great and the patch was released to all. THAT, is customer service.
