Remember the fun it was to build your own custom ships on games like Master of Orion? GTB is a tower defense game that's like that for every single unit or turret. From the smallest cheap gun to the big strongholds, from inexpensive recruit infantry to heavily shielded mechs.\n\nDesigning the units is simple, but the management of new and older designs can be a little busywork. But this kind of complexity that usually lacks on modern games is very welcomed.\n\nThe very fact that this games plays as both a traditional tower defense game and an inverted tower defense game is a testimony to its flexibility. It's a robust selection of units with great variation of strategies you can use to beat the enemy.\n\nAt least for me, the fact that you can design, customize and name every unit in the field adds to the enjoyment and creates a very fun experience when your guys are winning a battle. It's just most interesting when that tank unit you built to be fast and strong barely makes it to the finish line.\n\nBuilding units is not everything, and the battles are intense and complex.\n\nApart from the built-in campaign, you can edit your own scenarios, and upload and download challenges from other users.\n\nIf you like Tower Defense games or games with customization, this is a very good choice."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1420954923, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523391", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13936835", "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198122293652", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1421908336, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 269}, "timestamp_updated": 1420955638, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ok, maybe i need to have more time to discover how to use my units correctly (4.4hrs when i wrote this) and maybe i suck ass, but i can't help feel that there is just way too much going on to take in. GSB did feel like that at first but i think what kept me playing that is because i was able to distinguish better what worked and what didnt. With GTB however, it feels more like, \"spam more than the enemy can handle\" kind of game.\n\nWhen i tested out my own custom units as an attacker, i did win, but i couldn't quite make out how i did with what designs were effective and it felt like it was just all about spamming faster than the enemy can place its units down. I did see a couple of units really stand out but that was all i was able to take in and didn't feel as if they made a real impact to the game and was more about having more guns than my enemy to break through their defences.\n\nAs the defender, different story, after a solid 40mins of deciding what to put in my turrets and so forth i used them in battle, but it seems as though my theory of \"the spammier the better\" really came to fruitition as my enemy was constiantly fielding units that eventually meant i couldnt keep up with stopping the flow with the supplies i needed. I admit, i may have made classical n00b errors, such as not using the speed settings to help me better make sense of the battle (D'oh), and i noticed how most of my turrets were fitted into Anti-Armor roles. Maybe i just need to go back to the drawing board like i did with GSB, but honestly, after playing a few games of what felt like \"the spammier the better\", i saw no point and scrapped all of my turret designs.\n\nYou see with Space Battles i was able to figure out roughly where i went wrong if i lost a battle. Sometimes it was a design that ended up being obsolete with enemy designs or not being able to fill the role i intend it to. But with Tank Battles it didn't feel like that at all. It felt more like all of my units were at fault and the unit stats at the end did nothing to help me at all. I just couldn't make sense of all the information being given to me.\n\nThough as i said at the beginning, i probably suck and need to put more time into this game for its goodness to really shine, but it felt like a real dissapointment from its Space counterpart, and besides, i have never been one for Tower Defence style games anyway as i always find the genre having little strategy and mainly focusing on who spams best. Tank Battles seems to be the same story then as always for me, just with customisation of units being a nice feature to it all.\n\n5/10. A game that looked promising along with the customisation features but maybe that is due to my love of its space daddy counterpart. Overall, i am dissapointed, hope i can come back to this and it convinces me to change my mind.\n\nIf you love TD games, this may be for you but may not be exactly your cup of tea, and all the customisation and info that this game bombards you with may put you off in the end, aside from that, i advise you save your \u00a36.99 (\u00a311.98 with the DLC included) for a rainy day and look elswere.\n\nAnd as for me, i am off to play GSB in order to cheer myself up by blowing alien ships up for no apparent reason, at least i can make sense out of all the chaos...oh well...\n\n*readies plasma cannons* toodles."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1372001784, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521434", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "955930", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197982995489", "num_reviews": 308, "last_played": 1470073699, "num_games_owned": 1047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 214}, "timestamp_updated": 1372001784, "received_for_free": false, "review": "ENG:\n\nOne of the best, if not the best tank strategy game on Steam, a simple and addictive game.

You now have to equip something in every slot of your models, you can customize their appearance much more, the battles are asymmetric and you have to control things instead of passively watching, and the different maps provide a lot more variety than the void of space.  I would recommend it more highly except that the battles take so darn long.  I'm sitting there for 15, 20 minutes or more, either fending off waves of enemies or throwing my troops into the grinder, and there's still half the mission to go.  It feels more slog than fun, sometimes.  It just\u2026 lacks something, some ineffable quality that other TD games have.  \nAlso, the unlock system was partially better in the previous one.  I'm many games in, and most of the way done with the campaign, but there are still bunches of things to be unlocked.  The other one gave you points for every victory and you could just buy the things you wanted in the store (often several for a good-scoring mission), but this one gives you one scripted thing and a choice between 2 other equips after each fight.  This is good in that the scripted ones ensure you get the important stuff first, but bad in that it takes a [i]lot[/i] of missions to unlock everything.  \nJury's still out on the balance, but it's replaced its predecessor's \"here are 5 equips that vary slightly from each other\" for any given category with \"here's a small, medium, and large thing - what'll it be?\".  That, combined with the fact that attacker and defender use almost the same gear, means that I'm skeptical of the potential variety.  Will have to play it more.\n\nEd. So, after coming back to it for a while, I don't think my views have changed.  It still feels like your decisions are mostly dictated by the map and your budget, not your overall battle plan.  There's room for creativity in unit design and deployment mixes, but the fact that you can only put guys/turrets/support structures in pre-defined places really limits how you can play the level.  For the attacker, it's even worse, since you have to send your troops down specific routes, and they always seem to get snarled up by traffic jams.  The game lacks any realism in having wrecked tanks block your way, but injured ones at the front of the line will still slow you down.  The attacker is supposed to have the advantage at the start, since they get more cash more quickly, and the defender later, since they never run out of income and keep all their non-destroyed defenses on the board.  However, it really feels in most maps like the defender has an overwhelming advantage from the get-go.  With the right placement of troops and turrets, they can get such a volume of fire in one spot that your line of vehicles, advancing single-file, will get picked off one at a time before they have a chance to do much damage.  And if they have a repair yard nearby, what little damage you do inflict will be fixed in no time.  Perhaps I just haven't hit on the right combination yet, but this seems somewhat shallow to me, as the first one did.\nIt's still not a bad game, and worth exploring for a while if you enjoy this type of thing.  There's a lot of replay value to be found in the maps and the asynch multiplayer skirmishes."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1403259039, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506055", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "10558885", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197966057945", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1403690939, "num_games_owned": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 50}, "timestamp_updated": 1403259039, "received_for_free": false, "review": "a solid game, maybe not the best i ever played but if you can pick it up during a sale it's totaly worth it.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THE DLC, IT'S GARBAGE AND ADDS NOTHING TO THE GAME."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1415200676, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505464", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "12803296", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198048293196", "num_reviews": 22, "last_played": 1415401613, "num_games_owned": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 170}, "timestamp_updated": 1415200676, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I love it.

The ability to customize every unit with all sorts of components and augmentations is a tweaker builders paradise. Reminds me of the fun i used to have designing battlemechs for the board game version of Fasa's BATTLETECH back in the 1980s and 90s. When designing new tanks, mechs, troops, turret defenses etc you have to observe how each one effects the other. You may design a walking mountain of destruction but if its engine isnt strong enough it will be running as slow as a snail giving the enemy plenty of time to tear it to pieces with laser,plasma,canon, machine gun fire among many other lethal forms of weaponery and defenses. Another cool thing about the design process is you can paint your units to whatever paint scheme you want. \n\nSound effects are brutal with the screams of infantry dying in agony as giant flamethrower type canons burn them into charred flesh or machine gun fire creates a field of dead bodies lying in pools of blood. All the while the battle cries of those still living permeate the carnage filled air with combat rage. Giant mechs stomp the ground below them with thundering earth shattering effect. Titanic tanks the size of Keith Laumer's BOLO units crush all with their mighty treads as they blast away at long range with their world destroying arsenal of weapons. \n\nGraphics are very well done with a rpg board game feel to them similar to Steve Jacksons CAR WARS with an impressive level of zooming in where units do not lose their level of visual detail.  Seeing trenches filled with the dead bodies of infantry in pools of blood definitely gives off a visceral thrill of massive carnage reminding me of the war scenes in the future in THE TERMINATOR. Tanks and Mechs burn in smoke trailed flames and show battle damage as they annihilate all in their path to reach their goal. \n\nGame play comes in two forms where you defend or attack. I have never played a tower defense game before but that is what this is supposedly called though to me it reminded me more of mech combat in CYBER EMPIRES by Silicon Knights back in the 1990s where you destroy or defend against waves of enemies. Here the goal is to defend against waves of enemies or acttack while fighting your way across the map to exit thus reaching a certain victory score once enough surviving units have exited the map. This may sound easy but one of the coolest and incredible things about GRATUITOUS TANK BATTLES is its adaptable ai where the game adjusts its combat to your play style constantly changing to your new tactics. All the while the ai never feels like its cheating. During battles you may also end up getting supply drops allowing you to get things like free supply trucks into the field which will add huge amounts of victory points if they make it across the battlefield.\n\nGRATUITIOUS TANK BATTLES if your into designing units and then sending them off to battle to see how they will destroy or be destroyed then this is the game for you."}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1395182074, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505914", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "9555074", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013900410", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1393383288, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 412}, "timestamp_updated": 1395182074, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I bought this game because I enjoyed Gratuitous Space Battles enormously.
