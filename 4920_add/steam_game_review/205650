FINALLY!!  We have an adventure/puzzle game that is very involved and quite lengthy.  Kudos to the team for putting the famous bullet-hole initials VR!  It is such an iconic part of 221B Baker Street, and I am so glad that it was not left out.  First off, the voice acting is wonderful!  Sherlock Holmes is not an easy character to portray as he is quite complex by nature.  Kerry Shale played this role brilliantly.  David Riley was on point with Watson.  If Watson gets on my nerves, then I know that the portrayal is spot on, and he definitely got on my nerves.\n\nGameplay wise, mostly smooth.  There were three different types of views one could use while playing.  I typically do not like 1st person, but unfortunately that is the view I had to use for most of the game.  Switching to 3rd person, a lot of times got Holmes and Watson on a continual walk, and nothing you could do save for smashing a lot of keys, would get them to stop.  In 1st person, there is no issue with sticking or just walking no matter what your commands are.  I loved the idea of actually playing as Toby the dog during one of the chapters, but he also had the same sticking issues, and with him being so low to the ground, it was easier to blow past things that you really needed to see, which caused a lot of doubling back for me through the warehouse. \n\nAll in all, this was a beautfiul game.  While there were a couple technical issues, they could be forgiven with this roller coaster of a mystery that you are presented with.  Just when you think you have it figured out, Holmes finds something out of the blue and it completely changes everything.  Definitely a must have if you like mystery games."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501318237, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506829", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33876015", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198283562416", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1501240615, "num_games_owned": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 802}, "timestamp_updated": 1501318237, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Amazing game.

It has some weaker aspects - the movement system(Third person view) feels heavy and lazy;the animations are simpler; the lip synchronization is one of the worst things in this game. But these can be accepted, due to a independent developer.\nMore important is the story. Gripping and very well written story. Almost from the beginning you feel that something doesn't fit and it gets worse...The puzzles are neither too hard nor too easy. Simply put - interesting and funny. The graphics are decent and the level design is sophisticated. Also voice acting has a very good quality. But the game is a bit too short - only 15 hours to finish it.\n\nPositive:\n- Story\n- Voice acting and dialogues\n- Puzzles, deductions, investigation system\n- Sherlock Holmes\n\nNegative:\n- Lip synchronization\n- Too short\n- Price"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499456068, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33352102", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198048928936", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1499423989, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1712}, "timestamp_updated": 1499456820, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I would give this game a rating of 6/10. It is not a terrible game, but not a great game either, just really mediocre.\n\nThe story starts off intriguing and promising with a reeeally satisfying first crime scene, thus making you really engaged and intrigued into digging further into it. \nLater on though, at some point, the plot unfolds all at once into what feels as out of the blue nonsense and you lose interest, as it seems overly complicated and exaggerated, to the point of being funny. The fact that your own actions have very little to do with the unfolding of the plot also takes away from the excitement and the engagement with the story. [spoiler] Sherlock Holmes starts reciting his deductions based on things that he had found out on his own behind the scenes, that you had absolutely no idea about. [/spoiler] \nThe ending... was not that spectacular either.\n\nI found the puzzles \"elementary\", except for one that I found hard and a couple of others that were a little bit challenging. In general, the puzzles are very easy in my opinion, with no real \"aha!\" moments that will give you that satisfaction after solving them and make you self-indulge in your brilliance. \nI played the game in the \"normal\" setting though, so I am not sure if, by changing the setting, the puzzle difficulty changes. \nThere is also the option to skip the puzzles, which is nice to have for those who can't come up with the solution and would otherwise be stuck and prevented from continuing the game unless they looked up a walkthrough.\n\nThe deductions on the deduction board often make no logical sense and you need to rely on luck in order to choose the right option.\n\nThe graphics are generally good and the voice acting of Sherlock Holmes is good too. I cannot say the same for the character of Watson though, as at times it feels inconsistent, switching from one emotion to the other during the dialogue - for example he may appear very frustrated at Sherlock Holmes and after Sherlock Holmes replies, he immediately switches moods and he sounds as if nothing ever happened. I found that inconsistent and to be honest, rather funny. Watson can also be quite unlikable at times.\n\nI really liked being able to switch on my own accord between the characters at some part of the game and I also liked another variation in the control - [spoiler] controlling an unexpected character as well during the game, a dog, [/spoiler] which spiced things up a bit.\n\nThe game generally takes you by the hand and lets you know what you should do next almost at all times, which makes it very - or rather maybe a little \"too\" - straightforward and linear. Also, at a couple of points you specifically need to examine some things in a predetermined order, otherwise the game will not let you interact with them.\n\nThere are no consequences whatsoever for your \"wrong\" choices. If you are talking with someone and you choose a dialogue option that makes them reply in a negative way, eg. not allowing you access somewhere, you can simply keep choosing the remaining options, as if the previous conversation never took place, which seems a bit weird. \n\nThe cutscenes would glitch and freeze for me - while the dialogue kept on going, the video would not flow normally. \n\nThe achievements are easy to get and you can easily have a 100% completion of the game in your library.\n\nIn general, this game is OK and has some nice moments that keep your interest going through some segments, though not consistently. It provides a means of passing the time, however, without it being an extraordinary exciting game that leaves a strong impression afterwards.\nIt would be best to get it on sale."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499654878, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33420604", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198157124251", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1499654776, "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1254}, "timestamp_updated": 1499654878, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I absolutely LOVED this game.

I loved it so much that i bought this game as a part of the Sherlock Holmes collection with other games.  Since I played the newer games first it took time to get use to the different controls but other than that it is a well made game. The plot makes you suck right into the game and the puzzles are well made and not as hard to solve. The graphics still hold up even after 5 years. I would highly recommend this game and crimes & punishment as it is enjoyable and well made. If you love detective games with puzzles, adventure and point and click then both the games are a perfect treat. As for people that like a little bit of action and QTE in their game then the devil's daughter is a good one to play."}]}
