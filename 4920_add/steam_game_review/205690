It starts off easy, but in a matter of minutes you'll be jumptouching panels as well (meaning you have to jump to the panels without touching the other, normal, panels). It never gets THAT difficult but there might be a couple of moments where you have to think about what you really have to do.\nIt's cute, but in all honesty, I don't think I would really recommend it to anyone (not that it's bad).

That's great, considering the maps are well-established through a Metroid-like interface to keep track of your progress.  You find upgrades as you move along, and though it's easy to take a break, I didn't want to stop playing.  The conclusion feels satisfying as though you accomplished something, but didn't really need to know a lot about why you were doing what you did.  Sound and visuals also demonstrate the simplistic tastes by using shades of grey and soft sounds.\n\n[h1]The Cons[/h1]\nThough it's pretty simple, I wish there was a little bit more.  There's essentially three characters in the game, and though it's more of a puzzle-platformer, there's a [i]very[/i] weak story that just leaves me wanting a little bit more.

I'm pretty sure the game explains it, but obviously not clearly enough for some.\n\nHowever, once you grasp the basics, the game starts to get pretty fun. When you understand Teleport, it gets a lot more interesting. And when you get the Sonar upgrade, the game really takes off.
