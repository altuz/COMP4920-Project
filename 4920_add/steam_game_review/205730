Most of the special abilities you get are very creative and fun to use, my favorite being the buzzsaw. There's not a lot of tutorials or hints, but there's an objective marker and you get an info tool you can point at things to find out how to interact with them.\n\nAll-in-all it was a very good game in my opinion and it's only about 8 hours to play through the entire game and find all of the collectibles.

Yet, unfortunately, for some users there seems to be a problem, that the game just won't go above 30fps. Which is pretty cross, as the game is intended to run in 60fps and gets slower with the framerate. Thus, people who have the same problem as me will play through the game in HALF OF THE INTENDED GAMESPEED. For nVidia users, turning on maximum performance in power management mode works, for amd users, like me, however... nope? I'll remove this text, as soon as a fix has been found.\n\nEdit 2: After having this issue for two years and almost forgetting about it, out of curiosity I checked how well ITSP would perform on the very same machine after I did the upgrade to Windows 10. I didn't change any of the hardware. I just looked into the game and WOW it's RUNNING LIKE HELL! Verified with Fraps - yupp. Solid 60fps now. :) I will let the first edit stay here for reference for others.\nVerdict: Runs great - even better - on Windows 10.
