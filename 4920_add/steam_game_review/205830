Luxor Evolved has bright, neon graphics with a very dark background whereas other Luxor games have been based on Egyptian architecture. This game appears to pay tribute to 1980s arcade classics such as Asteroids, Berserk, and Pac-Man.\n\nThe basics of the gameplay remain the same: you are a scarab at the bottom of the screen shooting spheres that correspond to the colors being pushed by the evil scarabs in an attempt to breach the pyramid. If they do breach the pyramid, you lose a life. What is different about breaching the pyramid from previous Luxor games is that the spheres will move back and you will have to shoot them down again. Previous Luxor games simple rushed the spheres into the pyramid upon breaching the pyramid. In Luxor Evolved the spheres will be rushed past you into the pyramid only after losing all your lives. Making three consecutive matches of spheres will throw up a powerup in the air that you must catch to gain some advantage such as reversing the horizontal movement of the spheres, turning a group of spheres into one color, or stopping the spheres temporarily to give you time to shoot them with less stress.\n\nThe neon lights are accompanied by a retro soundtrack. I think the soundtrack is not very diverse, but still entertaining enough to keep from being boring. As in previous Luxor games, you will find bonus items after destroying a scarab and your scarab gobbles it up in a Pac-Man like manner. There are bonus rounds that require you to take out spheres flying in patterns using your throwing knives. Secret levels are very interesting, but must be unlocked by collecting a fixed number of treasures, including fruits and coins. Survival levels test your ability to withstand several scarabs moving spheres toward the end of the pyramid within a set time. Another new type of level is the boss level. Boss fights require you to shoot spheres into the sphere chains circling the boss\u2019 eye. In the meantime, the boss is attacking with rows of spheres below the aforementioned sphere chain. All of this action is occurring while listening to the techno soundtrack.\n\nIf you are a fan of Luxor games, you will be surprised by the dark background and neon colors presented by Luxor Evolved. However, you will be familiar with the chain reactions that look quite dazzling when a string of three or more spheres are eliminated. I found it quite entertaining to see secret levels showing a Pac-Man like maze and a Berserk inspired background. In my opinion, however, the Luxor games presenting Egyptian hieroglyphics were aesthetically better looking than Luxor Evolved. I first played this game in the Hard difficulty mode and I finished it after 8+ levels. It was unique and a laugh out loud (lol) moment to be able to continue shooting spheres when the closing credits were running. Scarabs were still moving rows of marbles when the game was over and the credits were running.\n\nI think that Luxor Evolved is a fun game for those who enjoy arcade classics that have been remade in modern times. It is a game that will be entertaining for a few hours, but I do not view it as a puzzle game with a high replay value.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1419804330, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517820", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13674570", "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197969811083", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1420860680, "num_games_owned": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 528}, "timestamp_updated": 1419804330, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Quis fazer logo essa avalia\u00e7\u00e3o antes que acabem as promo\u00e7\u00f5es e evitar que algu\u00e9m perca esse jog\u00e3o hehehe.

Luxor has always been towards the runty end of casual, what with taking the least interesting bits from Breakout and Puzzloop and not even really trying to do anything vaguely interesting with anything it does take from. It always, always felt like a bit of a \"yeah, I want a marble blaster but totally not Zuma honest guv\" thing.\n\nAnd yet here we are with a vector reimagining of the game, somewhere in the region of Dark Castle Software or Sokurah's house styles and very, very pretty it is too. Yeah, I'm easy and I'm easily sold on things which glow. I can't say I actually imagined for a second it'd be any good but it is good and I'm not sure I know how to parse that. Sure, it's easy. it's tremendously easy and the difficulty curve is pretty much close to non existent but it's satisfying so that's OK, I think. \n\nIt is, still, Luxor at its heart. You have a bat that you move across the bottom of the screen to fire the appropriate coloured marble at the marble snake thing that makes its way down the screen. But I dunno, whilst the formula remains the same, the stark neon glow, the great sound effects, the classic arcade bonus rooms, it's like someone really took the time to try and make it work as best they good and then make it pretty too. \n\nI like it. I like it a lot and it surprised me. It's perhaps trying too hard to straddle the casual divide but who cares when you've got neon exploding marbles all over the shop?
