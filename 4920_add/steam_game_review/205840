The music really sets the atmosphere and the voice acting is solid. People complain its a short game but a point and click adventure is really about setting the mood as you play out a story and this game achieves that. If you are a big fan of point and click adventures then i really recommend"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502083760, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502654", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34075178", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198016632416", "num_reviews": 175, "last_played": 1361088000, "num_games_owned": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 358}, "timestamp_updated": 1502083760, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is an OK game.
