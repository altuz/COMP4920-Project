Each set of bars will be a different part (melody, bass, secondary, etc) which combine to create the piece of music for that act. This is done using a varying set of tools (directional/rejection, portals, speed up/slow down, etc) and challenges (colors, splitting streams, etc) in order to meet the requirements for each level. It should be noted that while this is a music game, it's NOT a rhythm game.\n\nWhile there's no demo, you can find the first 2 (or 3? I can't recall) Acts on the developer's website: http://www.cipherprime.com/games/auditorium which introduces the core concepts. It's how I was first exposed to it years before it came out on Steam.\n\nThis isn't a game that I'd recommend sitting down and cranking through - you'll knock out a few levels, and then move on to something else.

You use these to manipulate and bend the colour in the level to fill up a kind of \"meter\". For example, you bend the red light to the red meter, and if the flow of the light is constant enough (not just flicking it around), it will stay full.\nEach meter plays a sound, and get increasingly louder as it gets fuller. Each colour makes a different sound when put into its place, you fill all of them in the level and each sound will work together to create a piece of music.\nEvery level and every stage is different and you are slowly introduced to more tools and more colours to play around with.\n\nThe music in this game is great, it\u2019s calm and not to overpowering. The only downside in my eyes would be that if you\u2019re stuck on a level, and I mean really stuck, it can get a little repetitive and annoying. \nI won\u2019t lie, a few points during the game I wanted to mute the game completely because hearing the same chimes over and over had really started to hurt my head. But then again, having the volume up fairly loud is no help.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all that long of a game, but for me it was a good length, I didn't get bored before the finish and I didn't end up saying \"that it?\", seeing as there isn\u2019t a storyline to keep me hooked.
