It's a card game where you play it like a board game and it's up to you to predict what your opponent is going to do and try to react accordingly. \n\nThe most unique part of this game is that you play FOUR cards at ONCE. Every turn, both players! And there's no mana. If that doesn't get you at least interested, I don't know what to say.\n\nPeople talk about grind in f2p, (which is what put me off of HS) and grind is part of RuneScape, so that label almost put me off of this game.
