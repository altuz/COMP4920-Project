Its very deep stat system and occasionally interesting challenge areas and boss fights are quite good, but ultimately these highlights are overcome by extreme linearity, way too many trash mobs, next to no plot, and one of the worst cases of hitpoint bloat I have ever seen in a game (late game there are some random enemies with 4,000 hitpoints. Given that the average character can do 50-100 points of damage per turn, you can work out the problem here). I really love spiderweb games, so I hate to bash this, but this is probably their worst. \n\nOf couse I still forced myself to finish the whole thing on torment difficulty, but that's only because I'm a total OCD, power gaming, masochist (and for all the game's faults, it is refreshingly difficult). Normal people who demand things like \"enjoyment\" and \"entertainment\" from their video games (novel concepts, I know) need not apply.

While Avernum 4 was super difficult and some what hard to follow, in this iteration you play as Empire's scouts, and then the fun really begins.\n\nThese games are difficult, combat wise you'll get your teeth kicked in if you're not careful or prepared. I had a warrior, an archer, a mage and a priest. Having this setup was instrumental to  my easier playthrough. \n\nYou must be aware of what you pick and their stats, as experience may be gained or lost and handicaps and advantages can make battles hard.\n\nExploration was just supreme. It's the best part of this game. Stumbling upon a crypt or a thief's hiding hole and the brief description was the most enjoyable aspect of this game. So many times did I just clean out the entire map to get the best items and supplies (and really, you'll need to!).\n\nThe choices in this game are supriginsly abundant and there are some nice rewards depending on your stance. You must be careful, because some choices may make settlements hate your guts.  \n\nThis game does drag only because the combat is so difficult and punishing. Never did I feel like I reigned supreme until I started abusing the game specifically to give me an advantage. When I finished the game, just over forty hours came up and I felt exhausted. It will be a while until I move on to the next one.\n\nComparing it to 4, I'd say there's a bit more to take care of and the characters and enviroments (well everything looks pretty plain so lets call it regions instead of enviroments) were much more interesting. The challenge areas were far more challenging then 4 and there was a lot of super ancient evils to give the blade.\n\nThere were also a lot of well written quests and dialog. I remember a band of bandits that use a woman to lure you in and after you slay them all she begs for mercy. If only she was so lucky, and when I sealed her fate she burst into tears, and into gibs as she took fireballs to the face.\n\nFor the value of this game, I'd say as long as you can tolerate the archaic graphics, controls and resolution (I had to play on a smaller resolution on my 1920x1080 - you'll be in for one treat.\n\nThere is also a great walkthrough online for this game, and dont be afraid to cheat so long as it makes you progress the story."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1412520420, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510706", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "12376799", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198074180953", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1412558290, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 798}, "timestamp_updated": 1444706298, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Let me just start by saying Avernum is not for everyone.

Normally it's the player deciding in which direction going and how to proceed the story, which has several main plots. This time instead the player is obliged to follow a single path, made by consecutive areas until the final one. The torment difficulty is praticable until a certain point, which I don't reveal to avoid spoiling, but then you are practically forced to switch to a lower difficulty not to be trapped in the middle of the game.

I played a lot of rpg titles, from classics like Eye of the Beholder, Ultima 7 and Infinity Engine games to newest games like Skyrim, Mass Effect and Dragon Age series, and although Avernum does not have fancy graphics, I still think this series is one of the best rpgs ever.\n\nAvernum has great setting and story, great playability, decent length (about 100 hours) and many sidequests and secrets. Leveling up system is balanced and nowadays almost forgotten turn-based combat is a welcomed change from flashy action oriented battle systems. An old-school rpg which proves, that doesn't need \"ultra high detailed\" graphics to create an immersive atmosphere. Highly recommended."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1464896649, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501992", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "23349932", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198157962206", "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1464894223, "num_games_owned": 1162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5444}, "timestamp_updated": 1493072935, "received_for_free": false, "review": "In Avernum V for the first time in the series you play as the Empire soldiers, which are sent to Avernum to hunt assassin of the Empress Prazac.  The gameplay feels almost exactly the same as previous parts of the game (which is awesome), the whole plot is nice, and the same old style turn based combat is entertaining. The game also offers a whole new big region to discover The Northern Frontier, which is really new thing in the series. There is also a deep stat system, alot of (hidden)skill and spells, plus some basic alchemy and crafting system. The only cons i find, is the really small max resolution and kind of linear story, which is unusual for this series.

Some - but by no means most - of the criticisms in that review have been resolved in Avernum 5.\n\nThe A5 engine is better than the A4 engine. However, it is still by far more cumbersome than the old A1/2/3 engine (no auto-combat; keyboard support is still lacking). And I'm still miffed that they took away the town/outdoors distinction. \n\nThe plot is new and reasonably interesting - certainly not a boring reskin of A1 like A4 was. However, it's also somehow more linear and railroad-y than A4, and that's a real black mark against this game. Earlier Avernum games have had their railroad-y segments, like the passage to the Vahnatai lands in A2, but these segments worked [i]because[/i] they didn't last the whole game - they induced a sense of urgency and danger for a short time, but once the danger was past, you were free to roam the open world once again. You don't get that luxury in A5.\n\nThis game is certainly playable, unlike A4, and I do think some people would enjoy it - but I personally wouldn't recommend it. Go play Avernum 1-3 instead - they're still the gold standard.\n\n(But given the improvement from A4 to A5, I'm still willing to give Spiderweb Software the benefit of the doubt - onwards to A6!)"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1343814105, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494831", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2435746", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198007306615", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1339916400, "num_games_owned": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2535}, "timestamp_updated": 1343814105, "received_for_free": false, "review": "More awesome underground old-school RPG fun!"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1492443011, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31201568", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197974462770", "num_reviews": 72, "last_played": 1495133254, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6729}, "timestamp_updated": 1492443011, "received_for_free": false, "review": "\"You are in a maze of twisty little portals, all alike\".
