Like EFTP it's very open world (although a few areas are closed off at the start), but it's biggest advantage is in its stat system, which uses the older skill based system that EFTP abandons in favor of a more simplistic skill tree model.  Plus, unlike Avernums 4 and 5 (which had trouble justifying their existences plot wise), the writing is great, setting the game in a sprawling kingdom in decline and exploring some darker themes like drug addiction, famine, and terrorism.  \n\nA great end to the series.\n"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1398167943, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525207", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9899246", "votes_up": 22, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198000560738", "num_reviews": 800, "last_played": 1398166985, "num_games_owned": 5356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 198}, "timestamp_updated": 1398167943, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Just like its predecessors, this plot heavy game will scratch a hardcore RPG fan's itch.

I knew what to expect but had never played any of Spiderweb\u2019s games before. After finishing, I thoroughly recommend it, with minor reservations.\n\nThe graphics are simple but effective; actually, the sprites can be quite charming. I\u2019ve played Dwarf Fortress and a number of rogue-likes so the graphics didn\u2019t get in the way of my enjoyment of Avernum. The only complaint I have about them is that it was quite a challenge to target enemies and move a tile when there were many characters around you during combat, especially in cramped corridors and rooms. The UI is also a bit unfriendly.\n \nThere are a few issues with combat, imho. It works fine, but it can be very grindy towards the end of the game. I played in the normal difficulty and some of the fights dragged for too long, with enemies that were hit sponges, could hit multiple times, and could summon, all in the same round. I imagine that it must be complicated to balance the challenges in a RPG such as Avernum. I also understand that good games don\u2019t take the player by the hand. That said, after 100 game-hours combat fatigue started to weight me down to the point that I saw myself rushing to finish and avoiding combat (or combat side-quests) whenever I could.  \n\nWhere the game truly shines is in its story. Jeff Vogel (the creator of the game) is a gifted writer. He managed to present the land and its people very convincingly, sometimes in just a few strokes. Although you encounter most NPCs only briefly, their descriptions usually convey them as fleshed, three dimensional characters with a strong sense of their emotions and previous history. I suspect that some of them (and the places) are survivors from previous Avernum games and it must have been thrilling for veteran players of the series to re-encounter them again. I also enjoyed that Jeff avoided the simplistic moral narratives or Manichean accounts of \u201cgood x evil\u201d that are quite common in fantasy RPGs.\n \nIn summary, I\u2019d give the game 8/10 and would recommend it for anyone who likes \u201cold school\u201d RPGs (however you define such an open-ended term). I bought his first installment in the revamped series (Escape from the Pit) and I\u2019m looking forward to play it in the future. Keep up the good work, Jeff!\n"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1390487549, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512667", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8818963", "votes_up": 11, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197990724728", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1437164465, "num_games_owned": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1966}, "timestamp_updated": 1390487549, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The Avernum series is a great lineage of games by a little company.

For instance, if you want to make an attack with a ranged weapon and you're too far away to do so, the game won't just run your character forward, but will instead tell you that you can't attack. A lot of annoying little things that alternate between that and outright balance changes:\n\n*You basically get into combat the second you see an enemy, so you never have time to buff before a fight - you either run through the overworld with buffs constantly on, or give up on them entirely.\n* Clerics get their first area of effect spell very late, and it's a fire spell that rolls around just when you're fighting mostly fire-resistant enemies.\n* Fire-resistant enemies that love to block melee attacks. I never really felt my party was in danger past the early game unless I stumbled into a sidequest combat without being prepared for it, but a lot of the unavoidable maingame combat was horribly sloggy, with the enemies being way more tanky than necessary.\n* The game is kinda balanced so that you get a lot of challenge out of optional sidequests on normal difficulty while unavoidable maingame content is quite a bit easier (if sloggy). Not sure if I approve of that, and the very notion of going through the sidequest combat on a higher difficulty is frightening.\n* Game kinda falls apart in the end. You kill the ostensible main bad guys, and are then left retreading the same ground for a few hours, cleaning up loose ends and doing fairly unimpressive quests until you're allowed to access the endgame battle. An endgame which doesn't even have named enemies.\n\nWith all that in mind, I had a great deal of fun fighting and exploring for about two-thirds of the game, and was invested enough to slog through the remaining third, poor balance and annoying interface issues and all.
