Customize the visual style of every character and weapon in a pixel paintshop and explore randomly generated dungeons, constantly upgrading your skills by expanding little game boards (ala the zodiac in FFXII) that can be switched on the fly for different challenges, and where other characters you've created can be slotted in to support the one character you control at any given time. Combat is a little tight, with awkward hit boxes that don't really emulate Link to the Past or Seiken Denetsu type combat, and takes getting used to, but there's enough things that are unique that I recommend it as a action JRPG. Just probably not on PC.\n\nIf you have the ability to play it on PS Vita, choose that. On PC, try the demo first and try it a few times, because this is the worst port of any game I've ever played and that includes wonky ROM translations. First, though it's a pixel art game, it gets less than 5 FPS on laptops with integrated graphics, the same laptops that can play Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Hyperlight Drifter and so on without issue. Second, even on good hardware the game will suddenly seem to go off its timing so that there's a lag between your input and what's happening on screen. Sometimes it will just fail to load images and all you'll hear is music. Finally, and probably the worst of all, the game will randomly forget your controller mapping, and outright fail to recognize proper xinput from XBox controllers until you delete the settings and rebuild them, at which point it will recognize your controller again.\n\nIt's unlikely the game will ever get any updates for PC, though sales are happening more frequently this last couple years and there really aren't that many games like this."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1345225852, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506842", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "1900538", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197999477940", "num_reviews": 35, "last_played": 1397062822, "num_games_owned": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6897}, "timestamp_updated": 1388298037, "received_for_free": false, "review": "JRPG lover? You want ACTION-Based RPG and not turn-based? Want the pixels? Love to grind? Don't care about the story? Want to customize your charater's appearance from top to bottom? Even if the story is lackluster and if you're in doubt if this game works, just give the demo a shot. \n\nA brief warning. This game is a PSP port and its' multiplayer features is not implemented fully at the moment because the PSP port's multiplayer works in ad-hoc mode (via playing locally). However, if you want a good JRPG game while your internet is screwed over, pick this game up immediately. People outside the JRPG realm?... Hard to say. There is a tutorial on it, but this game will not hold your hand once you get out of Trial Island which is more than enough for me.\n\nThis game can easily fill in 20-40~ hours of gameplay AT THE LEAST. It can go more when you want to reach cap on 8~10 different characters (Level 99 is the cap)\n\nOh, and not to forget to mention there's a Job Changer, so you can do the same grind, AGAIN! And max initial cap of any stat is 999. The universal cap is 9999. So I still got a longggggggggg way to go.\n\nThe learning curve is steep when the \"Magic Circle\" system is into play. Basically, you can stack your sub-characters together with your main character (the one you physically play with), and the stats get transferred to your Main Character while special tiles like \"Growth\" will determine your Sub Character's Leveling Parameters. \n\nIf this looks like rocket science to you, this may not be the game to pass up and if you want a simpler game, I will forward you to Binding of Isaac or Hack, Slash and Loot. Heck, even Desktop Dungeon (its free, and not on Steam). For a roguelike with a slightly higher learning curve, I recommend Dungeons of Dreadmor.\n\nIn addition, I have a 4 1/2 hour stream of a first game impression by me if you want to check that out: http://www.twitch.tv/critical__hit/b/328931483\n\nJRPG Fans wanting a grind?

The game strongly rewards players who find the best ways to exploit its \"Magic Circle\" system, which allows you to line a party of helpers up to invisibly buff the player character. Being able to edit characters and equipment at the pixel-art level in-game is a fairly unusual feature that is also kind of neat.\n\nOn the minus side, the translation and porting of the game lack polish. For one example, the game allows equipment to have up to four random \"titles\", but the names of those titles often bear only a passing resemblance to their functions, and no attempt is made to string them together into a name that makes sense in English -- maybe the titled names make more sense in Japanese? The occasional onomatopoeia is badly done to a baffling degree: a dog bark is written \"gow\" on several occasions. Huh?\n\nFor another, the game's controller support is spotty. My XBox One controller works, but only if it's on when the game is launched. My wired 360 controller doesn't work at all.  In-game button prompts use button numbers 1-6 rather than A/B/X/Y/L/R. It's perfectly playable with a controller if you have a compatible one and translating the prompts doesn't bother you, though, and I recommend this if it works.\n\nIf you can overlook the issues above, and give the game half an hour to start to open up all the mechanics, you will find a lot of RPG-mechanical depth there under the pixel-art graphics and wafer-thin plot. Unfortunately, stability issues I've run into lately on Windows 10 make it necessary to give the game a thumbs-down overall. This game is a sadly missed opportunity for the publisher IMHO."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1395584235, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509886", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9607191", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001762787", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1462570576, "num_games_owned": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 680}, "timestamp_updated": 1395584235, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Though just a bit too pricey for its kind in my opinion, it's one of the nicest RPGs I've seen on Steam, with nice character customization, a variety of weapons, and a lot of nice menu options, such as making a sort of \"aid\" with your other characters to increase your stats and defense.\nThe only con, is that after a while it feels repetitive, and as such, it's hard to really get through if you feel such.

You can jump, you can block, you can slide, and you got a variety of abilities and weapon types at your disposal. There's even a decent amount of finesse and tricks you can do, like cancelling sword slashes into blockings and then jumping out of danger to save yourself, or buffering jumps into short jumping attacks. \n\nThe enemies you face also have nice variety, and do a good job of remaining fairly unpredictable even after you've learned their fighting styles. Another thing I especially love, is that the game incorporates a subtle stealth element. Enemies won't start chasing and attacking you till they spot you, but once they do they'll chase you through the entire dungeon. Attempting to run from an enemy will cause you to rush by other enemies, who will also break into chase. This results in a frantic chase through the entire dungeon as you attempt to escape in time from the horde trying to corner you.\n\nFor customization, you're allowed to create as many characters as you like, selecting jobs, weapons, and abilities. You strengthen their abilities and growth in certain areas by drawing on the strength of other characters you've created. Visually, you can edit weapons and characters (and even animation) of your characters pixel by pixel. Don't be daunted though, because the game uses a great template for creating fairly basic but still cute looking sprites. More artistic players can still create some great stuff though.\n\nThe actual gameplay is basically divided into two games. You can make your way through the static progression of dungeons of the main campaign, which has decent level/dungeon design and is balanced well enough to not require any grinding. Alternatively, you can take on a massive 100 floor randomly generated dungeon, which feels more like a rogue like. \n\nI personally love the randomly generated dungeon, the way stealth, combat, traps, and preparation are balanced is fantastic. Unfortunately, enemies increase in level ridiculously fast as you proceed through the floors. Eventually your attacks will do 0 damage, so it's really quite impossible to clear the dungeon based on skill alone. While making it as far as you can and escaping with random rare loot (you lose everything if you die before making it to an exit), is plenty exciting and skillbased, it's still ultimately a long term process to clear it the entire dungeon itself.\n\nClaDun X2 is still a fantastic game, plenty fun, and allows you to play and create your characters to suit your needs.
