This mostly has to do with how you are controlling a giant mutant blob. Precise is not exactly how I would describe how it moves and controls, which is fine, but don't make me try and steer this thing around instant death traps please.\n\nIt is also an EXTREMELY short game. Even trying to get every collectible in sight and the hidden pals I still beat it in under 4 hours. It won't affect my score of this game though as I don't generally dock games for length, unless it's extremely egregious given the price/style of game. But it is still worth noting.\n\nDespite the flaws it is still an immensely fun and charming game. The final level is hilarious.\n\n3/5"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1497453125, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505582", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32412160", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198050269651", "num_reviews": 41, "last_played": 1497524197, "num_games_owned": 1461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1266}, "timestamp_updated": 1497453125, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great platformer from the creators of magnificent Guacamelee.\nThere are cards, achievements, leaderboards, points to collect and secret friends.\nYou play as a blob who has to eat in order to grow."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1495866207, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500353", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31989625", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198009654132", "num_reviews": 76, "last_played": 1495869594, "num_games_owned": 1632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 122}, "timestamp_updated": 1495866207, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack is a casual/platformer-puzzle with cute design and fluid controls.\n\nPros:\n+ Game mechanics\n+ Controls\n+ Visuals\n+ Level designs\n+ Fun\n\nNeutral:\n~ Sfx and soundtrack is shallow\n~ A bit short\n\nCons:\n- Too easy.
