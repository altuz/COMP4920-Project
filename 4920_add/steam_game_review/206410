Help a crazy inventor build wacky contraptions to cause a chain reaction in order to achieve specific goals. This review includes the [i]Collision Course & Mental Activity[/i] and the [i]Gadget Fun & Tricky Riddles[/i] DLCs.\n\n[h1]\u26a0 [u]Description[/u][/h1]\nThe [i]Crazy Machines[/i] franchise is the spiritual successor to [i]The Incredible Machines[/i] where, just like this one, you build devices \u00e0 la Mouse Trap best explain with an example: Drop the ball which flips a lever, which turns on an engine, which activates a conveyor, which moves a box, which pushes a button, which turns on a toaster, which pops a toast, which hits a switch, which lights a torch, which ignites the rocket you've been trying to launch. You get the idea.\n\nYou have a series of Puzzles you must solve by figuring where to put the missing parts in an incomplete contraption. There are also Challenges which gives you a base setting from which you build contraptions of your choosing to achieve the goal. Then, there is the Editor which is a sandbox free play you can assemble contraptions of your own design.\n\n[h1]\u263a [u]Pros[/u][/h1]\nThere's a large variety of parts to pick from when building your contraptions, each of which will react to multiple elements and can serve different purposes: a torch can ignite fuses, heat boilers, or even serve as a light source for solar panels, wood planks can serve as shelves or walls, can rotate on axles, or light up on fire, and so forth. This is in addition to the environmental effects such as wind, weather, and even gravity that will affect the results.\n\nGraphics are bright and colorful, each part being distinct and easy to recognize. The user interface is further simplified with quick access to any item description, just hover your mouse over it to get a quick description of the part and a list of elements (fire, electricity, rotation, light, etc.) it can interact with, making the game very accessible.\n\n[h1]\u2639 [u]Cons[/u][/h1]\nDevelopers probaly tried too hard to be original with the parts. I mean, objects such as flying saucers being attracted to planet-looking balloons, or weather machines that launch lightning-bolt-spitting clouds, are quite a departure from the traditional \"home-made contraptions\" the attraction for this game usually comes from. Even the aesthetics are items built on plywood sheets in a backyard or a brick wall, instead of the basement laboratory theme  people have come to expect and love.\n\nDifficulty has been dropped from past games by a milestone. The 140 Puzzles are way too easy to figure out, you are given the exact amount of part you need to complete it, the background limits the locations you can place them, and there are floating cogs you must collect which serves as additional clues to show you exactly how you should solve it. While the Challenges give you more freedom to solve theme, there's only 30 of them.\n\nThe reason people have always come back to such games was to design contraptions of your own, but here, you are limited in the quantity of parts you can put by an arbitrary currency and value-based parts. Furthermore, the goal of self-made contraptions is to design puzzles of your own, choosing which parts players can use to complete it, and what goals the puzzle has, yet there is no way to export and share them with other players, so what's the point?\n\n[h1][b]Verdict[/b]: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 - [i]\"It's up to you.\"[/i][/h1]\n\nIf you wish to recreate Pee-Wee's Breakfast Machine from [i]Pee-Wee's Big Adventure[/i], this isn't the best iteration for it. Still, there are plenty of puzzles to pick your brain to keep you occupied, at least for a time. Veterans might not find their fill, but it's an easy entry point for those who never played these games before, the target audience I am recommending it to.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n[i][b]This was just my opinion.[/b]\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CJsOpinions/]reviews[/url].[/i]"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504298841, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34668937", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_reviews": 1973, "last_played": 1504298805, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1504298841, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Tags: Casual - Mechanical & Assembly\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Abandonware Grade.
