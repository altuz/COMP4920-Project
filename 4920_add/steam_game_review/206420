My review is based just on my experience from playing Saints Row IV Game of the Century edition, as a review for a game should be. \nNoting on some key-point elements of the game:\n- You have a vast free roam map of several districts, each district with it's own theme, military, industrial, domestic etc. It's a trully sandbox experience. \n- You get the feeling that you have so many things to do, follow up on the main quests, catch up on some side quests, try out your newly aquired weapon or skill, roaming free around the city delivering mayhem on the streets, killing countless of innocent pedestrials just because...you can. It's up to you.\n- The controls are pretty straight forward and simple, but actually effective, with the exception of driving the motorcycle and flying the aircraft.\n- At the start of the game, and later on in specific stores, you are given the opportunity to customize your avatar in ways I never thought I would see in a game. That is all I am going to say:)\n- The variety of weapons and powers it's impressive, plus everything is upgradable. There's a bit something for every taste and style. Also, there is a number of challenges that, when completed, provide you with very usefull upgrades.\n- The story is interesting, with twists and developments. I was tempted to take on the next main quest, just to see what would happen.\n- Despite it's light and humorous atmosphere, if you dont take your enemies seriously, there are times that you might actually die, I find this a good thing, otherwise it would had been a bit boring.\nOverall it's a pretty fun and exciting game, full with content that will keep you occupied for over 100 hours, at the momment of writing this I'm at about 60% of completion."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507116823, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504677", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35469235", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198260467928", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1451666947, "num_games_owned": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1948}, "timestamp_updated": 1507116823, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Not worth the money, if u have played Saint Row III before...\n\nNote : Believe me Saint Row III is better"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505705989, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507193", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35038180", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198038677251", "num_reviews": 36, "last_played": 1505738676, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 69}, "timestamp_updated": 1505705989, "received_for_free": false, "review": "remember when the game was about gangsters and the hood ? ahh the good old days"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504714285, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34778414", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198285517123", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1504806659, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1276}, "timestamp_updated": 1504714285, "received_for_free": false, "review": "you can get succ from a robot which is basically a core from portal 2"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504642462, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34763846", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198051362289", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1505790410, "num_games_owned": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2562}, "timestamp_updated": 1504642462, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Dirty, non-sensical, over the top, hilarious fun.\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505083220, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34872601", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198082014509", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1429450122, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 858}, "timestamp_updated": 1505083220, "received_for_free": false, "review": "6.5/10.\nWas very cheap when I bought it, making it a 8/10.\nWas very fun for a while.
