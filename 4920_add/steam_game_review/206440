Most of what could've been said has been said already - but I'll try anyway\n\nThis game is beautiful - from the stunning, atmospheric music to the gorgeous pixel art. The game itself, in terms of gameplay, is rather lacking, but it makes up for it with its emotionally jarring story, which, while simple, can definitely be a tear-jerker. \n\nIf you want to experience this game the way so many others have, I highly recommend playing at least an hour before you decide you want to quit. The six hour experience is a long time, but definitely worth the wait. \n\nAnother small thing where this game is lacking is with the walking speed, but that can't really be helped.

I finished it because the reviews were so positve and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Now I know. It was not worth it. \n\nPros:\n\nThe story was very thoughtful and original. I haven't heard of any other game, movie, book, etc that explores this last wish memory adjustment concept. It had an unexpected twist 3/4ths through and some feels. A++ for the story. That was the only thing that kept me going. \n\nThe artwork was very well done, colorful, and overall impressive for the format. Personally, I do not like the sprite style. That was a hesitation when I bought the game, but I was willing to give it a shot. Nah, I just don't like it. If you like sprites, you'll love this. \n\nMusic. Yes, the main theme is really nice. Generally the music supported the feels. \n\nCons: \n\nThe pacing was dreadfully slow. This game has almost exactly four hours of content. You can speed that up a bit by tapping through all the dialogue, but you can't speed up the ponderously slow panning, animations, walking, etc. Be prepared to spend some time just waiting because you don't have any other choice. \n\nThis was a very story driven experience. The minigames were not needed and were just in the way most of the time. Its not like I got some sort of reward for solving them them faster or more efficiently so what was the point? I have enjoyed good minigames that added to the game experience - these did not. \n\nThe navigation. So bad. I'm talking about just walking around. I shouldn't be blocked by a *small* plant if I'm trying to get across a half acre property. And the entire screen shifting suddenly to track with the player in the center. Because you could only move up/down or left/right, it was so distracting. If I tried to use the mouse to direct teh characters, they would not go farther than about 6 tiles without needing more direction. Why was this? The player controls and navigation were what I hated the most about this game. \n\nTLDR: \n\nIf you want a sweet boy+girl story, you like sprite animation, or just want a low-impact diversion for a few hours, you may like this game. If you want something challenging or faster paced, this is not for you."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506651155, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35279567", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197980344955", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1501636352, "num_games_owned": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 266}, "timestamp_updated": 1506651155, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I read reviews for this game and how this guy cried and this girl cried, and everybody cried and I don't cry because thats a sign of weakness.
