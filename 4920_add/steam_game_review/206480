There is none of that level scaling crap in this game which has become a trend recently.  It is all leveled content.\n\nThis is one of the few games which I install every time I have to do a re-install of Steam for what ever reason.\n\n\nThe Game;\n\n\nThe world is huge, to be frank.  AD&D has access to areas of the Forgotten Realms region that, I assume most of us are familiar with, as well as the main city hub of Stormreach, and several huge explorer regions.  For instance, when you get into the Forgotten Realms Campeign setting, you gain access to Evening Star, and eventually gain the keys to the city. If you don't want to be there, then you can go to Stormreach, the Kings Forest, or even the Underdark.\n\nThe game has all of the usual enemies which you would associate with the AD&D world, including Dryads, Dire Bears, Kobolds, Druids, and Drow.  The enemies are plentiful, the loot is plentiful, and the traps which can be powerful enough to kill you in one shot, are also plentiful.  \n\nIt is a true AD&D game in every way.\n\nThe amount of loot that can be acquired from various quests is so expansive that I cannot list them all here, but there is everything from +5 Daggers, to +6 Docents, to +1 Kite Shields, to specific, named loot.  It turly is immense, and the amount of ways to get that loot is even more expansive especially considering the depth of the crafting system, and the wilderness areas which contain specific bosses who can be farmed for fat lewt.  On top of that, farmable item sets of great power can be farmed in Evening Star, simply by farming event tokens in the Kings Forest.  That only takes a few nights to get, and you are essentially fully geared.\n\nThe quests are plentiful for both groups, raids and solo players.  The main issue with that however, is that the servers can feel a little empty at the minute, but to help tackle this issue, the game does still receive constant new updates.  Later this year for instance (2017), the development team will be releasing the Ravenloft expansion pack.  Besides which, you can cut the need to do low level content out by purchasing the Shadowfell Conspiracy Expansion Pack and start from level 15 with a heroic class.  Furthermore, a lot of the content does not require a group, so there is nothing stopping you from playing solo, scene as every class has access to certain spell casting and healing items.  With all that said, the game is ageing well, for a 10 year old game.\n\nThe highlight of this entire game however, is the level of character customisation.  Every character can be specifically customised in a variety of ways, whether it is through the character generation screen when you first start, or through the epic destiny system, or the tallents trees.  \n\nFor instance I play a mage, that might sound boring at first, until you realize that I play a 20th level Eldritch Knight / Pale Master with 7 Epic Levels in Draconic Lineage.  That makes him one bad ass character in both melee and for spell casting.  The range of spells available are not only equal to anything in the original 2nd edition AD&D rule set, but also exceede it, because of these epic level spells and the abilities granted through the tallent trees.\n\n\nUpdates;\n\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the game is constantly updated, and always in the right direction.  New raids, new quests, new player races are added, and a whole plethora of other things are usually added.  THERE IS NO NERFING which is important to mention, because the trend these days seems to be that if something is deemed too powerful, nerf it and that is usually your update in other games.  That doesn't happen in AD&D DDO.  Instead, we get new raids, new quests, new loot, new hero classes and races, in otherwords, content that we actually ask for.  It is all done right.  \n\nI would highly recommend buying both of the available expansions packs however.  In particular, The Shadowfell Conspiracy DLC is well worth purchasing on F2P accounts.  If you plan to do some F2P gaming on DDO, especially as a solo player, without having to pay a subscription fee, buy that DLC pack before you do anything else.  I will tell you why below.\n\nThese are probably my two main gripes against the game.  \n\nI don't like the fact that you may feel like you are forced to buy content packs to get the most out of the game if you don't want to subscribe to DDO, or want to treat DDO as entirely F2P, but you can work around this by buying the expansion packs instead.  \n\nThe only times that locked content may be a pain though, is if you are farming for specific loot, and that loot is only available in a certain part of the game world that you do not have access too, or when you may want to do a quest with your friends, and you don't have access to those quests because you haven't unlocked them.\n\nMy other gripe is that I really don't like how Spell Points are regenerated via Rest Shrines.  Rest Shrines can be used every 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or once only, depending on the difficulty setting.  This isn't a problem really for classes who don't use spells, but since many of us do, SP management becomes critical, and that is also the chief reason why I chose to play an Eldritch Knight.  Even when my toon runs out of SP, he can still go melee.  The SP elixers should also drop much, much more frequently in game, and I don't think that they should be listed on the store in all honesty.  Selling Spell Point recovery pots may be seen P2W, and may put potential new players off DDO.\n\n\nSubbing Vs F2P.\n\n\ndon't bother subbing over a long period of time, it is not worth it.  The only real benefit to subbing is the \"free\" DDO store points that you get each month.  \n\nThere is a better, cheaper way to unlock most of the games content on F2P accounts, wihtout ever having to pay a subscription fee;\n\n1:  Buy the Shadowfell Conspiracy Pack.  This will unlock a shit load of content and allow you to start from level 15, as a heroic class character.  This will also make a lot of the lower level, locked content worthless.\n\n2:  Buy the Menace of the Underdark Pack.  This will unlock the Forgotten Realms setting as well as the Drow Race and Druid Class, and give you a permanent xp boost for your account.\n\n3:  Use any store points given to buy the \"Hall of Heroes pass\" so that you can transfer between Eberon and Eveningstar without having to fight Lolth on a new toon each time.\n\nSubbing for a year would cost well over $100.  Buying both of the expansion packs and the Hall of Heroes Pass costs around $50 and you will unlock a lot of the base games content.  you then have access to that content forever, without ever having to pay a subscription fee and can start a new toon at level 15, with access to those campeign settings instantly, forever.  \n\n\nConclusion.\n\n\nI can whole heartedly recommend this game at the minute.  I am slightly nervous because news broke recently that the Development Team were teaming up with Daybreak Studios, which is a bad sign in my book, but still, I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, for now simply because I enjoy this game so much.  \n\nIF DAYBREAK do anything to harm the success and longevity of this game, I will never have anything good to say about that business again, and I will probably hate them until the end of my days.\n\nFor now, I will continue to actively support this game, and I do plan to buy the Ravenloft Expansion pack later this year, if for no other reason than the goodies it should contain.  Hopefully, aside from the new content, it will include new heroic races, Experince Tomes, and DDO points.  \n\nWe shall have to wait and see though, how well this unholy alliance with Daybreak plays out."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485385516, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515346", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29491710", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198030156753", "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1486580962, "num_games_owned": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1355}, "timestamp_updated": 1485567199, "received_for_free": false, "review": "In short: \nI strongly recommend this game WITH 2-4 friends in tow. Otherwise, given the current state of the community, I strongly recommend against it!\n\nNote:\nSome folks are having problems with becoming a subscriber or purchasing in the market. This is a problem with the Steam launcher. To circumvent, you need to go to your Steam folder ...\\steamapps\\common\\Dungeons and Dragons Online\\ and run TurbineLauncher.exe.\n\n\nThe long version:\nI had thousands of hours of gameplay prior to acquiring on Steam. I have recently returned to check it out.\n\nDDO, iirc, was the first Western mmo to go f2p-microtransactional. With Daybreak Games acquiring publishing rights recently, it's unclear how bad microtransactions will become. The claim is that DBG won't have undue influence, but this could easily be pushed into the P2W zone.\n\nThat said, DDO remains the \"unique\" mmorpg out there. Nuts-and-bolts it was built with grouping, suspense, problem solving, humor, quirkiness and discovery in mind, rather than grind or plain action. In its prime, it had 4 core group roles, with a nod to a fith: tank, healer, dps, trapper and a lil' bit control. The trapper was essential for finding and disarming invisible traps and unlocking key doors.\n\nFor newcomers who find a balanced and patient/dungeon-crawl group, the experience is unparalleled. DM narration, complex dungeon/mission mechanics (vs simple boss scripting), puzzles, and slower pacing really do rival your most acute PNP nostalgia.\n\nLike all mmorpg's, however, the dev team has allowed this to degrade into solo'able content, or dps biased grouping. But unlike other mmo's, the original experience is still viable and worthwhile!\n\nThe graphics aren't 'modern,' but they have always had an ineffible charm."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486045124, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509682", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29649561", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198007684968", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506053750, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 980, "playtime_forever": 10783}, "timestamp_updated": 1486045124, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This MMO is very different than other MMOs on the market, so it's mostly a love/hate case.\n\nPersonally I find it very relaxing and i like its gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated if that bothers you.\n\nThough the gameplay is pretty good and requires teamwork in later levels."}, {"votes_down": 14, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486818424, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517327", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 28, "recommendationid": "29847104", "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198070024786", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1451229088, "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 100029}, "timestamp_updated": 1486818444, "received_for_free": false, "review": "it's okey"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485808501, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505058", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29592379", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198003139563", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1505607367, "num_games_owned": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 28007}, "timestamp_updated": 1485808501, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have to say this is my favorite MMO of all time. I have played off and on since 2006. The game is just different from other MMOs. The dungeons and combat have a way of making you feel like you are in the world. Trapped down in a dungeon. At times you will find yourself just barely getting through a dungeon. The best way to enjoy this game in my opinion is to get a small group of friends (2-6). Even if it's just two of you. Only play the game together if possible, and only run dungeons on elite. The joy of experiencing a fresh dungeon with a few friends, and not knowing what is around the corner is much of what this game has to offer. That feeling of getting one shot by a trap is beyond anything I have seen in a MMO. The game suffers from a few balance issues, but it's acceptable given the amount of customization it has to offer.

Not because it's D&D; I don't care about that. DDO has the most complex, demanding, and rewarding game mechanics I've seen - by far. The dungeons are carefully crafted to [on the hardest settings, which you can control completely when subscribed] require intense strategizing: if you screw around for a second, if you don't think your way through every moment, you will fail. But, when you learn the system, and set the difficulty correctly, it's also completely fair.\n\nThe dungeons provide an extremely wide variety of carefully crafted strategic situations, and regularly surprises you as everything suddenly spirals out of control due to intentionally placed surprises - this, however, becomes a nonexistent factor once you've played through them once [changing trap locations aside]. The intitial dungeons [levels 1-3] aren't a great example of my claims, especially on F2P, since you won't be able to increase the difficulty to the hardest settings without first playing through the easier [normal, hard, elite] settings. But, give it time. The game is also stellar for team-play: every class has dramatic strengths over other classes, which when combined, make your team that much more powerful.\n\nThough I personally consider this game to be, mechanically, decades ahead of all other titles, it has many flaws. \n\nThough the mechanics are extremely complex and fair [both the character building system, and combat], the game nevertheless has a wide variety of minor yet annoying bugs. Game-breaking? No; if we exclude the atrocious hireling AI. I don't recall ever being deep in a brutal dungeon and losing because of a bug. Nevertheless, you'll just have to get used to issues which have always existed on this old engine. Nothing to be done about it. \n\nAnd while the mechanics function correctly, and are precisely fair, there are a wide variety of issues when it comes to understanding them: there is very little explanation of how many of the mechanics work [even ddowiki, which is your best source of information, has blindspots], so you'll be spending allot of time researching from multiple sources. For example: If you want to multiclass, which opens an extremely wide variety of game-play styles, there's very little information ingame about it - even simply sticking to one class can be a very complicated process. And, ontop of all that, many tooltips for spells and skills are incomplete or blatantly inaccurate.  \n\nAnother issue to keep in mind is that the game can be a serious money-pit, even when carrying a subscription: there are numerous convenience upgrades which can only be bought with real money. Though many of those upgrades can be earned ingame through simply playing, are available as long as subscribed, and a subscription includes currency which can be spent toward those upgrades.\n\nAll that aside, when deciding whether or not to commit, keep in mind that I have understated the complexity of the system, and that you will have to learn a great deal if you want to play on the level of difficulty which I love. Also that, to be completely blunt, you will need to play with at least 2 total people - ideally 3 or more, if you want to get the most out of the game. Though you can simply turn down the dungeon difficulty, and use \"hirelings\" for most situations while soloing, there are nevertheless many which demand specific classes and multiple people. There are plenty of player groups [guilds] to join. \n\nIn total: If you're the hardest-core strategist, if you love extremely tight team-play, this is the absolute best option for you - though remember that you need to carefully calibrate the difficulty settings, and your second playthrough of a dungeon will remove the surprises. Still, it's a flawed masterpeice; you will have to take the bad with the good.\n\nTo whomever was in charge of building this game's mechanics: I consider myself in your debt, for the joys you've granted me.

Throw Dice at it...more dice and eventually you may find a different result.   This game like the Tabletop version is very Team oriented and much like the Tabletop experience. At Low Levels Non-Casters thrive, but at High Levels It is those with a Casting Ability that really start to take the Lead.  Some will find this system of standing in a room and holding down Left Mouse Click to kill something...Tedious...Boring...Overdramatized when it should be contact with enemy produces some kind of visible reaction from the enemy whether I miss or not...I have friends who have told me the exact thing. This Game and its mechanics are not for everyone. \n\nThe Pay to Play Thing: Yes some classes are Paywalled but everything can be obtained through lots of hard work. Turbine points are given for in game progress but can also be purchased. Quest Packs are purchased and unlocked in the same way. So is the Druid Class. If you have a subscription you get all the Quest Packs and 500 Turbine Points a Month.\n\nThe Pay to Win Thing: Now there is an opposite side to these Turbine Points. Not only do they unlock classes and quest packs, but they also allow you to buy ingame Convenience Items that make most of the game; Stupid Easy. Like Resurrection Cakes that let you Free Rez inside of a Module, or Items to allow you to Craft Epic Pieces, Unlimited Lockpicks, you name it.  While This is not cheating it does fulfill a model to create revenue because at the heart of any MMO is a Business and Businesses need money. I do not fault their decision to offer items like this, but it irks me sometimes at their offerings.\n\nSocial Mechanics: Given the age of the game and that fact the Devs are still pushing out content (Turbine and WB are somehow still producing stuff) and the mostly active community. The Social side of DDO still has enough active guilds and Power Runners who've literally memorized the maps and quest sequences that you are bound to find a group if you look hard enough.\n\nFinal Thoughts: So this game was made a while ago. By today's standards it is like World of Warcraft in that it should be scrapped and a completely new, graphically intense game of the same name needs to replace it, like yesterday. \n\nThat being said I am a diehard D&D player and DM so part of me knows the frustration of trying to Disable a Trap and then roll a 1 and get completely obliterated. The other part of me knows...this type of gameplay is not a positive example for a RealTime Game like DDO.\n\n100% Watch Low and High Level Gameplay before you Get a Membership.
