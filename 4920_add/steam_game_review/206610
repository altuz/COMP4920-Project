They catch your interest with the 3D and the camera mode but that feature doesn't work very well. The screen moves around whenever you move your head, even slightly and in stead of it staying in the direction you are looking (like it is supposed to) it pops back to center. And its really useless. It doesn't help with gameplay or make it any more interesting, it just rotates the screen back and forth. Who can concentrate when your screen is swinging around?
