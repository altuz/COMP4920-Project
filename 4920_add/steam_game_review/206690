They don't respond to praise, they don't respond to complaints, and they DEFINITELY don't respond to bug-fix requests.\n=-----------------------------[/b]\n\n[original review follows]\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED due to game-breaking bug which prevents the game from correctly going into fullscreen mode; leaves the game basically unplayable. (Even the best available workaround leaves you in a situation where you click stuff in the game and it doesn't respond -- because the graphical coordinates are messed up and the game does not register that you are clicking in the correct spot!)\n\nThis affects (at least) Win 7 and Win 10 (both 64-bit), running AMD GPU.\n\nOther people have reported this issue as well and devs have evidently not fixed it. Nor does reinstall/reset config/etc. fix the issue.\n\nI have played the other game in the series and I played this one for a while before it got stuck in this glitched mode. In general I enjoyed them and my feedback about the franchise would be positive except I can't recommend a game that's going to break and not let you play it. :| Especially when the devs have abandoned it."}]}
