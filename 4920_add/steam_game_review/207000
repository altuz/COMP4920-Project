His butt's shiny and he's got his cute little poses through the game.  Don't let that fool you though.  He's still a freaking spider and as such, he can be a bit of an asshole.  \n\nThe idea is simple enough; get through the levels using your jumps and webs, slinging yourself from tree's and such, all while collecting little glowing orbs.  There's obstacles to avoid, such as rolling rocks, thorns, mushrooms and such.  Like I said, puzzle platformer 101.  All in all, this game play's not too shabby!  It can be fun and it is most definitely challenging!  It's got some big problems though.  \n\nGranted, these problems may just be my skill, maybe it's my third party xbox controller.  The controls are kinda of tough from time to time.  The main mechanic of this game is shooting your webs in mid air to attach to tiny platforms, using your momentum to throw you across gaps and obstacles.  Your webs do not always shootin the angle you want them to though.  There's times where having to restart check points feels pretty cheap since you would have sworn you used your right stick to spit webs in just the right angle, just to have it shoot straight up. \n\nThe controls aren't game breaking, but they're certainly frustrating.  A bit of a blemish on an otherwise cute and fun puzzler!"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1408430347, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505862", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11776299", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198091419830", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1408593326, "num_games_owned": 566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 76}, "timestamp_updated": 1408430347, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I purchased this game thinking it would be fun.\n\nI was right... for roughly ten minutes. While the tutorial is excellent in helping you understand the basics of the game, the programmers obviously decided to make this thing WAY too difficult WAY too soon out of the starting gate. Granted, I'm playing on a keyboard, and i'm not used to playing platformer games like this on a keyboard. So OBVIOUSLY, i'm a bit out of my depth here. However, My big hang-up on this game is, without a dout, THE DIFFICULTY. \n\nThe core design of a good game, say for instance, Super Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog, is the start the gamme off blaringly easy so players have a decent time getting the hang of the controls and getting used to the gameplay mechanics. Graphics, sound and the little moves the spider character put on for the end-of-level theatrics is acceptable, and I could get by with those alone in a normal game. But here, the difficulty comes NOT from a decent, well-paced challenge, but from the game forcing you to essentially crab-scuttle with your head bowed to the ground at ALL times to make sure you \n\nA: Don't miss anything\nB: hit all the right jumps and web shots PERFECTLY\nC: DON'T. FRIGGING. DIE.\n\nwhich is AGAIN, where this gae fails: THE DIFFICULTY AND HOW EASY IT IS TO GET KILLED. Once again, looking at Mario & Sonic again. Both main characters have at LEAST a health counter: Mario has one hit in small form before death, 2 if he's powered up, while Sonic MUST have rings in his possession at ALL TIMES in order to stay alive. Not having a life bar is fine if the character is made to die in one hit, but they LEAST the developers/designers/WHOEVER could have done for this game is to PACE the difficulty apprpropriately by the world and current stage. Stage 1-3 SHOULD NOT, AND I REPEAT, SHOULD NOT BE the stage that kills any desire to continue.\n\nI played that one stage for nearly a half-hour, retrying over and over to make SURE I hit everything perfect and NEVER died, and STILL ended up dying close to fifty times, ending up with 0 points before i gave up and shut the game off.\n\nThe mark of a GOOD game, folks, is that it is enjoyable, entertaining and makes you WANT to not only finish it, but replay it again and again while NEVER losing its playability over time. This game Is, as I've said, enjoyable ONLY for the first ten to fifteen minutes, is only entertaining while watching that litle spider prance around like he's got something to prove, AND makes me want to NEITHER finish NOR replay this game EVER.\n\nHints to the developers: Take some time to go back and recode the game. Judging from the reviews and comments you've gotten, this could be a VERY GOOD title, if not for the flaws that have been pointed out. Some hints would definitely be:\n\n1: Adjust the difficulty scaling and retool the earlier stages accordingly. World 1 should start off easy and get to low/mid-grade diffulty by the boss. World 2 should pick up from World 1's ending, bumping up the difficulty JUST enough to keep players on their toes and getting up to mid/high-grade difficulty by the boss. World 3, again, should pick up from World 2's end, bumping up JUST enough to keep attetion strong and finish with a boss that's challenging to beat and will leave a sense of accomplishment.\n\n2: Addition of a display/graphics menu option would be a VERY handy feature. I'm not big on full-screen gaming, as I tend to have multiple things going on over two screens; taking up one SPECIFICALLY for the game and nothing else is annoying, but with no option to fix it, there's nothing I can do save for \"alt+tab\" every time something happens.\n\n3: ADDITION OF A LIFE METER. Touching a MUSHROOM kills you in one hit? Are tips being taken from the NES title \"Action 52\" here? Because there was a HELL of a lot of that going on in THAT title; I know because I've played it. Being able to take multiple hits willl DEFINITELY see an increase in playability; would you EVER want to play a game where you have to play the entire game PERFECTLY without dying once? the infinite continues from save points feature is nice and works, but having to start BACK from where I JUST was every time I die AND having to collect ALL the same items again and AGAIN is NOT fun, it's tedious and frustrating.\n\n4: The controls need work in general. I find the character does a lot of gliding after directions to move have halted, and the jumps are awkward and hard to aim. half the time, I end up BARELY making my mark, while the other half ses me plummeting into a death trap. The web shooting mechanics need some tweaking also; as long as I shoot from the ground, i should be able to hit and connect to my target; why would i EVER need to jump to hit a target the size of pea with webbing? I've never seen Spiderman having these problems, and he does everything either from a stand-still or while STILL IN MOTION. \n\noveralll, I'd rate this 3.5/10 due to the numerous game-breaking flaws. And if the save-deleting bug i've read about is real, then the score will be going even further down. You can't make a game, find out it's bugged and in need of work and just decide to leave it as is; people WANT to play this, so come back and fix these problems, for the love of all things GAMES!\n\nThank you in advance, regardless of whether you read this and/or take action or not.
