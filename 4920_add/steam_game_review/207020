Like Sprint meets Excite Bike, meets RC ProAM on Steroids. It has some flaws, like the catchup sometimes or either being too easy one minute and extremely unforgiving the next. However, if you see past those minor gripes, it's fun even with the short story. I do like they added story attributes which is new for this genre to me. Wouldn't mind a more refined sequel or some DLC episodes with more vehicles and tracks."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1497168434, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "32336935", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198175651133", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1497168241, "num_games_owned": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 30}, "timestamp_updated": 1497168434, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The game has problem with unaccpetable low framerate=slideshow.\nAnd it is not yet fixed.
