Sinking bullets into suitably varied enemies and bosses produce particularly satisfying explosions.\n\nOverall the game provides a good initial feeling. Then there's everything else.\n\n[h1]Old-school for all the wrong reasons.[/h1]\n\nPoorly laid out mission structure inflicts lots of unwelcome pausing in between surprisingly short interactive segments. The game constantly yanks control away during frequent, repetitive and uneventful transitions.\n\nThe story is lazily delivered via bland walls of text in between missions, without effort to bring the game's world to life. Too many different pilots, each somewhat unique but none of them developed enough to generate any attachment or personality.\n\nStiff controls remain too imprecise to navigate tight spaces. Mistakes become punishing when you find yourself constantly chasing lost power-ups in a ship often not fast enough to catch them back. No permanent upgrades or customization options in the main campaign.\n\nRunning out of time blasts your ship instantly for no valid reason. Enemy projectiles spawning out of thin air sometimes shatter your ship in the middle of nowhere.\n\nI was expecting a better, probably more accessible and certainly more cohesive package along the lines of Raptor or Sky Force Anniversary.
