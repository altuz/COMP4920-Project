The movie was fantastic, but you can get the movie for far less then $10. Heck, you can rent/buy the movie on amazon for $1.99-4.99, or buy \"The bastment collection\" by edmund mcmillion for $1.99 (Plus shipping) and you get the movie, 8 games, artwork from said games, etc.\nSteam is ripping you off with this movie, so check some other sources, becuase I know that I wish I had known this sooner. \n\nThat said, the movie was great, it will be boring if you aren't into the indie game making process, or the games they're talking about, and it's a tad dramatic, but that makes it more entertaining."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498661352, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511979", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32939183", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198111561903", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1498824765, "num_games_owned": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 115}, "timestamp_updated": 1498661352, "received_for_free": false, "review": "After watching the movie, it is safe to say that it is sending a message no matter what form of media you are working in.

Obnoxious self entitled developpers that cash in before delivering the product then treat their own customers as abusive beggars, bundletrash greenlight asset flips with trading card economy was just one step away. It is an interesting movie, for some reason I find Phil Fish the most psychologically interesting on a documentary although I would actively avoid him if I knew him personally unless I was his therapist or something. All in all, not a bad Movie, but its relevance has waned significantly and it clutters the library"}, {"votes_down": 24, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1495491104, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491832", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "31908646", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198194154351", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1458619050, "num_games_owned": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2656}, "timestamp_updated": 1495491104, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This flim is 99% about Phil Fish whining and complaining and 1% about independent game development \n(The Team Meat commentary is like the only good thing about this film)"}, {"votes_down": 37, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1496725068, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454306", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 23, "recommendationid": "32213702", "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197999372741", "num_reviews": 21, "last_played": 1472564852, "num_games_owned": 1400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 248}, "timestamp_updated": 1496725068, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Not enough sex scene tbh."}]}
