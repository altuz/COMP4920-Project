Moving quickly on my next game we have Stellar Impact.  I\u2019ve made it a point to go back into my library and find old games like this to review with a hope to find them better than I left them.  Many times I approach a game like this expecting to only spend a few hours with them before issuing my review because nothing has changed or the community is now dead.  Many times I am proven wrong\u2026this is not one of those times.\n\nCreeps in Space:  So, what kind of game do we have here?  Essentially it is a MOBA that meets space combat in a 2d plane.  In many ways this might have been more at home in a naval environment but I\u2019ve played many 2d space games that I\u2019ve enjoyed greatly.  Instead of champions we have ships and skillshots are replaced by\u2026skillshots with big cannons I guess.  To be honest I\u2019m going by my memory here and the tutorial I replayed because\u2026\n\nDead Space:  Okay, let\u2019s get this out of the way\u2026the community is dead.  In the several days I checked the servers I never saw more than a handful of players and never saw any public games to join.  To make matters worse there seems to be no way to play against bots which is a shame because when I played this game originally it was an interesting take on the MOBA Genre.  You will see a few vocal players shouting that the game isn\u2019t dead but it really, really is.  I know it may suck but if you want an MOBA there are much more popular ones out there but this one did have a glimmer of originality.\n\nFlashing Lights:  Due to the game being several years old and from an indie developer as well I want to give the game a pass but I can\u2019t.  It just feels like a mobile game in almost every way.  Now that I think of it, this game could make an outstanding browser game or mobile through a tablet.  The game defaults to 4:3 resolution which immediately concerns me whenever a game does that, the graphics really don\u2019t push in any meaningful direction (slight pass as you want your MOBA to work on any system).  I\u2019m fairly sure my cell phone could handle this game.  I was planning on droning on but really all this is moot, the community is dead and there really is no way to play offline (bots).\n\nTo be honest this review is a bit like the game, dead and really a waste of time; like the game, no one will probably read this.  I am mainly doing this in an attempt to formulate my thoughts on games like this that have now died out.  Back to the case at hand however, don\u2019t buy this game, wouldn\u2019t even recommend it for free unless you have a good set of friend who would want to play it as well.  If you do, I hope you enjoy."}]}
