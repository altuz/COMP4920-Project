The variety of environments and monsters is not too high, but the level layouts keep everything fresh. Especially noteworthy in my opinion are the puzzles, there's a ton of them and they kept being interesting and creative.\n\nMassively enjoyed playing this game!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505270373, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34912100", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198060030151", "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1471794668, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1200}, "timestamp_updated": 1505270373, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Punching giant snails.
