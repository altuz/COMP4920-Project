Would rather stick to Flatout:Ultimate Carnage.\n\nReview: AI is annoying, the car combat through overheating is unsatisfying and clunky, the musical tracks are annoying, the tournament mode likes to get you stuck in silly objectives it wants you to accomplish and the tournament combat is the worst because of all the different overheating types and the indirect method of fighting is very unsatisfying. Xbox 360 pad responds correctly. Game looks just okay, will age badly very very shortly as more racers and technology improves. The cartoon enemy taunts are not very credible or fun. The whole thing feels rather juvenile. I am basically slating this for permanent removal as soon as I review something in the same genre that surpasses it."}]}
