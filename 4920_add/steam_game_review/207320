You ever had to rebind your keys for a JRPG? I rest my case. \n\n- Played [the last boss] all night, in a romantically obsessive sort of way. Then I see it getting light again outside, and it stops being romantic and starts being sad. But soon, at about 5:30am, I beat him. \n\n- My heart hasn't been beating that hard in... [?]\n\n- Maybe sleep deprivation is affecting my judgement here, but it seems like that was pretty much the most incredible boss fight I have ever played. I'm comparing it to Megaman Zero and ZX, Iga Castlevania, God of War... I guess Megaman ZX comes closes, but so much of the excitement in those games is beating the boss guantlet, committing all that time before you even get to the actual last boss. Oath's last boss is self contained. You die, you start again at the beginning of the fight \u2014 and after, what, 4 hours, it was still incredible fun. \n\n\nI can't wait to play Origins."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505264945, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502475", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34911243", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198160868511", "num_reviews": 265, "last_played": 1505265519, "num_games_owned": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 422}, "timestamp_updated": 1505264945, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Without a doubt a worthy remake of the original action JRPG masterpiece Ys III: Wanderers From Ys."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505449773, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499550", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34963846", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197991157647", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1478746174, "num_games_owned": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5579}, "timestamp_updated": 1505449773, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I gotta admit, this is a game I grew up playing on the SNES, although at the time I believe it was called Wanderer's of YS 3 and not Oath of Felghana. I always worry whenever a game gets switched to an isometric or 3d playstyle from a 2d side scroller but this one was perfectly executed. They captured the same challenges as the first game, the movement and combat are fluid even jumping around. I do admit that the ring system on the SNES version gave you a few more abilities you could use opposed to what we have now but I also understand their design decision because they were going for a more action packed, fast to play game style.\n\nIt all worked well. I mean I admit my first playthrough picking hard difficulty may not have been the best choice. I raged, oh boy did I rage LOL. But I won! That satisfying feeling of winning something really difficult can't be beat. That is what the developers did right with this remake. They captured that satisfying feeling of victory with fast, action packed gameplay that didn't depend on game design that punishes you for 'dying' by making you waste time backtracking. You die? Jump right back in and try again gives it that arcade feeling where you get addicted and just keep putting in those quarters until you finally win and shout YES! WOOHOO! I'M AWESOME!\n\nI have absolutely no complaints about the gameplay at all. If you don't like your games to be difficult, this isn't the game for you. If you appreciate a challenge and feel the victory of overcoming such challenges is a sweet reward, you will love this.\n\nAs far as the story goes? Well I had to install some mod to get the voice acting from the PSP working here. I really liked the voice acting and the story overall is pretty good. It's really your stereotypical hero who conquors evil with some really nice twists. I can't call it the most riveting story ever told but it is absolutely enjoyable, at least to me.\n\nAlso the music... wow. The composer did a fantastic job with the music score in this game. It's so blood pumping and at times emotional and makes up some of the best music I've heard in the industry actually. \n\nThe Art style? Well it's an isometric 2d style, top down camera, pixel art and level design giving the illusion of 3d but I can really appreciate this style it's colorful and creative.\n\nLastly, the level design. Many of it feels maze-like with some hidden secrets. They did a pretty good job capturing that old school level design we appreciated on the SNES game. But it isn't so maze-like that you can find yourself lost and going around in circles constantly.\n\nYs: The Oath of Felghana is a masterful recreation of the SNES game Wanderer's of YS 3 and i've enjoyed every minute I spent in this game thoroughly and will continue to support Xseed's future YS projects."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505279841, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499550", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34913602", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197970513770", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1505279351, "num_games_owned": 1133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 45}, "timestamp_updated": 1505279841, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Review is listed here.

Luckily I can say that this game is nothing like Dark Souls II (except for the marketing campaign which thinks that difficulty is a good selling point and a \"consult and FAQ already XDDD\" achievement are funny) and I really cannot understand all the reviews complaining about this game being unnecessarily hard. I played on normal, which I think is the intended difficulty and I never had a problem with artifical difficulty the only thing that I can think of that comes close, is that the hitbox of one of the 2nd boss' attacks is b\u00fcllshit when he's in his last phase. The dungeons themselves are pretty easy, thanks to the carefully placed save points, but the Bosses are the real challenge. The Bossfights are hard but always fair. This game really forces you to learn all the patterns of every boss in and out. If you don't know how to deal with an attack of a boss, you're dead. That's it. You can't afford to not know how to deal with all of the enemies attacks, as this game has no healing during bossfights, meaning that if you take damage, you will have to continue with your reduced health for the rest of the fight. One thing that always annoyed me about Dark Souls (even though I really like Dark Souls, or at least the first half of it) is that you always had to make a \"corpse run\" from the last bonfire to a boss and while this mechanic is okay the first few times, after a while it gets really tedious and loses its point of making you learn the level. This game doesn't have that, you restart the fight instantly and can die as many times as you want without any penalty or downside. You can learn the boss' patterns as long as it takes you, even if it takes you 100 tries. This game doesn't really put an emphasis on this but you really, really need to carefully scan your environments for loot because having the best possible equipment at all times is key to victory. This also means that you should constantly keep your equipment upgraded to max. Regarding the story, it's about as cliche as it get's and while all the characters are likeable, they have about as much depth as a puddle. But still, the story does it's job and doesn't get in the way of the gameplay. The soundtrack however is an absolute masterpiece, it fits all the situations perfectly, gets you pumped up and just sounds great. As for the controls, I strongly encourage setting the magic button to one of the shoulder buttons as that way it's much easier to charge magic and use your sword at the same time. Otherwise they're perfectly fine, every button is rebindable and you can chose which connected controller you want to use. The graphics are dated but the pre-rendered sprites look great and allow for some detailed enemy designs, also this probably runs on a toaster.\n\nOverall I would give this game a solid 8.5 out of 10"}]}
