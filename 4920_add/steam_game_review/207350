I watched the Playthrough with Toal to get the full grip of the Story. \n\nI started my first Playthrough with Yunica because... Why not. The Story is wonderful and the gameplay is top-notch. I Love the Gameplay, the artstyle and everything surrounding it.

There are changes in the story, enemies, puzzles and bosses for each character, however, the locations are identical and it can feel very repetative. I still managed to enjoy myself regardless.\n\nThis was my first entry into the Ys series and for the most part it was excellent. \n\nIt looks like more Nihon Falcom are slowly making their way onto Steam and I couldn't be happier. Trails of Cold Steel and Ys 7 were just recently ported onto Steam and Ys 8 is very close to getting its PC release. Keep em' coming guys!"}]}
