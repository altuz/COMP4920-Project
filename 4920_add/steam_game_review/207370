I got it as part of a package on a huge sale with all the eXceed games, which essentially made this free. I wouldn't really reccomend buying it on its own, unless you like older styled windows based STGs, or only want to spend $3. After initially launching the game, it ran at 55 fps, which made the game very slow paced. Follow the link below and you can get it running at 75 fps:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/207370/discussions/0/846965882777043479/\n\nFor the English translation patch, the process is the same but select the new .exe file. The game feels cluttered in its visual design, and the enemy placement often seems a bit lazy, but it has cool ideas with bullet patterns and is a lot of fun. Some of the patterns look ripped straight out of a CAVE game! Not having the bomb clear the screen of bullets doesn't really make sense to me, I still don't really understand the special move mechanic, and its not grabbing my attention enough for me to want to really learn it, but it has its place in my heart."}]}
