New ones keep coming out, but I always find myself returning. The aggressive style of shooting and ramming mixed with the colour changing mechanic paired with the great rock soundtrack always begs ONE MORE ROUND!\n\nI know it's old, low resolution, ugly, doesn't support d-pad movement, the makers went out of business long ago and that no one will read this, but I don't care. I'm doing a disservice if I don't at least write down my love for this game.\n\nAnd how much do I love it? If an HD remaster came out tomorrow, I'd buy it for a hundred bucks, and I wouldn't think twice. It's prefect in every way but one\u2026 The stage five boss, seriously, **** that thing and **** it's swords.\n\nIt's balls to the wall action packed and there's nothing like it on the market today (as apposed to Ikaruga's more puzzle like play) and the highlight of the Exceed series. The fact I had to learn every tiny detail of the game on my own makes it very special to me and I hope (although it'll never happen) that one day it gets the love and remaster I dream of."}]}
