The added mechanics on top of the classic brick breaking mechanics really add up for a genuine fun gameplay.\n\nPros:\n* There's a magic bar which you fill up with brick drops; magic is used to cast mainly 4 different spells, fireball, wind, cannon ball and fairy ball (you move the ball and it also slows it down).\n* There are bonus rooms and stores you enter by colliding the ball against doors in the levels. You must collect keys in order to open these doors.\n* Enemies and boss battles.\n* You help rebuild a village with money donations in exchange of power ups for the next level, e.g. a security wall.\n\nCons:\n* There is no in-game tutorial that explains all this to you. The explanations can be found in the settings though.\n* Intense and a bit unfair difficulty ramp in the last world and boss.\n\nNot many cons to mention. I'm really enjoying the game :D"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498930230, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33093051", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197995233482", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505685047, "num_games_owned": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 170}, "timestamp_updated": 1498930230, "received_for_free": false, "review": "fun pinball game with a twist and cool theme!"}]}
