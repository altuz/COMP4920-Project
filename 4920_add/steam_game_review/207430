For several reasons.\n\nFirst, there is no inventory system, so the classic roguelike gameplay element of picking up resources to take with you and making decisions on what you need most and when to save them vs use them is nonexistant.  \n\nSecond, success is completely reliant on loot rng to find the correct enchants/resists on random items.  If you happen to not find the correct resist for a given quest, you will lose.  If the dungeon is being stingy and happens to not give you any food to restore hp, you lose.  If you get lucky and find all the OP stuff right away, you probably win.\n\nAnd lastly, the whole 32 characters to unlock thing is a bit of a lie.  There are actually ~3 characters, warrior, archer, and mage.  There are 32 variants of those, not characters themselves.  Each character has a different weapon/armor/start stats, but they are the exact same otherwise. This system is actually a bit of a downer, many of the games quests are basically impossible with the starter classes, but become objectively easier once you unlock some strictly better variants.\n\nAnd tbh, there are better roguelikes that have been in developement for decades, still going strong, that are free and better than this.  I typiccally love roguelikes, gave this one a fair shake, and found it to be far too shallow for my liking."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1495591299, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509989", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31927406", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971275585", "num_reviews": 76, "last_played": 1359792000, "num_games_owned": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 89}, "timestamp_updated": 1495591299, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Way too much RNG and unlocking new characters takes too long.
