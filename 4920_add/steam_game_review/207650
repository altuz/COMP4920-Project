It was challenging but really enjoyable and intense with all of the creative obsticles you have to deal with, including eachother.\n\nLiked the music so much, decided to save it to winamp so its always in my collection. It suits the game well, with upbeat techno. The art is simplistic but gets the job done, everything visually is clear so the only one to blame for failing is yourself, there's no cheap deaths in this game.\n\nThe versus mode is kind of strange, a bit like bomberman but not really something to keep coming back to. The only thing the game is missing to me was an online mode, but we still managed to beat the game in local multiplayer before he had to catch his flight."}]}
