The first levels were quite nice - nothing special and pretty far from what I expect from a \"music game\" at the same time, but still nice. Then I got bored. And then the final levels came. They are ridiculously hard - not challenging, just annoying and badly programmed. I found it impossible to finish the last one, but my masochistic mind told me to do it and get all the achievements. So I tried and I tried, and I tried, and I tried. And suddenly I had to thank the GREAT programmers of this FANTASTIC GAME because hey, you can pause the game and still link these damn notes! What a relief. What a joke.\n\nI finished the game and still got two achievements locked - \"500 Notes\", \"250 Max\". So I kept playing this \"pause and link\" game, making it my worst enemy... And then I found out the game is not saving your achievement progress. You have to launch it and keep playing it until you unlock these achievements. And guess what? Even they are bugged (I got it after over 600 notes were placed and over 300 max length chains detonated)...\n\nSo yeah, I wasted my time on this game as it ironically became a challenge to me and activated my \"achievement wh*** rage mode\".

Unfortunately this isn't the case.\n\nIt uses an RNG tune with RNG bonuses/penalties mixed in with the blocks. And unfortunately you can't intentionally miss penalty blocks (such as speed up) as that counts as a hit against you. So 1 hit against you vs 20 hits from a poorly timed speed up. Which might not be so bad if you had time to actually look at blocks to see what they do.\n\nMost of the time though I'm just scrambling to connect whatever before it hits the bottom and then get the wonderful surprise of a block splitting at the bottom and giving me 2 penalities. :D\n\nThe other problem is that the mouse curser is so tiny that if you don't get the connections perfect the first time, you don't have time to fix it and one or two mistakes is enough to keep you from passing the level.\n\nThere are endless modes of each level, but I'm not sure what the point of those is because they don't really help you in any way except to practice a level you've already finished.\n\nUnless they change something (which I doubt since this game is a few years old) I'd say just skip it.\n\nThere's better things you can buy for $2.\n\nEdit: Also, I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but you can play the game while it is paused. I have Hold to select/Release to detonate as my control scheme, and I can select blocks while the game is paused.
