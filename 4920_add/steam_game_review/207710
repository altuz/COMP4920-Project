I'm not sure what I was expecting from this game, but I didn't get it. I completed all of the levels (except for the few bonus ones that I didn't unlock through normal gameplay) in an hour. Sadly, I was just glad that it was over. The graphics are great, but the gameplay is very simple. It plays extremely similar to many [i]iPhone[/i] apps. There's some nicely created single-frame cutscenes at the beginning to warm the player up to the game's universe.\n\nYou progress through a series of levels, in three different worlds (with a fourth promised soon), and can get up to three honeycombs as a ranking -- this game's version of the three stars used in many similar games. You defend against enemy bugs using about five different spells, with each level allowing usually one or two specific spells. Spells are cast using a mouse movement, such as a downward stroke from the clouds for lightning or a rightward stroke from around your character for fire or ice. Some enemies explode, or release icicles, allowing for combos which are needed for high scores and to conserve your limited spell reserves. \n\nInitially, the enemies simply serve as target practice to launch your spells and get a feel for the game, but as you progress through the levels, they start moving towards your base in larger numbers. If one enemy gets past, or you run out of spells before all enemies are defeated, you lose. Most levels I was able to clear in one try, with a few taking multiple tries. If you wanted to shoot for perfect rankings, though, the game would be a challenge.\n\n...and that's about it. To me, this game was hardly worth my time playing, let alone shelling out $5 for. Fortunately, I believe I purchased the game on sale for something like $1.25 or $2.50. [i]Bumbledore[/i] is not necessarily a [i]bad[/i] game, and you might even enjoy the game for a short time, but I cannot personally recommend it for purchase or play.\n\nBest regards,\n\n- johnmyster"}, {"votes_down": 16, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1385944491, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509686", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "7873267", "votes_up": 27, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198004859598", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1362643200, "num_games_owned": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 48}, "timestamp_updated": 1385944491, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game has it all.
