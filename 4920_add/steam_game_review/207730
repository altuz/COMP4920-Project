You get very few buildings. Are not allowed to build a base or gather ressources. Instead of a hero you make a small squad of robots, try to maneuver them around kill neutrals level up and try to opportunistically mess with your rival. There seems to be a capture the flag element with barrels or I assume you could just level the enemy base. Either way its not a compelling experience in today's market. Especially since the fighting agains the A.I. will never provide an experience similar to playing against a real live person."}]}
