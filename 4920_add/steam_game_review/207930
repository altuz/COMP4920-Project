Half the time your toon is not on the spot you think he is.\nAm I hitting this guy or not? Am I picking up this health ham or not?\nWho knows? Just roll the dice and take your chances...these are not the signs of a good design.\nThe controls aren't great. The feel of combat...not really there. I feel like I'm wacking paper with a ruler with each hit.\n\nI would give some props to the art style, except it's super simple in a lazy way, not in a good way.\nWe're fighting the same NPC over and over, they could have at least put some effort into it.\n\nMuch like the fighting in this game, it's a good swing, but a big miss.\nGo play D&D Shadows of Mystara or Golden Axe instead.\nBetter yet, get Dragon's Crown when it hits PCs everywhere."}]}
