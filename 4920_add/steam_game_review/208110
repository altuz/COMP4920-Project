While it is nice to move around freely, the graphics were terrible.  I enjoyed MYST and Riven because of the detailed, immersive environments, even if you had to move from spot to spot.  Furthermore, the clues, or lack thereof, in this game was mind numbingly irritating.  Nothing else in the franchise left you with so little to work with.  Finally, the story was far from engaging.  The constant interruptions from Esher were unnecessary and stalled gamepley.  Honestly, I am surprised this was made by the original developers as it missed the mark so badly."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1492784464, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490649", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31276019", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198099016363", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1492784498, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 451}, "timestamp_updated": 1492784464, "received_for_free": false, "review": "this is the worst myst game...    everything was terrible.  so sad it was the ending...   ;P\n"}]}
