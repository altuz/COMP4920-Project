However, the bad part of the game is that it's not newbie friendly. It takes you much time to learn how to play with it, and if you are not very experienced, you may not be able to beat up an easy AI empire. Also, the game weights competitive more than storytelling. I would suggest you not to play Endless Space if you are to enjoy a \"space opera\" SF game (not derogative).\n\nWhile playing, you can actually feel your empire growing stronger and stronger, at a faster and faster speed. This is what technological advancements is like, this is the part I enjoy the most.\n\nYou can play a berserker while using Amoeba, a pacifism empire. Of course, that's reasonable, because your empire is a reflection of your will. If you want to play a berserker, so you can.\n\nDiplomacy is boring. The most interesting part is to develop and evolve, but not other empires. They are just targets of your outraging fleets.\n\nAbout the DLC Disharmony: it's worth to buy it, because this DLC actually increases the game contents. The Harmony species have different game experience. While other species relying on the Dust, they declare war on the Dust, and can actually erase it during later game. Again, feel strong from technology, this is the point SF strategy charms."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505306443, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421172", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34918770", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198164016808", "num_reviews": 36, "last_played": 1507097844, "num_games_owned": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1694, "playtime_forever": 3247}, "timestamp_updated": 1505306443, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game for relaxing and continuing your galactic dreams of conquest!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506058139, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501125", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35120854", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198042826327", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1498123903, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2394}, "timestamp_updated": 1506058139, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I think this is the closest game to galactic civilizations.

Dust is a concept that instead of being another boring version of a currency actually has relevance to the lore. The lore also remains consistent too in relation to Endless Legend. The humour is quirky and funny, without trying too hard. The factions are fleshed out enough and different enough to warrant playing each one at least once. Technologies actually have descriptions and names that aren't ridiculous. If you are interested in worldbuilding then this is a great 4X game for you.\n\nThe soundtrack is also another equally impressive aspect of the game and tend to give a real sense of sci-fi, mystery and wonder when exploring the galaxy and coming across remnants of the Endless and other civilisations. The Flawless Theory track is the most iconic in the tracklist and will definitely get stuck in your head. The Endless Choir will become a catchy motif through both Endless Space 1 & 2 and Endless Legend and is the most symbolic of Auriga and the Endless. Fans of good soundtracks will certainly enjoy this game.\n\nShip customisation is rather fun once all of the designs have been unlocked and one is able to experiment with the designs. Custom ships can be created out of a single blueprint to enable specialised units such as exclusively siege based craft or carrier ships. However once a certain point is reached, your advanced fleets can annihilate the enemy fleet every single time and sustain almost no damage (that can be instantly repaired by having a couple of specialised repair vessels in the fleet and spamming the nano repair option for all three battle phases). This can make the game tedious in later stages as the only way to not win a military engagement is to not upgrade your fleets or research the techs. The combat certainly isn't terrible and the AI may surprise you sometimes. \n\nThe hero system also works good enough to mean that they are useful, as good administrators really make the difference, particularly in huge solar systems late game, and skilled fleet commanders are less required but still useful. The game can be very challenging when you first start and the tutorial doesn't help much. Not colonising enough planets will certainly cause you a lot of trouble, but so will overextension, which goes without saying. Diplomacy isn't fantastic, but certainly better than any in the Total War series, as the AI will actually sign trade agreements and trade resources (albeit sometimes at ridiculously outrageous prices). \n\nTrade in the game is rather simple and could be more varied and perhaps represented by cargo ships on the map for a bit of flavour, but colonisation is decently fleshed out with anomalies and wonders being placed on random planets. The system ownership is rather unfortunate however, as claiming one planet in a system of six means the entire solar system is controlled by that faction, not allowing for much deeper conflict - you either take the entire system in conquest or don't. There is also a limit of six planets per solar system, which should perhaps be higher at least, and with more planetary types. \n\nA custom faction can also be created with a large amount of options to choose from, but the factions created for the game are very flavourful and tailored to specific playstyles enough already. The games are also extremely customisable, with several galaxy sizes, shapes, ages and other features.\n\nAll in all, the game is balanced rather well. It is definitely worth buying."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506907550, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501362", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35401235", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198032006795", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1480792554, "num_games_owned": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 482}, "timestamp_updated": 1506907550, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Over the years, I have played several dfiferent Sci-Fi 4X games.

It adds nothing to a formula that has probably existed since Masters of Orion. Granted, it is not as generic, and no where near as imbalenced, and Galactic Civ.
