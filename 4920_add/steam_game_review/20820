Guess again.\n\nI'm on the fence with Shatter though. It's fast-paced, slick and has a killer soundtrack, but I feel the gameplay is a little watered down by the fancy extras they've introduced. In many respects, I'd say it's more akin to those side-scrolling arcade shooters than a brick-breaker, so feel it'd appeal more to those fans.\n\nA curious modern take on the Breakout-style games (or 1-player Pong). It has the familiar 'bounce the photon to knock out blocks'... only with tons of explosions. Because who doesn't like massive explosions? The ability to gamble your lives by adding multiple photons to the field is also pretty neat. Artistically, it's a masterpiece and looks exceptionally sleek and sharp. Stunningly intense for an arcade game. And if there's one thing I can't fault... dat soundtrack. [i]DAYAM[/i]. Talk about getting you pumped.\n\nIronically though, in trying fill an ordinarily laid-back brick-breaker with 7 metric tonnes of OOMPH... the actual brick-breaking is, by-and-large, shoved to the wayside. You get all sorts of new block-types, but tend not to notice them as you can just shred through it all in under a minute with the ability to push/pull the photon and unleash a Gatling-gun special attack. You can get so swept up in the slow-mo explosions that you look back and realise you have no idea what just happened. As such, the regular levels are pretty much hollow formalities leading to the boss fights. Oh yeah, there are boss fights! And they are, at least, pretty well-made and nicely challenging.\n\nIn many respects, I feel the game was limited in being a brick-breaker. The devs have tried to spruce something up which doesn't lend itself well to HIGH-OCTANE-PLUGMEINANDCRANKUPDATVOLUME meaning that, in order to fit the look-and-feel, it had to be warped so far beyond comprehension that it's not particularly recognisable any more. So perhaps a bit more look than substance, but you cannot fault the developers for trying. Maybe not one for those who want an in-depth brick-breaker. But as a pumped, upbeat arcade-style game with sublime graphics... yeah, why not."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1494683569, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31724692", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198024230479", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1494769515, "num_games_owned": 1022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 255}, "timestamp_updated": 1494683569, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One of the best breakout clones I've ever played and the music is top notch modern retro. \n\nThe game features story mode, time attack, Co-op and multiple other game modes, controls are perfect with either a controller or keyboard and mouse. \n\nI can't recommend this enough especially who those grew up in the eighties.\n"}]}
