Especially with the shoulder mounted flashlight which makes these exponentially easier.\n\nThis version gives you an easy way to run both Doom and Doom 2 though over the terrible to play standalones which is the highlight of the collection.\n\nI'm not a fan of The lost Mission at all.

Now that we have that out of the way, let's begin.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReleased in October of 2012 and working as a sort of \"Doom Anthology\", Doom 3: BFG Edition was released at a peak moment of worry for fans of id Software's seminal shooter; The last game in the series came out in 2005, with Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil, and Doom 4 (later simply titled DOOM) was extant only in rumors and hearsay, not physical content. Those who have played the original, both on its native PC and the Xbox console will know that it was a remarkably frightening game, with a slower pace, pitch black lighting and enemies that literally jumped out at you, with RoE adding to that. Despite that, BFG Edition feels... Bland. Blase, almost BORING in how it's presented - a simple application of id Tech 5's superior lighting model to the old, almost decrepit halls of the id Tech 4 tech demo. Don't get me wrong, however, I appreciate what this game did for Doom 3, though I feel they went a little too far. But what do I mean by that?\n\nFor starters, the opening hour or so of the vanilla Doom 3 campaign is FAR too easy compared to the original. I don't know the full reasoning behind this, but I'm sure it was to make Doom 3, which would strangle players who used ammo supplies too recklessly, a more welcoming game to start. At its core, this makes sense - the majority of people who would buy this game are going to do so on console, where they might not have lightning quick reaction times. Normally, I would't have a problem with this if NOT for the fact that Doom 3, albeit with minor alterations, was released on the Xbox with no changes to the difficulty. In addition, the campaign for RoE is neutered as well, for there is a section of that game where you must traverse a dank, wet sewer system wearing a gasmask using O2 bottles scavanged from your slain enemies. Later on, an entire segment of Hell was carved out of the game, a segment that WAS LEFT UNCHANGED in RoE Xbox, again for perceived difficulty, which I find mind boggling.\n\nBut enough about that. In addition to Doom 3 and Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil, BFG Edition includes a new campaign of seven levels titled \"The lost Mission\", which... Is nothing to write home about. Aside from a new story and new characters, it's nothing special. On top of that, the Xbox Live Arcade versions of Doom and Doom II are included, but even THEY have problems, such as a wonky soundfont for the music and weird audio balancing for the weapon SFX. In closing, Doom 3: BFG Edition is a nice gift from Bethesda, made with the intention to keep Doom alive, but in the end it was pointless, at most forgettable, which wasn't helped by the fact that the Doom modding and multiplayer scene was still alive and well at the time of release.\n\nDoom 3: BFG Edition. An unecessary installment with the intent to revive a franchise that was never dead to begin with. While it's a good launching point for those new to Doom, I personally don't recommend it."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504647874, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485577", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34765143", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198021800223", "num_reviews": 94, "last_played": 1505566292, "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1130}, "timestamp_updated": 1505414581, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Doom 3: BFG Edition is a juicy action heavy on content old school First Person Shooter for a cheap price of one game.
