Avernum is a land underground, a subterranean nation full of rogues, misfits, and brigands, struggling for survival and wealth in the monster-infested darkness. \nYou have been banished to the underworld, never to see the light of day again. \nThe surface is ruled by the cruel Emperor Hawthorne, master of the Empire. All of the known lands are subject to his brutal command. Everyone who speaks out, misbehaves or doesn\u2019t fit in is cast into the dark, volcanic pits of Avernum, far below the surface. There, you are expected to die, a victim of starvation, horrible monsters, or simple despair. \nBut not all of the Avernites have surrendered. With magic and steel, they are forging a new nation deep underground. You can join them and fight for safety. Or freedom. Or, if you dare, revenge on the surface-worlders who tried to destroy you. Join your new countrymen, explore a huge game world, hunt for hundreds of magical artifacts, choose from hundreds of quests, and become the hero of the underworld!\n\n[u]Release Date: 11 Apr, 2012[/u]\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\nThis is not a mindless RPG. Don't go into this game desiring mindless fun, for you will have to read quite a bit, manuever Avernum's cave systems via map systems, and retain information about quests, as the game doesn't hold your hand with doing so. The game does have a journal system that is VERY nice for its time; when you're speaking to an NPC who says something worth noting, you can \"record\" their speech with the click of a button, so you can pull this up at any time. This comes to be very useful, as quest notes don't update as you progress through a quest, so it's up to you to pay attention and know what the next step is. Despite all this, Avernum stays very much so to the right side of the line when it comes to tedium. I encountered no game-breaking quests during my playthrough like I have with other RPGs of the time (Divine Divinity, I'm looking at you, though I love you so). It IS possible to kill NPCs that you'll need for certain questlines, though the other questlines are still available, and there is also a cheat system to help you through this as a last resort (just look up your problem online). \n\nAll in All [u] Avernum: Escape From the Pit[/u] is a good RPG Game!\n\n9/10 From Me\n[i] Sweep [/i]"}]}
