In 2012 Vettel broke the record for the most pit-stops in the season [b](15)[/b] and equaled most races wins in a single season with Schumacher [b](13).[/b]In addition to seeing [u]seven drivers win the first seven races[/u], the 2012 season broke several records. The calendar for the season included twenty races, breaking the previous record of nineteen, which was first set in 2005. Six current or former World Drivers' Champions [u]Sebastian Vettel, Fernando Alonso, Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, and Michael Schumacher[/u] started the season, breaking the record of five established in  The season also saw the return of Kimi Raikkonen, the [u]flying Finn[/u] who finished 3rd at the end.  \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1121617190\n\n[h1]F1 2012 Game[/h1]\n\nFourth in installment from Codemasters game is pretty decent. Graphics are good even compared to some newer version of F1 games. The game features 20 circuits and 24 drivers battling for Championship title. Race through famous circuits such as Monaco, Spa, Monza, and Intergalos and become next World Champion. As you probably heard AI in this game aren't too much competitive compared to older versions, in fact in some cases they will let you overtake them, so I recommend You to search for some mods on the internet in order to have competitive cars to race against. Compare to some older versions F1 2012 is pretty decent and far better than F1 2011, there is some lack when it comes to comparing to F1 2010, which had very competitive AI cars but it had too much of an understeer. Although it's still enjoyable to play with new features such as Championship mode and Season Challenge.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1121617146\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1097143233\n\n\n\n[h1]Career[/h1]\n\nBefore You start a career you need to complete Young driver's test, It takes about 15-20 minutes after that you have been given few teams to choose between. Once you have chosen team You are given 7 seasons of career gameplay. Complete Team objectives, finishing at the top positions. beat Your Teammate and Your rival and completing R&D Objectives will help you get recognized from top tier teams. Some teams like Red Bull can recognize You faster than other teams like Mclaren or Mercedes. Race Your way to the top and beat top tier teams to win World Championship titles and Constructor's title.\n\n[h1]Season Challenge[/h1]\n\nYou choose to start a team, depends on difficulty, if you choose easy you will be able to pick any team, If you choose hard, you will start will low tier teams. In Season Challenge you pick your rivals and try to beat them in best of 3, if you score 2 wins you will get a contract from that team, if you accept contract You will replace that driver and You gonna pick next rival. Season Challenge has only 10 circuits, 10 less than career and in that time You must beat all rivals you have chosen. There is One-Shot qualifying and Race is only 5 laps long, tyre wear is not affected!\n\n[h1]Championship mode[/h1]\n\nHere You need to beat 7 World Champions from recent time, Kimi, Hamilton, Button, Vettel, Alonso, and Schumacher. Once You have beaten them all in their own challenges You are going to the Ultimate race where You are going to race them all at the Austin. Choosing difficulty will impact the medal you get, e.i. If you choose hard you will get a gold medal.\n\n[h1]Time Attack[/h1]\n\nIn Time Attack you have 6 different circuits, Valencia, Silverstone, Hockenheim, Suzuka, New Delhi and Austin.There You must beat time to get medals, better time better medal.\n\n[h1]Time Trial[/h1]\n\nYou try to beat Your own team at any circuit.\n\n[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]\n\nFor the first time, You can do Online Co-Op where you and your friend battle to win DC, CC.

The game is worth buying if You are into F1 or like racing games.\n\n[b]Rating: 9/10\n\nAchievements: 49\nEst. time to complete all: ~60h"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500154552, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519862", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "33569654", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198030980645", "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1502430444, "num_games_owned": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 998}, "timestamp_updated": 1500154552, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's hard, it takes a while to load, use abs if you're on a controller and not practicing brake control, shanghai during rain is literally dark souls, the car whine is to die for, good looking, works triple monitor, listen to eurobeat to increase speeds by 30%"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501002538, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "33790557", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198325618088", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1501308779, "num_games_owned": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6546}, "timestamp_updated": 1501002538, "received_for_free": false, "review": "THIS has to be the best F1 game iv played yet and iv played 2012 2013 and 2014"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501669927, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33968128", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198051517683", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1502554565, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1703}, "timestamp_updated": 1501669927, "received_for_free": false, "review": "For Michael Schumacher and Jules Bianchi."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500063676, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503015", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33544004", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198059730585", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1500199157, "num_games_owned": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 119}, "timestamp_updated": 1500063676, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I uswd to plau f1 games all of the time but this is so hard even on the easiest setting its just not worh playing unless you like being beaten over and over again,the silliest thing about this game is the rewind option which i dont know what its supposed to do,i thought this was a simulator, so i am going back to my rally games,shame as this looked quite good,it only cost  less than \u00a34 so i an not going to loose any sleep over it"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500034672, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500867", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 6, "recommendationid": "33534725", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198218017241", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1500033890, "num_games_owned": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 85}, "timestamp_updated": 1500034672, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Undriveable.
