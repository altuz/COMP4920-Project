This game is a lazy form of that. \n\nThis game plays very similar to Tropico when on the city map, but instead of buliding a city you are buying properties and upgrading. And upgrading, over and over until you're maxed out, then finish the mission and start all over again. This is fine for a city builder such as Tropico, it works for Tropico, to a point, but not here.\nIt stops being fun after a while, sooner than expected for me.\n\nNow the turn based part. Instead of moving all your units around and then ending your turn, every unit, player controlled and AI, are in a queue. It's never really explained how to queue up faster, if you can. Your units can have special abilities, but most can only be used once per mission. Once. When all your characters are bleeding to death you need to choose carefully which one you heal. So it is recommended to bring your main character and as many medics as you can. This makes the rest of the maybe 30 characters usless for the most part. And that's just as well since you only level up by completing and not by any means of gaining experience.\n\nThe gameplay and story itself is a watered down cartooney version of a Mafia story. It just felt like I was playing a kids game. A semi violent kids game. I lost interest after about 10 hours and have little desire to pick it up again. \n\n[b]TLDR:[/b]    This is a \"Meh\" game. It's not bad enough to dislike it but it's [i]just[/i] good enough to earn a thumbs up. \n\nI bought this game on sale, very on sale, and I suggest if you want to try it you should wait for a sale as well."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505179247, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491221", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34893166", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197982585075", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1505021415, "num_games_owned": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 443}, "timestamp_updated": 1505179247, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Boring map play and unbalanced encounters.
