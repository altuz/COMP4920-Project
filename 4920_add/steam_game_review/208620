Not helping Mumbo Jumbo's case is their lack of action to fix the problem when it first came up, and things only went downhill after they deleted the achievements and (initially) refused to restore them. It should also be noted that two other Midnight Mystery games (Devil on the Mississippi, Haunted Houdini) had the same update process as Salem at the same time, so why Salem was broken and why Mumbo Jumbo didn't bother to fix it before things got out of hand is, again, baffling.\n\nI'd keep a wary eye on Mumbo Jumbo and their games and check the forums to see what's going on before you give them any money. You are free to read the original review below.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW FROM FEB. 14, 2015:\nI cannot, under any circumstances, recommend this game. Additionally, I cannot recommend purchasing any games from Mumbo Jumbo. I'd advise to stay FAR away from Mumbo Jumbo after they removed the achievements from this game, a feature that was the incentive for me to purchase via Steam rather than, say, Amazon or some other digital storefront.\n\nMumboJumbo is too lazy to fix this game, in particular, and rather than put in the effort to listen to customer feedback and implement fixes for what they broke to begin with, they would rather REMOVE features and further break their games. I have noticed whenever they updated their games on Steam, there are no notes or documentations on what was done to warrant the update.\n\nI would only follow Mumbo Jumbo just to make sure if they bring any more games to Steam I can be sure to avoid Mumbo Jumbo's games like the plague."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1418286138, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503739", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13314349", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971623249", "num_reviews": 26, "last_played": 1418285924, "num_games_owned": 1911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 247}, "timestamp_updated": 1418286138, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Not nearly as good as the Edgar Allen Poe mystery.

The downside was that in looking online, I got the whole solution, when I would have preferred just getting a starting hint of some kind.  And there was one puzzle where the solution I found online did not work.  It was a puzzle where you have to slide books out of the way so that a particular one can get to a particular spot.  The opening arrangement in my game was different than the opening arrangement I found on the website.  That said, overall, I did enjoy the game.  The story was not quite as rich as the previous game (it was longer, certainly, but not as well-connected), but it was still immersive, and I enjoyed seeing how the different charcters and puzzles interacted with the main plot.
