It's not great, but for genre junkies like me, it's worth a play (especially on sale). It's a good passtime for a few hours, especially if you complete everything.\n\nFor one thing, it's the most challenging Midnight Mysteries yet. It's still extremely linear, and woe be to he who forgets to click a clover before solving a puzzle, but getting through the game and the bonuses can lead to some hair loss, without feeling like it's been overly unfair.\n\nThe only exception is the quality of the Hidden Object scenes themselves; they're very substandard, with almost everything being brown-ish, a low resolution that makes it nearly impossible to differentiate, and an inordinate number of things aren't in logical locations. One of the touches that was nice about #3 was that everything looked drawn and rendered just for the scene; here there's lots of re-used objects with wrong lighting or hidden in edges they would never be in real life. In other words, it's lazy.\n\nThe plot and writing is definitely better than Devil on the Mississippi, but not by much. The character graphics are about the same, still no voice acting. Don't play for the story, obviously, but I do appreciate their fresh takes on real historical controversies/conspiracy theories, and it actually kind of worked this time around."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1419357024, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505152", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13549757", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198035054806", "num_reviews": 200, "last_played": 1373169258, "num_games_owned": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 335}, "timestamp_updated": 1419357024, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good point and click hidden object.
