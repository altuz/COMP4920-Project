As a Batman fan, I was looking forward to playing a solid, patched, version of the game with all the DLC included...\n\nHands down, the best Batman game ever made. Every tiny detail and easter-egg, the voice-acting, the gadgets, the BATMOBILE! I was blown away. It defies logic that a game with so many different mechanics and such a vast open-world could possibly come together to deliver such a cohesive experience, but it does.\n\nExceeds the already high bar set by Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. 10/10 - WOULD recommend!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505668478, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512291", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35028659", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198092576259", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505016132, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7423}, "timestamp_updated": 1505668478, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a game unlike an other I've played before, a game that only make you allow the best. As you progress further and further it pushes you to the limits, there are no gimics or cheese in the game only combo based gameplay. It is and can be challenging to only allow the best however the payoff is like a surge of immense dopamine. As a player who has achieved 100% of the trophies and 240% the story it was time well spent.\n\nThe game only stuters in some moments in the batmobile so after the dust has settled it is now a fully functional and succesfully ported game and this is comming from a guy plays on a laptop. I played with keyboard and mouse due to not having a controller and the controls are very comfortable on keyboard. Theres no pausing in movement to input a combo while fighting due moving your hand awkardly. \n\nThe city and level design are extremely detailed and full of life and colour even though its Gotham city, a city notorious for its crimes in the DC Universe. The city is extremeling appealing to the eyes and the rain, sea, and vegitation are very detailed more so than Arkham City which felt like only 1 theme of being a depressed borough in Gotham where as Arkham Knight has mutiple themes on Miagani, Bleake and Founders island. Bleake island a borough that focuses on horizontal zonation being day to day work life and housing for the Gothamites such as China town. Miagami island a city that takes influences from many captial cities around the the world that includes a monorail station, a grand avenue like street that that is surrounded by the tall skyscrapes. Founders island; a redevelopement project that focuse on coprate skyscrapers like Wayne International, a Gotham Lexcorp building (A nod to Lex Luthor) and Gotham Cental Bank. All in all the greatest city world game to date.\n\nThe combat is very similar to its predecessor Arkham Origins who focused more so on he combat than all other aspects of an Arkham Game. However Arkham Origins and City had beter boss fights than Arkham Knight, something Arkham Knight lacked in. The game takes more focus on the people of Gotham and the Arkham Knight's army rather than the villans of Batman. Expect complex levels with varing classses of mobs to enter combat with. The \"Predator\" amd Stealth of the game is extremeling satisfuying in which it makes the enemies adapt to counter the Batman, you can't do the same stealth takedown more than twice. If you are looking for more of a challenge; play the AR challenges they are unique and challenge you to peform the best and only accept the best. \n\nThe Batmobile combat gameplay is very straight foward and easy to play, not much of a challenge. It most feels clunky if you are dong the racing AR challenges and can be frustrating at times. The times where the Batmobile shined was the Riddler challenges and the Campaign for Disarment those were extremely enjoyable and complex. I highly recommend buying the 60's Batmobile racing challenges the racing courses are extremely detailed and full of refrences to the TV show. The game really forces you to use the Batmobile to get to A to B in story missions which it could of toned down a higlight being the Deathstroke/Slade Boss Fight which was a rehashed version of a story mission batmobile boss fight. I wanted to face Slade in hand to hand combat like in Arkham Origins.\n\nThe DLC of the game I would recommend being the Seasons of Infamy. The Mr Freeze and Ra's Al Ghul side story lines were extremly fleshed out and provided a variety of gameplay and re shaped Gotham such as making Gotham encased in snow. The Matter of Family of DLC would only be recommended for fans of Batman Universe and want more of Mark Hamil Joker. The DLC gives more characterisation on Joker's stance on the Bat-Family and Tim and Barbras compatibility with each other. Overall the DLC is slightly above average compared to most City.\n\nLike all Stories a conclusion has to made and Arkham Knight accomplshes that surpurbly. The ending is extremely satisfying for a game trilogy and that for Batman's career. The story is extremly engaging and brings much shock value espically for those who are new to the Batman Universe, however if you have read stories such as Knightfall, The Killing Joke, Under the Redhood and even Batman the Animated series you can see plot points and conflcts from a mile away. The story respects source material extremely well but that is to be expected of an Arkham game. However what really engaged me was the characterisation of Bruce and Batman persona. It really brings forth ideas and reflections of what would happen if Batman was to put away the cowl and why he shoulders Gothams safety on his shoulders. The Voice acting by Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil is amazing they always have to work together if they want to make Batman on media an amazing, marvelous and memorabile story.\n\nSo should you buy Arkham Knight? Yes you are definetly getting your moneys worth for only $20. Rocksteady made a ground breaking conclusion to a game series that outshines others like Final Fantasy: Lightning returns, Mass Effect 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Metal Gear Solid 5 (Story Wise and though its a presequel). If this game was released like it was after the PC Port was fixed it would have been game of year hands down. Thank-you for reading this review it was my first and one that was definetlt deserved for Rocksteady's equal Magnun Opus Arkham City. \n\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506903260, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508506", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35400024", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067371366", "num_reviews": 70, "last_played": 1504799536, "num_games_owned": 889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5464}, "timestamp_updated": 1506903260, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Batman\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th][b]CATEGORY[/b][/th]\n        [th][b]RANK[/b][/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td][/td]\n        [td][/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td][b]VIDEO[/b]\n\n[i]graphics, performance, port, physics, arts, visuals...[/i]\n[/td]\n        [td][b]9/10[/b]\n\nThe game is beautiful, if you have the right system to make it run.

Now if you wonder why I would spend almost 100 hours on a 81% rated game, it is only because I'm a Bat fanboy. So beautiful graphics with a psychological plot in Gotham, even with repetitive and heavy gameplay content, I am still sold!

The story is good, but there are far too many breaks in the action to really enjoy it as a game. Every time you get a flow going, the action is broken up by a cut scene. So much so that I'm starting to lose interest in the story, and find Oracle and Gordon more and more annoying.\n\nThe tutorials are frustrating because you often see the screen-tip just before you fail, meaning you'll have to re-run several of them many times just to know what buttons you'll need to press to complete. PC players might as well just pick up an XBox controller, because as with most ports, this doesn't play very well on mouse and keyboard. You'll find tutorials very frustrating without a controller, and the button combinations for keyboard are overly complex and communicated too quickly on the screen to be of use. \n\nAll in all, I enjoy the same so far for its gorgeous visuals and decent story, but I'm disappointed that the gameplay isn't more intuitive and isn't as fluid as it could be with the story. This is a \"play-then-watch\" type game, with only a few minutes of play action between each longer-than-the-action cut scene. Very frustrating. \n\nI would recommend this game for those like me who have played other games in the series and want to continue the story, but if this is your first foray into the Arkham games, go with Arkham Asylum instead."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506821023, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501330", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35359755", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021977093", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506797043, "num_games_owned": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 286, "playtime_forever": 2363}, "timestamp_updated": 1506821023, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Now that it isn't a buggy mess, I really enjoyed this game.
