Yes, the game is genrally  mediocre, but the graphics aren't bad, the voice acting is okay (Ayumi is voiced by the same woman who voiced Cassandra Pentaghast, so show a little respect, you peasants. :D ), i encountered one glitch, namely the rifle just wouldn't reload for whatever reason and the gameplay is fine, fast paced and the fighting often is no cakewalk, especially on Hard. I'm playing with mouse and keyboard and it works just peachy for me.\nSo what? The game is hard? That your problem with it? Is it that it's not a masterpiece of gaming craftsmanship? Do people forget that you can abuse the hell out of the time rewind feature and lose fights all the time?\n\nAnyway, i'm enjoying it for what it is. Certainly not the second coming of christ but it sure as hell is not a bad game or in any way unplayable. If you're into Hack & Slash this is a solid game to pick up. If you're in doubt just wait for a sale. I for one do not feel like i wasted my time or money here.\n\nI haven't played the DLC yet, so i'll shut up about it. But i'll certainly be playing through it.\n"}]}
