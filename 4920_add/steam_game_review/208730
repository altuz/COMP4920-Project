You play as Mors, a Night's watch recruiter sent South, and a Red Priest known as Alister, heir to a noble House. They trun out to be good friends, the Lannisters are still fucking cunts, same old stuff.\n\nThe Game: Overall it's...not really memorable. There is a hell of a lot of potential in the game, but none of it shows up or if it does, it falls flat like a jumper from a thirty-storey building. The characters are poorly done, but have some personality despite it.\n\nOverall I'd give the game a 6/10. It has moments where it's good, but unless you're a fan of ASoIaF, you should avoid it.

The game gets progressively better and more interesting as the plot thickens.\nAlso, the gameplay is not as bad as I make it sound. I just want to be clear that this is no Skyrim or Dragon Age game. But it does offer some interesting choices in character development, and has a very good variety of weapons, armour and skills to equip your characters with. Combat is real-time but strategic (you can slow time to choose targets and abilities) and can be quite satisfying if you put some effort in developing your character and use your abilities wisely. Choices you make in the game matter and can have consequences much later in the game.

I guess it kind of scratches an itch I have for Dragon Age style RPGs, and the GOT twist is just enough to keep me interested.  It's still a bad game, though and I wouldn't recommend it to the majority of gamers. Let me explain exactly why : \n\nThe Graphics\n\nDespite being released in 2012 the graphics are straight out of the late 90s early 2000s.  Obscenely low resolution textures, and chunky looking characters. I actually laughed when I saw that this was created with Unreal Engine 3.  It's an amateur effort, at best.\n\nThe Combat Balance\n\nEnemies will slash you with their swords when you're miles away, and archers will shoot arrows that can hit you through walls. They attempted to ape the Dragon Age \"Tactical Pause\" system, but it just doesn't work, particularly if you are choosing to play as a ranged character.  You are forced to constantly quaff these health potions to stay in fighting shape, but they have limited charges and can only be replenished at merchants, so it's VERY easy to get yourself into a progress breaking state where there are just too many enemies to tank.  The enemy numbers and placement ASSUMES you have more health potions than you actually do.  It's garbage.\n\nThe World\n\nVery little effort was made to bring the world to life.  Almost everything is a static backdrop that cannot be interacted with unless it is directly relevant to your current quest.  There are all kinds of areas that the level designers built that serve literally_no_purpose.  There aren't even any collectibles or loot stashes in them, just empty filler.  You quickly learn that exploration is pointless and that you should just bee-line for your main objective.\n\nThe Dialogue\n\nIs atrocious.  With a few exceptions (Varys is quite good, and seems to be voiced by the actual actor who plays him) but other than that you get bargain bin voice acting that sounds like it could have been done by one of the programmers.  Much of the writing is also exposition heavy and assumes that the player knows nothing about the GOT lore, so it tries to ram it down your throat ad nauseum.  (Jeor Mormant repeatedly explains the tenets of the Night's Watch for a good 10 fucking minutes at the start of the game). \n\n\nSo with all that bad stuff, why am I still playing it?  There are a few good things.\n\nThe Character Progression \n\nWhen you level up you can select new abilities from a branching tree,  increase your core attributes, and earn various traits that give you small buffs.  It's nothing revolutionary, but what's there is solid and reasonably enjoyable.  Trying to build a deadly water dancer or dual wielding wildling is pretty cool.  \n\nThe Story\n\nWhile the dialogue and character writing is terrible, the overarching plot points are quite good, and seem true to Martin's world. There is deadly sibling rivalry,  executions, and political intrigue.  It rarely rises above the level of \"decent fan fiction\", but it's good enough to keep you wondering how it will end.\n\nGOT hype\n\nYeah, this is a thing.  It's cool to find a merchant selling the Red Viper's spear, or hear that you will get to have an audience with Cersei Lannister. If you're not a fan of the books or show you can cross this one off the list, but if you are, it'll make your inner fanboy tingle. \n\n\nSoooo yeah.  Overall it's a bad game, but if you're a huge GOT nerd or you want a sad Dragon Age clone set in that universe it's good for a few hours of fun."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505193492, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499052", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34895357", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198126131226", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1505190045, "num_games_owned": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 689}, "timestamp_updated": 1505193492, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Catagories[/th]\n        [th]Ranking[/th]\n        [th]Summery[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Value[/td]\n        [td]$7.49   [/td]\n        [td]Well I've got to say for a game I got for less than $8 I'm fairly impressed with it so far   [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td] 7 stars[/td]\n        [td] Game play isnt perfect by any means and it has room for improvements but its not so bad that I feel the need to attack Cyanide Studios for some reason or another.

Honestly I know I shouldn\u2019t judge the series by the show but I hope the books are better. This story on the other hand I find pretty damn good I like how you bounce between your characters the way you would in a book and the story is just compelling enough that I groan when I have too switch over but then getting rather amused by the position Im stuck in in the next little \"Chapter\" that\u2019s a job well done.

UGH If I knew who designed it I'd find some way to show my displeasure in true GoT fashion lets say. The camera catches on corners, boxes, specks of dust floating in the non-existant wind, and skips around you while you try to run through the narrow streets and corridors. One minute your hot on the heals of a guy sprinting through the market of Fleabottom next I'm trying to count the hairs up my characters nose\u2026 drives me mad.

It's very melee centric which makes some sense but the sheer number of weapon style options can be a bit taxing I mean seriously Swords, maces, axes, hammers, pole arms, one handers, two handers, bows, crossbows, blunted, slashing, puncturing\u2026 I think I forgot one or two options in there but I cant seem to remember. From what I've been able to sort out pick one or 2 things and just stick with it. Thinking and preping beyond that seems to be a fools errand.

For these being non canon side adventures I have to say I hope the books are this good, if not better.
