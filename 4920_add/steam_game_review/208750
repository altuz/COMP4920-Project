[b]Using a controller could be far from being intuitive and comfortable.[/b]\nb) deal with its is \"realistic\" melee combat, meaning that you will have to use melee weapons accordingly to the situation and surroundings: spears will be oviously useful to keep your distance from beasts and enemies wielding heavy melee weapons, such as club maces and axes.\nc) keep in mind that [b]melee wepaons have precise hitboxes[/b] meaning that if you're using a spear, ONLY the pointy end of it will deal damage, so button mashing the melee hit key (mouse click) won't often lead to useful results at close range, while aiming to heads and non-armoured body parts will instead rewarding your reflexes (and bravery). \nIf you fancy simpler combat and hitbox mechanics, such as Hotline Miami 1's melee weapons, then you'd better stay away from this game and avoid using a controller, even if you're allowed to.\n\n2- Boss fights are enjoyable and epic, always followed by an intense (yet repetitive sometimes) soundtrack and a good english voice acting\n\n3- Scenarios are well designed, well supported by an informative map, by fast travel mechanics and, just to show:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1134996989\n\n4- inventory and crafting mechanics are extremely simple and linear, meaning that utilizing and taking advantage of your gear and items will be fast and very intuitive\n\nTO SUM UP:\n\nBuy Apotheon to enjoy a \"2D God Of War\", rich of great scenarios, greek myths, a simple yet functional character progression and item management, a deep and rewarding combat mechanic that might not be liked by gamers that love using controllers.\n\nThanks for reading, leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations, have an amazing day/night."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505441695, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513776", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34962098", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198042892170", "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1505866820, "num_games_owned": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1293}, "timestamp_updated": 1505441695, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I just finished this game. I haven't played many games of this genre, 2D side scrolling type, but this one was a ton of fun. An interesting combat system, 12 unique worlds which you can freely travel between, hidden treasures and gear, markets, tons of weapons and improving combat skills. This game has a beautiful art style and a unique type of gameplay. Some levels can get frustrating, but what's awesome is if you're having too much trouble, you can retreat back to the city and replace your gear and powerups. There are also side quests which grant their own bonuses that you have to find on your own. This game is excellent: interesting combat style, fun idea, good music and graphics. The only element that is particularly lacking is character development. the character you play as is almost entirely silent during the game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505131263, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34881384", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198062229668", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1435098356, "num_games_owned": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 582}, "timestamp_updated": 1505131263, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Amazing game!\n\nIf you love greek mythology you'll already love it. \n\nIt plays a bit like 2D Dark Souls with an amazing art style and great soundtrack.\nEvery battle feels fun and satisfying, every god has it's own unique realm with different enemies to fight.\nBoss fights against the gods are unique and epic.

I have always loved mythology and the art style lookin as if it was fresh off a greek pot would have been enough to peak my interest. But, on top of that, it had fun combat and a pretty engaging story that involved many mythological characters in an interesting way. Granted, the fighting itself is a literal hit or miss as it is a basic 2d sidescroller but, the ability to fluidly change what weapon to use according to the specific scenario I was in was where all of the fun crap went down. Even just fighting the enemies in the hub area was sometimes engaging enough to distract me from even going to the next story area.

As an example, adding latency to much bigger weapons also make it much more difficult to use. If in a 1vs1 combat it's ok, but when enemies are many, attacking at the same time, you just can't wait for 1 second for your axe to raise and strike, while unshielded during that time. You just take hits that reset your attack. It becomes unplayable.\nAnother issue during combats are the stairs : fighting in stairs is just awful. Your character climbs a stair as a priority instead of walking on the ground. When going forward or backward during a combat, to avoid a hit or to do one, it can't be a worst thing than seeing your character climbing up or down. Trying to jump off the stair to go back on ground using Jump + Down direction makes fights really irritating, while your enemy is hitting your unshielded because climbing exposes you character to enemy's hits.\nI would have preferred an arcade game that allowed me more progression, rather than this fighting system that tries to be skills based (but that fails, in my opinion), with such ergonomics and controls flaws. At least I could have enjoyed the narration and though \"it's ok I didn't pay this game for playing 45min\".\nThere are other design flaws, in my opinion, like the crafting system. Why would I craft a life potion instead of picking it up as a bonus, while I can pick dozen times the ingredients to make it. It's just creating a false game mechanic, that gives no pleasure, but instead is a useless steps I would prefer to not have to do (there is nothing enjoyable in crafting it, nothing enjoyable in collecting ingredients, everything just being a non ergonomic menu navigation manipulation).\nI prefer stop playing that game, I know I won't return to it.
