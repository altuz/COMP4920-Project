You'll probably notice it in cutscenes and on close up faces, though. There isn't much variation in the faces of the generic characters populating the streets, but their presence does make the places feel quite alive.\n\nThe story is great, and very much draws you in. Each of the side quests is quite well fleshed out, and has a short description to accompany each section of the quest. There are also quest markers which indicate where you need to go, which is very useful when you inevitably forget where to find the person you need to look for. Having the game split into chapters is a little contrived but generally works well, giving each section a sort of conclusion. The choices you make are often quite tough to make, and I found myself wondering for a while before I made the decision a few times. Early in the game there are quite a few decisions to be made which affect the outcome in small ways, which I liked quite a lot. Having the ability to influence the world state even a little is interesting. There are a few larger decisions to be made, but I'm not sure how much this affects the path through the story since I only finished the path of the Scoi'atel.\n\nThe combat is quite satisfying and timing-based, with 3 different fighting styles for different enemy types, and the timings for each of the styles changes as you upgrade the abilities. The animation quality of the swordplay is generally impressive, and also changes with upgrades. Parrying and dodging is automatic based on your talents and potions. You can also dodge by rolling which is more reliable. I think I played on normal difficulty, and only died a few times the entire game, so it's probably better to play on a higher difficulty if you want more of a challenge. I played with the over the shoulder camera mode, which turns Geralt with the mouse. It's fine once you get used to it. There are some special attacks you can learn at higher skill levels, which apply an effect like blinding or incineration, but these were often quite hard to use since they often get cancelled when you're hit. They're not particularly powerful either, with the exception of the strong special attack which can do quite a lot of damage. It's not really necessary though.\n\nThe other part of combat is signs, which can also be upgraded.  Signs are revealed to you gradually, after discovering the stone corresponding to the sign. They can be used for a temporary boost to that sign's intensity after you already have the sign. By the second chapter I think you will have all the signs. Sign intensity is something that apparently makes a difference to signs, but the effects weren't very obvious to me.\n\nI played most of the game without using the trap (yrden) and hex (axii) signs, although actually they can be quite useful if upgraded. The other signs are quite useful for dealing with enemies more quickly, aard allowing you to do an instant kill if the enemy is stunned. This is a little bit overpowered because you can often stun quite difficult monsters early on. Later it's useful for just powering through weaker monsters who are in the way. Igni is also great for burning stuff, and when upgraded affects a larger angle range, up to 360 (as with aard). Quen is good for protection, but I didn't find it to be particularly necessary. Signs are governed by vigor, which recovers more or less quickly depending on potions and skills. Managing it can be important depending on the fight. At the start you can cast only two signs in a row, but later on this can be increased to perhaps 5.\n\nWhen you level up, you receive skill points, which are split into bronze, silver and gold. Bronze points are used to learn some basic skills, silver some more high level skills, and gold the highest two levels of skills. There are attribute skills, which increase some attributes like health, vigor, dodge, and resistances, and also allow you to unlock higher levels of combat or sign skills. Combat skills increase damage, increase the chance of effects like bleeding (which I never really noticed), and add more attacks to the sequence. Sign skills modify the signs to make them more powerful or have a wider angle of effect. For the most part the skills are relatively uninteresting, and just slowly ramp up the power you have. It was quite hard to choose what to upgrade since there are so many skills. The two swords have different skill upgrades for each style, which is already 6 different trees, and each sign also has its own for an additional 5. By the end of the game I was a good way into the trees  for each skill. You can fill out all the trees if you grind, but it's probably not worth it.\n\nPotions are quite useful, allowing you to augment various things like health recovery, total health and so on. Some have more specific effects like preventing knockdown, which can be useful in some fights. There's also one which slows down combat so you can react more quickly. The variation was quite good, and it was  necessary to use them sometimes to make a fight quicker or less difficult. Potions have no negative effects beyond the toxicity. Potions can have an additional effect if you brew them with ingredients which have matching secondary qualities (rubedo, albedo and nigredo), which is also nice. Ingredients are quite plentiful and I ended up picking a lot, but ended up probably only needing less than half of what I picked. Blade oils and whetstones add the possibility of augmenting your sword, which is good for doing damage against specific types of monsters (or humans). Bombs also exist, but I barely used them.\n\nYou can brew potions and make bombs and oils, with the right ingredients. You have to learn the skills to make bombs and oils, but potions are available from the start. The interface for this is quite clunky, although maybe I just missed a keybinding. You have to click the thing you want to make, and then another button somewhere else on the screen to make it after you choose the ingredients (which are also automatically filled in, but you may want to shuffle them to match secondary qualities). You can also double click the thing you want to make, but this can be unreliable, and each must be made individually. There is a filter for ingredient types which is useful. Each different type of crafted item has a base ingredient (alcohol, grease or powder), and you add other ingredients to that. Ingredients are gathered from herbs and monsters, and are quite plentiful. There are some potions which can only be brewed with a special ingredient from a large monster, which grant an additional skill. You can choose to kill some of these monsters or not, and if you don't you won't be able to get that skill. The skills aren't so great that it makes a significant difference.\n\nTo make things, learn skills or pass time, you need to meditate, which requires a fire or a place to do so. You need flint to light a fire, which can be annoying if you're in the middle of nowhere without flint. You can find places to meditate with certain characters, and at inns, which will charge you a nominal fee for a \"room\" which is often just a carpet in some corner of the inn. This was quite strange the first time I used it."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505708744, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509622", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35038726", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197972040704", "num_reviews": 455, "last_played": 1402844027, "num_games_owned": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 633}, "timestamp_updated": 1505708744, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I loved this game when it first came out and I played the disc version to completion.

In replaying the first act of this game, I was bored out of my mind running back and forth to the various quest objectives in The Witcher. The amount of running here is comparative to the amount MMOs like WoW or The Old Republic like to put into their games just to stretch out playtime. Fast travel should have been used in my opinion, but the developer elected not to. Too many hours are spent just traveling without exploration or combat, purely backtracking to turn in and pick up quests, feeling too much like an MMO for me to enjoy myself."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506851562, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35375044", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198132165486", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1445798461, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 72}, "timestamp_updated": 1506851562, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Literally...there is no other game that even comes close to how in depth story driven and polished this game truly is.

At first i wasn't sure about this game, I saw some clips online and it didn't look good, the graphics, gameplay, story all looked well meh. But I bought it anyway and it did not disappoint. It was a amazing game! sure it had a couple of problems but overall it was a amazing game.\n\nPROS: \n\n-The story was really well done i was intrigued for most of it with a great ending.\n\n-The music was really well done it wasn't like any of the other games, but what I loved about this \n music was how atmospheric it was.\n\n-The quests were mostly really fun, they always made want do more, and it helped flesh out this \n world and characters.\n\n-The voice acting was really well done.\n\n-The leveling system in this game is probably my favorite in the Witcher series.\n\n-The combat system definitely has it's problems but what I loved about it is that you can change \n the combat styles depending on the different enemies you are facing.\n\n-The characters were really well made in this game, and a lot of them were apart of the story not \n just there to be there.\n\n-The choices really matter in this game and they are not just a good guy choice and a bad guy \n choice it all depends on you point of view.\n\n-The game was a good length around 45 hours, and that's not doing all the quests. Doing all the \n quests take around 68-75 hours.\n\nCONS:\n\n-The combat has some good but it also needs some work, sometimes it felt like you were just \n clicking a button over and over.\n\n-The bosses are weak, and not very creative, they are more of just a pain then fun to fight.\n\n-The the story's pacing is not always great, chapter II was very slow compared to the others.\n\n-The writing at times could be very cheesy, but most of it was good.\n\n-The sword textures in the game almost all looked the same which was disappointing, but there \n were a couple that are different.\n\nSCORE:\n\nI would be lying to you if I said this game is perfect and no problems, but those are so small compared to how great this game really is I love all of the Witcher games but this still holds a special place in my heart. I would definitely recommend this game to any Witcher or RPG fan.\n\n9/10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506797710, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506948", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "35350366", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198129640880", "num_reviews": 36, "last_played": 1506787646, "num_games_owned": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 664, "playtime_forever": 726}, "timestamp_updated": 1506797710, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If this game doesn't have BOOBS, I wouldn't buy it.

So I read the series of novels its based on and really enjoyed the books, so I was excited to dive into the game series and I decided to start with the first game in the trilogy. Even got a fairly good laptop to play the first two, which is a big deal considering I'm primarily a console gamer.\n\nHonestly, I was pleasantly surprised by just how much fun I had with the Witcher. I played it mainly to develop a history and background with the series so that when I got to the Witcher 3, I could truly enjoy it and all the easter eggs I'm sure the developers included for long time fans of both the novels and the first two games.\n\nI ended up pumping over a 100 hours into the game! I only ever spend that long on really exceptional games, such as Fallout or Persona. The Witcher Enhanced Edition impressed me and if this is how good the first game in the entry is, when CD Projeckt Red was just starting out, I can't even imagine how good the final game in the trilogy is. Maybe the hype is well deserved.\n\nThe Witcher Enhanced Edition is an great action role playing game with an engaging story and a deep lore filled world just waiting to be explored! I loved how the game designers drew on the mythos of the books in order to really flesh out the world of the game and its characters. Also, graphically I feel it still holds up today for a game released more than 5 years ago. \n\nSo long story short, I REALLY enjoyed the game and would heartily recommend it."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505140290, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34883847", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198078403549", "num_reviews": 112, "last_played": 1505136542, "num_games_owned": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1613}, "timestamp_updated": 1505140290, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The Witcher, one of the best RPG games of all times and part of amazing trilogy just like most RPG (e.g Mass Effect, Dragon Age & Dark Souls) even though it's not aged well.\n\nThe story is amazing in many ways, choices/multiple endings and rich world creation makes the story even better.\nThe gameplay is weird, but RPG element is OK and weirdly i had fun with the gameplay because it's weirdly simple.\nThe graphic isn't bad considering it's old games, but the artwork is totally amazing and  the soundtrack fit with the gameplay/story even it's nothing memorable.\n\nIf you love RPG games, there's no reason not to buy this game especially if you already played another The Witcher series.\nJust buy The Witcher Trilogy and you will have great time."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506232903, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35171989", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198208284245", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1506522137, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 358, "playtime_forever": 4059}, "timestamp_updated": 1506237825, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game.
