Unlike the three other Arkham games made by Rocksteady, WB Montreals is unpolished, unoriginal and kind of dull. \n\nAlthough I don't think this game is bad, it is a dissappointment in basicly every way you look at it. The story turns into another one of those 'with a certain character in it', who is revealed about 2 hours in. For a lot of people, including me, that was really a bummer. As a side note the grey-ish environments - that seem off-scale compared to the size of Batman - is boring to look at, despite the almost omnipresent chirstmas decorations.\n\nFor others, its the large amount of errors and bugs that is inherent with this installation of the series. I experienced crashes and weird enemy behaviours (e.g. getting stuck in walls and frozen animations), but others suffered from more severe ones, like falling through the ground upon restarting from checkpoint. In that case, the player has to restart the whole campaign! I also happen to own this game for the Wii U, where the textures sometimes take forever to load in, making the world look extremely muddy and low poly. \n\n[h1]That reminds me: after playing for 1 hour, I noticed how flat the environmental textures appeared. It turns out that it is a common glitch where HD textures would never load in. This is solved by opening a certain ini file in the games folder and changing a value from 0 to 1.[/h1]\n\nAs for the gameplay, I'd say its just alright. The combat feels great, when it works. Often times I felt like my button inputs didn't register causing me to lose that crucial combo. Another dissappointment (in the main game) is the aweful amount of combat, in contrast to the amount of stealth segments. One of the prominent things that change up the pace from the combat, are the stupidly-easy riddler trophies (or in this case datapacks), that even the most simplest animal can solve. Like: sliding under a fence and....solved!\n\nAs a completionist, this game is a chore. Not only the above mentioned datapacks are redundant, but also smaller achievements like 'listening to everything Alfred has to say' require more attention than you would want to give it. If you're aiming to get all the achievements, than you'll notice that there isn't a reason to check out the Initiation DLC, as the devs didn't even add the 2 achievements for those on Steam. Even worse, the multiplayer mode has been officially closed since july 2017, making about 10 achievements unobtainable.\n\nOh, some achievements are bugged for some players too.\n\nThe Cold Cold Heart DLC on the other hand is really well done and worth checking out! The main game though, despite the memorable bossfights, is lackluster."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505762413, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523357", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35051488", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198024451265", "num_reviews": 217, "last_played": 1505761153, "num_games_owned": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 805}, "timestamp_updated": 1505762413, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1]Somewhat rehashes, yet very enjoyable // Recommended to round out you action-games selection\n\n[/h1]\n\n+ Surprisingly well-written plot\n+ Very, very strong voice-acting\n+ Crisp & fluid combat system that flows well\n+ Fantastic, extremely enjoyable boss fights\n+ Investigating crime scenes is extremely well-done, & reconstructing them feels like a novel experience (even if you're not actually DOING much)\n+ Detailed, generally impressive environmental visuals\n+ Gadgets are just as fun as always\n+ Leveling system now has a grading system added to xp gain (does increase rewards a bit); goes the extra mile to reward smart thinking & planning your encounters\n\n- Where are all the people?
