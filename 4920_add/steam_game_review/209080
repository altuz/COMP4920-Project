Pilots fly the ship and give commands, the engineers repair and buff guns, armor and equipment, and the gunners, well, man the guns.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!   I find it sad that so few people play it regularly, and that makes it hard to play, and it takes forever to queue into a match, but the wait is worth it!
