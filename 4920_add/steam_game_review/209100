And what do i tell you, don't listen to those cry babies. Tell you why.\n\nFirst, I had no problems with GFWL, i was already signed it into it and it went all smooth (Win10 x64).. About controls - well, if you did play RE5, it's almost the same, but more fluid. Not perfect, but fluid enough. Such controls is a RE trademark after all. Anyways it wasn't a trouble for me directing my character.\n\nPlaying as Umbrella's Elite Security squad is awesome. Story is interesting to follow. At least i wasn't bored. A lot of unlocables, different abilities, everything adds to the replaybility. I actually feel i will be returning to this game after i complete story mode, just to hop in, and have some fun with other players. Not a regular thing i do with games, but it is this kind of game. Very good for co-op."}]}
