You'll get all the DLC characters(which are yours by right for free, as they are already in every copy of the game as hidden stuff), including the Playstation exclusives. Online play fixed and no problems with windows 10.\n\nNow, talking about the game: fun game, really solid roster with a good move list for most of the characters. SF characters moves pretty much like in SFIV, including lots of their combos, Tekken characters got part of their classic move set from various titles of the Tekken franchise, and other ones to make everything connects. It is a very agressive and fast-paced game though, and that is the most basic difference from the SFIV game style.\n\nCenarios are really beautiful and creative, though they are super colorful and can annoy some players. Art style is basically SFIV with the watercolor stuff in place of the ink stuff. Character models are just ugly. They are kind of improved versions for SF characters and the clunky muscles new models for the Tekken ones.\n\nAnother counterpoints? The gem system. It is boring, uninspired and justs adds one more thing to be careful throughout the gameplay. Music and voice acting is also pretty bad. Specially for the Tekken side. Still, really fun game. Wouldn't bother with the competitive side of it, but love to play it with friends and mess around."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503131984, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504426", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34345772", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198001076027", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1503421630, "num_games_owned": 976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 153}, "timestamp_updated": 1503131984, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The game is great and works flawlessly off-line with the community patch, and is even better with it since it adds characters that were exclusive to the PS3 version of the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=649186874\n\nThe guide offers a solution for on-line play, but I ignore if it's working and you have to deal with GFWL.
