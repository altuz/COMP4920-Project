Assuming you're into rpg's (otherwise i don't see any reason you're here), and want to get your mind blown away, then this game is for you. I can't possibly describe how fantastic Witcher 2 is. While the \"general\" story might not be something outstanding, the way you progress through it, the way you interact with people completely engulfs you into the experience, and you won't even realize when it's already 5 am, and you've been playing for 12 hours at least. This is partly because of the side missions. Unlike other rpg's where they are mediocre at best, and mainly consist of something like \"Get to point B, Talk to someone, Return, ????, PROFIT\", side missions in Witcher 2 are self contained stories, some of them being more enjoyable than the main game itself. And of course if you don't want to do them for whatever reason, you'll miss A LOT. \nAnother thing at which Witcher 2 excels is the combat. While at low difficulty you should be able to complete the game by \"pressing X to win\", other difficulty settings require knowledge, thinking, and tactical aproach. You'll have to create mixtures, craft weapons and armor, find or buy herbs and recipes, just in order to be able to survive. While this might be confusing, and hard, trust me that it's not. It's understandable, it's logical, and requires just a little bit of initial effort. \nAt this point you're probably thinking \"Yeah, cool, i'll go buy it\", and you won't be wrong in any way. BUT, be advised that while this is a great looking game, it isn't particulary well optimised, and you may find yourself struggling even at minimum settings if your PC isn't powerful enough. \nSo what is my score for the game? Definitely 10/10. I really do think it's such a good game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504719624, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512612", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34779981", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198086925819", "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1492296253, "num_games_owned": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 165}, "timestamp_updated": 1504719624, "received_for_free": false, "review": "In 2015 CD project Red gave me The Witcher 2 for free on gog.com\n\nIn 2017 i Bought it just for thanking them for doing so.\n\n\nThank you CD Project Red, you are the best company out there."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504649702, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511979", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34765513", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198055337714", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1504741017, "num_games_owned": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1064}, "timestamp_updated": 1504649702, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Want to start off by saying this game is really good and you should try it out if you haven't done so already.\n\nI did start playing Witcher 2 after playing Witcher 3. There are major differences in second game compared to Witcher 3, they obviously approved on a lot of stuff after the 2nd game. So If you are wanting to play this after playing Witcher 3 because, like me, you loved Witcher 3 so much that you needed more Geralt in your life then you will have to bear with some of the gameplay.\n\nThe biggest thing I noticed was the combat system feels old and not as smooth and can be annoying at times. The gameplay in general also feels sort of linear, which isn't terrible but you dont feel as free as in Witcher 3. There is less playtime and the story does seem short compared to Witcher 3.\n\nThese \"bad\" things are only noticable for me because Witcher 3 was so smooth and polished. When Witcher 2 came out it must have been amazing for its time, and it is still very fun and entertaining if you are wanting to play it now. If you want to play it before Witcher 3 to get the full experience it will be amazing and it will make Witcher 3 an even better experience. If you are playing it after Witcher 3 it is still very fun."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504702670, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34775025", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198099234862", "num_reviews": 45, "last_played": 1499433383, "num_games_owned": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 348}, "timestamp_updated": 1504702670, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The second installment of the Witcher series is as good, if not better, than the first part.\n\nBeing blamed for the murder of King Foltest, Geralt is on the journey to find the real murderer and his motives. While doing so, he is mixed up in politics, treason and unraveling conspiracies throughout his way.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is, that the graphics improved quite a lot, compared to it's predecessor.\nSharp textures, lush colors and a great attention to detail will please your eyes. Though, when it comes to post-processing effects, they might have been a bit too generous. Sometimes the colors, the Bloom etc. can be a bit distracting and blinding, though that doesn't take away from it's beauty.\n\nThe second big improvement is the combat. While it is still kind of a click-combo way to fight, it's way less clunky and feels more natural and direct. You shouldn't have big issues getting the hang out of it.\nYou still have 2 swords to chose from, one silver and the other a steel one, while being able to do a light or heavy attack.\n\nThe characters and story are, again, the highlights of the game. It's not just the main story that's captivating and motivating you to push on, but also side-quests that are funny and or interesting.\nWaking up on the beach with a hangover, naked and being tattooed on your neck and then finding out what happened is one of those quests (keeping the tattoo and importing your save-file to the Witcher 3 will let you keep the tattoo; great attention to detail and continuity).\n\nThe one thing that might be a bit overwhelming and confusing could be the political part of the game. Especially in the beginning, but also in parts throughout the game, you're faced with a lot of different characters, kingdoms and it's kings, the political situation of the world etc.\nKnowing the books the game is based on, i didn't had any issues following it, though if you're not familiar with it, it might be a bit much.\n\nAnd again you are faced with choices and this time there is one big choice which will decide which area you will visit from chapter 2 onwards. So replaying the game and choosing a different side will open up a whole new area, new quests, new characters to meet and a whole new perspective on the story and motives of the characters.\n\nThankfully for me, i didn't faced any technical issues, bugs or crashes, so i can't comment on any of these.\nHowever, i know that when using the german language, it crashed in the past and you had to replace the umlauts (google should help with that). Remembering this, i replaced those from the beginning and wasn't plagued by any issues.\n\nGreat part 2 of the series and definitely recommend it.\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506537159, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35247118", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198153490345", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1503598313, "num_games_owned": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1537}, "timestamp_updated": 1506537159, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The Witcher 2 is an amazing game (like every witcher game)\n\nPro's: \n+ Amazing story\n+ Good graphics\n+ Choises do matter\n+ Multiple endings.\n+ Nice alchemy system\n\nCons:\n- Not so much open world\n- Short game (25 hours is ok lenght but compared to the other Witcher games)\n- Contracts are still boring (like in Witcher 1)\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505231989, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34903890", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198028059421", "num_reviews": 23, "last_played": 1505232231, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2524}, "timestamp_updated": 1505231989, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A dark, gritty story set in a medieval, renaissance-esque fantasy world, filled with choices that have (sometimes) far reaching consequences.

Still the story is interesting, there is a lot of room to choose how to play the hero, whether as an amoral monster killer in a violent world or as a lost, kind soul in search of his past, and while the events that unfold will sweep the hero  in their wake, the sense of having an impact in the world and the grand scheme of things is real, and that is the strength of this game.\n\nThe gameplay and combat is ok-ish, the maps are small with lots of backtracking to the same locations, the inventory is a pain to use and navigate and the crafting completely unintuitive (the character doesn't learn recipes, he has to keep them in his backpack and show them a  crafter NPC who will craft it for him for a fee). Thank god for the internet and the many help guides out there!\nOn the plus side, the graphics in their time were putting many machines to their knees and are still good, with a lush world, beautiful use of lighting, day and night cycles, dynamic weather that astounded me when I saw NPCs running for cover when the rain started pouring.

But other than that, I loved how different ur paths would be just by choosing one of 2 different allies to side with(won't give it away to some ppl who deem it spoiler territory) and the story and the way it was told was so epic. The characters were so lovable that upon their absence or presence in the 3rd game, I was either devastated or joyous abt it. Personally, I also felt that due to the world being more linear than d 3rd, I sorta felt more involved in d main storyline which made it very immersive.
