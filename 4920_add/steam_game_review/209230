However, I will warn the Sherlock purists that this game has only a very passing relationship to the book so if you're looking for a HO-version of the classic, you very well might hate this.  The story is really very different.\n\nIn terms of general gameplay this is a pretty standard game for the genre, with HO scenes mixed with minigame puzzles and the usual inventory-based puzzles.  Where it departs from the norm is with a handful of special \"powers\" unlocked throughout the game that add to the puzzles; while in some cases it's apparent what you have to use and when, other times it took some thought and I appreciated that.\n\nPuzzles and minigames themselves are average difficulty, not hard but not too easy, with the exception of one or two of the minigames that were just obnoxious; however there is a skip button or if you're intent on getting a no-skip achievement, there are solutions online (I confess to being guilty of looking up one or two solutions for that reason).\n\nSound and voice acting is nothing stellar but definitely better than the average, if you consider that most HO games have extremely poor voice acting.\n\nAll in all, a great game with some unique aspects that make it stand out.

This time Frogware is just a publisher not the developer and this choice is evident in many ways inside the game.\n\nThis short adventure starts With Henry Baskerville asking Sherlock Holmes to help him to break the curse of his family which involves a big Hound that brutally kills all of the Baskerville family members from generations. Now, for those who are familiar with Sherlock Holmes and the original novel, yes: this is not exactly a faithful transposition but it's more like an interpretation... Which works good and bad at the same time. Good beccause the adventure in a big mansion where a Demonic dog is supposed to be is quite a good idea giving the game a good dark atmosphere. Bad because this interpretation involves magic and time travel (without any particular consequence, so it's just an excuse to have another room with riddles with a few minor graphic differences), which really don't belong in a Sherlock Holmes adventure. \nAs a Hidden Object game The gameplay doesn't need much explanation. You need to explore rooms or other ambiences, pick up items, interact with various objects and when you focus on determined zones you will be requested to find a long list of items very well hidden in the screen. Besides that you can find a very long list of puzzles and riddels, some of them are quite easy, but there are few VERY TOUGHT ones that forced me to get some help to deal with them.\nThis title can count on a good soundtrack most of the times trying to give a tense atmosphere, maybe even more than necessary. Besides that Holmes, Watson and Henry Baskerville will often talk during the adventure and not just with captions as already happened with the persian carpet, but we can hear the original voice cast for our two protagonist, which is really appreciated.\nThe worst side of this title I believe is the menu and game system, where you don't save because it's an automatic progress but you can't start a new game befor you completely finish it first unless you erase and create a new game profile... An operation that will delete your (ingame) achievements, which is the reason that took me 5 runs instead of just 2 to fully achieve the game.\n\n[h1]+++PROs+++[/h1][list]\n[*][b] GOOD ADVENTURE.[/b] All in all this title represent a good adventure, with tough Hidden Object sections, Some very Hard Puzzles and Riddles, with easier ones, various dialogues with characters and a nice soundtrack.\n[/list]\n[h1]---CONs---[/h1][list]\n[*][b] MAGIC.[/b] Actually This version of the Hound of the Baskervilles doesn't really suit a Sherlock Adventure [spoiler]mostly because it doesn't give an explanation at the end even though for all the time Sherlock says there Must be an explanation[/spoiler].\n[*][b] SAVE SYSTEM AND MENU.[/b] This game doesn't have a way to restart the game unless you finish it first and the only way to do that is to erase your ingame profile and make a new one.

It's a perfectly good game for its genre with good HO scenes and logic in puzzles. The puzzle type and difficulty varies greatly throughout the game; most are doable without guide or hints.\n\nThe story follows Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson as they go with Lord Baskerville to his mansion to find out why his bloodline has apparently been cursed and his ancestors all died to this curse by being attacked by the creature known as the Hound of the Baskerville. \n\nAs a Sherlock story it's a bit... blasphemous; the story has heavy focus on supernatural theme and there no logical solution is found (this is not really a spoiler),\n\nThe game has good visual progress with throughout the game you complete \"badges\" to unlock powers to get into new rooms. Not really sure if this is good or not as it reminded me a bit too much of the much more child-friendly Princess Isabella games. \n\nAll achievements are easily earned; the one it says you get for \"completing the game\" is actually earned for Easy mode only, and as it has an achievement for completing Hard mode, you'll have to play it through twice to get all achievements. All dialogues can be skipped and as I accidentally clicked away a sentence said by a character, I can only assume that the \"do not skip\" achievement is only messed up if you click \"skip\" on dialogues entirely and not for normal left-click for skipping the sayings individually. \n\nI didn't have too much problem with the voice-acting; Sherlock is a bit more enthusiastic in this game than he is in the later P&C games Testament and Crimes and Punishment. The sound effects and music is pretty good, but if you play League of Legends it might annoy you that in one musictrack there are sounds almost identical to \"found a game\" and \"game invite\" in LoL. \n\nBuy more for the Hidden Object genre than for it being a Sherlock Holmes game.
