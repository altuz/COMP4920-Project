I played it for two years and truly enjoyed it thoroughly!!! (WOW, 179 hours!? I noticed only now!)\n\nIn a sense, it feels like chess, with fantasy characters and many many many more units. You choose one among the 6 available teams and are paired against a random opponent (or a friend) in a random arena. Your objective is to destroy all opponent's crystals or kill all of their units.\n\nAll teams are very different between each other and all units are useful in their own way (except you Windblade, you just suck). This opens up nearly endless strategies, depending on the units you get at start - the only RNG part of the game - the team you are facing, the map chosen, and so many other factors.\n\nSince it's turn-based and you have to wait for your opponents to respond, it's perfect to play in short burst; I often played it on my phone during breaks at work and then on my PC when I got home. I usually had 10-20 games open, so I there was always at least one ready.\n\nPro:\n- Cute character design\n- Extremely tactical, with very little RNG\n- Tons of replayability (I played it 179+ hours, no jokes)\n- Great to play on your phone when you have only 5-10 minutes free\n- Teams are unique and have very different units and strategies\n- Teams are very very balanced\n- You have all the time you want to \n\nCons:\n- You typically can't play it for long sessions\n- I'm not sure how many people still play this game. Still, I bet you can still find opponents!\n- You get only two teams with the basic game, so you'll have to buy the rest. But they are worth it! (I think they are much cheaper on mobile shops, so better to buy them there)\n- In high level games, you may have to resort to some basic math pretty often\n- In high level games, \"standstill\" situations may happen, where the board is very balanced. They often take some time to break... like chess.\n\nHero Academy is easily the best turn-based strategy game I ever player, and one of the best games in my list overall! I wholeheartedly recommend it! 9/10"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499594988, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495347", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "33399699", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027769668", "num_reviews": 159, "last_played": 1455439543, "num_games_owned": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2467}, "timestamp_updated": 1499594988, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Before I played:\n\uff3c\uff3c \uff3f\n\u3000\u3000 \uff3c( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 <\u3000\u2312\u30fd\n\u3000\u3000\u3000/ \u3000 \u3078\uff3c\n\u3000\u3000 /\u3000\u3000/\u3000\uff3c\uff3c\n\u3000\u3000 \uff9a\u3000\u30ce\u3000\u3000 \u30fd_\u3064\n\u3000\u3000/\u3000/\n\u3000 /\u3000/|\n\u3000(\u3000(\u30fd\n\u3000|\u3000|\u3001\uff3c\n\u3000| \u4e3f \uff3c \u2312)\n\u3000| |\u3000\u3000) /\n`\u30ce )\u3000\u3000L\uff89\nAfter I played:\n\n\uff0f\uff8c\uff8c \u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u30e0\uff40\u30fd\n/ \u30ce) \u3000 \uff09\u3000\u30fd\n/ \uff5c\u3000\u3000( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0\uff09\u30ce\u2312\uff08\u309d._,\u30ce\n/\u3000\uff89\u23127\u2312\u30fd\u30fc\u304f\u3000 \uff3c\u3000\uff0f\n\u4e36\uff3f \u30ce \uff61\u3000\u3000 \u30ce\uff64\u3000\uff61|/\n\u3000\u3000 `\u30fd `\u30fc-'_\u4eba`\u30fc\uff89\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u4e36 \uffe3 _\u4eba'\u5f61)"}]}
