It consists mostly of reading letters and diaries of different people who lived on the generation ship hundreds of years ago and of discussing them with two AI characters. \n\nThe story is solid, although the message surely lacks subtlety. And several anime tropes seem at odds with the overall tone of the story (I felt that way, at least). Still a worthwile experience, in my opinion."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501974496, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506959", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34048386", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197995993650", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1501972217, "num_games_owned": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 150}, "timestamp_updated": 1502345245, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Overall I am quite mixed about this game.\n\nThere's not much to talk about in terms of gameplay since it is mostly a lot of reading, so the comments will have to be a vague overview of the story.\n\nIf you are wanting to play a novel because you like solving mysteries or experiencing grand ideas, this game is not quite a good fit. There is no complex mystery, nor are the central ideas all that deep or difficult to grasp. This is because the plot pushes a one-sided argument about society, and really, two balanced sides are needed in order to be really explore an idea in an interesting way. On the other hand, the setting and atmosphere is done rather well. There are one or two numbering/math errors if you pay too much attention to details (as if you were a detective or something) but overall I would have to say that this is a well-assembled game that, unfortunately, just happen to miss the vital points which I find enjoyable in novels.\n\nAs a side note.
