Purchasing it I was initially impressed with the game play but frustrated with the difficulties in finding an opponent.  I made teams to match my tabletop ones which won consistently but here this was not the case.  I pressed on assuming that I did not have the skill and it took me time to get used to the interface.  I eventually realized that my gameplay had little to do with it: the rules were subtlety different and at times broken, such as game duration limit and no blitzing off a teleport.  The final blow for me was the Dwarven Deathroller which in my opinion is so broken that I have caught myself swearing at my monitor at least forty times.  All other \"big guys\" have a detriment skill like take root, really dumb, etc. but not this beast.  I calculated that teams I played against that did not have a Deathroller, I won >65% of games while if they did have one, I would win less than 20% of the time.  \n\nWhy not make a team with a Deathroller, Trou?  My answer: why not make a game that is at least reasonably balanced?\n\nI am able to look passed a lot of this game's flaws that are stated here in these accurate reviews but combined together with this diarrhea on top, I would not recommend this game even if you love the table top version like I do.  \n\nJepumk said it best: it is a poorly realized version of the table top game."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1386057873, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527498", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "7892825", "votes_up": 41, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198023238266", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1407615058, "num_games_owned": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 45}, "timestamp_updated": 1386057873, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Awful.
