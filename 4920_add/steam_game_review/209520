Could have been ... Could have been ...\n\nWhen there is one top view racing game out there that does fit this saying then that's the one right here.\n\nI mean, look at the trailer, look at the screenshots, listen to the groovy music or the well made sound effects, take a look at the easy and intuitive track editor, count the vast number of cars available to your garage, ... but it all boils down to one point:\n\nWhy is the rusty old truck faster than my fully modded lamborghini?\n\nDon't get me wrong, i won't even talk about the bad AI that seems to kinda treat this  game more like a brawler than a racing game. Or get into why the players car is always the one loosing when crashing or even just sligthly contacting other cars?\n\nNo, it's just this one thing: The old and rusty truck is faster than my lambo.\n\nWTF?\n\nI'd really love to see the assets of this game made into a well crafted second installment of the (not yet existing) series, because everything else is great and made with so much love and devotion to it. It's just the handling that merely ruins the game and holding it back from being really enjoyable.\n\nBut as it is ATM I think that most owners just play it for the achievement, never to be seen again. And that's a shame, regarding the work that went into making this really pretty game.\n\nYou may get it on discount if you like this type of game, but don't say I didn't warn you."}]}
