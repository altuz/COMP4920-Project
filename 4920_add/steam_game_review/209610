The utter freedom in creating any coaster design you want is great; even if you create physically impossible coasters that would rip it's riders apart; and the fast action makes it addictive. But, still, those controls. They make absolutely no sense; they're hard to get to when you need them and you'll find yourself spending more time crashing your coaster becuase you weren't able to get turned quick enough. \n\nIt's a fun game, it's a *really* fun game; but the controls aren't suited for the kind of fast paced action this game throws at you. They're clunky, they're cumbersome, and they're just in no way suited for this game. If you find it on sale; it's worth about 2 bucks; but I wouldn't give any more for this game.

Its not a theme park came, but very much a build as you ride coaster generator. The concept is nice and create an easy pick up and play format. However, I find there is one main flaw in this game and that is the lack of a rewind feature.  It is quite frustrating to build a really long coaster and have it crash right at the end and have to start all over.  Either restarting 10 seconds before the crash or just a simple rewind feature to be able to go back to any point in your build and deviate from your original plan.  I would invest a lot more time in this game if this was the case.

Wasnt sure what I was expecting from a 3d roller coaster, but in this game you just kind of move around and it lays track as you go.  You dont plan it out as in other tycoon type games.  In this game you need to collect gems adn do stunts.  The controller support is ok but the game is very picky if a jump says 50 mph, and your at 51 or 49 you crash.  Crashing would be more fun if people were on the roller coaster screaming, but the game is mostly silent minus a muted background track.  Meh, woulda been more fun to build a wild ride like Mr.Bones but there is no real building in this game just as you go.
