What I got instead was a horror game with badly-designed puzzles thrown into it, with way too many cutscenes in between the few-and-far-between puzzles.\n\nThe main mechanic of Magrunner is that you can change the magnetic polarity of objects into either red, green, or white. White objects aren't affected, but two objects that are the same polarity will attract, while two objects of different polarities will repel.\n\nThe first problem here is that this is the exact opposite of how we've been taught magnets work when growing up. This on its own wouldn't be too bad, truth be told, and it could actually spawn a good puzzle game where this is the core mechanic. \n\nExcept in this game, it's often not easy to determine the outcome of what happens when you have three or more different magnets, some red and some green, all trying to act on each other but moving in very constrained ways.\n\nFurther, I'm pretty sure the physics engine in this game isn't well-made. I mean, stacking two cubes one on top of another (the game snaps them into place for you) and making them repel will actually send the top one *at an angle*, not straight up! And when a number of puzzles require you to jump on top of these tiny tiny cubes and stay atop them while you fire yourself up, then jump off at the peak onto a narrow platform, one can't help but get frustrated at this game.\n\nPuzzle-wise, things aren't very good either. Many key pieces of the puzzles are tucked away high up on a shelf that's easily missed if you're not careful enough. One early example gave you two cubes at the start of the level, and a switch that you could almost, but not quite, reach with the two cubes. As well as a platform that seemed like it'd lead to the exit. What that platform *actually* leads to is a third cube, but you'd have no way of knowing that unless you actually expended the effort to go up there. Glass exists in this game; why not just put the third cube up there on a glass platform, instead of tucking it behind a curved bend in an alcove in the wall?!\n\nIndeed, the architecture of the levels doesn't feel like it fits a testing facility. You have all these brightly-coloured walls with weird beveled bits that do nothing; small decorations jutting out into the passageway, and giant one-off structures and curvy passages that don't look modular at all (which is what you would expect from a testing facility). It broke immersion quite frequently. Indeed, Portal, going the opposite direction, by making the test chambers all regular and blocky, was better in this respect since you could easily believe that this was how a test chamber would look.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the bloody cutscenes. By the time I'd finished the second level, I'd already spent 10 minutes playing the game. Of which 8 minutes was from watching three (yes, THREE!) cutscenes in the two levels.\n\nTHREE CUTSCENES. TWO LEVELS.\n\nThat's ridiculous.\n\nOther stupid stuff in the game includes:\n\n* All levels before a particular level having the very bottom floor be safe, then that level having the bottom floor be instadeath without it being properly signposted. (A previous level's voiceover suggests that the floor *IS* safe.) Contrast this to Portal, where the first level that has goo has GLaDOS telling you \"The floor here will kill you. Try to avoid it.\".\n\n* The cutscenes. There are a lot of them.\n\n* Putting a hatch into a lower floor underneath a platform. You can't see the hatch and it isn't indicated at all.\n\n* The cutscenes. They're before and after every single level. Sometimes even DURING levels.\n\n* A launcher that launches you straight into the edge of a platform you can't move prior to it. There's no way to--\n\n* The cutscenes. They're really annoying and long and just people talking while you're in an elevator. Or the screen cutting to black with voices when you're in the middle of solving a level. Which idiot thought it was a good idea to INTERRUPT THE PLAYER'S GAMEPLAY the same way I'm interrupting you reading my review right now?!\n\n* --know beforehand where the launchers take you (unlike in Portal where it's indicated).\n\n* The cutscenes. They're mainly just useless boring banter about corrupted corporate image.\n\n* Walking speed is REALLY REALLY SLOW and you can't speed it up. This one should really have been at the top of the list, actually. Oh well, no matter, it's still a stupid thing in the game.\n\n* The cutscenes. Shut up already, Kram!\n\n* The \"change the polarity of the cube you can't get to to bring it to you instead\" mechanic isn't introduced well.\n\n* The cutscenes. Did I mention those? I just want to play the damn game; is it THAT hard to let me do that?!\n\nIt's as if the people making this game didn't take any courses on puzzle design. Or get anyone to test their game (which is ironic considering that their game is about someone getting 7 people to test their system).\n\nBy the time I ragequit an hour into the game, I was having far more fun jumping around in the bloodsplatter of someone who'd been freshly eaten than actually solving the puzzle in the room containing the bloodsplatter. That's honestly a grim outlook for the rest of the game.\n\n(Also, the game doesn't have antialiasing and had a lot of visual tearing on my machine. This is even after I set the game to use the NVIDIA graphics card and anti-alias the game. Prepare to see blocky blocks.)\n\n* The cutscenes. Yes, there are just that many of them.\n\nIf you're looking for a puzzle game, you should actively avoid this monstrosity and play Portal instead for a Portal-like. Or maybe Polarity, because that one's quite good.\n\nIf you're looking for a horror game, consider trying something else (because it takes quite a while before the horror bit shows up).\n\nWhile this game isn't as bad as Soko Match or Rolling Shapes, it's still an abomination, and one I'd want a refund for. But alas, I bought this thing over two years ago, so that's money I'll never get back.\n\n* The cutscenes. Come on, you knew this last one was coming."}]}
