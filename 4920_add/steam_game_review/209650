The only complaint I have about the COD games is that the campaign doesn't seem long enough.  It's not bad, I just end the game feeling like I wanted more and that there \"should\" have been more.  \n\nThe game mechanics are among the best, though.  I like just about everything about the gameplay.\n\nRecommended.\n\nPS. I have high game hours because I leave the game running in the background when not playing.
