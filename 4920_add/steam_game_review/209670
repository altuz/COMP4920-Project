Maybe both.\nIt's true what they say, the game is dead or sure as hell as close to dead as possible, but there's just something that keeps bringing me back from time to time.  No, I did not own the game during a more livelier time of development, the only one that I've ever received my time being here was the last one.  The one that fixed performance, which I was indeed thankful for.\nFor some reason, I can't help but recommend it.  I wouldn't say it's worth twenty dollars, unless you're easily entertained by something that's consistant of the same thing (shooting your opponent in the brain and his pawns in the brainless heads) or something that can be used to waste time in a humorous or even entertaining manner.\n\nThe game itself is simple, mostly comprised of building a base strong enough to protect your brain in a jar, much like a skull would, if a skull could endure bombs and such.  You bring in mindless clones, controlled manually or with basic AI, to defend your base.  This main concept is build upon with multiple gamemodes such as the campaign, in which you assault other bases and try to take over the planet for that sweet gold income.  The major flaw is that this game itself relies a lot on the community, as it'll easily get boring with just the same few factions you're given in the base game, often requiring you to grab mods.  If you don't like repetition, even though it can be amusing at times, or dev abandonment, this probably isn't the game for you.\n\nI have not, however, tried out multiplayer seeing as I'm a loser with no friends in my close area.  If you want a game to hotseat and probably die laughing with a companion as the two of you crab bomb the hell out of eachother, maybe this is for you as well.\nJust be sure not to add too many crabs, you might die from hyper-accelerated crab particles or other deadly crab-related radiation.", "timestamp_updated": 1506421261, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506421261, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34773481", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499802", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505627182, "steamid": "76561198243330150", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "the best and my first game that i bought i give it a 10/10", "timestamp_updated": 1504696337, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504696337, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35276465", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499070", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506982847, "steamid": "76561198166577402", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 104}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "alright, I'm going to get why this game is good out of the way first. this game is pretty fun, has entertaining gore physics, mod support, and a whole lot of replayablility. \n\ndespite the pros, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. the devs have moved on from this UNFINISHED game to a new project, and even had the audacity to put a huge ass ad for it in the cortex command main menu. in it's current state, the damned thing is filled with bugs, like player models and npcs morphing through random objects and burrowing into them. even if you can deal with that, the AI is completely useless. if you ask it to mine, it will either ignore gold and dig dirt or burrow through the bottom of the map killing the bot and the expensive mining equipment, for just one example.", "timestamp_updated": 1506641773, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506641773, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 651, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 151, "total_reviews": 802}}
