The price was always ridiculed on iOS, especially when the devs refused to ever bring it down, even during holiday sales, despite the fact the extra maps were actually at one point DLC that had to be purchased.  Even including the DLC levels, $10 seems a bit off for a bare-bones PC version that doesn't function properly (more on that later) and has been a mega-success for going on 4 years or so now.   This barely rose to the $10 level on iOS, and it's not remotely a $10 on PC in this condition.\n2. The Steam version has a horrendous bug/glitch that the developers have yet to fix where mouse input becomes severely lagged after the second time you play it.  In other words, the first time you play it's fine, but after that the game is unplayable with virtually any form of mouse.  Touchpads on laptops tend to work, but some bizarre problem with the port causes serious issues with mice.  As of my writing this, this is not fixed.  The glitch does not seem to effect everyone, but it effects enough people that it's unfortunate it is not mentioned in the game description.\n\nFieldrunners is a great, basic tower defense game, but this port is really shoddy and the shoulder shrugging response on fixing the bugs frankly makes me regret ever supporting these devs back before they made their fortunes on the Fieldrunners IP.", "timestamp_updated": 1388476002, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1388476002, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34708805", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504436653, "steamid": "76561198056216901", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "its babby's first tower defence", "timestamp_updated": 1504436683, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504436683, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "22188838", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497953", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1343026800, "steamid": "76561197982628667", "num_games_owned": 459, "num_reviews": 290, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Bought this game, realized I\u2019m terrible at this kind of game.", "timestamp_updated": 1459562480, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459562480, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "7826170", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494615", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1400195182, "steamid": "76561197980046433", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of the worst tower defense games I've played", "timestamp_updated": 1385743140, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1385743129, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "10235640", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1435276330, "steamid": "76561198045923996", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Got this game for free somehow.
