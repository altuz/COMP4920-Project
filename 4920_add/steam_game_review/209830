I'm fine with pixel art, but this game just seems really low-res and painful to play for extended periods.\n\nMore importantly, the game itself isn't all that challenging or fun to me, and the story is one of those incomplete-information multiple-interpretation types that can end up pretentious and ineffective if not handled well.

Horror? I was not scared for a moment. Survival? Perhaps an excuse to give you limited items to get past monsters so that you get stuck if you do not manage to use them right. Adventure? More like a walk in your apartment building and city with a lot of meat and weird gurgling. 2D and Indie? .... I guess I'll give it that.\n\nPros;\n-Intruiging start and 'hub' to come back to.\n-Nice and simple graphics that play around with the pixels on occasion\n\nCons;\n-Story is 'interpretable'. I dislike this, but for others it might be fun to theorise what is going on and what the significance is of random bathroom tiles or meat growths in specific rooms. \n-Controls are cumbersome\n-Items appear necessary to progress, but are limited. There is no easy way to revisit a previous part to check if you missed out on a puzzle item or something of the like.\n\n\nI bought this game out of my love for horror games, pixel graphics, and puzzles, but I was let down. The puzzles have, in classic point-and-click fashion, insane solutions. Solving a problem does not so much depend on figuring out a solution as it depends on scouring all the pixels and places for the items you need. \nThe story is what seems to be the most important part of this game, but it is thoroughly incoherent. Told purely from our main character and whatever he sees, there is never a sense that there is a world outside of him. Perhaps intentional, perhaps not. Who knows? Certainly not me, because this story is interpretational and has different endings based on some things you need to do/not do. ( Kill all the monsters, don't kill all the monsters, make a choice in a hospital or something...) \n\nAll the horror classics are here, with none of the refinement or horror. Spooky girl who may or may not be part of your past. Clear signals that not-all-is-right and that your main character might be in a coma/delusion/dream/death. Monsters whose existence are never explained... \n\nPerhaps if the sound design had been better, and the gameplay smoother and more refined, I could have loved this game. As it was, it failed to be scary. It also failed to be fun to play, or intruiging. I do not understand the positive reviews at all - for a horror indie-title with more atmosphere, better monsters, and similarly awkward controls, just download Cry of Fear.", "timestamp_updated": 1502032039, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502032039, "votes_down": 18}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 435, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 48, "total_reviews": 483}}
