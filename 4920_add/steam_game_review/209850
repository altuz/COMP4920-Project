Also, wow, the \"humor\" is even worse - if you can believe that. \n\nIt's not quite as buggy as GT is/was, but there are still some technical problems with it. On the larger maps, the framerate starts to crawl because of the number of units, I suspect because the game isn't quite optimized. There's no music during gameplay, and the sound design leaves a lot to be desired (though I did get a chuckle when I heard the wilhelm scream). Graphics are quite bland, barely passable.\n\nThat said, it does scratch the itch a bit just like Grotesque Tactics did. If you've played through Final Fantasy Tactics enough times to really look for something else, you could find worse.

There's a lot of references to the pop culture and the characters break the fourth wall all the time. The rules (and AI) are simple: you attack and then enemy retaliates if not dead or petrified. There are infinite amount of retaliations. Towers shoot any enemy attacking your troops in their area and also help when you attack. Enemy does not remember where you were last round, so you can always hide in the forest (or go invisible as Trillian) without a large chance of discovery, though sometimes enemy somewhat randomly goes there or hits Trillian anyway while moving and \"discovers\" you.\n\nThere are troops and then there are disposable troops that respawn from keeps, mage towers and such. Like expected you are not allowed to lose hero units who are also better than the rest and have a couple of very useful special skills. There are also 6 different spells that both you and your opponent can use, acquired through capturing monoliths scattered within the levels.\n\nAI is not very smart as it is easy to fool someone who doesn't remember enemies going into the forest, but as a snack-type strategy game this one is fine. There's no multiplayer, so don't expect too much replay value. You may complete each level on a higher difficulty level though, meaning more and stronger enemy troops. The level-based special achievements are a nice touch as well.\n\nDo not expect your mind to be blown (except by the puns) but it's a fine game akin to a snack.
