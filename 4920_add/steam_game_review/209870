At first it seemed like just another Call of Duty ripoff that decided to take the free-to-play route, but as I invested more time into the game, I began realizing how distinct this game is from others. Just pressing the V key is enough to see that.\nIn all honesty I don't know where to begin. The weapon balancing was pretty good, but that kinda changed later. The customization options were, and still are, broad and lets you really personalize your character. The community was fantastic for the most part, and as time went on, the playerbase decreased, which led to each lobby being like those old towns you hear about where everyone knows each other. \nThere was a time for about a year and a half where the developers did not update the game due to internal problems, and the game's functionality certainly reflected that. The servers didn't work too well, constantly crashed, were rather laggy, ect. A lot of the playerbase died out at this point since the game was having these problems, but it just made the loyal parts of the community closer.\nThen they updated it after all that time with the Parity patch. They took all of the new content from the PS4 version and brought it to PC, which everyone was excited for at first. What ended up happening was we got a game that felt really strange and unlike what we were used to. Recoil was reduced greatly, which limited the viable builds to be damage-focused builds for the weapons. The question for moving further into the game changed from \"how can I build this gun to fit my playstyle and comfort?\" to \"how can I build this gun to do more damage?\". To me, this lack of diversity ruins the fun for me, especially considering the amount of diversity before the Parity patch.\nIf I were to have written this three years ago, I would have said that this was the best multiplayer FPS game available and that if you are willing to grind a bit to find equipment that matches your playstyle, you will enjoy this game greatly. But sadly I can't say that anymore. I would not recommend this game to anyone looking for a fresh FPS experience.", "timestamp_updated": 1487324708, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487324708, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29633162", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 49, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549570", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1454985198, "steamid": "76561198018642305", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 21139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "This game will never return to its previous glory.", "timestamp_updated": 1485972558, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485972558, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "29699757", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544699", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1407268835, "steamid": "76561198054935029", "num_games_owned": 683, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 6016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "One of the most painful downvotes for me, some of my best gaming memories were with blacklight in 2013-2015 i was honestly addicted and managed to even pull my friends into playing it, blacklight was seriously one of the best balanced and well playing f2p fps games out there and it was a game that people kept coming to, that is not an easy feat in the f2p fps market sadly the devs just randomly left it to die, they also released patches which activatly made just about everything worse and they never did fix that, there is so much money left that could have been made, this was a great game in its haydays, it still looks fantastic as well which is such a shame. This was one of the games that made me move to pc gaming exclusively and now its dead all because the developers randomly abandoned it when it was going strong when there was an active scene surrounding it, it is a shame because it could have been so much more however good things must come to an end and this has met its end just slowly being starved of servers and players until it is no more. \n\nI met a lot of friends because of this, found a new platform and so many options, it will be sad when the servers ultimately shut down but this is an example of how you can screw up even when you were doing everything correctly, this is what happens when you forget who your true audience is. \n\nhardsuit labs made a fantastic game and perfect world destroyed it.", "timestamp_updated": 1486232591, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486232591, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "30105461", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529066", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1479439482, "steamid": "76561198102053794", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The best \"has been\" fps game, if only there was a time machine to go back to the good days of full servers and accessable gun attachments.
