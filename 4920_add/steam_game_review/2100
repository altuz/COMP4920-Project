Compared to most of such games, this is a perfect medieval fantasy game. Realtime combat with a sufficient degree of actual player skill involved. Somewhat interesting story/dialogue. The game mechanics work for me. If you are a fan of the genre, it's a bit more than simply worth playing. Especially since it holds up compared to much of what I've played from modern day, mind you this game is old. I know this isn't saying much but the combat's clearly better than e.g. Skyrim, and people love that excuse for a \"game,\" so you may as well play this actual literal game. It's not too long, it's not too short, so you may as well.

I remember playing the demo when it first came out and it blew my mind. I can't think of a game that's come close to the sandbox combat of this game:\n\nEnemies are more likely to fall over if they're hit while climbing stairs. You can shoot ice on the ground to make enemies slip and fall like idiots. There's one catacombs zombie level where I can bypass the whole thing with creative use of the Rope Bow, which lets you create climbable ropes in the environment.\n\nYou level up purely by progressing through the levels, meaning you're 100% free to get to the end however you see fit. There's zero grinding, and no punishments for creative play.\n\nIf you even remotely like the look of the trailers, then buy this game.
