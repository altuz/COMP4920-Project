Gameplay can get pretty repetitive. You often have to go back and redo levels multiple times once you've unlocked more characters in order to find all the collectables.  If you're a perfectionist, this can lead to a fair amount of frustration.\n\nHonestly, the game is most fun if you play with a friend, and just enjoy the ride without obsessing about finding every little detail. But there IS plenty to find for those who do want 100% it.\n\nThe main downside is that there is still no online multiplayer, only local."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506791337, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35346870", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198282267165", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506896026, "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 221, "playtime_forever": 221}, "timestamp_updated": 1506791337, "received_for_free": false, "review": "my childhood"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505402396, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508593", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34950559", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198109673389", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1505401748, "num_games_owned": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2814}, "timestamp_updated": 1505402396, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It was an old game but this was one of the first few LEGO themed masterpiece where it has no voice over feature, unlike recent LEGO titles.

The LEGO blocks building, constructing game play made me love it so much. Easy yet challenging. Nice to play and a lot of unlockables.

If you have played a LEGO game before, you know what to expect for the most part. You can expect humorous cut scenes with linear levels where you advance by solving simple puzzles. In the LEGO Batman series many of the \"puzzles\" are based on having a specific suit equipped on either Batman or Robin. Once you complete a level in story mode you unlock if for free play so you can visit with other characters and obtain all the collectibles. \n\nYou will likely think Batman and Robin are the only characters playable in story mode + will be confused on how you unlock the majority of the villains for most of the game. Well, that is because you unlock a villain story mode AFTER you complete a story mode as only Batman and Robin.... which can drag as, in my experience, the villain story mode was much more fun than the Batman and Robin one.\n\nCharacters, extras, and Batman comic trivia are all unlocked at a console on the lower level of the Bat Cave. On that lower level is also the console that unlocks the villain story mode based in Arkhum Asylum, but it is only accesible after you beat the Batman and Robin storyline.\n\nWhy do I recommend this? I love LEGO, the cut scenes are enjoyable, if you want simple gameplay to relax with this is your ticket, and of course: LEGO Batman and company. Be aware this game is ONLY Batman and company unlike the two sequels that include the rest of the DC universe. This game is also (of course) a lot simpler and shorter than the later LEGO games."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506010984, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35108388", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320018202", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506969734, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_forever": 337}, "timestamp_updated": 1506010984, "received_for_free": false, "review": "love the game but it won't let me jump on things how do i fix it"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505531383, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34986427", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198182515645", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1483236193, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 54}, "timestamp_updated": 1505531460, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I am a fan of  Dc  and lego is my childhood a game abot both yes please. \n\n\n\n                                                 8 out of 10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505351200, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "34939971", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198035291869", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1349334000, "num_games_owned": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 18909}, "timestamp_updated": 1505351200, "received_for_free": false, "review": "good"}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505106778, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480003", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34876998", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376670707", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505101092, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 15}, "timestamp_updated": 1505106778, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I absolutely love the story to this game, but I can't recommend buying it on PC.
