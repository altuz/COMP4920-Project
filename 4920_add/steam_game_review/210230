A lot of the puzzles are challenging, and you have to use too many references to solve them. There aren't any hints from Bess or anyone else. Because you're in an Egyptian tomb, the environment is very busy, as in a lot of hieroglyphics everywhere, therefore it's hard to catch hotspots.\n\nOverall, this is a good game.
