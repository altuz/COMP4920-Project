Part 2 has the same basic Beat-Em-Up gameplay, but manages to be more repetitive and overall worse. Just like in Part 1, the storyline itself is actually a strong point. It's a separate storyline from part 1, and shows a possible explanation for why Rorschach and Nite Owl Split. It touches upon some interesting themes such as the difference between what is legal and what is ethical, and has an interesting gameplay twist at the very end, so the plotline is decent. \n\nWhat isn't so good is the gameplay. In part 1, you could unlock new moves, which kept the gameplay from getting completely stale. In part 2, you start off with all of the moves from part 1 unlocked, which makes sense, but you don't unlock anything more. You end the game with the same skills you started with, meaning there is no progression and the difficulty curve is more of a difficulty flatline. Furthermore, part 2 is the same length as part one (about three hours), but has half as many levels (a total of 3), meaning you're stuck in the same area for twice as long and fighting the same enemies for twice as long (and just like part 1, there's really only two or three enemy types, just having different models on each level). The effect that all of this has is that every fight in the game is essentially identical, and since the game is almost nonstop fighting, you're going to have a bland time. Furthermore, the final level is just annoying, as it consists of you chasing the villain through a mansion. Everytime you catch up to said villain, she says something essentially boiling down to \"HAHA YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME WATCHMEN\" and then runs off to another room. This repeats several times in a row and just felt like a lame way to keep you moving through the level.\n\nOverall, can't reccomend this one, even though the story is decent."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1412298638, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521955", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "12332407", "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983372988", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1412297462, "num_games_owned": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 227}, "timestamp_updated": 1412298638, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I played the second part and like the first it was short even shorter than the first part with only 3 chapters.

Other than that, if you like Final Fight, Double Dragon, and games of that sort, you will find this a decent button mashing brawler. The theme is a bit more adult than the last one and seeing Rorschach's brutal moves used against the female baddies...well, it was brutal, lol. \n\nHere is my review for the first one. Like I said, pick it up on sale and you get a decent brawler that tries hard and manages to miss the mark yet is still strangely fun. \n\n\"4.9 hours in aaaannnd, we've beaten this beatemup! I do recommend it, conditionally. It has its good points and bad but for the most part it delivers an entertaining few hours of smash and well, more smash. \n\nThe Good: \nThe moves are pretty smooth and easy to pull off. \nThe story fits the mood of the comics/movie well. \nIt's not bad if you get it on sale for 1-3 bucks. \nIt's like a modern Double Dragon or Final Fight. \n\nThe Bad: \nThe graphics are dated. They do the job though, barely. \nNo replayability really. \nRepetitive. You fight. It's a modern Final Fight. \nThe combos are ok but you mainly end up doing the dodge/counteratttack move. \n\nThe Ugly:\nDon't pay full price for it. \nIt's short. I logged the 4.9 hours and I napped in between a couple of levels with the game open, lol.\nThe options are abysmal. \nNeed more playable characters. \nThe gore looks cheesy.\n\nBottom line is this. If you can get it on sale and enjoy a button mashing fight fest with a gritty undertone and slick moves then this game is for you. \n\nJust be aware going in about exactly what it is you are buying here. \nNOTE: If you use an XBOX 360 controller (wireless) be sure to change the setting to use the wired version. Otherwise you get a stuck camera angle and non-responsive controls. The wireless mapping is hosed. \n\nAnyway, just my opinion here but I didn't hate it, didn't love it, got it on sale and don't regret the time spent with it\"\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1443906993, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498662", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "18314714", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197976528105", "num_reviews": 140, "last_played": 1443906800, "num_games_owned": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 154}, "timestamp_updated": 1443907022, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Hilarious, cheesy & fun."}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1408005773, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509077", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "11698721", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198012910130", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1421901656, "num_games_owned": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 257}, "timestamp_updated": 1408005773, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Same as the first one, a co-op brawler aimed at the watchmen fans.

This is probably my lightest recommendation ever. Let's start with this. Watchmen: The End is Nigh 2 has a completely different storyline than part 1. I enjoyed that part as you're trying to solve the mystery of trying to find a girl who is posiibaly involved in an illegal porn ring. The level design I thought was actually pretty cool. Very detailed and I loved hearing Rorashach and Nite Owl voiced by Jackie Haley & Patrick Wilson respectively. But FFS the one note gameplay and enemy \"variety\" was a joke. This game pretty much goes beat up anywhere from four to ten of 2-4 different enemy types per level, then open a door. I am absolutely not kidding you. Maybe once in a while you'll solve a door puzzle or pick a lock but for the majority of this game you'll be fighting generic enemies. This is where playing an unbelievable game like Sleeping Dogs (seriously, go buy that NOW if you don't have it) helps as you'll be button mashing with the help of some countering. I'll admit though. I enjoyed myself during the two hours I put into this.  I ended up blowing through both games in a toal of about five hours. Absolutely do not buy this at full price. Sale though?
