Sometimes way too much money is given, other missions will leave you with just 2 towers because thats all you can afford. There is also no recompensation for playing alone, the money received is the same, meaning that some maps are only beatable with 4 players. Good luck finding them, most servers are empty.\n\nThe characters weapons are all horribly underpowered, and the characters themselves are very squishy and fragile, yet the towers too are too weak to deal with most enemies, forcing an uncomfortable compromise of pulling in and out of action quickly.\nNo money is given during the waves for kills, which makes it hard to deal with bosses that destroy towers. \nSpeaking of bosses: Most will be armored head to toe, making them flat out invulnerable to any tower attacks, except lucky shots. A challenge is of course welcome but rendering all your towers useless is a bit too much.\nConsidering that all those issues (and many more) have remained unfixed for now 4 years, this speaks ill of the developers skill or commitment to their product.", "timestamp_updated": 1506648523, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506648523, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "35360539", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491224", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1451529500, "steamid": "76561198165955452", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "just not as fun as it looks", "timestamp_updated": 1506823327, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506823327, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "35258350", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478446", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503609185, "steamid": "76561198103195728", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "hm", "timestamp_updated": 1506591913, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506591913, "votes_down": 15}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3271, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 7, "total_negative": 231, "total_reviews": 3502}}
