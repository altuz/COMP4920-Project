At first glance, one might dismiss F.E.A.R, writing it off as yet another first person horror game.\nWhen you actually get into the game, though, you will be greeted by some of the best shooter mechanics you'll ever see in a game. Even at release, the inclusion of bullet time was something not entirely groundbreaking. However, F.E.A.R has many other great elements that add to up a near-perfect experience. The AI, of course, is one of the most impressive elements of F.E.AR. \nEnemies will react dynamically, and communicate in a realistic manner. You don't get the impression that you're fighting yet another generic fps enemy. They'll flank you, throw grenades, and vault over cover. They'll even dodge your shots! The best comparison I can give would be to the Covenant from Halo, but even they pale in comparison to F.E.A.R's enemy AI. \nThe inclusion of some pretty impressive physics also add a satisfying punch to your arsenal. You'll often notice papers being blown around, or lights being shaken. Everything in the game world will be affected by your use of weaponry. The enemies also have this over-the-top reaction to your bullets. They'll often be thrown around the envrionment. One weapon can even pin them to the nearest wall. Ragdoll physics were so satisfying back then...\n\nThe story, while sparse, is still something that impresses. I  often found myself poking around the environments in search of any background I could find on the events leading up to the story. It's riveting stuff. \nIt's just so great, and at only 10 dollars, it's a steal.\nIt comes with all the expansions, so it'll definitely keep you busy too. This is a must-buy for any FPS fan."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507051916, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517559", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35452563", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049908459", "num_reviews": 56, "last_played": 1489941935, "num_games_owned": 1027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1477}, "timestamp_updated": 1507088694, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Made in 2005. Still unmatched even today. \n\nIn a modern \u0440ussyfi\u0435d world where good action game is as scarce as water or fuel in mad max. It must be hard to make something as thrilling and dynamic as F.E.A.R. That's why we never got a proper sequel to it. I think F.E.A.R. took the best from shooters, before Modern Warfare came and compeletely ruined the genre for years to come. \n\nThe gunplay is superb, like in best of John Woo's movies. Its a joy to break into a room full of clone soldies and riddle them all with lead in glorious slow motion, with bodyparts and bloodsplatters everywhere, and the room ending up looking like swiss cheese after. But it's not just about shooting dumb cannon fodder, rather about dispatching groups of well trained enemies, so you also have to be cunning and mobile while you at it.\n\nNot to mention decent enough story as a bonus, with masked protagonist, pointman (basically you) and without any annoying secondary characters, well aside from Norton Mapes. \n\nA perfect shooter in my book. So if you want to feel like an action hero, go play it, di\u0441ks... i mean kids."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506389974, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35213877", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197998978818", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1504968917, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 53}, "timestamp_updated": 1506389974, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A great combination of horror elements and real hard-core FPS.
