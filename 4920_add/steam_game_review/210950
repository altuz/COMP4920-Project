A brutal, fun and unique hack n slash game with great enemy and level variety with a awesome soundtrack that just sets the mood so well. The levels are done in a old school shooter way, which means they are big and there's a lot of them! You have several types of weapons and multiple different tiers within those types. You also have  powers by collecting Runes which depending on the weapon do certain magical abilities. The voice acting works, sort of a cheesy action movie style, the art direction and armor designs are a sort of gothic meets viking style which is pretty awesome and memorable. There's even a awesome mod that allows you to play the campaign in coop or even download some of the custom campaigns to play together. This game truly is a hidden gem within the genre, something if you're a fan of action and adventure games or Hack n Slash you shouldn't miss it. There's also a fun multiplayer mode and the game runs great on modern systems. \n\nAll in all, a lot of fun, exciting and easily replayable. It's still crazy you never hear about it especially since the people who made this did the Heretic/Hexen games. So check this title out and here's to hoping the new Rune game they have coming out is just as good. \n\nTil' Valhalla!!!", "timestamp_updated": 1506209163, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506209163, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 198, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 207}}
