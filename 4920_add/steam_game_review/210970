Where are you? Why are you here? Doesn't matter, here is a puzzle. A very simplistic one. Draw a line from A to B. It opens a door, leading to another puzzle. This time the line has a knick in the middle. Fair enough, it's more complex than a line. This opens a second door, leading to the outside, where you can see the blue sky...\n\nThe game takes place on an island where you can wander around, look at the beautiful landscape and find lots of puzzle panels. The core mechanic is always the same: Draw a single line from a valid start to a valid end. It does collide with itself, which means that intersections are not possible. That alone doesn't sound exciting, right? But there are lots of additional mechanics the developers have in store for us. What starts simple soon becomes pretty complex, when different mechanics start interacting with eachother.\n\nAs you may already guess, it's far from an action game. You can walk and you can look around. Jumping or falling of ledges is not possible. And there are no enemies that can attack you or distract you from your puzzles. You can take all the time you want, thinking about the problem before your eyes, maybe scribbling some shapes onto a piece of paper next to you. The graphics are beautiful and very colorful, the whole island feels very calm and peaceful.\n\nAlso, there is more to the game than just solving one panel after the other.

no, puzzles for me have taken 2, 3 hours just for one. joseph, above, pointed out that the steam page literally says that this game treats your time as precious, which as you progress, continually shows itself as a blatant lie. and you may assume that with a game with \"500+\" challenging puzzles, this makes for a huge time investment. except for one thing.\n\nthere aren't really 500+ puzzles.\n\nit's pretty clear that this is just a marketing tool, and because as you progress, simple puzzles that consist of a LEGITMATE STRAIGHT LINE add to this count. it's ridiculous and annoying. \n\nthat's not even to the main part yet - the story. this is what drew me into the witness, something that made me so very inclined to buy it - this mystery of an abandoned island, frozen stone figures, a town in shambles, and a plot, or so i thought, to unfold.\n\nthis is honestly the most fucking bullshit i've ever heard, because this game has zero story at all. zero. the \"ending\" consists of you flying around the island as all of the puzzles that you've done, all of the work that you've put into this, slowly unravels. the puzzles turn off, and you're back were you started the very beginning of the game. the game quits. and that's it. t h a t s  i t.\n\nthere is, of course, a \"secret ending\" which is even more bullshit than the first. finding a secret entrance to a \"lobby\" as it's well-known, you walk around this sky palace, then through what appears to be limbo, and then you wake up. a video plays for a solid ten minutes of a dude stumbling around an office before laying outside in the rain and going back to sleep. honestly, i was a little confused too.\n\nthe part of the game that annoyed me the most, however, was how stupid half of the puzzles were. there were many sections that i enjoyed - the quarry was probably one of my favorites, as was the shady trees and the keep. besides that, they confused the hell out of me - so much that i didn't know what to do. the jungle was nice for the first few levels, but then spiraled into random puzzles that didn't make sense even after i knew the answer. the swamp did a terrible job of explaining that i could combine tetrises in different ways. for half of the desert ruins. i had no idea how to obtain nor even start to obtain the answers. i get that the glare was the answer, but for most there was no glare to begin with, and experimenting with lights and water levels did nothing to change that. the town was great. i enjoyed it immensely. the mountain was great, but still had some puzzles that still today confuse me. i have no idea how in the hell to solve the puzzle on the final floor of the mountain, and i hated the puzzles on the first floor stuck in that jumble of trash in the center. \n\nthis isn't even to mention the obelisks, which were some of the best and worst moments i had in the game. the problem with these obelisks puzzles were how contrived they were. when they were in accessible locations and required little effort to solve but actual effort to find, they were at their best. some however. were stupid for the point of being stupid. the main example of this is the one found in the theater as the psalm of 46 plays, where YOU WAIT FOR A FUCKING HOUR FOR THE MOON TO MOVE SO YOU CAN FINISH OFF YOUR PUZZLE. you cannot move. you cannot do anything but sit and wait for it to finish. this similar concept of waiting for a ridiculously fucked up amount of time for something to happen also happens in 4 to 5 other places throughout the game, most notably the bridges in the swamp. \n\nfinally, a little suggestion - for some reason the pc port of the game has only 2 achievements, while the ps4 port has at least 14, including one for each of the lasers. i feel like i would've enjoyed the witness more if those achievements were added to the witness, and gave me feelings of accomplishments while also allowing me to compare myself to other players' standings. with only 2 achievements that you can only get about 20 hours into the game, there wasn't really any way for me to feel good about myself after completing a section. just something to think about.\n\ntl dr; this game is great in some aspects, but generally terrible in many. i enjoyed some of my time with the witness, but also hated most of it as well. if you're looking for something in the same vein as braid, look somewhere else. i loved braid. this is nowhere near as good as braid. period. i advise against buying unless you can get it for $5. i got it for $10 and i still think that that money would have been well spent elsewhere.", "timestamp_updated": 1505668831, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505598984, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35061679", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1492476001, "steamid": "76561198175787383", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "2HARD4ME.

There's no logic involved in many puzzles - they are simply ARBITRARY. It's like trying to understand why 2 + 2 = 3 and just after it changes to 2 + 2 = 7. Logic is all based on premises; if the premises keep changing, what you have is arbitrariness and nothing more. Randomness doesn't make the game \"intelligent\".
