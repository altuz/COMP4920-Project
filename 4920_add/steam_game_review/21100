And despite this, F.E.A.R. 3 will still perform worse than both its predecessors on lower end hardware even at its lowest settings and with DirectX 9 forced on.\n\n - While the developers clearly did what they could to salvage a thinning story, they still managed to completely muck-up several key plotholes that even casual fans of the series would be highly irritated with (The Harlan Wade factor, the disregard for F.E.A.R. 2 Reborn, an inpromptu transition from the end of Extraction Point to F.E.A.R. 3, the wanton disposal of Michael Beckett as a series' character, the list goes on...).\n \n - Gunplay [strike]feels like[/strike] [i]is[/i] a watered down Call of Duty; the guns do not sound realistic even by CoD standards, the guns are not balanced -- several were clearly intended not to be used except in specific situations -- and the ai, while manageable, just doesn't have the teamwork capabilities of its predecessors (especially F.E.A.R. 1).\n\nAs I stated at the beginning of this review, F.E.A.R. 3 leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth; the series' fans hate it for the evident lack of quality control and damage to the storyline, while casual players are turned off by a generic CoD gunplay clone and what they perceive to be a bland, confusing storyline where the final turn off is when they realize that, yes, [u][i][b]everyone is freaking related to everyone else and that's the whole friggin' point!!!!![/b][/i][/u].\n\nThat being said, I call F.E.A.R. 3 my favorite bad game for a few reasons: bias, pity and self-loathing.  Bias, in that I'm a fan of the previous titles.  Pity, in that I'm aware of the very limited timeframe the developers had forced upon them by Warner Brothers.  And self-loathing, in that I don't know any better than to hold on to only a handful of franchises I like no matter how underground or deteriorated they become.  \n\nAnd, yes, it can also just be a stupid-fun game."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506570245, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510757", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35254053", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198057926617", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1506568443, "num_games_owned": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 251, "playtime_forever": 251}, "timestamp_updated": 1506570245, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Had fun with a good pal, played the entire game in co-op and it was a pretty good experience.

Do not use money to get this game. This game craps on everything that was the first game. Gone are the atmospheric levels and the intriguing story - in their place are garbage spec-ops like COD levels and a cover system so generic I can't even think of a sarcastic way to insult it. This game is to gaming what a steaming pile of cow poop is to gaming. I will pretend that this game does not exist - FEAR 1 is the only game in the series, 2 and 3 are made up. It's just so heartbreaking to see what this series has become. \n\nThere is literally no redeeming quality to this game - it's not scary, it's forgettable, the story sucks, every single previous feature has been neutered (you can only hold 2 guns, you have to UNLOCK the hand-to-hand abilities from the previous game, and the enemies are somehow more lackluster and devoid of character than freaking CLONES). And, there's a so-called progression system that does nothing (or, at least it seems that way). I genuinely want to be angry as I write this because I wasted money on this but instead I am just.... disappointed. \n\nBottom line, do not buy this game. Hell, don't even pirate it. I intend to beat this game eventually because I still for some reason want to finish the series, but I already know I'm gonna be wishing for my 2 hours back. I could spend those two hours watching a good movie, talking to girls, working on my fitness, reading, or doing literally anything else but NOPE. I'm gonna be a sucker and attempt to get my money's worth out of this steaming pile of game. Sigh. The first game was really freaking good.

The timeline has absolutely no mention of its relation to the other 2 games (9 months post F.E.A.R 1 and 2 events; had to Google), and the storyline it offers feels out of place. \n\nF.E.A.R. 3 doesn't give the same creepy, sometimes scary, and unsettling atmosphere and gameplay as the other two titles. In fact, I spent more time running through rooms without a care in the world then I did cowering in a corner as I await the horrors of the unknown.\n\nAs was wondefully present with the first game (and in a lot of instances, the second), the enemy AI doesn't feel as fluid and intelligent as they once did. Instead of attempting to silently flank you or respond on a dime, the AI decides to camp a spot and pop out of cover predictably.\n\nIn F.E.A.R. 3, they decided to add this horrid, terribly out of place and ludicrous ranking and point gathering system. Urging to dash down a corridor and sweep that soldier off his feet in the first mission? Well, you can't unlock that till rank 2. \n\nThe playtime as compared to the previous 2 titles is ridiculous. It took me roughly 4 hours to complete the entire game.\n\nIf you're expecting to be able to gather medpacks and eagerly search every little area for a reflex booster, they also added regenerative health and a reflex boost on certain level rankings.\n\nPros:\nIf you're looking for a pretty decent FPS that bumps shoulders with Call of Duty, I'd certainly recommend F.E.A.R. 3."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506828574, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35362277", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198009618175", "num_reviews": 21, "last_played": 1506883041, "num_games_owned": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 587, "playtime_forever": 587}, "timestamp_updated": 1506828574, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A great game.
