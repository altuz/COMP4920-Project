You know, Final Fight alike where you can move to front and rear of the screen and can grab enemies just by moving toward them. It was developed by Sega of Japan, their Sega CS division. I wonder if makers of SoR2, Ancient, were involved as well. It came out in 1994. 24 Megabit ROM.\n\nThe game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version.\nThe Western one, not the original Japanese one. Yep, the censored one that was made much harder.\n\n\nNow, for usual technical part about Sega's emulation here:\nThe Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for \"Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Classics\" game that should appear in your library.\nBy default it runs 3D bedroom Hub. Since emulator itself is based on 2006 one made in Java and 3D Hub is made in Unity, both famous for having not-good optimization, the performance in this hub varies from one PC to another. Sound lags as well.\nIt's recommended to run Simple Launcher, which can be done by Right Mouse Clicking the Sega Classic title in Steam library and selecting it. It still isn't perfectly accurate emulation, but it's acceptable. Sadly, it doesn't have user-friendly access to mods.\nHowever, Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu, so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time! Also, yes, emulator supports quick saves.\nAs alternative, you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Kinda like when people use ZDoom source port to run Doom on Steam. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in \"uncompressed ROMs\" folder that program itself doesn't use, the file for this one being \"STREETS3_<Region letter>.68K\".\nYep, that means that original Japanese version is included. Too bad that launchers aren't set to be able to run it.\nI also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. Go to \"manuals\" folder of game root and open \"SoR3_PC_MG_EFIGS_WW_HR.pdf\".\n\nThough you may want to look up some moves in scans of JP ref sheet or on GameFAQs.\n\nWhile the game has multiplayer mode for two players, the emulator doesn't have any online function for that, so it's local only.\n\nAnd it's one of games to use 6 buttons controller, yep.\n\n\nThe gameplay core is usual Final Fight style. Move anywhere on battlefield, attack left and right, get close to grab. Use Specials to get yourself out of trouble and for beat down. Streets of Rage 2 was a slow-paced game that focused on making each punch feel meaty. SoR3 goes in a different direction, increasing the pace, complete overdrive. Every character can now dash by tapping direction key two times, enemies zip around.\n\nIn order to fit to hectic pace of the composers changed the music style around. It's now upbeat techno while going more weird in more ambient pieces. It's not as melodical as previous two games but fits perfect. Devs also changed the art style around, keeping the big sprites but giving them realistic look. Doesn't look too good in spots. Yea, the night romance is gone. And why did they change the perfect hit sounds of SoR2?\n\nThanks to 6-button controller, you can pull off backward attack with Z button and the final hits with Y button. You can roll up and down by pressing two times there. Western version actually made it go farther.\nProtip: Press Up+Jump when thrown to land onto feet.\n\nEvery 400k points you get a star, up to three, \u2013 a level up for your F-F-Attack.  You lose one star if you die. There is alternative for 6-button controller \u2013 if you press X and then input certain motions on D-Pad then you will pull of a certain upgraded version no matter how many stars! However it's so awkward that I prefer making look that this method doesn't exist.\n\nYou got 4 characters to play as, all of them have their own playstyle. Axel and Blaze are back. I think Blaze got slightly buffed in western version. While Skate's dash isn't unique to him anymore he is still the fastest character in this game and isn't as pathetic as he was in SoR2. Max, being a slow grabber that wouldn't fit to new pace, got replaced by Dr. Zan, who was made into cyborg by Dr. Dahm, who's main features is the reach of attacks. He also turns all weapons into energy ball and always yells \u201cPowerup!\u201d. I find all of them balanced.\n\nThere are unlockable chars, none can use weapons. There is kangaroo. Has no throws but delievers non-stop punches. He was buffed in Western version in both attack and jump. You can get him by not killing him in Stage 2. Now Shiva requires cheat code and feels unfinished. He does have best reach and Z button attack allows for infinite. Ash, miniboss of Stage 1, also requires cheat code but he was cut from Western version due to being homo. He is another unfinished but powerful character.\nProtip: When held behind press jump and then attack to throw opponent away.\n\nWeapons are back and, just like in SoR1, you don't drop them when you grab somebody. You can use Z button to throw them or to swap weapons with the one on ground. While keeping \u201c3 knockouts and out\u201d rule for weapons they also added hard-limit use-bar. It sucks but then each character specializes in weapons differently, which is awesome, and some even replace their special attack, so use-bar makes sense.\n\nIt's a shame that stages in this game aren't insired until the end of the game. At least one has pits that were missing from SoR2, yay! The game has two different final levels. If you do good on Stage 6 then you go to Jungle Base. You get either totally bad or good ending depending on if you beat final boss that is awful \u201ccheese or die\u201d one.\nOtherwise you are going to White House. Oh, sorry, \u201cCity Hall\u201d as written on a gate. Did I tell you that Sega of America remade story to plothole-filled one? Shame that this path leads to somewhat-bad ending as it's a cool SoR style final. \n\nSoA in localization also decided to change outfit colors of main heroes to \u201cgender neutral\u201d. Quite ugly. And they covered up enemy women. At least new voice samples aren't so bad and sound engine got fixed.\n\nAs for options menu, there are sound test, controls. Amount of lives per continue. And oh boy, difficulty.\nSoA not only censored game but also upped each difficulty so BK3 Hard is now SoR3 Normal. They increased the damage on each difficulty that enemies do and gave bosses extra health that drags them out.\nThey do say that BK3 lacked hard difficulty but yet. Plus, \u201cgamers back then loved hard games\u201d which means \u201cthey rented more\u201d. It's too bad that they made Easy mode end after Stage 5, giving you a hacked up ending.\n\nI hated these changes at first and was cursing SoA. Then I played some more and realized that it's a case of public opinion having an impact on me: the game isn't unfair. It's fun, just take some practise like other Genesis games.\n\nNot only SoA take but they also gave. There is a strenght bar that regenerates over time. At full the A button special doesn't take any health away, dropping strenght to zero. But the less you have it the more health it takes and less effective it is. In BK3 at worst it could take almost 1/4 of the health bar! In SoR3 at worst it takes SoR2-like tiny amount, if not less. As a result you should use them often for offensive and always for defensive, when grabbed. Use it!\n\nAh, there is multiplayer. You can play the game in coop mode. With friendly fire. Good fun. They brought back team attacks from SoR1. Just grab your opponent and either jump over or throw him away for high-damaging air attack.\n\nWell, or you can play Battle Mode against each other. Just a silly bonus, it's not Street Fighter. Catching each other and out-abusing specials. At least the game is fast.\n\nWhile this is indeed one of the worst localizations ever due to SoA touching more things that it should, gameplay-wise SoR3 is more than valid.
