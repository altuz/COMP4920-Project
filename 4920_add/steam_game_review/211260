Lovecraft and classic horror.\", I don't think I could describe the game much better than that.  \n\nPrimarily I divide the game into two main categories, level completion and level challenges.  \n\n[h1]Level completion[/h1] is pretty self-explanatory, just finish the level.  There'll be animated cutscenes, enemies, and DEATHS.  There's no time limit, no requirement to obtain the hidden collectibles, and your rank is irrelevant.  It's the easiest and shortest option that should give you about 9-10 hours of total playtime including the extra levels.\n\n[h1]Level challenges[/h1] are completely different, for [b]EVERY SINGLE LEVEL[/b] you'll be required to kill all enemies, obtain all pages, get A ranks, S ranks, beat the level without dying, and speedrun the level (in no particular order).  From what I understand this doesn't actually unlock anything new for you to try, it's just an extra challenge if you found the game fun and want to master it.  I'm sitting at 100 achievements at 24 hours and would imagine getting a full 100% would take 40 or more.  The real masochism in this game lies mostly in finishing the extra levels whilst attempting these challenges, they're significantly longer and harder than the campaign levels.\n\nThe controls are... alright.  At times they felt a bit clunky but the game never felt unresponsive or dropped any inputs.  If you get used to it the game will be fun.  The music is good too, it lies in an area in-between almost catchy and somewhat atmospheric.  It fits the game design well while remaining understated so as not to distract you whilst playing.  If forever reason you particularly enjoy it you can get the $5 DLC of the 2 hour OST in it's entirety with FLAC audio (very high-quality).\n\nEvery now and again this goes on sale for $2, put the game on your wishlist and you'll get notified when it goes on sale.  Although if you at least plan on finishing the base game it's worth the full price too in my opinion.", "timestamp_updated": 1505067184, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505005446, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35088995", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499246", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1433611118, "steamid": "76561198032541409", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is fun and the purple chick is hot.", "timestamp_updated": 1505929741, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505929741, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1015, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 157, "total_reviews": 1172}}
