Solid entry in the genre. Limited ambitions but concentrates featureset on solid Xbox360 pad support, atmospheric environments and unlockable upgrades.\n\nGood core elements of the genre, co-op, not too frustrating, decent level design, some gamepad support, does not overuse zombie style enemies, and better than average visuals and sound for games of this genre and price tier. A central hub area to go from level to level, a large enough supply of stuff to buy with the money you gather, and a thin yet servicable plot. All these combined together allow this game to leave flash games territory and enter proper gaming territory. The game is not trash, and it is not a chore or feels like an utter waste of time to play. As far the money is concerned I would track down a bundle copy or buy 90% off however as this game is still severely lacking in many departments, it has unpolished edges, it does not  do anything new or interesting and does not have a ton of content.", "timestamp_updated": 1506052596, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492895269, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 43, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 35, "total_reviews": 78}}
