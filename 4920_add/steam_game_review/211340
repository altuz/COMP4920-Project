It\u2019s a Harry Potter-inspired tale of a female freshman student at a magic academy. As a \u201cwildseed\u201d, a mage born from non-magic family, she struggles to understand and adapt to an unfamiliar reality, with its pretty strict rules and unpredictable challenges. During her first year, she may succeed or fail as a mage, but also build various relationships with other students and professors at the school.[/b]\n\nThe game\u2019s cute, colourful artstyle might be misleading, as it tells a really well-crafted story with decent amounts of depth and multiple, interesting routes. In some parts it seriously surprised me with its sober tone and serious character development. It was mostly cheerful, but didn\u2019t avoid some dark themes and drama - and what\u2019s most important, none of those elements ever felt out of place. Some routes were more relaxed than others, but all had a decent mix of happy and sad moments, making you emotionally engaged and interested in what\u2019s going to happen next.\n\nThe game has a fairly strong romance element, but doesn\u2019t focus on it exclusively and most story paths can end with you making friends and building bonds rather than finding love. As it is with most games of this kind, sometimes criteria for a successful romance path are rather unclear and you\u2019ll need multiple tries to find an optimal approach to various situations. It creates quite a lot of replayability, while for the most part the endings you get without actively trying to screw yourself over are also satisfying and positive.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to explore alternative paths after the first playthrough, [b]the game offers around 10 hours of content. While it\u2019s not a masterpiece, the mechanics it offers (learning spells, using them to pass exams, balancing your skills and stats while studying) are satisfying and the story is surprisingly good, better than in many \u201cpure\u201d VNs I\u2019ve played. I think it should prove an enjoyable experience for most players, even those normally not interested in visual novels \u2013 you just shouldn\u2019t judge it on visuals alone. Just like with Long Like the Queen, there\u2019s a lot of depth and fresh ideas under that cute, brightly colored surface.[/b]", "timestamp_updated": 1506076321, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505947511, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 450, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 32, "total_reviews": 482}}
