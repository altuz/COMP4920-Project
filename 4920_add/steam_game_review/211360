Yup, I do think it's better than Super Meat Boy.\nWhy ? First, it's got nothing less, artistically-speaking. The universe, cutscenes and music are wonderful, and give the game a genuine, cutesy atmosphere which I find really enjoyable.\nBesides, the controls are irreproachable, and allow/reward pixel and frame-perfect action, for the most hardcore players.\nThe level design is awesome too. Even among the hidden levels, which are diabolically difficult, none is unreasonably long, like in most SMB-like games, which makes the die-and-retry experience a lot less painful and frustrating, while still as rewarding.\nFinally, you can really play the game two ways. If you don't care about beating the best times on each level, you should find the game quite easy and refreshing, and you can enjoy the various changes of atmosphere as you make your way through the 100 first levels. Hence this game is perfect for kids and people who enjoy themselves some relaxed, casual playtime. It succeeds where most games fail miserably.\nOr you can try to beat all the dev times to unlock everything. It's a total new experience, and oh boy, that guy's serious. But I can tell you it's definitely worth it in the end.\n\nPlus you get to throw cute animals in the face of a dinosaur.", "timestamp_updated": 1499347229, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499347229, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 80, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 90}}
