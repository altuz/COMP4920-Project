Movement is clunky, the character clips and \"teleports\", contextual interactions are inconsistent, the physics is wonky (pushing/striking zombies often moves them in the opposite direction), you can't run past zombies (usually) but swinging the axe will cause you to pass through them, input seems to lag at times, etc...\n\nPausing the game often causes it to hang for 5-10 seconds and sometimes freezes it completely, requiring a force-close and destroying any progress made since starting it.  Progress failed to save once when exited normally as well, setting me back a few checkpoints.\n\nI was looking forward to this game but between the control issues and bugs it was painful to finish.\n(used gamepad)", "timestamp_updated": 1506944578, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506944578, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2379, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 976, "total_reviews": 3355}}
