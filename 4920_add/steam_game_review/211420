Where's the Burg? When you get to Firelink Shrine, the Undead Burg is the only place you can go that goes up in elevation. Look up a map. \n\nUse the Wiki if you get lost. \n\nDark Souls is a game that grows on you. At a certain point in that growth, things will become clear as to why people get addicted to this game. \n\nAnd now the last bit of advice: Its perfectly fine to not like Dark Souls, Its not for everyone.
