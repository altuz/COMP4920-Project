So, what is wrong with it?\n\n[list]\n[*][h1]Level design[/h1]\nThe further you get into a game, the more challenging it should become, that's what we are all familiar with. Unfortunately, \"more challenging\" means \"with more stuff on screen with seemingly random movesets for the player to keep an eye on and avoid in even larger levels\" in this game.\nThis approach is just not fitting for a puzzle platformer. Simply using more enemies to obstruct the player's way is not good level design. As for the level size, did I mention that you die in one hit, and when you do, you have to redo the entire level? Thus a level becomes more frustrating the larger it gets.\nBut this would not be a big problem if not for the...\n[*][h1]Controls and Hit Detection[/h1]\nThe Controls are a little too floaty and unruly for this kind of game: You accelerate too fast, even in midair, and you never stop exactly when you let go of the directional button, which is crucial in a game where the hit-box detection is so unforgiving.\nCountless times have I fallen to my virtual doom because Shuggy would not jump off a ledge properly or hit his... eye (or something, since I am certain it could not have been the top of his head) on one while trying to jump onto it.\n[*][h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI dunno.\nI wouldn't recommend this game purely because I find that there are games that do everything, the puzzles, the platforming and the presentation, way better and are more deserving of your time. If you feel otherwise or really want to try this game out, then that's fine. Like I said, it's not a horrible game. Just seems frustrating, unfulfilling and kind of boring to me.\n[/list]", "timestamp_updated": 1498923281, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498922704, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 106, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 18, "total_reviews": 124}}
