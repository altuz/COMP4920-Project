Before I talk about the positives of the game, I would like to address some of the negative aspects of the game (remember this is my opinion and yours may differ). \n\nCONS:\n1. The F2P model. The F2P model is more that the game has free base content but you will have to buy the rest of the content unless you are a fast enough racer to consistently win Competitions (more on this later). I have yet to earn vRP (the currency used to purchase content) because I am not fast enough to win Competitions and you earn 0 by actually playing the game whether it is offline or online.\n\n2. The \"simulation\". The realism in this game definitely is there (more on this later) but some bugs/design choices make me feel like it isn't a complete sim. Wearing down the tires takes too long even through prolonged abuse and the damage model being too forgiving, are two of the most notable issues I have with the simulation aspect of this game. \n\n3. Online. This game allows people from all over the world to participate in online race events and that is great but it does create laggy races. I personally have joined race servers where even though my ping is 90ms, it feels like my ping is signifacntly higher than that because the cars with lower ping don't look as smooth on the track. Nothing is wrong with those cars but my ping makes other cars look weird which sometimes leads to phantom contact (two carboxes collide even though the car models do not touch).\n\nPROS:\n1. The \"simulation\". The cars handle realistic pattern and some of that I attribute to the real world racers that give feedback to the developers who then turn that feedback to make the cars handle that much better. \n\n2. The sound. The audio in this game is the best out of any racing game that I have ever played. The engine audio sounds great with a great capture of low, mid, and high sounds. Tire sounds give you fantastic audio feedback. My favorite sound is when your car drives into the gravel and you can hear what sounds like small pieces of gravel hitting different parts of the car. It makes the Forza series, which has always been applauded for its audio, look a bit behind. \n\n3. The Competitions. I used to dislike leaderboard hot-lapping but that all changed with this game. Competitions is a game mode where the developers have preset challenges of who can run the fastest time with a certain car and track combo. Some of these \"competitions\" use new cars and tracks (a way to drive new cars and tracks without owning the content) and challenges the community to see who can adapt and be the quickest. Some of the other \"competitions\" are sponsored by actual companies and over a several week competition that also goes to different tracks every week, the winner gets a prize. For example, there is currently a WTCC competition, where the top 30 or so drivers at the end of the competition compete in a final race. The prizes include cash and tickets to WTCC race(s). \n\n4. The AI. After an update to the AI (a couple of months back from the time of this review), the offline experience got a signifcant increase. The AI are aggressive, use slightly different lines, and have a much larger difficulty adjustment for players of most skill levels being able to enjoy a nice race against computers. It reminds me of rFactor 2 AI which is another racing game with fantastic AI (probably the best but that is for another review).\n\nI would definitely recommened this game because the pros outweigh the cons, in my opinion.", "timestamp_updated": 1502124142, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502124142, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 260, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 62, "total_reviews": 322}}
