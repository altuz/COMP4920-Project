I may be in the minority in saying that I prefer both the original and Deadly Shadows more,\nbut goddamn if this isn't a worthy successor in every way, continuing the series and building upon the world that you helped shape by the end of the last game.\n\n[b]The Great:[/b]\n++The sound design in this game is phenomenal. The propogation engine, the voice acting, how it effects gameplay, everything is just at the highest standard possible which is to say totally unmatched.\n++The atmospheric music by Eric Brosius is also just nothing short of incredible\n++The level design is about as good as gaming has ever gotten in the first person genre\n++The cutscenes in this game are, again, and I'll be repeating this a few times, totally unmatched within video games as a whole\n++The atmosphere is extraordinary, even if it isn't as strong as Dark Project or Deadly Shadows\n++Levels can take an hour or more to complete and are totally rewarding the whole way through\n++The intricacy of the levels makes this game replayable as all hell\n++The sneaking is just plain fun\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+Graphics are a noticable improvement over the Dark Project more so in consistency and art style then technical acheivement.\n+Using Tafferpatcher, I couldn't ask for smoother performance on modern systems\n+Levels are huge, but not for the sake of being huge\n+The addition of officially marked secrets is awesome\n+A lot of the new equipment is really cool\n+I've always liked the animations in these games, but some people seem to think they've aged really badly\n\n[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]\n+-Some minor glitches are prevalent near the end of the game specifically\n-+The Life of the Party is just disappointing, but I guess it's not its fault it got hyped so much. Plus, it's not bad by any stretch of the imagination.\n+-What the hell are the point in vine arrows? I used them like once for metal surfaces the whole game.\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n-One level is turned into two which is utterly lazy and unenjoyable considering how the level wasn't even that good the first time\n-Movement seems to glitch on surfaces more than the first game which is quite frustrating\n\n[b]The Horrible:[/b]\n--N/A\n\nSound: 10/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nContent/Replayability: 10/10\nOverall: 9.5/10\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nThe Thief games, at least for me, are always better once you know how to do the main objectives and can work your way around the levels well enough. With the levels being the most intricate in the series it is a bit convulated and my love\nfor this game was a bit delayed in comparison to the other two games in the series. On my first playthrough though, I found it hard to decide whether I liked Gold or 2 more. Honestly, this game and this series mean a lot to me. Everyone\nshould give this series a shot, starting right from the beginning and working through in order. My experience when doing that was utterly unmatched.", "timestamp_updated": 1504959164, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504959164, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35258708", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506915559, "steamid": "76561198095177418", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 54}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Simply the best, exemplary work", "timestamp_updated": 1506593451, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506593451, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35237577", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1386452466, "steamid": "76561198076311823", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "True classic.

From its incredible level design, intricate and fun to play in, to its gripping atmosphere, gritty and urban in just the right measures, its subtle storytelling and great memorable villain, it's hard to think of a single thing this game did not get right. It is now nearly 18 years old, a lifetime in gaming, and it is still the unrivaled king of Stealth.\n\nIf you want my advice, wait for this game and the original (Thief: The Dark Project) to go on sale, and buy them both. You want to have played the first before this one. Also look at the fan patches for both games, which make them incredibly better to play in from a technical point of view.\n\nIf you like Stealth games where you have to think and take it slow, solve the guard patterns like so many intricate puzzle, and where doing your absolute best to never be spotted is not only necessary for survival but fun in a tense and scary way, look no further than [b]Thief II: The Metal Age[/b].", "timestamp_updated": 1505159466, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505159466, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35176330", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506181077, "steamid": "76561198057221241", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 280, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Nice game", "timestamp_updated": 1506247231, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506247231, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34897967", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491943", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504948182, "steamid": "76561198085809275", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "[b]Potato[/b] out of [b]potato[/b].
