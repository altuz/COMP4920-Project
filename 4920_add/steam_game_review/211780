I played this so much when I was still a console gamer. I played countless hours of this game with my brothers. I remember how intense it got when we got in a firefight. Throughout the missions you add a few more guys to your squad. Sending commands were very easy and made sense. You can play this on your PC but the controls are just awful. I love this game, but the controls are just so awful it ruins it. If I was writing this review for PS2 I would recommend this, but for PC I can't recommend this. If you don't mind some weird controls than get this game. I do not recommend this game on PC though.\n\n[/b] This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: [/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nThis review is just my opinion.
