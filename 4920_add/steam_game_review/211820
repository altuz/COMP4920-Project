Unlike other survival games, Starbound takes exploration to a whole new level. Every planet is unique and urges you to explore it; there are hidden pieces of lore, random dungeons you can delve in, hints of civilization and villages. The best part is that all aspects are so beautifully tied together that it does not get boring; and even if a planet does not satisfy you, you can always jump to another.\n\n2) There is indeed a main quest which you can complete at your leisure. You have all the time in the world to prepare yourself and delve deeper in the storyline but that's not only it. There are also \"radiant quests\" (as described in other games), where a simple NPC will give you a quest and mayhaps they'd like to join your crew after a while.\n\n3) Starbound's economy is pretty much fluid. If you are one of the \"trader\" types, you will enjoy this a lot. Considering the fact that you can establish countless bases and trade routes (especially since the Spacefarer Update) after a while you will feel that investing and trading are not monotonous. \n\n4) You can create a village of your own through the tenant system and earn pixels from it. After a while you will be able to do quests for your own little settlement. All in all, if you feel like managing a group of NPCs is your thing, you have the freedom to go for it. Managing your crew is fun sometimes. \n\n5) Replayability is one of the \"I win cards\" Starbound has. You can do whatever you want whenever you want as long as you are well prepared. Plus, you can always find that detail that will suit your playstyle in the workshop. \n\n  Last but not least, the devs are very active and they have brilliant ideas which they add to the game and most of the time you can get a sneak peak of (can't wait for 1.4). In my opinion, this is pure value for money and I don't believe anyone would regret buying this game.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1505114206, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505114206, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34822363", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505475928, "steamid": "76561198088675970", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "is good i can be jojo and kick alien ass", "timestamp_updated": 1504902036, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504902036, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34825149", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505708163, "steamid": "76561198086092675", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 12711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The best indie game i've seen.
