This is way more approachable but remains as unengaging as the grand strategy cousin.\n\nIt comes across as a indie engine reskin of civ1 for windows 3.1 with flat miniature sprites without the empire management component. There are tooltips and the engine seems robust but the interactivity is poor and the flow of the action feels clunky. The game went completely silent on me after the only one track of music failed to loop back. The tilework recycling is way too obvious and is way too blurred out and low quality.
