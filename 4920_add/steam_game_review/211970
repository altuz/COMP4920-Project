With multiple eras of Ferraris, from classic to modern, and a full campaign for each, as you attempt to accomplish various objectives, such as showing off certain vehicles, win certain races, and so on. \n\nYou will be at first, be distracted by eye candy aplenty, then you realize the game has excellent driving models that portrays convincing weight transfer, throttle while turn, drifting, and so on, but also has full driver aids like auto brake, optimum line, and so on. The catch, of course, is you are basically doing the equivalent of GT races and test drives where you need to negotiate chicanes, hard braking turns without spinning the car, hairpins, and so on, often with competition. \n\nBeware that even \"easy\" is not easy on a track when any sort of cutting across a corner may earn you a warning, and repeated offense will earn you a DNF / DQ (did not finished, disqualified). \n\nEach era as mentioned before, has a lot of vehicles to try. Think the old EA \"Porsche Unleashed\" and you're not far off, except there is no point to point races, only circuits, and evolution is combined with factory driver, but cut up into multiple eras, each with separate progress. \n\nThe main problem is the AI is not very tunable, and with races of only a few laps, any mishap will mean you fail to achieve your goal. Furthermore, some of the missions are next to impossible given the required car. For example, one of the missions I got stuck on was \"dodge the simulated debris on track, while still achieve required laptime\". There are like six different \"debris\" sets and they are in the driving line, so you can no longer take optimal line to retain speed, and your car is not exactly a speed demon (but an 1950's UNsporty Ferrari) and I'm always 2 seconds short and I can't find any way to make up the time any more. And that's on EASY. There's also medium and hard with even tighter time requirements. \n\nOn the races, I can usually beat out the competition. It's these timed races that got me. \n\nThe game is basically GT racing, so braking and precision maneuvering through tight corners and chicanes is expected, and that, I'm not very good at. You may do better. \n\nWith dozens of Ferrari vehicles to unlock in career mode, and a dozen tracks to experience, this driving sim really needs a wheel for full enjoyment, and some patience. Don't expect to jump in and master the cars just like that.

There's no getting away with that. Classic cars feel quite good but the experience deteriorates in the faster cars. Make even the slightest contact with other cars and you'll have to brace for a somersault.\n- No option to individually tune driver aids. Auto-clutch and ABS can't be turned off at all.\n- DUMB AIs. They're very slow and are prone to amateur mistakes. Expect to overtake all of them before even getting into turn 1 and build a 15 second gap by lap 2. I managed to fall to last place twice in a 3 lap race and STILL managed to win at the hardest difficulty setting.\n- Lackluster damage in all the cars excluding the F1 cars. Slight scratches, dents, and misalligned steering rack is just about all the damage you get.\n- Time trial in hard difficulty setting requires you to set ridiculously fast lap times, but there's NO incentive in playing the missions at higher difficulty or completing bonus objectives. So why even bother?\n- Missions are mandatory to unlock the wide roster of tracks and cars. Yet only about 20% of them provide unlocks upon completion. Other 80% have no rewards whatsoever, giving a feel that developers crammed in missions just in order to keep the players continue playing.\n- Repetitive. All missions are either 'set a lap time', 'overtake your opponents before the race ends', or 'get a podium finish'.\n- You'll most likely give up on pursuing on unlocking the cars and tracks because of its tediousness. It's strongly recommended that you use a mod that unlocks all the cars and tracks.\n\nIn conclusion, it's Need for Speed: Shift, but with slightly worse overall gameplay and Ferraris.

I LOVE old Racing Cars reproduced and the game is setup for an easy intro to winning. NOT setup to make you lose with SNOB levels of difficulty. Do not use FXAA AA ..but MLAA at top level or could make weird blocky trees. Set your Graphics cards to let the game set stuff or it could crash on exit. Had a few bugs. but now works great.
