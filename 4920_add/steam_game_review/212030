If you see a review with 0.5 hours or something? Disregard it really, it's not gonna tell you anything about the later game which posesses the issues to make it a not recommended. \n\n\nControls:\n\nX is ground attack.\nA is air attack.\nX+A is a chi attack.\n\nThese work well, although X and A don't allow you to do any special combos, the chi attacks make up for it allowing you to buy multiple chi attacks that are activated through stuff like X+A, X then X+A, X+A mid air twice then X on the ground, ect. It's also nice to just mash A and X to go to town on the enemy without thinking too hard about combos.\n\n\nRT is dodge\nB and LT is deflect\n\nOne of these is the biggest issue with the game but i'll focus on it later. Dodging is as it sounds, you roll away quickly in the direction you chose then you move about twice as fast for a second afterwards. After this you go back to normal speed. Now to deflect which is a mechanic that allows you to be invincible for a second, and in that second any enemy that attacks you has their attack negatated and is knocked down. There are a few exceptions for how deflect works as some enemies still continue hitting you after you deflect your first attack (with no warning), and some don't even care and will hit through your deflect if they have an ! appear before they attack.\n\nNow to the issues with this otherwise great beat'em up game. This is a review that needs a neutral option as if you look past it's issues, there is a lot of really fun parts to this game that I wish more people could enjoy.\n\n\nIssues:\nLets start with one mechanic in this game where you hold X against an enemy when prompted too, and then press A to finish it off. This is some sort of guard break on the enemy but the issue i have with it is how long the A prompt is up and how much the X prompt can vary in length. Sometimes the X prompt is almost instant and sometimes it takes a while. If it was a set length, this would work regardless of its very quick-time event feel to it. This is also shoved in your face while you're attacking an enemy too and all you can do is sigh and do this boring mechanic yet again.\n\nIf you attack an enemy, other enemies will then attack you during your attack which you cannot cancel, at least to my knowledge. Usually you can get one or two hits off then run but that doesnt' work. So you have to get a few hits off and deflect the enemies, but you can't always do that until later on because of another issue right after this one. Overall this mechanic isn't bad just doesn't work with other issues in this game.\n\nYou have to buy the ability to deflect in mid-air and dodge in mid-air which is really fucking stupid. This is absolutely nessecary to the game later on and even in earlier levels. So if you do any air attacks, you're wide open until you get either one of these. This issue applies to guard breaks as to finish one off, you press A... an air attack.\n\nYour brief speed-boost after dodging will end without just going to your way too slow normal walking speed, it will automatically make you do a FULL STOP wherever you are for half a second. Why is this a thing? Why don't i just go into normal ground speed, why do i have to go from roll to running to fucking stopped without me pressing a button. It's terrible, the only way to avoid this is to keep on rolling and attack an enemy before the stop happens which is annoying and is harder to focus on than you think due to the other issues all hitting you at once.\n\nAnd now the mother of all issues with this game, deflecting. This son of a bitch doesn't work. It's not that you can't deflect, no you can easily deflect. It's that if 2 enemies attack you, which is very frequent. More often than not, they will attack you so you can only deflect ONE of them while the other will hit you no matter what. This is terrible. The ganking of the enemies ruins this feature so much as if one enemy hits you, usually 2 or 3 more will start to attack. You attack one enemy and then the enemies approach you, deflect to counter them and woopse either 1, the enemy you were hitting suddenly breaks the stun lock you put him in for no fucking reason and hits you almost instantly, stun locking you. 2, the enemy attacks in different intervals so you can't deflect them all. Or 3, you get lucky and only 1 or 2 enemies attack you in a way where you can deflect it. Maybe if you're extremely lucky you can just attack the enemy and the RNG doesn't decide to randomly screw you over.\n\n\nSo many issues with this otherwise great game don't just make the side things annoying but effect the main game. I just can't recommend it. It's a blast at first, but it gets boring. Money is too hard to come by to buy new skills and items, the inconsistenties in this game are too extreme at moments, the deflect system that is pressured on you doesn't work enough with the rest of the game, and overall a giant amount of design flaws. You can tell they understand how to make something more fluid in areas like how nice the rolling is. The rolling part feels so nice, you can change direction easily with no worries. The X and A spamming also works very well. I don't know what it is about it but all the combos go how i'd think they'd go. Which makes it easier to use them. The fluidity and challenge that this game possesses isn't fully taken away. What deals the final blow between recommended and not recommended is the pricing, 10 dollars does not match this game's quality and how much content it has fully. Yes it has a lot of effort put into it and I feel bad almost for not recommending this game, but it's true. I'm usually overaly critical on games but on this one, i really think these are really bad design choices. So if it's on sale? Get it. If not, save it as this game's not a short gem.
