Usually the only chore with this genre is that sometimes there is no rhyme or reason to the puzzles, and one ends up clicking and combining everything possible in order to proceed.\n\nThis game has a similar problem with a twist. Most of the time it is clear WHAT should be done, and the actions make sense as such, but the user interface is so horrid it regularly is nigh impossible to figure out HOW to do it. In general, the game's UI makes doing anything at all as hard as possible, and not in an entertaining manner.\n\nJust an example: there is a thing you need to read to gain crucial information, and it is made clear you can't take the thing with you. In most games, simply reading the thing would unlock dialogue options related to it. Not here; you have to figure out that you CAN drag-and-drop the thing into a special inventory (\"short term memory\"), where it becomes a conversation item, that can then be used in dialogues elsewhere. Anything can be dragged into this inventory, but only a few items can be stored there at one time; as it is often not clear which STM items are important and where they should be used, this quickly becomes very annoying. (To muddy the waters even further, there's also a third separate inventory, for \"long term memories\". They also need to be used like items.)\n\nThere are not enough saving graces either. Having several playable characters is an intriguing idea and one plot twist and a couple of puzzles utilize it nicely, but it also multiplies the irksomeness of the overly convoluted inventory system. (And that's a major issue, because most of the gameplay in this genre consists of inventory management.) The story is OK, but not very original. Graphics are very retro and get the job done, but are nothing to write home about. The characters are clich\u00e9d and lack depth. Dialogues are vapid. Atypically for a Wadjet Eye Games product, even voice acting and music are stale. And the vexing trial-and-error games in the end ensure the whole thing ends on a sour note.\n\nI crawled my way through, but playing this game felt like working a never-ending shift in an office where someone regularly hides your mouse and keyboard.", "timestamp_updated": 1500229357, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500225241, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34223781", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496740", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502661264, "steamid": "76561198065952271", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Excellent adventure game. I don't recall having played one with a similar mechanic: you have Long Term Memory and Short Term Memory besides Inventory. LTMs are only gained through story, but STMs you can \"get\" from the scenes, recording them for bringing them up in speech. It's very interesting and functional.\nThe story is great, with twists I couldn't foresee and multiple endings, The puzzles makes sense, and the \"talk with other characters to get a hint\" really helps. It needs to be said because I have played a lot of games that in-game hints don't help at all.\nAnother great adventure from Wadjet Eye.
