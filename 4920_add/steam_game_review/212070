All currently available DLC's cost you 223,94 \u20ac. You get 4 or 5 AAA Titles for that.\n- There is a short Tutorial but the game is very complex and most things are unexplained. The Wiki is mostly in russian language.\n- Grind. All you do is to level up different ships to get a better one with slightly improved stats. rinse and repeat.\n- You can loot occassionaly usefull things for a certain module but since there are so many modules you can rarely update the stuff you need right now.\n- Balancing. The balancing is NOT for a fun game experience but solely for generating money for the developers. You will see MANY artifical walls which restrict you from progress when you don't want to pay the \"incredible\" prices for things that should be in there right away. this appears like extortion to me. And this will never end no matter how much you have paid already.\n- Long waiting times (1-5 minutes, European Server) when you want to do a battle. Be sure to have something to read for that time.\n- Depending on time of day few players so the battles are filled up with \"stupid\" bots.\n\nI have not done much PvE and been not in a Corp so I cannot rate these aspects. But corps mainly require Voice Coms (Teamspeak) so this only works if you live alone.\n\nOther reviews have mentioned unfair bans. I have none experienced myself but I will certainly NOT pay (waste) hundreds of Euros when the game can restrict me from playing it that easily.\n\nSo the game can be fun if you like Grind and are willing to pay many money. Everyone else should be aware that this is a simple cash mashine for the developers where you provide them the content (opponents) and shall even pay for it. The more I think about it the more I dislike this business model.\n\n\n\n\n\nas reply to TigusVidikis's comment:\n>Pay to Win??? why?\nBecause you can speed up your progress significantly with real money. Faster progress means faster success and an advantage over players who don't do it.\n\n> Premium ships are just different ships. Better in some stats, worse in others.\nBut they start fully leveled. Non-premium ships are therefore worse from their stats until they are leveled up also. but there is little point in flying a leveled ship any more since you mostly want to level up the next one. so for most of the time the premium ship IS better.\n\n>The only real thing to give you an edge is and indirect bonus, if you go premium you get more XP and more loot.\nmore xp and more loot (items, upgrades) means better stats than one who doesn't pay. better stats means better chances. better chances means winning more often. winning more often means even faster progress. so from my conclusion this IS pay to win.\n\nfrom what i have seen you can achieve most things by stupid grind. but it will take you a long while and will certainly not be fun for the most time. the game is purely balanced to annoy you so much until you pay. and the developers are greedy.\nfor 1 \u20ac (euro) i get 300 galactic standards (gs).\none month of premium licence (+50% xp, extra loot) cost you 3000 gs = 10 \u20ac\na second set of implants cost you 2000 gs = 6,7 \u20ac\na rank 11 ship costs you 6.2 million ingame credits this are around 12000 gs and thus 40 \u20ac.\nto change ONE visual aspect of ONE ship costs you 150 gs = 0,5 \u20ac.\neven beeing the mentor of a new character afaik costs you 200 gs = 0,7 \u20ac.\nso if you want to play it seriously and have fun doing it you have little chance without paying. thats what everyone starting this game must be aware of. if you have plenty of real money to spend play it. but don't let you fool by the \"free to play\" tag because this is a lie.\n\nI see that the developers must eat and want to be payed for their work. but the payment scheme applied in this game is obviously greedy and reminds me of extortion. and this is not only my opinion i have heard several other people mentioning this as the most annoying aspect of the game.\n\n\n\n\nupdate #2\nI have now spend lots of time in the game (and also few euros) and want to explain my long term experiences.\nCorp/buddies is important to have for flying together and get some tips.\nPVE is quite boring and repetitive.\nIDIOTS. I can't describe how frustrating this game is because of the idiots in it. there are many bad players who don't contribute to winning, refuse to help their teammates etc.. Its very frustrating when you constanly loose a match because of such people. And there are the players which have spent many time in game already (you are too late!) and have top (premium) ships, best equipment and experience. If you have those in enemy team you have mostly lost already before the fight even starts. So if you are a \"medium\" or average player like me you will recive constant frustration.\nThe matchmaking system seriously SUCKS. If you want to team up with someone you have significantly increased waiting times (you spent half of the time in this game waiting for a match anyway). So if you want to play together (its multiplayer, right?) you will actually have less fun.\nAnd the teams are often very unbalanced with one side having a clear advantage over the other. The balanced and fair (=the fun) fights are 1/3 approximately.\n\nSo with the greedy developers, the idtiot community and the crappy matchmaking system I CANNOT recommend this game to anyone. I'm sure there are better gaming experiences out there. Once my licence epxires i will leave the game for these reasons. Gaming should be fair fun and not unfair frustration.", "timestamp_updated": 1425113591, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "34", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415347152, "votes_down": 67}, {"recommendationid": "29928043", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 87, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596458", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505527815, "steamid": "76561197994001988", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 90494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "You would think with almost 1500 hours and at least a third of that being money invested I'd rabidly defend this game, but I am not happy with the development direction. I'll probably still play for as long as I can considering what I've invested already, but . . . This game has long deviated from what made me fall in love with it. Remnants are there but I can't help but comparing. What I really take issue with is how I see customers getting treated. Not me specifically, I am the way I am and I've just learned to accept any incoming consequences as a fact of life, to brush them off, and just keep going, but other people who go into things with a certain set of assumptions about their investment both time and money wise . . \n\nThe latest example would have to be the transition from destroyers to alien ships. I am not a person who likes the idea of destroyers in the game as it has been put into practice. On paper great, but initially they were very strong. Yes they had events to get these ships easily, but now they are difficult to get and have a sort of air of exclusivity.\n\n On this basis you would think that at the very least, customers are rewarded with a strong ship for investing real money.  But now they've been nerfed into the ground. They needed it to be honest, but it coincidentally happened the same time they moved to the new faction with the alien ships.  The starter kit for which costs 40$ USD if you want to \"convenience\" your way to them and they are quite powerful. Maybe not so much in the hands of a new player but they can easily vs a whole team. \n\nRight now there is a broker mission and some grinding you can to do to get there for free, but I imagine by the time the general community finally gets to them they could be nerfed as the new ship is released, with a new 40$ starter kit.  I've seen this sort of game balance strategy before and it ruined the community of a game I cared very much about. MWO is now dead because of this sort of economic model. Maybe I'm wrong. That would be nice. I get very passionate about things I care about and trust me I would love to be wrong on this.\n\nSo no, at this time I don't want to recommend this game because of my own opinion, but I will say:\n\nIt's free, so it's not like you have to spend money to try it out. If you really like space games A negative review isn't going to stop you and If you feel you're having enough fun to spend money on it, that's great, there are a few DLC that have quite a bit of utility value especially when on sale. If I see you asking in game I'll probably even tell you which ones to get.

I even plopped down over $100 for myself and my family for premium accounts, since progress without premium is incredibly, mind-numbingly slow, and the game is really fun and flows smoothly at first.  Plus, I like War Thunder (though I've hit a steep increase in the grind curve and haven't played it for quite a while), and so decided to give it a chance because Gaijin did at least some things very well.\n\nWell hoo hoo.  What a fool am I.  Everything they said is true.  And I feel like an idiot for giving the devs my money.\n\nA quick aside.  I used to play Warframe for quite a while.  I eventually left it in disgust for what became more and more clear -- the devs' focus on the exploitative aspects of the game, rather than improving the experience for the players and developing the depth of the game, and disrespect of the playerbase -- particularly their time.  And, most of all, its terrible grind that makes the game end up feeling like a job -- it progresses nicely and evenly at first, but then, even with a premium account, it takes forever.  And then there are time-limited goodies to get, but the gambling/loot system is rigged to screw you over so much that you have to put in an inordinate amount of time to get the time-limited goal/goodie fair and square by legitimate gameplay...  so why don't you just pay for it already and skip the grind, hmm?\n\nI got sick and tired of it.  Quit after a long enough time that I'm embarrassed to say it.  But I'm a lot quicker to spot this kind of game this time around -- after a couple of weeks, I'm already done with Star Conflict.  Had enough of grinding fights against players who you can't damage but who demolish you in seconds every time you pop your head up (because the matchmaking system pits you against players with ships far more powerful than yours).\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was and then spending real money on gambling chests that promise all sorts of interesting things, though 5 of the items they can provide -- hardly noticeable in that impressive list of cool things -- are just small amounts of mundane resources that you get at the end of every mission and are sick of by the time you've played a week.  But that's 5 out of 40 items, surely I'd get at least one or two good things.\n\nNope.  Bought a pack of 5 of these chests and got nothing but the mundane resources and a few crystals.  Really?  I guess they want you to buy chests, get nothing interesting, then keep buying more.  It's a mechanism used in a lot of exploitative games.\n\nThe game has a lot of promise, and is fun, until you hit about rank 6 or 7, and then suddenly the grind increases a LOT to progress just a little, and you find it necessary to play PvP, where skill matters little and your equipment is massively underleveled.  You watch your hits ever so slightly decrement their shields, then suddenly you get rapid-fire 5-shotted in a matter of 1-2 seconds.  Not so fun anymore -- your job is now to be farmed, while you grind away, hoping some day to progress to the point where you are competitive, or at least can hold your own.  Or...  why don't you just buy the premium ships and pay for a ship that can win already?\n\nJust pay to win and stop complaining.\n\nScrew that.  No thanks.\n\nNot recommended, at all.

Devs have no foresight, and don't care about their community. Game is being used only to generate money (only way I can explain the decisions they've made).\n\nWhen I first started playing Star Conflict four years ago, I was absolutely hooked. It provided awesome full 3D space combat with gorgeous visuals and lovely sound design (including music). Unfortunately, I got to know the game. Over the last four years, not much has changed in terms of outward appearance, but the mechanics have taken a drastic turn for the worst.\n\nIt was always a grind (and a bad one at that), but it has gotten worse. Not only have they rearranged the tech tree into a jumbled mess, but they have added new ship types that just boggle the mind when it comes to obtaining them. The Destroyers, for example, require components to build which, in turn, require resources that [i]could[/i] drop from post-mission looting or [i]might[/i] drop from open space resource nodes. You can spend real money to purchase resource crates, but even they have an RNG component which randomizes what you get from them.\n\nThey are doing the same thing for premium ships. What you were once able to purchase using real money for a respectable price, they are now changing their acquisition method to resources unique to each premium ship, which are just as rare (if not rarer because there are so many items now diluting the drop pool) than other ship components from random drops. If you want to buy the resources outright, it is once again a random drop from a crate. Doing the maths; premium ships cost WAY more than before.\n\nShip module upgrades are a must-have if you want to remain competitive in PvP. But, not only has item upgrading been made even more tedious than it was before, you are able to instantly upgrade an item using premium currency. If that isn't pay-to-win, I don't know what is.\n\nThis game was made by the same company as the one that made War Thunder. Despite Star Conflict being developed by a different studio, the problems with the developers persist. They are toxic about feedback. If you slander their game publicly, they will retaliate with bans or something else, and they don't listen to community feedback (where economics are concerned at least). They also seem to have no grasp of game economy mechanics. Having an RNG loot table is all well and good, but putting critical progression items into that table, diluting it with useless garbage like small credits caches, and then continuing to pile [i]even more[/i] progression critical items means that it just becomes impossible to get anything with any reasonable reliability. They don't seem to have any intention to fix that, and why would they? It would mean people won't buy crates.\n\nThis has turned into a bit of a rant, so I'll end it here.

Since then they are stalling the community and telling us occasionally they will bring VR someday. That\u2019s it! \n\nI have waited almost for a year now, to get back something which was perfectly functional and fun with DK2. Looking every Update message if the VR support is back!! No more! Waiting time is over! Congratulations Developers \u2013 you won and I\u2019m officially p.i.s.s.e.d! No more waiting for me. Today I will uninstall and get over with it!\n\nA very nice game, but I will give you a thumbs down, just in hope others like me, who are waiting for VR support to come back, give this review a push!\n\nFarewell beloved game!", "timestamp_updated": 1487999068, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487998677, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "29917638", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501974", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1362729600, "steamid": "76561197970554934", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "P2W no thank you.

When it came out 4 years ago, I can't stop playing it. It has top of the line graphics at that time, tbe best open world exploration, it's just overwhelmingly fun\n  Now, the game has been ruined by its greedy developers. Everytime when there's a holiday, the devs view it as a cash grab time instead of a time to give players free stuff and to make them level up faster. Every weekend, same, cash grab time. Recently, things got worst when Thar'Ga came out. My team's destroyers just got completely shredded by a swarm of enemy Thar'Ga. The game is extremely unbalenced unlike back in the good old days. The mods are unprofessional, and disrespectful (I got a violation warning for no reason). In fact, I was so close to uninstalling that day. The only way to win this game is to grind 24/7 or pay.

Destroyers, good idea but very imbalanced game. Still, gameplay against destroyers isn't too impossible to win.

I thought I was finally going to get something nice as I had lots of resources from playing this game so long, only to see that I was wrong. Oh boy how wrong I was able to be..

This game is about as pay to win as you can get. TECHNICALLY you can get everything in the game with sufficient grind. But sufficient grind for the latest and greatest items is measured in months or even a year, by which time it's been nerfed, and the cycle has started again. And the latest items ARE the greatest. If you've got a gaming wallet with thousands (Not an exaggeration, by the way), then this game might be for you.\nAwful developers. Extremely sensitive to feedback, any post on the official forums that is slightly critical gets deleted rapidly by moderators. If you don't have a direct line (pay to feedback maybe?) to the developers, you aren't getting heard unless it's sunshine and roses.\nAwful server availability. This depends a little on where you are, but over half of the games will be played on Russian servers, and ping matters for true competitiveness. If you live in Europe then this isn't as much of a consideration.\n\n\nThe community is about average for a free, competitive game, at least the English-speaking part is.
