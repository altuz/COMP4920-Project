Other controls are simple: arrows keys to move, spacebar to jump, and shift key to turn tile flipping on/off. You can slightly influence your direction mid-jump to lean out more left or right, then lean as you fall back in your original spot. You cannot defeat enemies by jumping on them (\"You're not Mario!\"); you can only avoid them or manipulate the environment around them. \n\nI haven't finished the game, but the puzzles I've encountered in the first and second factory were easy to medium difficulty.

I usually give a game a little longer before a review but I had some core issues with the game that I didn't see changing anytime soon.\n\nSugar Cube feels like a game that seemed like a good idea on paper but in practice just isn't fun. The central mechanic revolves around 'flipping' segments of the room to change the layout.  In theory this might sound interesting but my experience is that this quickly devolves into a tedious guessing game as there is often no visual cues where tiles need to be flipped so many puzzles you start out jumping around simply to locate where the necessary components are. \n\nAfter the pieces are located the puzzles were not partciularly challenging or satisfying and if there was a challenge it was often because a pixel-perfect jump was required at some point. In my short 30 minutes of gameplay I played through the first world and half of the second and the challenge rating did not really increase. At the end of the first world a \"boss\" was featured but really he was simply a giant obstacle to avoid and was not any more challenging than any other level. \n\nThe game's artwork has very limited animations and animated characters in the game feature only a couple of frames and as a result the game feels largely still and lifeless. \n\nThis game does support USB controllers but all the ingame instructions refer to keyboard controls so you are left to guess which controller button does what or go to the options menu.\n\nScore: 2/10\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1386819310, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1386819310, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "9491731", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499398", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1437672845, "steamid": "76561198072153080", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Such an addicting game.
