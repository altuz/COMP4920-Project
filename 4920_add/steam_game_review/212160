That we are troublemakers that shouldn't be taken seriously or associated with (this was stated directly by a forum moderator given power by Nexon to manage the community).\n\nThe EU playerbase is unfortunately going to have to deal with Nexon NA management soon, and even before the transition has fully occurred, I am told by many EU players that a significant portion of the EU playerbase has quit the game over changes NA has already forced upon EU, with no regard to the situation EU has to deal with (economic differences, primarily).\n\nIf you want to find a new game to play, this is not it.

The rush you feel when you finally defeat a boss in this game is unmatched. I toiled through the early levels, farmed for gear, and prayed to RNGesus to enhance said gear. \n\nBut once I hit the end-game was when Nexon really ramped up the bullshit. Gatcha upon gatcha events. Failing servers (namely Arisha release). Pompous volunteer mods banning well known community members for absurd reasons (You can go to hell Aquasol and Dealer).\n\nNow they've taken down all of the fan sites that have been maintained by players who received not a word of thanks or appreciation from Nexon for promoting their game and aiding the playerbase. I hate Nexon NA for ruining a game I loved and spent so much time on. I hate them and their bullshit policies and Terms of Service. With Sanitee banned and Vindictus Manual gone, I've decided that I'm tired of their bullshit. Thank you to the West players for giving me some of the most exciting moments in gaming that I've ever had, especially in a rough patch where I contemplated suicide.

Idea's, lots and lots of ideas. The original (Yes there have been several over the years) development team of the game had a vision of an MMO and was one of the first RPG MMO's to break with \"tab targeting\" and tradition class roles in an MMO. By all accounts they did a damn good job on that front as well. Fast paced combat with some of the most stunning visuals in an \"MMO\" at the time all while having \"most\" characters viable in group/solo play (Was balanced out later on so that all characters were viable)\n\nAt this point you may be asking yourself why the negative review then? Greed. Nexon is know the world over in smaller gaming circles as one of the greediest Publishers in existance. Think of the Korean version of EA and that basically sums up the taste it leaves in most peoples mouths who've played one of their titles. Every single aspecr of the game is tied to RNG (A chance to obtain X-Y-Z) and when you want to improve a shiny new weapon/armor piece you spent well over a month to try a aquire via enhancements/enchantments you have rather HIGH odds for that shiny piece of gear to be destroyed if either fails. To protect against such a happening they have \"Microtransactions\" that can protect your items up to a certain extent.\n\nMicro being ANYTHING but as you can easily spend $300 on a single item trying to get the to the \"Halfway point\" Meaning +10 with 2 enhcantments. Alas you think you're done? Nope, still having 5 enchantment levels to go each attempt WILL destroy your gear if it fails. In 5 years of playing I had managed to make a +14 and 2 +13's. Thats it. Some 5,000+ hours of play time and a figure of money most people would be ashamed to admit.\n\nNexon takes and takes and takes has no love for the people who give them the money to keep developing their business. On that note nexon had decided the development team was too ambitious and scaled back the scope of the project. This lead to unrest in the team causing most member of the original developers to either quit or be fired. Customer service is rarely of any use and will fight you until they legally cannot. Yes, they have done things in the past that were against multiple US/EU consumers rights and \"Fair business\" practices. Claiming that they had done nothing wrong when in fact their own ToS/EULA even states that what they had done was against their own terms.\n\nThe icing on the cake as some have mentioned was the implemention of \"Community Moderators\" who in essence swear blind faith to nexon and run rampent throughout the fourms destroying what little community was left after the first year the game was released (some 100,000+ active players in that time frame down to some 5-6,000 these days IF that) dividing most of the memebers into camps of \"Eveythings fine\" and \"This game needs help\" even being civil merely discussing issues with the game/company and plausable ways for them to rectify them can result in forum bans.\n\nLast but no least, whales. Cash cows run rampent in the game with impunity. The more you spend, the more you are allowed to break the terms of service. I myself in the final days started using various hacks/scripts, posting Youtube Videos of me doing such, posting these on the forums attempting to bring all manner of attention to what players were capable of doing to the game and what was the response? A forum ban. My account itself was untouched, active and fully functional. When I inquired about my account not being banned to customer support the ticket was instantly closed, when I used an alt account to do the same (the alt account had no money spent on it and was outside of an identical IP address had no associtation with my primary account was promptly banned from the forums without reason.\n\nIf you want to experiance this game do yourself a favor and play \"Black Desert Online\" many of the same people who developed Vindictus are working on BDO under their own company setting their own pace and it shows in the fact that they've made multiple millions of USD more than Vindy over a single year compared to Vind's entire life of 6 almost 7 years.\n\nTL:DR Nexowned isn't an enderaring term, avoid a graveyard of \"Good ideas blinded by greed\"", "timestamp_updated": 1485637694, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485637694, "votes_down": 12}, {"recommendationid": "29638907", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 76, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555148", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1493288343, "steamid": "76561198316907220", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 6, "review": "I no longer recommend this game because of Nexon's unjust January 2017 perma-ban of player Sanitee.\n\nAs a Vindictus fan from 2012, I have seen countless players (including myself) leave Vindictus, only to return for its unique combat. It has a medieval taste to it, your actions have weight, and it's dodge or die. The fluid combat system relies on building combos with the mouse instead of your MMO-1 through 9 keys. Gameplay relies on timing dodges and slamming combos in between.\n\nSanitee created fansites, contest-winning art, YouTube channels, and databases FOR THE COMMUNITY. Forum moderation deletes negative threads and difficulty working with customer service creates a global sensation that the players are not cared about.\n\nP2W? More like pay to get ahead or pay to look pretty. Real cash cannot save you from end-game gear-destroying RNG. Real world currency can buy rare cosmetics to sell for in game currency to buy pro level equips. Feel free to be the cheapskate we all are, grind your gear for free, but the eye-candy cosmetics for $10 are hard to resist. It's just as enjoyable F2P.\n\nThe real game is in finding your friends to stand by your side in the dungeons. The story is about humanity's war to find peace, there are movies and voice-overs, and regular updates from the Korean version. Bring a friend and you'll love it, or you'll quit and end up coming back for the Dark Souls gameplay.\n\nNexon though? I would like to see them contact myself and the community about Sanitee's ban.

This once again was made clear very recently when a well known/helpful player that had already been falsely banned once (a improper ban that was overturned) was improperly banned again to which Nexon NA basically said, 'We've already fixed a mistake we made once, so we won't do it again.' What?? So if Nexon makes a mistake once it's 'hey we'll fix it\", but if they make a mistake twice it's, \"go pound sand'?

Outstanding fast-paced combat with lots of variety, and decent graphics (back then, anyway). \n\nMy friends and I played the HELL out of this game a few years ago.  What really kept us playing was the great action-based combat, and amazing amount of detail and intricacy involed with the production this game.  When we discovered this game and how great it was, we started the guild called \"V for Vindictus\" and it quickly became one of the largest guilds in the game.  Vindictus is really one of the best free to play action-based combat MMOs we have ever played.\n\nCONS: The game is a few years old now, and showing its age.  Also, my account got hacked a long time ago, so I pretty much stopped playing since then.  It is almost entirely instance-based dungeons, where you que up solo or in a group depending on the level of the dungeon, etc. you need to do.  The problem with groups is sometimes you get people from the other side of the world connecting to the game using potato-powered internet, which will then lag out the game for everyone.  My advice is to avoid pickup groups, and join a guild to group with.\n\nMORE CONS: Whats with Nexon allowing trigger-happy, power hungry forum admins that ban some of the most infuential people for Vindictus of ALL TIME? (Fan-site and gaming community leaders)? A game company that cares little to none for its customers, which is the cheap way for Nexon. That forum admin should at least be permanently banned. It seems like many recent players are saying the game is dying, which is not surprising, as it has had a pretty good run for a Nexon game.\n\nLOLWUT:  If you really like action-based combat games with depth, then I recommend you just give Vindictus a try.

I have at least 1000 hours overall put into this game, some on the launcher and some on steam, but I'm thinking of stopping entirely now due to some recent events that have taken place. (Jan 22, 2017, tl;dr for the game itself at the bottom)\n\nBut for starters, we'll talk about the game itself\n - The good:\n\n    - The combat system is simply one of the best, if not the best in any MMO, and even better than some single player oriented games I've played like Dark Souls and The Witcher. The hitboxes are clean, the action is quick (and even faster once you get some attack speed), and the bosses have a lot of variety in the mid to late game that keeps you on your toes, and stumbles even some of the best players from time to time. The hack and slash elements here are very well done. I would entirely recommend someone to play this game simply for the combat system(but to be aware the early game is very muchly a grind and a faceroll until about the ainle missions, or even the polar bear if you're new to this type of game).\n\n    - The character classes are very diverse and unique from one another. Nearly every single character plays entirely different to the other characters, even between their weapon types if they utilize more than one. You want safer, consistent ranged combat, you pick your xgun or bow Kai. You want to get off a huge burst of spells and gtfo, you pick your staff Evie. You want to get in the face of the boss all the time, and stay there. you pick your Pillar or Cestus Karok, or Greatsword Hurk. You want to play reactively, you pick Twin Sword Vella dancing with ease at the bosses attack patterns, or a sturdy shield maiden in Fiona. And there's still others who fall on both ends of the spectrum. Find the character you like, and stick with them till 40 to see if you like the game(follow AP guides early on so you don't get screwed later).\n\n   - The character customization is also amazing. The armor sets can be mixed and matched however you want for the most part(be aware of set bonuses). There's an entire outfitter shop with all sorts of different hairstyles, tattoos, inner armors, etc. The bad part is that most of it costs a LOT of money. I'm talking $5 for a single head, armor, leg, glove, or boot customization, but for overall variety, and in such an old game engine, it certainly is vast and very customizable down to some of the colors of the armor pieces themselves. \n\n*-------------------------------------------------------------*\n\n - The bad:\n\n    - The game is pretty much entirely peer to peer hosted, so whoever's the host needs good internet or no one can play properly. While not usually a problem with the earlier missions that only accompany up to 4 people, it gets a bit hairier with the 6 or 8 man raids, or when huge masses of mobs start spawning in and the host's computer can't keep up. On the flipside, it does allow people to play on other servers with friends if they live nearby with relatively low ping and consistency, so that's nice. \n\n    - The game is VERY much a cash grab at this point. The only thing keeping it afloat are the whales, but most of them only stay simply because of the time invested through sunk cost fallacy. In a free to play game, the community needs to be alive enough for the game to be commercially successful, but eventually even the whales will quit eventually. It's been very sad seeing the community slowly dwindle over the years and now hardly seeing anyone in even the first 10 channels. \n\n   - The game is poorly optimized. It's built off a very old engine from more than a decade ago, and rarely, if ever, reaches 60fps for even the best gaming rigs. Sure it looks pretty on higher settings, but the game is all about functionality. This can be improved by turning off UI elements(the buff indicators and their tooltips in particular are resource heavey due to their updating every single second, if you want better functionality for this game I'd recommend turning off any UI elements you deem unnecessary for the fight itself.) but will still have a few issues occasionally. \n\n   - Progression in the game can be heavily RNG based. For earlier levels it doesn't matter that much for what weapons and other things you use as long as they're appropriately leveled. If you're an experienced player you can easily get to the late game within 20 hours of gameplay, especially when you know when to upgrade things, or just the weapon, etc, and how to play the game itself effectively. For new players, however, it can be very confusing and grindy when they try to farm for things they could just buy on the market for dirt cheap that's the correct level for progressing through the game. This is also a problem with the enhancing and enchanting systems in the game which can be seen here: \n\nhttp://vindictus.gamepedia.com/Item_Enhancement \nhttp://vindictus.gamepedia.com/Enchanting.\n\nThis can make it hard to progress in the game after a certain threshold where it's required to be useful in any way during raids or other battles. \n\n   - Nexon NA's support is ABYSMAL. The community mods are mostly just people ruling with an iron fist over anything that goes against their own preconceived biases, and Nexon has issues with fan made sites outside of their own forums or wiki. Dealing with the support team is mostly just rehashed, premade messages that get you nowhere. \n\n*-------------------------------------------------------------*\n\nThe recent issue: \n\nThe problem I have is with the built in security feature BlackCipher, which poorly summarized, works by testing the amount of RAM usage during your gameplay to detect abnormalities in gameplay to test for bots, and automatically adds \"points\". Once you reach a threshold you get auto banned. This also runs in the background and causes significant stuttering and lag for the actual game itself. The prime reason why I'm quitting now is because recently one of the most prominent community members, Sanitee, was banned due to his personally developed, and widely helpful Vindictus Inn site and database being marked as being a \"hack\" of sorts due to BlackCipher. This resulted in a permanent ban that he's tried to get uplifted to no avail, and which Nexon NA(or at least the minuscule amount of actual workers there) claims cannot be undone. In response, Shippuu(who's review can be seen nearby as well) has closed the other prominent fan site Vindictus Manual in retaliation and replaced it with a heartfelt message instead. These two key figures were widely regarded as some of the most helpful and experienced players, as well as prominent game developers devoting days of their time to making functioning websites for the entire community, and Nexon showed their true colors on how much they \"care\" regarding the issue, and the game itself. Because of this, I can't play this game in good conscience and refuse to spend more time playing a game that the developers(or at least Nexon rather than Devcat for the most part) care nothing about and which will die because of negligence. You might just get banned for no other reason than you forgot you overclocked your PC earlier out of nowhere, which is not okay in any online game. Nexon has entirely sweeped the incident under the rug out of sight of everything else as well.\n\nOverall, I'd say to try it until like level 40ish with whatever character you feel most comfortable with and see if you like it(better with friends), but understand that Nexon doesn't care even a little about anything, and you might be screwed later on down the line for no reason whatsoever, and many prominent people are leaving because of Nexon's negligence and disinterest.\n\ntl;dr : Gameplay++++, Customization+, Character Variety++\nPeer 2 Peer mostly--, Optimization--, Cash Grab--, RNG--, Nexon----------", "timestamp_updated": 1485130798, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485114677, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "30229272", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503906", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1487463845, "steamid": "76561198189351307", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "Loading screen simulator 2017.
