I started back when I was in seventh grade and this was my game of choice every afternoon and weekend through all of high school. I quit playing Mabinogi seriously about the time I graduated, then went back some time later. I've put way too many hours in to this game and I've watched it grow from the early stages to the game it is now. \n\nNow, the I'll break down the game's biggest weaknesses as best I can and let you decide if you want to play this game or not.\n\nRNG repairs: It's present in nearly every game at this point, but it's really bad in Mabinogi. If you have a sword with 12/12 durability and you take it down to 0/12 with lots of use, you can lose your maximum durability on a repair. Your 12/12 can become an 11/11 or even a 9/9. You can pour money and time in to upgrading and perfecting your weapon, getting the perfect enchants on it, and even spamming pay to win elements on it to make it perfect, but eventually you'll be sitting on a great weapon with 0/0 durability and no way at all to use it. \n\nRNG upgrades: Once you fully manage to upgrade your weapon of choice, you have a special upgrade you can preform that either increases the damage or your critical attack damage. This upgrade comes in multiple \"steps\" starting from step 1 and going up to 6 (I believe step 7 was added as of the last time I played, but I have no experience with this.)\nStep 1 to 2 will have a 50% success rate and cost about 100k per attempt. If you fail at getting to step 2, your step 1 weapon will go back to 0 and there's nothing you can do about it but try again. Every success takes you up a grade, every fail takes you down one. You could have a step 4 weapon and it can drop down to step 0 simply by failing what feel like coin flips repeatedly, each failure making your weapon weaker and costng you money to do so. As if that's not bad enough, there's a final 6th step you can reach from step 5 that has a 40% chance of success, and your weapon will DISAPPEAR if it fails. \nWhat.. The.. Fuck.... \nImagine spending a bunch of money on a weapon, a bunch of money carefully repairing it, a bunch of money upgrading it, you finally manage to get it to step 5 then POOF! All gone, try again. Seriously, whoever thought this was a good idea needs fucking fired.\n\nIn-game economy: It's nonexistant. Seriously. Any item you can craft or get as a drop will also appear in the cash shop in the form of a gachapon or a set you can buy. Want to recover a little of your max durability on a weapon? wait for it to appear in the cash shop. Need more space or want to get around faster? Buy a pet in the cash shop. You can't spend money to get out of doing leveling, but you can buy weapons that will make your leveling experience feel like the easiest thing you've ever done. The only reason to raise any crafting skills in the game is for the added stat bonuses. \n\nPvP: What PvP? There are multiple systems in the game for it, but there's absolutely no reason to do any of them. Players can do way too much damage and don't have anywhere near enough health to deal with it. Experienced players with enough money invested in reforges (see next point) can kill somebody (in a duel where you're supposed to do 1% of your original damage) in about ten seconds. There's no point at all.\n\nReforges: Oh boy, here we go. This, for me, was the nail in the coffin. This is what made me quit the game after so many years of hard work and commitment. Reforges are cash shop exclusives (with very very few exceptions through events.) A normal reforge will cost about $1.30 and gives you one roll at your gear. It doesn't change the gear's existing stats in any way, but it does add a new stat down to the bottom. Once you put a stat on your item, you can buy another to change it. I've seriously gone through $140 just trying to get the ONE stat I wanted on a single piece of gear. Not two specific stats, just one. You spend and you spend and you spend, throw your entire pay checks at Nexon just for a chance to maaaaaaybe get what you want. It got to the point I wouldn't duel anybody who used reforges, and I stand by my decision. You're literally buying your damage in the cash shop. \n\nReforge scaling: To put it in perspective, I could take the next few years and fully max out a character. Every skill. Maxed. No exceptions. I could then enchant all my gear and upgrade it perfectly to maximize my damage. The best bow with the best roll and the best upgrades, all the way to step 6.. Where to go from there? Nowhere.. Pretty good, pretty good... Now take a newbie with three month's experience and give him the same bow, let him max out just his archery skills (no added dex from other skill trees) and spam it with reforges till you get decent damage rolls. 10/10 times that newbie will do more damage every time with every shot than that expert. This game doesn't give a shit about your play time or your effort, money will always win. \n\nIn conclusion: There's tons more I could talk about, but I don't want to keep writing this any longer. This isn't recent, I haven't played this game in at least eight months. This is the resentment I feel towards Mabinogi and their publisher from how terrible their game was all that time ago, and I am positive it hasn't gotten any better. They add new 'harder' content but they increase the cap on the damage players can do as well, so there's really no point. Even if Mabinogi has some of the most entertaining progression I've ever played, you'll outlevel the progression and it turns in to a slow tedious grind on easy mobs and artificial difficulty thrown at you to make you feel challenged.

I haven't played a single game so far that is remotely similar to this game, and I love that about it.\n\nNow I know what you're saying: \"This sounds too good to be true\" and well... it is unfortunately.\n\nI'll list the pro's and con's for this game:\n\nPros:\n\n-Unique combat system, it's not a typical \"click and wait for your character to kill it\" kind of game, there's a stun meter, and it resets depending on how much you hit the opponent, Making mashing away, unless you are higher leveled, useless.\n-No class system, I swear when I join an mmo, I have a super hard time thinking what class do I want to be, and what if I don't like it later? Well, Mabinogi has a \"skill\" system that gives you stats, instead of having to be limited to certian skills because a class, everyone has skills equally, with the exception of a very few amount of skills (Those skills are locked into race).\n-Mainstream storyline quests, I will say it, I hate most mmo plots, the characters lack personality, there isn't a feeling of depth within the bosses, and most of the time, you have absolutely no idea what they are talking about, nor do you really CARE. This plot had me paying attention, I won't say it's an amazing plot, but if a plot in an MMO actually manages to have me wondering what will happen next, then I say it's at least decent. The bosses (due to the combat system) really have you feeling like you're facing off against a MENACE. Plus, you know a plot is at least decent when you have players sometimes actually TALK about the plot in the game.\n-Armor and clothes. Oh God how I hated games that were like \"Wait you want this cool looking armor or that adorable dress you always wanted? LEVEL UP AND GET THERE! Oh what's that? The next armor looks like -bleep-? Well if you wanna be good at the game, you gotta WEAR THAT ONE INSTEAD!\" You can wear ANYTHING at ANY LEVEL. Although the exception is Elves with wearing heavy armor, other than that though, you can wear anything with any level character. Are you a level 1 that so happened to get a rare item that EVERYONE wants? Wear it and be proud!\n-Pets These things actually HELP YOU in combat.\n-You don't HAVE to do combat. You don't... and I love that... I mean I still play the combat system, but if that's not your thing and you just want to socialize? Then go ahead! Want to make music for everyone to hear? Compose away! Want to be a farmer? Ee-ai-ee-ai-oh it up!\n\nCons:\n\n-Once you have leveled to a certian point, there's nothing to rank anymore, and once that happens, unless you log in just to talk to friends, the game gets boring.... fast... rally fast...\n-Most amazing armors and clothes in general come from gachapons... which you have to PAYYYYYY for, not only that, you only have a SMALL CHANCE to get the clothes you want...\n-If you reaaaaally want to be damaging in combat, guess what you gotta do? you gotta PAYYYYYYYYYYYYY for it, just to HOPEFULLY get that equip enhance you wanted.\n-Appearence changing, if you've got money to spend, this shouldn't be an issue, heck you can change your character's gender if you wanted to (which is free to do). But... you need money to actually CHANGE your appearence. I mean it's good that you are able to change that hairstyle that you hated at first, but most good hairs you have to pay for...\n-Pets are good, and valuable in storage and combat, but... you need to PAYYYYYY for it...\n\nOverall review: Great game- amazing even in my opinion, but it IS owned by Nexon, meaning you gotta have money, and lots of it.

First off, it's extremely heavy on your computer. Nexon could have fixed this years ago but they've been busy adding too much new stuff that costs either actual money or about 20m ig gold. I've only played for about two years, but I finally quit a couple days ago. The GMs are very biased and show favoritism towards friends; there's even rumors of the CM giving the rarest sword in the game to a friend of a friend for free. The storyline is decent, g19/g20 were my favorites, but hardly anyone actually plays the game. The game is almost completely dead, and those who still play (at least in Tarlach) just afk all day selling things from gacha for insane prices. Again, only playing on Tarlach, I might be biased, but the community is terrible. There's so much drama between guilds or just a couple people. Half the people, when they actually aren't afk, are total jerks. The other half are cancerous as h e l l. I will admit I've made several of friends on it, I wouldn't even be dating my boyfriend if I hadn't played it, but it's getting worse and worse every month.

I would recommend this game but honestly it's such a time killer and it pushes you into spending tons of money on it. Like I said, most of the people I've met on this game are either rude, perverted, stupid, untrustworthy, etc. Some of my old friends  fit in really well with the community, how I don't know. But in my opinion, it's just full of a bunch of people I don't want to be around. But, if you do have time and money to waste and you think you would fit in with this godawful community, then go ahead. And I suggest people 14+ because I know being a young person playing this game is extremely stressful. For example, lets say if you tell a close friend that you're 12 they might think of you differently, exclude you, think of you as weird, and/or tell you that you're too young for the game. I'm saying this because that's happened almost every time I told someone in this game that I am younger than most people that play. But, if you're lucky enough and you know how to make people like you regardless of your age then you might have some luck with this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1486849145, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486849145, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 23, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 18, "total_reviews": 41}}
