The Class System seemed nice, the Character Creation was ok, but f.e the Tutorial started already... Lame. It could've been ''something'', but it's just not. \n\nI played a total of 2,5 Hours. That was enough for me, to make a myself a Picture about the Game. \n\n*Steam did not reckognize the Game anymore after the first Start.
