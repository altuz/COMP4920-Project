So don't let your worries about population turn you away.\n\nThis is a classic MMORPG. It's going to be familiar to anyone that has played Everquest, DAoC, WoW, etc. While it means you're not getting any particularly amazing new mechanics, the perk is that LOTRO has figured out how to get the best out of those systems. Leveling feels well-progressed, classes are (mostly) balanced, and there is a lot of variety even within the classes to provide lots of replay value and ways to mitigate strengths and weaknesses.\n\nLOTRO might have the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I recommend turning off battle music and just enjoying the compositions. Bree, as well as the various Inns and Halls located therein, have some fantastic scores attached to them.\n\nLet's be honest though - if you play LOTRO you're probably here because it's Lord of the Rings. And in that regard, you will not be disappointed. The game is steeped in the lore - books and films - and has little nods to it scattered everywhere that are rewarding for someone that is really into their Tolkien scholarship. This is not a LotR skin thrown over a MMORPG framework - this is Middle Earth proper. Even with dated graphics (updates are coming soon, as of this writing) it's still a joy to look at. If you're rolling through some place like the Shire, you'll be able to soak in that sleepy, bucolic atmosphere that the movies portrayed so well.\n\nThis is a great MMO experience, and I usually find MMOs tedious. Moreover, it's free - so your excuses to at least try it out are non-existent.", "timestamp_updated": 1486486844, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486486734, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "29455274", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519754", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1463188870, "steamid": "76561198088832775", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The steam client is trash.\n\n[b] BUT [/b]\n\nThe game is amazing, It looks stunning for a game that came out when it did and the newer areas show the love the developers have put into the game, I dont use the steam client though because it has caused me some issues.\n\nPROS:\n[list]\n[*] Follows LOTR lore almost perfectly\n[*] Classes are varied\n[*] Community is always friendly\n[*] THE MUSIC SYSTEM!

For me, this was not the case. I don't have a powerful rig (and also not the best wifi), and I downloaded this game in under an hour. With quick account registration and patches installed, I was soon on my way to explore Middle Earth.\n\nAs for the game itself, for being almost 10 years old, it's incredible. As a fan of Tolkien, it's astonishing to run into iconic landscapes and characters. The game is beautiful for being 10 years old, and you don't need a high performancing PC to run it. There's a main quest line that follows the books and plenty of interesting side quests. Combat is fun and engaging for a tab target MMORPG. The music, oh the music. If you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings film scores, then you'll love the music in game. There's nothing more enjoyable than the ear-gasm of riding into Rohan and hearing the sweet sound of violins accompaning your journey.\n\nOn the contrary, the game can become a bit grindy. Lower level quests can become quite repeditive with the feeling of \"kill 10 spiders and collect 5 bear hides.,\" can be a bit overwhelming. I know. I've almost stopped playing again because of it. But, if you pick an advanced and interesting class, it can be less mind numbing. At the time of writting this review, I have a level 20 Warden and quests are becoming more engaging. Skirmishes, epic battles, and instances are a great break from these grindy experiences, and epic battles are available at low levels.\n\nAs for the F2P model, it's one of the best ones available. It's incredibly fair and there really isn't any P2W instances. Some higher level quests and expansions require LOTRO points, but these points can be acquired in game (if you're up for some serious grinding). Most of the equipment found in the LOTRO store are cosmetics, mounts, and chracter boosts. I started out as a F2P player, but fell in love with the game, and became a VIP member, spending some money on additional LOTRO Points.\n\nSo download the game. If you don't like it, then all you have done is wasted a bit of your time. It's free to play people.

With a free 105 level-up included with every Mordor expansion bundle now is the perfect time to give LotRO a try. Outstanding solo content, group patch coming this winter.\n\n[h1]ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW[/h1]\n\nPut it simple: the best MMORPG out there.\n\nIt's big. What do you think is big? WoW? Check this. If you pay attention, you'll notice that any other MMORPG uses either corridor-like locations, with view always blocked by mountains, trees, buildings etc., or dramatically low draw distance, or both. Well, LotRO draws enormously vast locations with honest draw distance - not GTA V, but nothing like you've seen in MMORPG before. (The Crew was later). When you're in the fields of Rohan, you feel exactly why it is the land of horseriders.\n\nIt's authentic. I play this game for 7 years and still I stop and gaze in awe at dwarf lords sculptures in Moria. Still I take screenshots of The Shire. Still I find dozens of new landscape details. This world is handcrafted by the indigenous inhabitants of Middle-Earth - piece by piece, tree by tree, bush by bush.\n\nIt's homely. LotRO officially has the best or one of the best communities in online games.\n\nYou know, I can go down to the basic mechanics, the classes (see in comments), the raids, the PvP, the unique mechanics like Legendary Weapons and Mounted Combat, but you know what? It's boring. Every game has mechanics, classes, balance and lots of people whine there's no balance. But this game is special. It has... it IS The Middle-Earth. If this means nothing to you, just pass by. You will like it, or dislike it, nothing I can change. But if you love Middle-Earth as I do, or if you are ready to fall in love with it, then we shall meet in White City, one day.\n\nOver 4000 hours /played on Russian servers before they were shut down.", "timestamp_updated": 1507048087, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486660714, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "29474508", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506823", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501715477, "steamid": "76561198135983859", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is probably one of my favorite things to review...as you can tell by my hours..198.8 hours total, BUT I have 64.9 Hours just in two weeks, thats how addicting this game can be, that is with no sitting around, no afking or etc..it's a very fun game..But with the fanboying aside lets get to what you guys came for and give my Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\nGreat Community (very helpful no matter what server your on)\nBeautiful Atmosphere\nNever breaks the tolkien universe feeling (which means always feels like your really in the Tolkien Universe) \nGreat Variety in Weapons, skill sets, and armors, you will rarely find someone with the same kind of armor and or weapon as you or even close for that matter\nVery Unique in its own way, personally I love the cosmetic system, it adds this feeling to kind of drive you into the universe more so you can kinda be more in character, feel like your there (Cosmetic system, allows you to equip armor and weapons that you would personally think suits you, so for man it would be ranger armor and etc, dwarves heavy dwarven armor and etc...Personally it a great feature as it gives a better feeling to it) \nTeams still working on the game, making it much better with every update!\nAdded a new race called Beorning with the class (their like druids, for WoW players you turn into a bear pretty much lol) But also hard to get on free to play..but possible!\nHas own servers for Roleplayers (so if your into kind of the Tolkien universe for LOTR that you know a lot about roleplaying and stuff give it a shot, people are very forgiving on Laurelin (the EU and US RP server) along with other servers as well.\nHas some wonderfu crafting mechanics that could very much benefit you if you are in a Kinship (kind of like a clan) you can help each other have the gear you need to FIGHT For middle earth!\n\nCons:\nSadly, helps the VIP a lot, with all expansions and etc unlocked\nF2P's have to \"farm\" all their points in order to level\nF2P's have a huge grind\nSometimes you could be looked down upon from being a f2p by VIP's (more my personal experience but still, something to be careful about)\nTime Consuming farming (not too much of a complaint as that's how its suppose to be XD)\nGraphics for character are out of date (expected of course from 2009)\nSome areas can be depressing yes, but that DOESN'T mean its still not beautiful, you could be taken away by the beautiful areas around Angmar, or the huge mountains in Moria or just in the Misty Mountains great places to go (harder to get to if your F2P, trust me..I farmed the points, tough but worth it) \n\nThese are of course my personal Pros and Cons, as you would expect, but most of them were based off of other people's reactions to the game and stuff like that, so it is not just me spewing a bunch of stuff out for someone to read :P I hoped you loved the review, and trust me I'd gladly give it a 10/10 course it has its flaws but it is still beautiful, fun, and interesting.\n\nAnd always remember....Baruk Khaz\u00e2d!

It is certainly more geared to solo players, but does a good job of catering to everyone. The classes range from basic to some of the most advanced and interesting classes I've ever seen in an MMO. (Take Warden or LoreMaster for example)! The community is also one of the friendliest and the servers are still busy and alive to this day. It has stood the test of time and still looks astonishingly beautiful as ever. Add to all that it has fantastic mood setting music you've got a class A product. Many players simply can't stop at a single character and over the years I have kept on coming back to this game. Without a doubt my favourite MMO ever. It's also great to see the dedication of Standing Stone in keeping their work alive and keeping lotro safe for the future years with a decent, not overly greedy free to play system. Much of the content can be enjoyed for free and extras can be bought as required. The only time you may consider spending money is to open up quest packs in different regions and expansion packs. But considering the size and amount of time you could foreseeably spend in this masterpiece, it is well worth it!", "timestamp_updated": 1487749663, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487749663, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "30190602", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501491", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507004684, "steamid": "76561198213571915", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 12296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 480}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is the game that introduced me to the addicting world of MMORPGs.  The game has aged rather well when compared to its counterpart, Dungeons & Dragons Online.  If you want to do F2P go right ahead, the company who runs the game doesn't bog free players with pointless restrictions and mandatory purchases to move the game forward.  In my opinion, however, its worth becoming a VIP, as it only enhances your experience and you get your money's worth.
