The story is short and simple (escape the oncoming enemy fleet), but the game is highly replayable due to procedural generation of levels and power-ups and a number of unlockable ships to play around with.\n\n[b]What's The Best Part?[/b]\nManaging your ship's crew assignments and power distribution is fun, especially in the heat of battle.  Needing to put out fires (sometimes literally) while struggling to keep your own guns firing on the enemy is frenetic and fun.  I particularly like that you can open airlocks to vent parts of your ship as a firefighting/combat technique.  Exploration of sectors is tense and fast-paced - time enough to decide what's important, but not enough to cover everything with a fine-tooth comb.\n\n[b]What's The Worst Part?[/b]\nThere's nothing really [i]bad[/i] about this game, although it's more of a time-filler than something you can really sink your teeth into.  It never [i]claimed[/i] to be anything bigger, so that's not really a strike against it, just something to be aware of.  I play a round or two of this game when I have an hour or so to kill, but it's not a game I really dig into for weeks at a time.\n\n[b]Will I Like It?[/b]\nIf you like fast-paced tactical decision-making where your choices do matter, even if they primarily affect your survival and not the story, then this is the game for you.  I don't know if I personally agree with the label \"roguelike\" for this game, but it definitely has a lot of similarities to that genre.  Procgen, permadeath, tactical gameplay.\n\n[b]Should I Buy It?[/b]\nI recommend it, but weight the decision based on how much what you're seeing appeals to you, personally.\n\nThis has been a 5TYSK review.
