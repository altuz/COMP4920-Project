Well, I finished the game in less than four hours, so it's more like a short trip than a full adventure.\n\nThe game has some \"fun\" modes which you can buy for upgrade points (which you earn in the missions) such as invulnerability, super speed and big-head mode. Those are fine, except the controls are not responsive enough for the super-speed, and it's crystal-clear the speed challenges were all designed with the super-speed active in mind.\n\nIn conclusion: the game is fun, but short, and the speed challenge does not carry it.

These are supposed to be the Seven Mortal Sins - and all wrath can do is headbutt and punch. Upgrade him and he gets some short-range boomerangs. So this became less a game of 7 inherently different characters and more of one character with 7 abilities who can punch people.\n\nThe graphics are below par.\nI bought for the plot, and it wasn't there.\nAnd the greatest sin throughout the game lies in the controls; having to quickly switch between seven different characters is dreadful yet required for the puzzles.\n\nPerhaps it was released too early.\nPerhaps funding was cut.\nBut the only thing about this game which did not disappoint was the trading card value on the community market.\nPerhaps then you can get some of your money back.", "timestamp_updated": 1390589407, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1390589407, "votes_down": 13}, {"recommendationid": "11517329", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502606", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405458602, "steamid": "76561198116707297", "num_games_owned": 1298, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very underated game.  People compare it to trine because of the idea of having multiple characters with different abilities to solve puzzles, but having played them both back to back (trine first, then this game) this game has a very unique feel to it.\n\nPros:\n-7 characters to use and it is easy to switch seamlessly between them, every character is assigned a shortcut key, it will take some time to learn them all but once you do switching between all 7 becomes seamless, there is also a character wheel you can use while you get used to the shortcuts.\n\n-each character has different combat abilites, while the combat is not deep, I did enjoy it more than trine.  In trine I always found I would just hang back with the archer and shoot everyone, this game gives you more variety in how you handle combat and in later levels it forces you to use all your characters in battles.  \n\n-very inventive puzzles, this is not a physics based game, and while some of the puzzles are cookie cutter a good deal of them are brilliantly done.  You will spend a few minutes trying to figure out what to do and then you will actually have to execute your plan, quickly in many cases since many of the puzzles are timed.  Except for one puzzle at the very end of the game, I enjoyed the puzzles in this game tremendously\n\nCons:\n\n-bosses are simple learn pattern, attack, rinse repeat kind of affairs.  I did enjoy the last boss battle, but the other bosses were pretty simple and a bit repetitive.\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun with this game, it does lack a certain level of polish but if your into puzzle platformers with a nice mix of action thrown in you could do a lot worse than this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1406965552, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406965552, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "8451381", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503104", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1371066712, "steamid": "76561198034816478", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is much more fun, easier, and enjoyable with a friend.
