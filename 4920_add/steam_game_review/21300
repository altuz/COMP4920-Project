It's near 10 years old now and the developer is long gone, but this is still one of the best Gravitar-style shooters ever made.\n\nDifficult but fair, with a surprising amount of diversity in the level design. You can download the demo, or there's also a good gameplay video [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvNd2aMsEP0]here[/url] so you know what to expect.\n\n\nNow a few important first-play tips if you buy this game (which you should):\n\n- The default level pack on the main menu is \"OfficialPack1.\" [b]That is the expansion.[/b] Click once so that you are starting with the \"Standard\" pack, which are the levels from the initial release. Otherwise the game will seem very difficult to start with.\n\n- [b]Use your shield.[/b] It will deflect all standard bullets and is a lifesaver in tight areas. By default it is bound to the middle mouse button; I suggest rebinding it to a more easily accessible key like the spacebar, or use a controller. All controls can be rebound from the options menu, which is available after starting the game. You can also adjust the mouse sensitivity there.\n\n- You can land on any flat surface, including walls and celings, and you will not take damage from landing at high speeds, as long as you are correctly aligned.\n\n\nGravitron is near-perfect, with only one serious flaw: There are no leaderboards. There were at one point, hosted on a third-party server, but that server is down for good. Steam leaderboards would be a major benefit, though there is little hope of that happening now.\n\nStill, that lone drawback should absolutely not stop you from picking this one up. Don't bother waiting for a sale - it hasn't dropped in price since 2013 and likely won't ever again. Plus at $5 it's already a steal."}]}
