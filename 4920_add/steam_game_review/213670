You play as a new kid moving into the town and are able to select from one of [i][b]four classes[/b][/i], Warrior, Mage, Thief, and Jew - yes, there is a Jew class. From what I understand, the game is more or less the same regardless of your choice of class, but your equipment and abilities will vary depending on your choice, which is cool. In battle, you will usually have a buddy of your choice, each one being very different and some of them having uses outside of combat. Playing comfortably, [i][b]the main story has about 7-8 hours of gameplay with probably about 6 hours more of side content[/b][/i] in the form of missions and other activities, like searching for collectables. \n\n[h1]The good[/h1]\n\nThe Stick of Truth's combat system is pretty straightforward and [i][b]just about anyone should be able to pick up and play the game[/b][/i]. I find the combat to be most [i][b]comparable to Legend of the Dragoon or the Mario & Luigi RPG games[/b][/i] for Nintendo handhelds, both being series' I've enjoyed. TSoT features many things that RPG fans can expect to see from an RPG, like [i][b]different classes, abilities, items, and choice of strategy[/b][/i]. Most of the game takes place outside of combat, which is just as enjoyable. The area that the game takes place in is densely-packed and there's [i][b]plenty of incentive to explore[/b][/i] the world and talk to NPCs.\n\nI can happily say that [i][b]the use of buddies is one of the best things about the game[/b][/i]. Each one was very well made and fun to use. In order of unlock, you're given Butters the paladin, Kenny the seductress, Stan the warrior, Jimmy the bard, Kyle the war chief, and Cartman the wizard. Each buddy brought their own tactics to the battle and they were fun to experiment with. Butters was the buddy I used most of the time, due to his ability to heal, damage many enemies at once, and deal reasonable damage to armored targets.\n\nDeserving of its own paragraph is the fact that TSoT is [i][b]one of very few RPG games where grinding isn't necessary[/b][/i]. Personally, I enjoy grinding, at least to an extent, but many complaints about other RPG games is the need to grind or the impossible difficulty of the story missions without completing some side missions for added rewards.\n\n[h1]The bad[/h1]\n\nTSoT is a bit [i][b]spoon-feedy with its difficulty curve[/b][/i]. With the lack of need to grind, I never found myself in need of anything. My level was where it needed to be or higher, I always had great gear acquired normally through the story, I was never in need of potions (very often reaching capacity limits on many of them) and I ended the game with waaaay more money than I needed. In most turn-based RPG games, you can either attack or use an item. TSoT allows you to do both as well as doing the same with your available buddy. With resources being nearly free, being able to heal to full health AND attack twice in one turn leaves very little for challenge. Going a step further, your buddy can both use their ability and attack, giving you free healing, stat boosts, or added damage every turn. With having Butters as my buddy, I could heal to full health with just one nearly free item and still get both attacks or abilities. To make things even easier, once you have at least two buddies available, you can use a buddy's turn to switch them out. Once your buddy is low on health, you can have them switch to another buddy with full health and mana. Your main character is already very strong as it is, everything I mentioned here is [i][b]just to make the game even easier[/b][/i]. The Stick of Truth gives you a lot of options to cheese your way through the game, [i][b]reducing the overall enjoyment[/b][/i] of the game. At this point, [i][b]I'd rather have to grind[/b][/i] than just be handed the win.\n\nFans of South Park go absolutely nuts over the humor, but I found it to be very hit-or-miss. There were some jokes about Jews or black people that made me smile and I gave the occasional chuckle at how wild the game got at certain points (like fighting giant nazi zombie fetuses), but half the time the humor is just \"haha poop and FARTS xD\" which made me sigh quite a lot. I don't expect this type of humor to change and I'm positive I'm in a minority here, but [i][b]the game as a whole really wasn't that funny[/b][/i] due to these constant dips in quality. \n\n[h1]Other things you should know[/h1]\n\nAt normal price, TSoT [i][b]costs $30 which is way too much[/b][/i]. Fortunately the game gets marked down for as much as 75% off during sales and TSoT was a featured game in April 2016's Humble Monthly Bundle, which is how I got it. I enjoyed the game, but it certainly isn't worth regular price. If you are thinking about buying TSoT, I urge you to wait for a good sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1505707150, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505707150, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34988474", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514543", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1483925897, "steamid": "76561198067573451", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 4, "review": "You can become friend with Al Gore, he's the best Facebook friend!", "timestamp_updated": 1505540649, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505540649, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34892518", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505247999, "steamid": "76561198100654527", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great game but doesnt take long at all to beat...", "timestamp_updated": 1505175577, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505175577, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35113912", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507180056, "steamid": "76561198139522998", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3471}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game has been one of my favorites for a long time, especially when I got bored in many cases.
