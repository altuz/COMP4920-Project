Flight dynamics are accurate; I spent most in-game time in the Cessna 172 Skyhawk, flying VFR over Switzerland, and landing/taking off at all airstrips. I use real VFR circuit patterns and airspace classification information to add to the experience, and just fly VFR flights from one place to the other. I also do a bit of airwork, e.g. maneuvers (stall recovery, steep turns, slow flight, crosswind landings) and procedures (emergency, circuits), but lack of resistance of joystick/pedals and lack of G-force loadings are not making the experience very close to the real deal. But none of these is the game's fault. In that regard, I miss other AI traffic, radio telephony with ATC, simple procedures (e.g. start the engine, turn on landing lights, VOR navigation), and maybe recording capacities.
