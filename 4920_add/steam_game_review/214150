I love 4x genre but CIV is my taste. This game has steep learning curve and no tutorial. You have to learn the game by watching YouTube videos from legendary streamers/LPs. I had no nostalgic touch for this game too. Also I couldn't stand so old graphics. I know graphics is not everything, but I seriously couldn't stand this very old graphics. \n \n \nThe game is good as per many reviews. But if your gaming taste and/or profile matches similar to me, then stay away from this. Get newer 4x space strategy games, plenty of good games available in the market.  \n\nNote:  I played the game (at least tried) for 2 hours, however Steam couldn't capture the game time somehow.", "timestamp_updated": 1498529401, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498529229, "votes_down": 7}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 22, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 27, "total_reviews": 49}}
