It feels like a poor version of The Last of Us, only not being good.\n\nThe climbing was a pain with the stamina meter and at one point, just pointless if you're like me and search every area for every little item. You can be climbing up a building, low on stamina and then drink soda or something else to refill your stamina making the pitons useless later in game. \n\nThe story itself is quite bland, we've all heard this story before of a man who is trying to find his wife and daughter, having no trouble slicing through and shooting anyone who gets in his way from cannabals to some innocent people protecting their stuff (if you choose to attack them) without batting an eyelid. I'd suggest save your money for something better like \"This War Of Mine\".", "timestamp_updated": 1505346134, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505346134, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34851316", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501582", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505013291, "steamid": "76561198016386186", "num_games_owned": 527, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Crashes every 5 minutes on Windows 10", "timestamp_updated": 1505009891, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505009891, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34770231", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499095", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1477982076, "steamid": "76561198324486522", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Feels incomplete plus there are a lot of issues.
