A world that is literally a trash heap .... check! Adolf Hitlers resurrection .... absent .... so it seems Deponia doesn't quite have everything a great narrative should consist of, but it makes a good effort.\n\nGameplay:\n\nSo to clarify I don't usually play point and click adventure games, and I assume from the little I have played the formula is very similar: Grab every item you can find, combine them and then ... make a profit? In all seriousness there isn't exactly much gameplay wise, click to where you want to go, click items to use etc, but what can you except it is a point and click adventure game after all. Well i'd be lying if that was it, there are of course challenging puzzles that one must overcome! No this is not some shooty shooty boom your heads gone kind of game, you must use actual  intelligence to play, in actuality a lot of the puzzles are somewhat obscure and at times nonsensical (that ties in well with the narrative and world so it doesn't hurt the games atmosphere or theme negatively). This could well be a problem for you if you don't like this sort of thing, but if you get too frustrated you can always look up a guide (did that on a few occasions not going to lie). It also has some very welcomed features such as double tapping arrows to fast travel to different areas or holding down space to view all objects/things in an area, I cannot stress enough how much time this can save you making the game flow much better and be less frustrating.\n\nVisuals/Sound:\n\nSince the art-style was the thing that drove me to playing this game I can wholeheartedly say it did it's job and it did it pretty damn good. Deponia manages to make a dirt ridden world filled with junk look vibrant and colorful, the characters also have quite memorable designs, such as the aforementioned egotist Rufus. On the auditory side of things the sound affects and music fit well with the lighthearted and comedic nature of the game, and the \"chorus guys\" medleys are catchy and fun. Perhaps one of it's greatest strengths are it's voice acting, Kerry Shale hit it out of the park with Rufus, and that's not to say the other voices are bad either, their all brilliantly casted and voiced.\n\nStory/Setting:\n\nThe junk planet of Deponia is a very interesting setting, sure things have done it before but Deponia makes the small town of Kuvaq a joy to traverse, the eccentric townsfolk, mountains of junk and the art style contribute heavily to this. It also manages to establish an interesting universe? bunch of planets? or larger set-piece? by the end of the story teasing us with Elysium, Organon and a floating black market. The locations and their respective factions seem to be the main focus of the story although it starts towards the end of the game, primarily Deponia is an adventure and that is where it's story lies. It is Rufus's adventure, that has many unanswered questions that deserve some answers. Without spoiling too much the story made me want to carry on to find out Rufus's fate ... would he leave Deponia? Get the girl? be the hero?\n\nWriting: \n\nDeponia has some of the best writing iv'e seen in a video game for some time, this can range from the eccentric characters and customs that have formed from it's magnificent world, to the ego heavy monologues of Rufus. The fact that Rufus thinks he's intelligent, yet he isn't ... but we the player solve these difficult yet impractical problems as Rufus shows exactly how intelligent and an absolute fool he is at the same time which to me is an example of great character writing. The comedy is also fairly smart and witty at times such as when you find some straw in a stack of needles, or when Rufus is constantly prompted to berate a man he thinks is a pirate. I honestly could go on about how good the writing in this game is but I better finish up ....\n\nConclusion:\n\nDeponia is like breathing fresh, clean spring air after breathing in diesel fumes for your whole life. It presents the player with a cast of fairly likable characters (unlike a lot of games which give you a skeleton, his only personality trait being he makes puns bout bones .... seriously why do people think this is good characterization). The writing is superb and made me laugh on a good few occasions, the art is great, voices are great, music is a tiny bit less than great .... but still good. And whats this .... this is part 1 of 3 .... oh boy can't I wait to play the rest of this series!\n\nThe verdict, maybe if you've never been into Point and Click adventure games, or just aren't into them give Deponia a try anyway, it's funny, has good characters, and a promising tale to tell. The price is decent, but it goes on sale frequently so you can wait till it's like 99p which is well worth the price, alternatively and probably the smartest option is being all 3 in the complete journey edition, which also goes on sale fairly frequently for about \u00a35!", "timestamp_updated": 1506724766, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506724766, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35003023", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499587", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1457043381, "steamid": "76561198003223581", "num_games_owned": 748, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Oh man, flicking through my library and seeing this game and the sequels I can't help but have fond memories of my playthrough.\n\nIt probably took me about 6 or so hours to beat but it was great. It's games like Deponia that really remind you why adventure games were such a huge genre back in the day while also making you feel a bit sad when you realise the genre is pretty much seen as a niche now. Understandable given games have evolved to be more action orientated and less focused on delivering a story or strong narrative but that's not to say there still isn't a place for adventure games to shine.\n\nDeponia is definitely one of those games that shines and brings the genre to the forefront. It's got a great cast, some really good voice acting and great writing. The puzzles, however... They're not that great. They do fit the quirky theme and setting but they're very random, very frustrating and you will most likely find yourself looking at a guide every now and then if not you're left with mixing all sorts of random items together in random areas and picking up things you didn't think you could pick up to combine with some of the weirdest things ever.\n\nTo put into scope how weird and how out there some of these puzzles are, there's one in particular where you have to get in a crane and operate it. When you fix it and put everything in it you're missing one last step but the game never hints at what it is, Rufus simply voices that something isn't right. What it turns out to be is the skeleton sitting in the seat before had it's leg up behind the seat so, what you have to do is grab the skeleton's leg, jam it behind the seat(After removing the skeleton) and then operate the crane. That's how crazy and how confusing some of the puzzles can be in this game.\n\nOther than that it's one of the best adventure games to date in my opinion. I loved the characters, the story was good -- it was no Tolken epic now -- and interesting enough and the world, it's setting and the atmosphere was fantastic. It did a good job of delivering a somewhat slapstick, chilled experience which I loved about it.\n\nGreat game, well worth picking up for the price it is now although the complete edition(Includes the first three games) is on sale regularly enough for about \u20ac15 so if you think you might be interested just pick that version up as it includes everything bar the very last game.\n\nAbsolutely recommend this if you're at all looking for anything that resembles an adventure game. Worth the \u20ac9.99 for the first game alone.", "timestamp_updated": 1505583792, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505583792, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1325, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 270, "total_reviews": 1595}}
