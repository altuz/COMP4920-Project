While I was a fan of the original Eets Chowdown (in fact, one of the first DLC I ever got on the Xbox 360) I do admit it had some flaws, most glaring of which was the precision of the puzzles combined with how very easy and tempting it was to just go \"Give me the solution\", and cheat your way to victory. While Eets Munchies has the same \"Give me the solution\" option, I'll be honest- I don't feel as tempted to actually USE it: So far the precision of the items is not as pixel perfect as the original, and those times where you do put something in the wrong place don't feel as frustrating.\nAnother great improvement is the music. Sound effects are replaced with a bunch of notes reminesent of the old Warner Bro's Coyote and Roadrunner cartoons, where Eets foot steps are punctuated by music depending on his mood.  Given that Eets is now no longer 3D rendered, and is now 2D animation, this also makes it tons easier to tell what his mood IS exactly (a feature that previously had to be conveyed in a little close-up image of Eets- especially if Eets starts off the level in the air.)\nAdd to that a level editor, and I'd say Eets is now a much better game then it's first outing.", "timestamp_updated": 1394672752, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1394672752, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "27188574", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499756868, "steamid": "76561198323482492", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I LOVE Eets!

In fact, it's probably better on smartphones than on PC, as there's no full screen grfx, and when you do enlarge the window the grfx do look too big.\n\nWhile just completing a level is pretty easy, however if you are someone who must get every 'pie' before the exit then this game will be quite difficult in the later worlds.

This game is casual on some levels while merciless in others. The fact that it is clearly a mobile game for touchscreens is apparent from the UI as well as puzzles. I will not hold this fact against it though because it works well on PC, even going as far as integrating Steamworks. This grants the game a possibly endless array of user-created levels. Sadly one of the achievements is to create a level and publish it and so Steamworks is flooded with low-quality levels. This means the good ones are harder to find.
