Animations are fluid, the art design hits home, the soundtrack is extremely fitting, the game has an amazing flow, all game mechanics are brilliantly thought of as well as intuitive and every single obstacle allows for several ways of approach, some of which aren't planned design-wise but completely valid due to the interwovenness of gameplay mechanics.\n\nIt is possible to go on a murder spree or to play the whole game with zero casualties except two story progression deaths.\n\nThere's a reason why this game has managed to retain overwhelmingly positive reviews for a run of 5 years and probably will still remain the go-to-benchmark for the entire platformer stealth genre for years to come: It is simply brilliant.\n\nNuff said.", "timestamp_updated": 1505036678, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505036678, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35200538", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506957", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506337109, "steamid": "76561197971880699", "num_games_owned": 1803, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 1058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 200}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "\nDuration: 17 hours\n\nFirst Time Played.\n\nI'm not usually much of a fan of platformers, but this is such an incredible game.  The best stealth platformer I've ever played.  The cinematics and sound are also very good.  What I really enjoyed is the multiple paths you can take depending on play style.  Kill everyone, or sneak through the tunnels and elude all the enemies.  The choice is yours.  You can also upgrade your skills and choose your loadout.  Tres cool.  Easily recommended.  Game has enough length too to make it worth it.  You can replay new game plus style keeping your equipment and try to maximise your score.  Not my thing, but it is there if you want it. \n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_updated": 1506337479, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506337479, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5694, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "review_score": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 168, "total_reviews": 5862}}
