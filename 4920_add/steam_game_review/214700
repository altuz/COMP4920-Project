This game is weird and I love it. \n\nThere are seriously few games that can hit the note this one does, with its blend of nonsense non-linearity, unabashed smash-cuts and richly coloured surroundings. Lights and sounds blend and overlap in strange ways. strange, plastic people surge around you. those tiny noises that repeat in your mind are brought to life in an continual flow of conciousness. Overwhelmingly, it gives off the feeling of being in a dream or a half forgotten memory; The places you are have a palpable character & feeling to them, be it the oppresive paranoid rush of an airport or the comfortable warmth in a lantern-lit city roof, but the details of where you are or how you got there are often lost. If I had to compare it to anything, I'd say it's a lot like Yume Nikki, or Cat Soup, or a few songs off of Sawako's Madoromi, in how small and personal it can be, plus the drowsy, near-soporiphic (but in a good way) tone it has. I don't think I've ever played a game that so perfectly captures the feeling of waking up at 5pm in the summer, or even tries to.\n\nThis game probably isn't for everyone. It's really damn short, and you can easily blaze through it in 5 minutes or less. However, the length of it is something that doesn't exactly bother me. Actual dreams often get cut off and mixed around and forgotten at both ends, and the game leaves me with a feeling that this is neither the beginning nor the end of what happened here, so it adds to that dreamlike quality for me. Just make sure you know that you're in for a short ride if you buy it. For me, it's like revisitng somewhere in your mind. A recurring dream where you can just drift away and be lost in the whirling colour for a little while. I recommend trying it at 3am, when you're a little sleepy. It can draw you in, that way.", "timestamp_updated": 1499998206, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499998102, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34161391", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502017", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501085181, "steamid": "76561198011972269", "num_games_owned": 1004, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It is an interesting game/experience.
