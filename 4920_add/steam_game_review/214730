Of course, I'm talking about [b]Space Rangers 2: Dominators[/b] and [b]Space Rangers 2: Reboot[/b]. But today I did not find the strength to waste more of my time on this version, and this is why:\n[list]\n    [*]High grind which includes the constant completing of monotonous quests (not text quests) which are usually \u201cgo there and kill\\deliver\\find something\u201d and not interesting space fights. Also, all of them have to be done in a limited time, so you have to check for yourself whether you can fly and complete the task on time and return back to get a reward. \n\n    [*]Lack of a convenient quest log. All that you have is a small panel at the bottom of the screen with pop-up windows. In addition, to find out where you need to go and what to do, you need to reread the unnecessary text. It would be much easier if instead of the text there was a brief description of the quest, as it was done with the information of who and were gave you this quest.\n\n    [*]Absurd dialogues which are written with a lot of Russian jargon, not funny jokes and old memes. Quite often I met dialogs that I think were written by a person who just wanted to joke but did not know how. And with each new version of the game, the number of these dialogues only increased. And finally, in this version, you can find old memes, which few people will know outside of Russia, right in the background. Why?!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1139249326\n    [*]Lack of deep lore. Due to the fact that the dialogues were written by many different people for a long period of time, there is no one solid deep lore which gives some kind of uniqueness to the races. Honestly, i've got a strong filling that writers come up with dialogues at the time of writing, and not worked out them in advance.\n[/list]\nOf course, the game has positive aspects, such as complete freedom of action, a live and interactive world, a good trading system, interesting text quests (I'm talking only about those that were in Space Rangers 2: Dominators, I didn't play in new ones), ground battles, etc. But for me, inappropriate jokes and outdated memes of this version spoil the whole impression of the game.\n\nI wish that the game were more serious and also that the developers hired professional writers, instead of a bunch of fans with a questionable sense of humor.\n\nThis version was developed primarily by fans of the game and is based on a free fan-made mod called [b]Space Rangers 2: Revolution[/b]. So personally I will stick with the original Space Rangers 2: Dominators (even with Reboot version) without any questionable additions and gameplay changes.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1139811847\n[i]P.S. Because of the conflict between the developers, the previous parts of the game (Space Rangers 1 and Space Rangers 2: Reboot) were removed from Steam.[/i]", "timestamp_updated": 1505985905, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505908564, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 392, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 66, "total_reviews": 458}}
