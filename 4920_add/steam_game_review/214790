The games may be free Flash games available on browsers, but some of them also have added updates and content to them, like Time Fcuk for example. There is also plenty of backstory content like QNAs, sketches, and prototypes included with most of the games. There's also plenty of unlockable content like artwork and other Flash based games that are available to play. The games themselves are also very good, most of them have plenty of replay value as well. However, since these are essentially older projects made with Flash, there are performance issues and glitches with some of the games, namely the Meat Boy prototype. I had troubles with it solely because of the terrible input delay. Other than that, I'd say this collection is great for any fan of Edmund McMillen or his games!", "timestamp_updated": 1506659792, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506659792, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 387, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 54, "total_reviews": 441}}
