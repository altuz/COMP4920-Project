You might think to yourself ''why would i ? Isnt that the same game with shitty graphics instead ?'' And the short answer is no and heres why.\n\nChallenge\nThe challenge in this one is wayyy lower then the first one, even on the hardest diffeculty its a cake walk, i only played around 2 hours of it and finished the entire campaign and easter egg levels, in contrary i played black edition for 19~ hours and finished it only once. \n\nLevels\nYes, this game has the same levels but thats exactly the problem... it has the same levels but there are less of them and altough some of the levels have fun surprises for veterans of the first game it simply isnt worth it. The levels used in this game are some of the fan favorites so your gonna have a fun time playing through them however.. worlds in this game exist of only 2 levels before a boss with exception to the first world which has 4/5 levels. This makes the total around 10/11 levels + 4 bosses. The original painkiller had 5 worlds (6 if you count the dlc) which consisted of 4-6 levels each, some of them only playable on nightmare or trauma difficulties. So your essentially playing a watered down version of the first game when it comes to levels.\n\nStory\nThe story is more of the same altough there are a few new cutscenes this time around (some of them pretty fun to watch) but painkiller has never been a story driven game to begin with so this doesnt matter too much.\n\nBosses\nThe bosses in this game are... baffling to me. You see they use the same bosses from the first game (with exception to the last one but more on that later) but they shuffle the order. For example ; instead of swamp thing being the second boss hes the thirs. The bosses are also (Just like the rest of the game) made easier. For the final boss however i was pleasently surprised ; the final boss is a completely new one (altough his arena is the same as the chapter 6 boss from the original) and is actually quite fun to fight.\n\nWeapons\nThe weapons in this game are the same as in the original +1 new weapon.. theres only 1 difference theyre unusable. Simply put your melee weapon in the game is wayyy stronger then the guns AND it heals you for 3 hp every time you hit a enemy with it, this is a shame since i enjoyed the weaponry in the original gun. For the new gun... its okay the design is cool and the idea that it can turn enemies into friends is a fun one but why would you use it if the melee weapons ends them in a matter of seconds ?\n\nSo would i recommend this game ? No not at all, i would recommend the original game but not this one. Not only is the original longer, its also cheaper and has a higher challenge. The only thing i would reccomend in this version of the game is the new boss but... is it really worth paying and playing an entire game for ? That choice is yours. \n\nI would rate this game :\n4/10 Not complete garbage but just.. unneeded.", "timestamp_updated": 1505655436, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505655269, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 365, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 154, "total_reviews": 519}}
