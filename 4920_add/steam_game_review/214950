The map is nice, the historical period is amazing, and the battle system is very nice. However, the game is shalow. It is quite easy to play, and as you grow bigger it gets even easier. The building system is very easy to learn, and you can easily outsmart the AI in battle. Upping the difficulty to make the AI get a ton of legions, be super aggresive and have buffed unit stats is possible, but I recommend another option. \n\nMods: \nThere are a ton of mods for this game, produced by a still very active modding community. I would highly recommend playing this game with one of the two major overhaul mods: Divide et Impera, or Radious. Both add depth to the game, but my preference goes to DeI, which I'm currently playing with. Everything is overhauled in this mod, new historical units, the AI is better, there is a supply system and a population system. For me DeI adds the depth that I missed in the basegame, and since its enterily free I highly recommend you to use it. \nThere are also graphical mods that make the game look nicer (I recommend GEM and Aztec lighting), and a ton of smaller mods, with which you can customize the game entirely to your taste. I would say that a fully customized Rome 2 can be a very good game, and since its entirely free, I do recommend getting the game. \n\nDLC's:\nThe DLC's are generally not worth the money, except when they are on sale (I bought mine 75% off), and you specifically want to play some faction. The DLC's are not needed to have a good experience with this game, and I would only buy them if you have played quite a lot of hours, and want to try out some new factions or campaign maps.", "timestamp_updated": 1506940932, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506940932, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35132982", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1451061033, "steamid": "76561198137270978", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The technical part remains somewhat problematic, but the rest of the game is of outstanding quality.

Waited a couple of years for Rome 2 to be patched up after all the fuss over the shoddy state of it at release. Got it for a steal on special. Still can't recommend it. Why? It's mostly because of the warscape engine: on the battlescape unit and army station keeping and pathfinding is just attrocious. A collection of units sent somewhere, whether grouped together or not, will all head off in tangential directions - and that's when there aren't even any obstacles in the way for them to get confused by. You are constantly having to select each unit individually and give \"not there stupid! over here!\" orders. Apart from that the interface (campaign and battle) just feels... soulless.  Yes I only have 22 hrs on record. I know well what a Total War game is, I'm sure I've spent over 1,000 hrs of my life on past titles (Steam and pre-Steam). I just couldn't stomach spending any more of my time on this one.

This series took a hit with a sub-par Empire edition, but rebounded maginificently with Shogun 2, which I still play fairly frequently even after 6 years.  Rome 2, however, is a bit of a let down for me.  First, I was hoping CA would take the franchise in an unexplored direction, like possibly the 3 Kingdoms era or 30 Years War, or Great Northern War, or Mongols (not as a sidebar to Medieval, but as the focus of the game).  Yet the 'C' in CA seems to have run its course.  There are so many other eras of history they could've zeroed in on, but I guess that dead horse named Rome hasn't been beat enough.  Secondly, they actually had some great concepts in this game, but simply underexecuted.  Overall, the game is OK, but CA isn't supposed to be putting out OK stuff so this one really had me bummed.\n\nThey attempted to introduce a degree of role playing by increasing the importance of generals.  Armies are led by generals.  The practice of building leaderless armies as was allowed in previous TWs is no longer possible.  I'm OK with and even prefer a design where the leaders are so important you develop a bit of an emotional tie (like ROTK VIII or XIII).  I found dealing with leaders and worrying about all their stats and how it affects the area to be more of a distraction.  IN the end the leader was no more than a face with some associated numbers.  You can succeed in all aspects of the game with not so great leaders and I eventually stopped wasting time considering what leaders to put in charge.  I just clicked the first one my pointer fell on.  \n\nI was also fairly excited over the idea that there are multiple political factions within the overall faction.  I didn't realize when I started playing that I would actually have situations where I put another faction's leader in charge of my Armies.  They tried to implement something akin to the intra-factional rivalries like they had in the first Rome.  I think the first Rome (fantastic game by the way) had it right.  Just make the intra faction rivals into their own playable faction.  If we're going to recycle old ideas might as well recycle some of the good ones.  I still have yet to see a civil war start in any campaign I've played or even any slight negative affect from having another faction's leader in run my Army.  I'm just not sure what the point was to the way they did it.\n\nAnother issue with the leaders is you only get so many slots to form a legion.  Again, I think they did this to improve the role playing aspect.  So, if you build a strong economy, get super wealthy, and think you're going to build a bunch of armies you will be suprised to see that you in fact cannot build all the armies you want.  This is actually a ridiculous restriction considering how the Romans raised and lost and raised and lost and raised and lost armies when Hannibal went on his Rock the Vote Tour in Italy.\n\nThe 'Hero' agent also seemed pretty cool at first.  But that turned out to just be another icon on the board to account for and increase the time you spend managing details on each turn.  The heroes are interesting, but ultimately their payoff is too minimal and unexciting.  I think an excellent improvement to the hero agent would be if once inserted into your army they were actually associated with a specific unit and given certain boosts and abilities to that unit and other units within a given proximity to that unit.  Other than that, they act more like saboteurs/shinobi type guys who degrade an enemy's army.  They've just taken previous agent functionality and wrapped it in a new skin.  \n\nThe buidling tree is typical of what you see in other similar games, just packaged differently.  But I do enjoy the variety in the buildings and the ability to assign developmental focuses in different provinces.  I appreciate the fact that I can't conquer an area 500 miles from Rome and immediately start recruiting high quality legionnaires.  \n\nThe naval combat in Rome started out very fun.  I loved ramming my enemy's ships.  But after awhile it became repetitive.  Overall I still like the naval combat, but the novelty wore off quick.  Even better, I love the fact I can land my ships on shore and use my crew as an Army.  That is an excellent feature I believe they got right.\n\nAgain, you will have fun playing this game at least in your first few campaigns.  It isn't a bad game.  It's just that my expectations for the Total War Series are very high and this fell well short.  I would not recommend this game simply because CA needs to be sent a message that customers aren't going to accept a product that largely pieces different aspects of previous games together and only scratches the surface of that increasingly meaningless first word of their name.  \n\nIf their Company name was Status Quo Assembly, this would be a fantastic game and I'd give it five stars.  Even more shameful is I see it's still on Steam for the full $59.99, as if it were ever worthy of a premium game release price.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1505082959, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505082959, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34939705", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506322", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505348522, "steamid": "76561198039103558", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I used to like this game, but that has all changed once i started playing shogun 2.
