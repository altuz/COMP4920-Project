This game never got the attention it deserved, and it's sad. \nIn all seriousness though, this game is [i]FANTASTIC.[/i] Not only that, but the soundtrack is amazing. The boss fights are amazing, and the game is a crazy metal slug-ish joyride of fun. The game gives you the feeling of nostalgia you got from when you played flash games when you were younger. This game is just 10 bucks too (as of 6/26/2017 on the Steam Summer Sale it is $3.00 and is COMPLETELY worth it.)\nIf you aren't sure (which you should be because again this is AMAZING) just play the demo. The demo doesn't lie about anything. You get to play the first crazy action packed level and go through the first boss for free. It gives you a good idea of what the game feels like. You should seriously pick this up.

It does what it needs to do, and that is get you to have fun shooting a shitload of ammo. \n\nMovements can get weird at times and objects and debris can and WILL get in your path and shoots, preventing you from killing enemies and moving to avoid getting hit. \nNeeds a lot of work on the movement part, as it can get clunky (especially while riding the wolfs) and would like a way to go down a platform whitout needing to go to the edge, fall, and move bak inside.\nHard mode is not hard enough, just a few more enemies here and there. Enemies can be killed just as easy no matter what difficulty you are playing in.\nWould love to see more variety of weapons and/or upgrading system. As it is, I stopped using the pistol after I got the SMG (I guess, not sure), which is in the first minute, and then the rifle a couple levels after. Also granade launcher doesn't do much damage to big enemies and range is too short for my liking.\n\nThis isn't metal slug or contra, but it still entertained me for a day until I got all the achievements. Beat the game 3 times as well. I do reccommend it, despite all the flaws.", "timestamp_updated": 1499327361, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499327361, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32912036", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501416", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1447992229, "steamid": "76561198026089591", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Buy this game!
