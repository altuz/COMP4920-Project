The tracks themselves are very linear and don't have the same fluid speed and awesome backgrounds of similar entries. The combat / shooting mechanics feel particularly shoddy, with weapons being frantically-used and not very cool to look at when activated. The track designs generally consist of clumsily running into arches  which restrict your movement throughout the racing lane. Stray too far left or right and you come to an abrupt halt after running into some of the arches. To its credit, some of the ship designs are cool and the music is decent, but if you're looking for a fun futuristic racer, there are better options available. Save your money."}, {"votes_down": 17, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1324767625, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487496", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "3933021", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029305165", "num_reviews": 81, "last_played": 1324713600, "num_games_owned": 6697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3}, "timestamp_updated": 1324767625, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Support Serbian devs!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1474448334, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "25615856", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198072431491", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1483294400, "num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 32}, "timestamp_updated": 1474448334, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Once  you learn the courses, master the controls and work out the weapons this game is great fun looks good with interesting tracks it can be hard to see were your going at times but not if you play it in 3d  i use iz3d and it looks amazing as if it was made for it.
