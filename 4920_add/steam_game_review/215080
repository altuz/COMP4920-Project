I was simply addicted to their main MMO, Dofus, and I could just not take it anymore. They're the worst company I have ever seen.\n\nSupport is non existent, for once. If you issue is more complicated than a password reset, support will NOT help you. You will often have to reopen your closed tickets several times for the support to actually read your message. Most of their answers are some copy pasted crap that does not fit your issue at all.\n\nSecond, and it's not so bad in itself compared to the other stuff, their updates don't make any sense at all. Tomorrow they might decide they change the whole game without consulting the community and they'll just roll with it. One ''funny'' moment was when they lost half of their player base deciding to switch from version 1.29 to 2.0 on their main PC game, Dofus. There was no options to stay on the old game, they just switched everything over and RIP. Let's not talk about how they willingly ruined 1v1 PVP, or how they keep making the same mistakes over and over without ever improving (rollbacks, awful class changes, awful mechanic changes, etc.)\n\nWhich leads me to my third point, which made me delete their games. They sometimes throw events out where you get 2 times the xp, drop, etc etc. Pretty cool, uh? Everyone makes sure they barely sleep at all to play as much as possible and farm like hell. But what they did recently was just too much. A player found a way to generate their in-game cash shop items for free (please note that the items in themselves were not generating any value outside cosmetics and that they were linked for 3 months to the account that bought them). This was on Tuesday, and was noticed by the staff on friday. The issue was leaked in the whole community, and Ankama was well aware of the issue. No communication on their end, however (like usual) and the double week end went on. Everyone played the game like mad monkeys, my friends and myself included. We didn't sleep. We did some incredible things, pushed several characters to the ultimate level and generated for $1500 worth of in-game currency (legitely).\n\nWell, when the week-end ended, they rollbacked everything up to friday morning. Not only did they wiped, without warning, all the player's efforts, they did not wipe everything that was generated because of the bug. No apologies, and they did not answer to alternative ways players bringed up (which were pleeeentiful and legitimate ways to fix the bug). They do that at least 2 times a year since they exist. If you ask for a compensation for a very specific item that dropped when you have 1% of getting it, and worth $400... The support will say too bad for you pal.\n\nThey're just lazy, and don't care about you. They only care about what you're going to inject in their cash shop. There's so many games out there that are great and are worth your time. I don't recommend you give it or any money to Ankama. You can google their reviews yourself, starting with ''rollback'', and have a good laugh.\n\nOh, that and Wakfu's dying with no plans on reviving it.\n\nRIP.", "timestamp_updated": 1485995146, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "9", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485995146, "votes_down": 32}, {"recommendationid": "29659590", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537734", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504564830, "steamid": "76561198119499365", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 22102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "One of the most innovative and fun mmos I have played/seen EVER. I can't name a single other rpg where I even slighly cared about the economics or in-game politics, both of which were done so even the casual player easily understands the situation your country is in and even motivates you to get involved for rewards. The combat system, while generic, is fun enough with cool animations, decent enemy AI, and the moderate variety of skills you had at your disposal. \n\nHowever, the game is a buggy mess, the devs never listen, and somehow most updates make the game worse. The update that finally turned me away was sometime last year when the entire skill tree and progression system was gutted. Previously you earned skills in a certain tree by using skills in that tree, giving you freedom to build your character however you want and experiment. This update took that away and instead you stiffly and slowly go through all of the skills in all of your trees as you gain player level instead of the level of your skills. This basically tripled the level you need to be to get the skill loadout you want. Overall the game can be described as a mountain of wasted potential that continues to rot. But at least its free.\n\n[EDIT]\nLonging for the good ol' days, I might still play this from time to time because of a faint hope that the devs might get out of their own asses but also because there's still absolutely nothing like it (mostly because it's not trying to be WoW)", "timestamp_updated": 1507154526, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486081760, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "30088258", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539012", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500264381, "steamid": "76561198039318211", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 17097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Update: Server Merge postponed till the end of the year, as usual 0 discussion of how they are going to deal with the economy after the merge...
