The steam version itself is ok... Not the best definately not, but not the worst either. It is a pixel-ish game. So if graphics are a big thing for you, RO is not for you. RO is possibly one of my favorite RPGs of all time. Not just from nostalgia alone, but there are certain decisions Gravity made that was just amazing. Here are some of them:\n\n-You don't have to chose your class immediately.\n  -- it's a small design factor since you do go to a class system, but having the player wait till lvl 10 to get a class makes all     that grinding a bit better. You grind in every RPG, but knowing that that grind can really change your character progression in a more significant way than just a few skills and attributes for your already established class. \n-Player to player trade is encouraged with the merchant class\n  -- This is a big factor to me since it gives all that dead space worth something. Most MMORPGs have this grand city, with only 30-40% actually relevant. Having a AH does make trading simpler, but less exciting in my opinion. Since selling your stuff to another player is best with the merchant class, most guilds have at least one, and most players have at least one character that is a merchant, and you kinda do it with a stall in the city street, and since you dont want to be an a$$ the city streets have more purpose than simple pathways.\n \nRO is beyond its peak. I can say that out loud, but theres no doubt it is a great MMORPG.
