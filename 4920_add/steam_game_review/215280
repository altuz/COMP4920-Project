I\u2019ll use a metaphor to try to explain to you what this game looks like.\n \nLet\u2019s say Bob and Patrick go to a restaurant and both order a steak. They wait a little bit and here it goes, they get their plates with a steak on it and a fork to eat it. \n\nBob never went to a restaurant before. He got a steak, it was juicy, the cocking was good but a fork alone to eat it was a little bit tricky but yeah, he enjoyed himself and is happy with it.\n\nPatrick on the other hand already ordered a steak in a restaurant and he knows that, first, a knife would be helpful, second, when you order a steak, you don\u2019t only get a steak but potatoes with it, third, the fork tend to bend when he uses it and, fourth the burr mill for the salt is really hard to use and demand a lot of effort. So, he begins to complain but the owner says to him that the fork will be fixed eventually, the knife is not available anymore, the potatoes will follow for free but he had to wait for them and he can pay a lot for already grounded salt or a little to get some oil to lubricate the mill.\n\nThen Patrick looks at the nearby table and sees that Sandy is enjoying a good steak with potatoes, a bendy fork and a knife and she does'nt struggle with the salt but, instead she struggles with the pepper. So, Patrick asks the owner why Sandy has all of those. The owner says that he could get that too but if he chooses this option, his fork will never be fixed and he will never have a dessert, even if it was promised years ago.\n\nAnd last, Patrick says the owner that he has a fidelity card but the owner stops him right away and tell him that those are not valid anymore.\n\nNow the analogies, the steak is the story of the Secret World Legends (SWL) and The Secret World (TSW). The fork is SWL\u2019s gameplay and fork + knife is TSW\u2019s gameplay. The bending are the bugs in both games. The potatoes are all the DLC. Salt is the grind for better stuff in SWL and pepper is grind of aegis in TSW, they are the same but for some reason, people are complaining about one and not the other. The buyable salt is the cash shop, the oil is the patron subscription. The fidelity card represents the old TSW character. And finally, the dessert is the season two of SWL. Bob and Patrick are playing SWL and Sandy is playing TSW. Bob never played TSW but Patrick did.\n\nPatrick is pissed because he knows everything he lost by being forced to play SWL to get the desert and doesn\u2019t understand why the menu has been spoil to add the desert to the menu. The dessert could have been added without spoiling the menu like the owner promised him years ago. Bob is pleased because it\u2019s a brand new cool story for him, he doesn\u2019t know that knifes exist and he get a dessert for free. Both can be pissed by the price of the grounded salt and oil. There are some pleased Patrick out there too.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m a TSW Veteran and I\u2019m definitively a Patrick. So, my advice is: play for the story, don\u2019t give Funcom money and wait for season 2.\n\nTLDR: This game is failure not because of what it is but because of what it could have been.", "timestamp_updated": 1505171358, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504950590, "votes_down": 18}, {"recommendationid": "34812833", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502731", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1473344332, "steamid": "76561198047793806", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The Secret World Legends is a \"reboot\" of the Secret World, a game that was pretty good for an MMO rpg, even though the updates to the game were released only so often.\n\nSecret World Legends is basically the same game after the reboot, but does nothing better on any front. In fact, it does a lot of things worse than the original making it strictly worse than the original. Yes, I am talking about the abilities, passives and the combat in general. No update to the graphics or sounds or to the music was made, even the engine is the same old and problematic dreamworld that came with the original game. The game is simply gimped/dumbed down from the original version.\n\nOf course since it is \"free to play\" it has micro transactions and as usual with The Secret World, the progression of the player is intentionally slowed down by a lot. This was already a problem in the original TSW so nothing is new, except the fact that you can use real money to circumvent the slow pace and \"boost\" yourself up to the speed. On top of this, of course the veterans who had grinded the original game for years also got nothing from their grind and their characters were basically reseted having to start the work done in all those years they played from the scratch.\n\nWant to get back to your former glory? Nope, you will not, not fast at least, unless you give us even more money than you used (I should use wasted here to be honest) in the past.\n\nAnyway in the end, if you are a new player and want to give this a try, go for it as it is free to play. Just don't give them any money because you never know what might happen in the future.

Even after that new content was added, the game really only has about a month worth of content to experience, even for a casual player.  Don't get me wrong, it's great content... the story is fantastic, with great missions that go far beyond the menial tasks that pass for quests in most MMOs.  How will the game die this time around?  Read on and find out.\n\nHowever, where the relaunch really dooms this game is in the new equipment system.  You won't notice it at first, but once you get about half way through the content your progress grinds to a halt.  Equipment progress is based on an exponentially increasing grind, where you can quickly upgrade an item from the starting green quality to blue quality, you do this by feeding your equipment other equipment, combining them together to add experience to your items.  Once you've gotten a green item to level 20, which takes about 40 other items, you have to fuse that item together with another green level 20 item of the same type, and this creates a blue level 1 item.  Now you have to repeat the previous process, leveling your blue item up to level 25, and then fusing it with another level 25 blue item of the same type... of course, the blue item requires significantly more experience, meaning you have to feed it significantly more items.\n\nSo now you've gotten your two level 25 blue items, you fuse them together and get a purple item... now the REAL grind begins.  At this point, you're going to have to level two purple items of the same type to level 30... but now it's going to take you hundreds of items just to level up one of them.  But wait!  You're not even half way through the item's progress at this point... you've got two more quality levels to go!  All of these levels also cost shards, and shards are the currency you get, in very limited numbers, as mission rewards and from selling items to vendors (at 250 to 500 shards each).\n\nLet's break down exactly what you need to fully level up a single item at red quality.\n2 level 35 orange items of the same type, with a total of 350,000 experience each, and 28,000 shards each\n4 level 30 purple items of the same type, with a total of 75,000 experience each, and 18,000 shards each\n8 level 25 blue items of the same type, with a total of 12,500 experience each, and 10,000 shards each\n16 level 20 green items of the same type, with a total of 4000 experience each, and 4000 shards each\n\nThe red item will have a max level of 70, requiring 250,000 experience per level... 17,500,000 experience total, plus 1000 shards per level.  You may ask, \"but how much experience do you get per item that you feed to your equipment?\"  Well, the answer to that is... 200 to 400 experience.  To fully level up a single item, you're going to have to feed it approximately 170,000 items.  Yes.  One hundred and seventy thousand.\n\nThis is a process that you will repeat for two weapons and seven talismans.  There are also signets and glyphs that are inserted into those items, and signets and glyphs go through the exact same gear grind that your equipment does, feeding other signets and glyphs into them to level those up.\n\nThere are some items called distallates, which are basically just item experience that you can inject directly into the item without a cost in shards... these generally have about the same experience value of a few items, however, they do not stack in your inventory, and your inventory slots are severely limited, so hording them isn't really an option.  In reality, this doesn't really speed up the process in the grand scheme of things.\n\nThey're expecting you to put years of work into a game with a month of content.  It's also largely unnecessary, there is absolutely no point in playing the game beyond experiencing the story a single time.  Even so, they decided to add 10 difficulty levels to the limited amount of group content, with higher levels being locked behind a number... that number is your item power (the combined level and quality of your items).  As your item power increases, you also get locked out of lower difficulty levels... the result of all this is a segregated player base in which group finder queues can become multiple hours of waiting for enough people of your item level to be around.  As the player base drops in number, which is already happening rapidly, we're going to end up with a game where even the few people that are online won't be able to group together... it is designed to kill the game.\n\nThis is a grind that would make the stingiest Korean MMO blush with shame... it's as oppressive as it gets.  I can only recommend this game for people to play through once, experience the story, but skip the grind... it's just not worth it and there is no big payoff at the end.  Don't expect any meaningful amount of new content to be added to the game either... the development team is smaller than most independent studios, and they are currently just stringing the player base along by slowly releasing content that existed in The Secred World years ago.  \n\nBottom line, this relaunch is a short term cash grab before the game goes back into maintenance mode and dies for good.", "timestamp_updated": 1506910727, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506910727, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "34887304", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505879", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499732241, "steamid": "76561198055788212", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 28947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First off I never write these things. This is my first. I feel like this needs to be said.\n\nIf you have never played the secret world then go for it. The story is one of the best you will find in any game. I played to the end of the first part, solomon island and story has not changed.  And if you don't know how much more indepth the first game was gameplay wise you wont know what you are missing. \n\nNow that aside the game is bad. They took their old system and dumbed it down to the point there is nolonger any strategy to the game. The new systems they did add are annoying and gimmicky. I used to spend hours trying to figure out what skills worked best with what passives and now thats all gone because the passives don't work on other weapons. So basicly using a hammer passive to make your shotgun do better is out or using a blood passive to make your elemental attack heal you is also out. They used to have skills that were things like strikes, blast, chains, and so on. The passives went off if they were the kind of attack not the weapon so a hammer passive that ups blasts would work on a shotgun skill that uses blasts. I could go on for hours about the builds but you get the point, Now none of thats there. Its shotgun passives help shotguns.\n\nThen comes the blatant cash grab that the game has become. Want to farm instances for gear better be ready to pay for keys. Want to unlock all the weapons, better be ready to spend weeks working on it or pay for it with real money. And I mean just to use them not unlock all the skills. Which I guess is a lot simpler now because there are a lot less skills in the dumbed down skill system. \n\nAnd the final strike comes in the form of the way it treats old players. I have a ton of hours in the old game and all that amounted to was unlocking the weapons and some clothes. What they are doing is basicly kicking all the long time players to the curb while trying to draw in players with an attention span of a gold fish.

It is a final attempt to try and save the game. The aurum-based model is incredibly insulting, and the skill system changes are above and beyond terrible.

They might as well have canned the game, it was fine in it's old form.  This company has lost me on this game but not some of their other games, the whole problem being that the company does not have a great track record with consistency and they tend to over time make their products seem too mediocre.\n\nNegative review for how the company disrespected it's older client base in wiping their old characters instead of adjusting them, and how they made the system for combat so limited I can no longer fight effectively with the limits on energy for moves.

Unfixed bugs and glitches permeated the game from front to back and top to bottom and beginning to end.  Sadly, in this newest incarnation, Secret World Legends,  has become a third rate game from the technical aspect.  Many of the bugs and glitches from TSW have made their way into SWL and in some ways they have gotten even worse.  So on the sloppy technical side of this game I cannot recommended it.  There literally is no valid excuse for bugs that have existed from day one of TSW to still be present in the revamped SWL.\n\nBut, like the TSW, the game's story, the game's setting, the game's visual appeal, and the game's lore still set itself apart from other MMOs and one should be able to recommend it base on those alone.   And, to a certain extent, the game's narrative does a lot to overcome many of the technical shortcomings.  It certainly is feasable to to play the game and deal with these bugs and glitches to experience the game's setting and lore.  \n\nWhat really breaks this game for me now is the free to play model.  For starters the free to play model is a serious grind.  That in and of itself isn't so bad, but the biggest problem is that when you subscribe it doesn't do much to alleviate that grind.    I am half way through a one month subscription purrchase and I can say with all honesty it isn't worth it. \n\nAbout the only true benefit of subscribing is getting double AP/XP handed out, boosted a little bit by a 10% XP bonus.  So you get twice the AP/SP rewards (skill points to increase and progress you abilities) and you get them handed out a slightly faster intervals.  Sounds great right?  Well, it does help you progress up the skill tree faster but teh skill tree is only half the battle against the grind.\n\nThe other half are weapons and talismans.  These are what actually boost the effectiveness of your skills.  Two weapons and like 6 talismans that you can gather and wear while using extras you find to fuse into your current gear to make them mor epowerful.  So no found gear ever gets wasted.  A pretty neat idea.  Subscriptions boost your ability to advance you weapons and talismans by providing you with one cache key (the games loot crates) every day.  You're  guarenteed to get something that will boost a weapon or a talisman or a glyph or a signet.  That's really not too bad either, except the cache key is a daily login reward., meaning you have to log in and claim that key every single day.  If you miss 4 days of logging in you lose those 4 keys. That is utter bull.  On top of that you can only claim the key for one character, so if you have multiple characters then all the others will get screwed.  A subscription should treat all characters you play equally and this just doesn't cut it.\n\nBut the worst thing is that there are things that should be covered with a subscription that aren't.  The most egregious example is that the fastest level of sprinting, Sprinting V, can only be purchased with Aurum, the in game currency you buy with real cash.   You CAN grind for Aurum because Aurem can be bought with an excessive amout of marks of favor (currency you earn through challenges and auction house sales) but that can get to be up to a months worth of work just to get one decent thing.  You also can't increase your bank space unless you buy aurum.\n\nOn top of this idiotic currency divide the outfits in the game are separated by currencies as well.  Outside of of clothing awarded by achievements clothing costs either aurum or marks of favor, but never both and teh division of what requires what seems arbitray for the most part.  In several cases to complete one whole set will require both aurum and marks of favor because different pieces of the outfit use require a different currency to buy.\n\nA subscription also nets you bonus dungeon keys, lair keys or whatever, and only an 8 hour cooldown on missions instead of like 3 days.  I find those insignificant because I don't run dungeons or lairsand the repeating of missions, which was included because of the community wanting it back in TSW, has now become an almost necessary part of progression (grinding for marks of favor and gear to use for leveling equipment).\n\nI cannot recommend Secret World Legends on the sheer fact that Funcom does not respect your time invested nor your money spent.  The setting and narrative are still as wonderful as they have always been, but no better.  The state of teh game on a technical level has seen some minor improvements in some areas, but is still mostly garbage code with bugs and glitches throughout most of the game. which you WILL run into.  You could easily expect one bug or glitch every hour, many more if you are actually paying attention.\n\nYou can play this game for its setting and story alone if the story is all you want and you don't mind having to work for it a bit, but if you want more then a subscription alleviates some of that work, though nowhere near as much as it shold.  \n\nMy time and my money are valuable to me, but Funcome doesn't think so and refuses to respect both so I am taking them elsewhere once my current  subscription is up.", "timestamp_updated": 1507111562, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507111073, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2095, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 661, "total_reviews": 2756}}
