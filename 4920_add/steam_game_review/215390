Its's arcade style, but you can fly it with a joystick or gamepad. The game makers put a lot of effort in the missions.  Some of them seem to actually have a historical source. In this game you get to dogfight in multiple World War 2 fighters. You can even choose to get into an Axis fighter to fight the Japanese. Also nice are the multiple views like 3rd person, from the hood of a plane or  cockpit view. So you can always choose what you like. This game has a full campagne coop. Yes people you can play this game with 3 online team mates. So I had many hours of double fun with this game. \n\nCons: The game always starts with me in windowed mode. Also I have to adjust the settings for my screen in game all the times when I start this game. These are just minor bugs and more a nuisance then a real burdon. Also the volume in the game is quite loud making it difficult to hear my mates on teamspeak. So before I start this game I have to adjust the volume settings in Teamspeak. Also a minor bug. \n\nAll and all a very good game with nice graphics. It brought me back into the fierce combat  of World War 2 Pacific theatre. Definitely a good bang(s) for a bug.", "timestamp_updated": 1385415682, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1354492659, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "12839219", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506060", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1476523261, "steamid": "76561198006411483", "num_games_owned": 811, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Console port style controls.
