I played and quite enjoyed this game before it got taken down, and now that it's back on Steam, I feel somewhat obliged to put in a good word for it after all these guys have been through.\n\nThis is a genre mashup between twin-stick bullet hell and \"Zuma\"-style match-3, and it actually works. I love it when a mashup actually works like this. Add in some creepy organic visuals (think of Metroid Prime\u2019s title screen), a surprisingly great soundtrack, and surprisingly good voice acting, and you\u2019ve got one solid, decent game here.\n\nYou play as a microscopic probe performing tests on plasma samples that are swarming with alien cells. The cells will attack you like an immune system. Shooting at them will sometimes yield colored blocks, which you can pick up and fire into the level\u2019s unusually colorful DNA chain. Score enough clears on the DNA chain, and you win the level. Take too long, and you\u2019ll likely get swarmed by alien organisms and die. Interestingly, when holding a cube, the alien cells believe you are one of them, and you will become temporarily invulnerable as you are given a few seconds\u2019 reprieve from the bullet hell madness to aim your shot. \n\nThe game features a ridiculously deep upgrade system. Using EXP you earn, you can upgrade a few dozen aspects of your probe, like shot power, speed while holding a cube, speed at which you shoot cubes, health and energy capacity, energy recharge rate, extra weapons \u2013 all kinds of stuff. And the real cool part is that you can go back to previous levels anytime you want to complete level objectives you might have missed, which can give very high EXP bonuses. And if going back to unlock more upgrades isn\u2019t enough to relieve the difficulty, the game is also thoughtful enough to feature two separate difficulty toggles, one for the match-3 aspect and one for the shooter aspect.\n\nIf I had to take off points for anything, it would have to be for the way some stylistic aspects of this game don\u2019t seem to add up. The idea is that the game is taking place underneath a microscope, so it makes some sense that the gameplay would feel surreal; movement feels a bit strange and things like explosion sound effects are believably muffled by the plasma. However, this doesn\u2019t excuse the lack of good tactile feedback when taking damage \u2013 you only get a barely-audible sound effect when colliding with an enemy, which you might not even notice as your health drains away. And despite the fact that enemy deaths and taking damage are sorely missing proper SFX, the game sees fit to throw in some silly sounds that nearly break suspension of disbelief, such as a \u201cpew pew pew\u201d when some cells fire at you, a \u201cbeep\u201d sound when hitting switches, or the sound of shattering glass when you clear matches in the DNA chain.\n\nOverall, I give the game a 7.5 / 10 for great visuals, great music, suitable difficulty options, and for a successful presentation of a novel idea. I also found it a great game for achievement hunting, providing a nice spaced-out variety of challenging objectives, some of which might make you rage for a dozen tries or so, but are very doable with skill and practice. I wouldn\u2019t call it one of my favorite games, but it definitely deserves to be back on Steam, and I\u2019m very happy that Alkemi might finally get to see some long-overdue appreciation for their work.", "timestamp_updated": 1472259359, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1472202321, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "1447578", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502694", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1374181036, "steamid": "76561197993331817", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Transcripted - an amazing symbiosis Zuma and Scrolling Shooter.
