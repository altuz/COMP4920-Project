The game ran fine, but nothing about it made it seem like a worthwhile endeavor.  The lack of polish recalled  PlayStation 2 ports that were rushed to Market before 3D games were truly understood.\n\nI am not adverse to low budget games, I have to make this clear.   I have played several games on Steam that I picked up for $5 or less, released by Indie Developers, on evidently limited budgets...  a couple of these titles were very cheesy endeavors, but still good games with decent stories.  (Blood Knights, Marlow Briggs, Hunted-The Demons Forge - specifically)\n\nTruthfully, I'm not hard to please...  give me a good bro shooter, or a God of War clone, and I will be entertained, I do not need every game I play to be perfect.\n\nBut on this one the developers just seemed lazy, in early encounters four legged enemies rotated on an axis, independent of their animations, to face me in combat.  The environments were  crudely conceived, the character movement janky.  Graphics seemes buggy, even when not.\n\nThe reason I am writing this, is because of other reviews praising the story...  While some intruiging concept may be brought forth later in the game, what I witnessed was fumbling cheese.  (A brother and sister bored of their fathers admonitions \"never to mix their blood\", yet who by adulthood did not bother to find out why)  I just failed to see the strength of the story.  And that DOES matter to me.\n\nIs it the worst thing ever?  No.  Digital homicide bad?  No. But...  Don't let the fan-boy reviews make you think this game is Skyrim or anything nearly worth the asking price.\n\nIf you buy it, deep, DEEP discount.  (This is one of 2 games I have ever bothered refunding.)\n\n2/10", "timestamp_updated": 1505506478, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505486222, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 91, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 45, "total_reviews": 136}}
