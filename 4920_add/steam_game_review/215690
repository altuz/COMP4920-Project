Not recommended even on sale if you haven't played Zeno Clash.\n\nLength - unsure.\n\nHad high expectation since Zeno Clash was so fun. This game unfortunately falls flat. I applaud the devs in making the fighting system deeper, however the AI is too poor to force you to use it, and the system itself is actually a tad clunky to begin with. Controls aren't really tight at all, something that's needed in a type of game like this.\n\nPros\nInteresting setting and world\nNice varied characters\n\nCons\nVoice acting\nFighting system, which is the core of the game", "timestamp_updated": 1506305481, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506305439, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35022511", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478945", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1474203406, "steamid": "76561198195614858", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 7, "review": "This game makes me cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed", "timestamp_updated": 1505651843, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505651843, "votes_down": 13}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 215, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 46, "total_reviews": 261}}
