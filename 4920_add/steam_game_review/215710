Why?\n1) it is obviously a tablet game. That means there aren't many functions, everything is realy big and the gameplay is very slow. The first level after the tutorial takes 50 waves and there isn't even a \"next wave\" button, only fast forward but it still takes far too long to end it.\n2) It has micro transactions although it costs 10\u20ac and that is definitely a rip off. You need the coins to unlock new towers or helpful ingame items. And if you don't want to invest money you have to connect it to facebook and twitter and that is one thing I don't appreciate when you are indirectly be forced to do some \"free advertising\" for a game.\n3) The enemies are very one dimensional. That means the only get faster or more health and as the waves progress they just get more health over time. So you are fighting the same enemies over and over again.\n\nIn my opinion you might be still able to enjoy it but I don't think it can be long-lasting.\nIf there would be a possibility to install steam games on a tablet then I might play it more often.", "timestamp_updated": 1475949651, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1475949651, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "2650524", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1375353492, "steamid": "76561198010500057", "num_games_owned": 4755, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "pretty good little game this one", "timestamp_updated": 1375353686, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1375353686, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "25586315", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1474289871, "steamid": "76561198029760969", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Hours of endless fun for 10 bucks?

Obviously aimed at mobile money markets with microtransactions removed for PC, this is definitely the worst tower defense game I've played in several years. Generic cartoony graphics don't even attempt to hide the lack of originality or character (but still somehow the game has long load times even on 2500k @ 4ghz, GTX 780, 16gb DDR3, and SSD). The levels, characters, and art design are generic flash TD fodder and have not a single iota of verve, originality, or even competence. \n\nSeriously, I wonder if all the other products that this game rips off even realize it? For example I bet Valve doesn't realize that they stole the TF2 Heavy model and animations almost verbatim (plus the TF2 soldier model and anims, just to name two), and several other models and animations have been copied slavishly from other titles. There are almost no options in the game for anything whatsoever. As far as I can tell there is no hotkey to instantly restart a level, or to bring up the normal ESC menu with the normal options. Apparently you have to click on it, because if you hit ESC it instantly asks you if you want to quit the game. Clueless, greedy, incompetent mobile devs. Yuck.\n\nBeyond the simplistic mobile approach and total lack of creativity, competency, or imagination, the worst failing of Fieldrunners 2 is that it's built entirely around the worst TD grind mechanics you can imagine, and they're all hidden invisibly underneath a layer of flash/mobile simplicity. The waves are seemingly endless, randomly thrown together without thought, and invisibly leveled in HP while still using the same models and animations, with no indication that the enemies are gaining massive amounts of HP. There is no \"next wave\" button or indication of what the next wave comprises. One of the earliest levels has 50, yes FIFTY equally boring and generic waves, most of which comprised identical looking enemies whose HP scaled invisibly up to the moon. Who likes that? Maybe someone on mobile who has never seen a tower defense game, but even then only for the first hour or two. \n\nI get that the game sucks and grinds purely to drive microtransactions, but I rebel against this negative approach to game design. It creates enemies out of your customers and generally makes people hate you. -I- personally hate you, Subatomic Studios, for this game. You created an enemy out of me, and I will make sure to track your company in the future purely to avoid your products and warn people about how much you suck.
