Skill points that you allocate are absolutely permanent. If you find yourself unhappy or unable to progress because of your skills, you'll have to restart the game from scratch to repick your skills. Further, winning battles leaves me unsatisfied, and I'm more irritated than distraught when I lose my units, little yellow plushies with no personality.
