Yes, I was using the CD Key.  SecureRom does not accept the CD Key given to me by Steam.

I\"ve contacted Steam - they say contact SecureRom - I contacted SecureRom, they say Steam gave wrong key.  \n\nI sent screenshots to Steam of my key and error pages and they say its a valid key, but neither company is willing to correct the problem. Honestly, I purchased this game from Steam, I expected them to either assist in fixing issue or refund my money so I can get the game off my library list (I was hoping to try to purchase/download a new version with a new code) but can't download another if it is in my library. So, no Age of Booty to play.\n\nNOTE:  by repeatedly downloading and trying to install this game, I've noticed that STEAM counts that as \"Played\" Time so my attempts today at trying yet again, added more time to what is displayed as Played.
