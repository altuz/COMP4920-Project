I like this because you then have to plan what towers to use on which level, some you like may not be able to fit on some levels, this actually makes sure all towers are used and not just a select few.\n\nIt runs very well, the cutscenes are cute and I am having a blast with the levels. \nAchievements are not hard to get, I assume they have lower-clear rate because people got bored of the game as I do feel the first few levels are slow because of the lack of towers unlocked but any tower-defense game has this so I do not mind it. Bear through the first few slow levels and then the fun starts once you unlock more towers.\n\nYou can use new towers in earlier levels too which is nice as often tower-defense games don't allow you to do this.\n\nOnly issue with the game is the characters voice, however you can turn that off in options so thank you developers.\n\n\nIt is fun, however maybe not as fun as other's in the same genre so I would wait for a discount unless you really like what you see if you watch some videos.", "timestamp_updated": 1504806321, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504776174, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 154, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 164}}
