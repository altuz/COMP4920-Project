Having to walk between targets and navigate the environment actually hurts the action and pacing. Disappointing gameplay.\n\nYou can mostly play with mouse only. This game comes way too close to being a standard topdown shooter for comfort and this genre demands as a mandatory requirement a full Xbox360 pad support which this game does not have. There is no music whatsoever which is oddly unnerving. Combat boils down to right clicking a bunch of times on foes, picking up health packs and throwing grenades at buildings.", "timestamp_updated": 1506056262, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502780887, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34114664", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497373", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1496787452, "steamid": "76561198025387259", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Boring and glitchy game!
