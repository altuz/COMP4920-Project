I remember back in the days when party questing was live, I was always looking forward to party questing with other people but now they took the fun out of it. In party quest areas, you may find like 1 or 2 peeps, that is not enough to get you into one, and they may be 80% be afk They may try to attract you to the game by putting up events but it really is not worth it. Try another game. Plus Game Masters look investigater and suspend/ban legit players who report real hackers and let the hackers roam while they put the legit players on the ground for a month. It is just absurd, they are taking the very incentive that makes us report hackers, to get them banned. The community is pretty much dead as well. If you are looking to play, don't, you will just be wasting your time as have I.\n\n-I got banned for no reason. I was not using any illegal programs nor was I violating any policy. I have been playing all day and suiciding on purpose to not over level so I could play with someone while I look for some equipments. I am greatly disatisfied with this suspension as there are real hackers that I see on the server and I am always reporting them when I see them, but instead, I am the one that gets falsely accused by the program. This is unfair not just to me but the whole community as well. People who do not use illegal programs, such as myself, getting banned while the real ones stay botting or w.e., this is to be not treaded lightly.\n     Their customer service is not implemented well, when asked to provide information on why I was banned, all I got was \"I understand that this is very upsetting, but any evidence obtained by Nexon is proprietary and we will not be able to release that information.\" and they would change the subject towards abiding the Terms of Services before playing the game. These gamemasters would keep saying that they had checked their evidence and would pass judgement on me by banning me but when they are asked to provide the evidence, they would avoid it (I believe they randomly ban people, that is why they do not hand out proof on why people get banned). Every response mentioned insisted that I should have read the Terms of Services and that I should commit to the agreement before I play. As to my knowledge, I have never broken any of those rules, I have gone through the list that they gave me multiple times and still unable to acknowledge the ban because I have never broke any of thoe terms and conducts they have provided. In addition, my time and effort put into leveling up my characters as fast as possible is labeled as leveling exploit (I was leveling so fast because I was strong and using the 1.5x/2x they gave us and the buffs that came with the event). I basically got banned for leveling up too fast, and when I tried to appeal, they ignored my requests and gave me no proof; I bet they did not want to admit that they banned the wrong person. In conclusion, I realized that they do not give a rat's ass about what we have to say. If these Gamemasters were judges, I am pretty sure they would pass the wrong judgements upon people such as letting the bad ones stay in society; meanwhile, caging the good ones in jail.\n\nIf you are looking into this game, keep in mind that you have no voice in what-so-ever.", "timestamp_updated": 1489017027, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487901460, "votes_down": 12}, {"recommendationid": "10276607", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500003", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1358496000, "steamid": "76561198062713712", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "MapleStory is a MMO RPG type game, where you play online with many others in different \"worlds\".
