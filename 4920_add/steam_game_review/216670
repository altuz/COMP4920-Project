This harkens back to the early days of Multi-player over the internet and a game called \"Empire\" on the Amiga 500 where you did this exact thing ... take a turn ... upload it (or save it to a floppy disk back then) or e-mail the turn to a friend ..... not sure why they did it this way other than lazy programming or a lack of knowledge on the Devs part as to modern day programming techniques but it is what it is.
