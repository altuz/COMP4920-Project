Now that I've played it. i wish i could delete it from my library so i never have to look at the art again.

I would have to jump several times in place for me to catch a pole, and when i did the swing would only go after i let go of forward and was shot and killed. Its not a fun challenge, more of a \"i want to go back to the time before i bought it\". please dont buy this game. i beg you"}, {"votes_down": 20, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505038680, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471293", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34858307", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198079492981", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1505038209, "num_games_owned": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 249}, "timestamp_updated": 1505038680, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Probably the worst storyline, gameplay, voice acting, boss battles (if you want to call it that), and mechanics I have ever seen in a game.

Even trying to get this game to start is hard since you have to uninstall your physx drivers and reinstall them in order to play. \n\nThe only thing going for this game is the graphics for it being released in 2009 it's not that bad but not that great either. \n\nAn honest 4.5/10\n STAY AWAY!!!"}]}
