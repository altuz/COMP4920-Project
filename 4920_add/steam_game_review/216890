Don't let people fool you into thinking the RNG is fixed. It's been proven time and again that the dice rolls are indeed random. So don't blame your luck or lack of luck on the dice. \n\nThe game stays true to the BB Boardgame. The only thing that might be a bit of a downside is the horrible AI. For a real challenge play MP instead. \n\nAll in all I highly recommend this game to you if you're into boardgames, warhammer races and are a bit of a masochist. \nBut as stated before, this game truly shines in MP. Singleplayer becomes a bit too easy as you start learning the ropes.", "timestamp_updated": 1507030599, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507030599, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 586, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 155, "total_reviews": 741}}
