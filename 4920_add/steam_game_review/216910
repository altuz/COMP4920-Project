About the combat system: combat is a series of chosen skills (Offensive or Defensive for Ark, and Ranged or Hand-to-Hand for Styx). All in all,  if you wanted me to give you one good reason to play the game, that would be Styx.

If you don't know what that is you might not like it. But basically it is just like KOTOR 1 & 2. If you don't like that kind of combat, don't buy this game.\n\nNow, short and simple, I give this game a 7.2 of 10. At first it moves slow and combat is bad and your moves are weak. But after the first stage and some level-ups, this game starts to turn around. It has a cool system where you control two players, one that is a tank and one that uses stealth and battle support; it works well once you understand how to use it. Plus, the story actually becomes pretty good 2/3 in. Not to spoil anything, but there is a really interesting part 2/3 of the way in and it made me want to finish the game.\n\nAs you can see, I spent about 30 hours playing this game (a game that can be finished in like 15-20hrs) so I spent time searching and learning. I am a bit bias because I like Spider Studio (especially since 2012) and I recommend this game.\n\nThis is not a AAA title and there are flaws in it (for ex. the story is ptretty bad overall, and the AI is a bit bad). But all in all, I recommend this game for $10 USD.

Essentially it works like KOTOR where you pause, plan out your attacks, and then cross your fingers. This would be fine if it wasn't for the broken RPG element. You see, as you level up you get to choose what abilities you want to spec into for both characters. I decided to go with a light tank/dps for the orc and a heavy rogue/dps for the goblin. But eventually I came to a point where this doesn't work, the enemies all did too much damage for my characters to sustain 1 or 2 hits and i had to constantly kite them into a corner so I could revive the other one.
