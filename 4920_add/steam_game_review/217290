Combat has a good amount of depth and even simple melee characters have a good amount of tactics apart from \"click till they drop\". There are a bunch of pregenerated character classes or you can design your own, mixing & matching skill trees. I also really like the dynamic nature of the game. Quests aren't static. Enemies aren't static. NPCs aren't static. Events evolve. Failures happen. Take too long, and the bad guys gain more power and minions. It's hugely replayable, as every town is different and you have to do different things to save each town. To me, this is what an ARPG should be. If you like messing around with different character builds, killing stuff, collecting gear with little story or exploration to slow you down. This is Diablo, only with a fifth of the plot- all action. You are probably going to die. A lot, though you can highly customize the difficulty to your liking, And so will all the townspeople relying upon you, their hero, for safety. All because, in \"Din's Curse,\" the bosses fight back.Slowly but surely, they gather power and influence, staging ambushes upon the town while you're down in the dungeon or shopping for more armor. You will die a lot, but it's great fun. Highly recommended for any fan of Diablo, Torchlight, or Titan's Quest", "timestamp_updated": 1499777299, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499777299, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 87, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 15, "total_reviews": 102}}
