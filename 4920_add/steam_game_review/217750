I played this game for 7 years,with about 2 years of pausing in between. The reviews here? The people crying about the Itemshop,about it being \"pay-to-win\"? Complete bullshit. And as a true AoC veteran,let me tell you why.\n\nItemshop? Completely optional. You can get the gear they offer you in not even a month of playing PvP if you do the daily PvP quests,Minigames and the PvP week-events which will give you INSANE amount of PvP xp. So the people saying this game is Pay-to-win are just bad,they need to step up their game and that's it,you have people qqing like this in every game. If you're a really good player,it just doesn't matter if you have the first PvP set (which is earned PRETTY easily) or the last (t3) PvP set,you will kill anyway. That's what the new players nowadays just don't get,they buy this game, have NO CLUE about it whatsoever and the first thing they do is either cry at the itemshop or buy the PvP set from the Shop and get completely destroyed by everybody nonetheless... \n\nThere are only 2 REALLY important factors about PvP in this game: \n\nAA Feats (Alternate Advancement system,kind of hard to explain,but long story short: You get AA points if you play and you spend it on your character's AA feat so he gets better at resisting for example crowd controls, or you get special abilities. However, if you take your time and show patience by skilling the right things,you wont have to worry ONE BIT about AA's because with the PvP AND PvE quests that exist you get them EASILY nowadays.)\n\nMovement. You need to aim in this game,not point and click. This is what makes Age of Conan so awesome, if your movement is good,you can kill anything worse than you. New players don't get that even though that's the most important thing about the game... You run around the enemy,predict his moves and try to counter them, you try not to get hit by certain things and and and...\n\nTry this game. You will have many people crying out loud here on Steam saying how incredibly bad it is or something like that but those are ALL people who do simply suck at the game and it's mechanics. It's a skill game after all...\nTake your time with it, look at the lore, listen to the music, and own shit when you hit lvl 80 (which you can reach easily in a week or two). YOU NEED PATIENCE TO GET INTO THE GAME!\n\nThis game has more than enough people to play it by the way,so don't just think this game is dead..this game is alive and running and they improved it A LOT\n\nalso very important: PROBABLY 95 PERCENT OF THE AOC PLAYERBASE DON'T PLAY THIS GAME VIA STEAM!

And although the quests are often clich\u00e9s, the game's combat profoundly contrasts with that; the system of combos and the irrepressible bloodthirstiness turns the gameplay into an addictive experience. The existence of a main mission is also a strong point, as it is made with focus on singleplayer, which helps constructing a fantastic experience, since the developers could heavily devote time detailing and expanding the story, consolidating a loyal reputation to the Hyborian Age.\nThe old graphics are truly charming; even if they're are old, for being so detaild they aged pretty well, like WoW's graphics.\nThe soundtrack, I would dare to say, is the strongest point of the game. It's astounding. It's not only possible to say that it's the best in the genre, but it's also possible to say that they are equipped with that of many great games, like The Last of Us soundtrack, for example.\nLately, I've been testing several MMORPGs. Age of Conan: Unchained, though old, is the only one that caught my attention. With fully voiced missions with cutscenes and an amazing loyalty to Conan's mortal world (whose original Robert Roward stories are special to me), and the details in the open world maps are incredible. It is a very high-class MMORPG, blurred by the sands of misfortune.

Age of Conan was a game I was excited for when it was released in 2008, as were many of my friends I played other MMOs with.  It was a hopeful challenger to the older and \"Gold Standard\" of MMOs, World of Warcraft or WoW.  It appeared to be a hit for the first couple of months by the sales and the community, patient as they were for the promised game, hung in for a few more months. Hawever, by the 5th month the game qucikly died off, like several other MMOs that didn't meet expectations of the consumers, leaving only the hopeful fans.  \n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nThe game in general is lack luster by todays standards.  For a game still trying to get money out of your wallet via micro transactions and subscriptions, Funcom has done little to the graphics engine, combat system, and UI to make it  feel current, fluid, and fun. Play this if you are a fan of the Conan lore and old school RPGs and can adapt to the awkward combat system. \n\n[h1]Faults[/h1]\nThe chief complaints were that the game was buggy and the zones following the starting area felt unfinished and lacked end game content.  Although Funcom has fixed many of these issues over time, the game struggled to produce revenue with a small community.  As a result it was repackaged as a FTP in 2011 (Unchained edition) with a business model that limited your ability to play this game as an MMO if you do not purchase the expansions/subscription packages. This also had problems, much like Rift faces today, with step prices for content and pay-to-win/ pay-to-progress debates. \n\n[h1]Current Business Model[/h1]\nFuncom has recently removed some, not all, of the pay restrictions for non-subscribers to access content such as zones and instances.  You can purchase game packages including expansions, T1 & T2 gear sets, mounts, loot boxes, consumables, and bonuses via micro transactions. A set of Tier armor will cost you $60 USD while mounts range between $10-20 and expansions will cost just under $20 each.  Subscribers still pay $15 a month and recieve increased XP, loot, and currencies. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAge of Conan offers a unique love/hate combat system.  The combat system is designed so that you can attack and block in multiple dirrections with combos.  However, the system feels unnecessarily complex, slow, and clunky with animations that lack a wow factor.  The combat performs more of what you would expect from a small indie team rather than a triple-A studio supporting a giant MMORPG. And compared to a MMORPG like Black Desert Online (BDO), the combat system is aweful. \n\nYou can chose to play in two game settings, PvP and PvE, on three server types, PvE, PvP, and RP.  Player vs Player is enabled when you want to play in the sunlight with other players. On a PvE server, enemy NPCs are in the world to attack rather than actual players. Player vs Enviroment is the night phase and you will not encounter other players as well as have completely different quest lines. This is a open world game however some areas are instanced and the world lacks the size of WoW, ESO, Rift, and BDO.  \n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nAge of Conan was a beautiful game when it was released and pushed the boundries of MMOs of the time period. However, by today's standards it is lack luster at best. The game lacks brilliant attack/spell animations leaving you with a feeling of blah when fighting with your character. Some people may not mind this but when combined with the slow awkward feel of the attacks, it is not very satisfying.  While other MMOs have updated the engine, combat, and textures to ncrease the graphical fidelity of the game world to current standards, Funcom has done very little to Conan. Compared to other triple-A MMOs you can play for free like WoW, SWTOR, ESO, Rift, and BDO, Age of Conan is a jewel in the rough and only shines in the story.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story is set in a great lore based world and this would be the only reason to recommend this game to anyone. The writing is great and interacting with the quests NPCs can be very enjoyable. I found myself laughing several times at the dialog. The voice acting isn't bad, but I wouldn't call it great either. You will encounter a wide range of accents which can aid with immersion and also break it when the large white viking looking barbarian suddenly speaks to you with an East Indian accent.  However, this is by far some of the best dialog I have experienced with NPCs in an MMO. \n\n[h1]Recommendation[/h1]\nIf you are a fan of the Conan lore and enjoy RPGs, then this may be a game for you provided you can adapt to the awkward combat system.  If not, then there are several other FTP MMORPGs that offer a more enjoyable experience.", "timestamp_updated": 1489697411, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0,

this took like 15m as i really wanted a variant of that name. so now i get to long into game. befor i even move using w,a,s,d, i fall thro the floor of the viking area into water. ok its a new game so i relog get back into game now i am on a floor and i am able to use w,a,s,d, and read all the tool tips. now this part of the game i loved the graphics looked good, sound was great. i leave the main town i am atked by and npc right near the exit of the main town. i ran not knowing what lv the npc was and the town guards killed it. the controls are close to mount and blade warband and so is combat. i join a guild all nice guys and gave me a few tips. also i read a bit about the game befor i got it so i would know how to spend my str, dex, hp, points. so i was told i should go at lv 1 and kill lv 1-9 npcs near town i did but i found a lv 23 when i was only lv 2. i was able to kill it and i had 75% or so of my hp left. only do this if you are good at mount and blade warband as the exp is well worth it. so imo pve is great\n\nPVP\nok so i goto a town with pplz from my clan we atk said town it had no players that i could see. a few npcs. we break a few gates with our spears and swords and take said town. i get paid for helping kinda like a mini quest i guss. then i goto a tournament where if you die you lose nothing ok great good way to get exp and test my skills. haha lol. its 19 vs 21 we had the 21. so its what team can get more kills in say 10m. its was 13 to over 100 near the end of the tournament my side lost. the lag i went thro was bad. i would be hitting someone and think i am doing great next thing i knew i was on the floor dead while the person i thought i was atking had little to no dmg. so imo PVP needs a lot of work befor its worth anything and since its the main part of the game well to me anyways i would say wait to get this game till they fix lag also i would say game is worth as is 10.00-15.00 so wait for a sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1486423112,

While (SWG) slightly dated look now there approach aged better then this because of their style, highly stylised games do not always age well. City of Heros (2004) had better animations, more fluid movements, higher quality (more detail in the movements). Also as much as i hate it World of Warcraft (2004), it has had only some minor animation inprovements over the years its still basically the same game. This list goes on to games MMO or Single player, they chose a visual style that would not age well coupled with probably fairly inexperienced animators, at the time most animations in games were the devs stumbling through the movements instead of a skilled or trained animator.\n\nAdditionally just because a game is old does not mean it is above criticism. When you put a movie, game, tv show, ect (any form of art) out into the world it can be critisised forever its age doesnt mean anything although it can lend a form of understanding or lense of \"this is the best of what they had to work with at the time\". This game however is just visually bad and boreing when compared to games of it generation.\n\nAlso the stroy was not gripping in anyway as to overlook the other parts where it falls short.", "timestamp_updated": 1490390141, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487327019, "votes_down": 38}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 17, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 17}}
