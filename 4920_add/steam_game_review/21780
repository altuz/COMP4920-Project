Note: You have to put it into Compatibility Mode for Windows XP Service Pack 3, otherwise it doesn't work. No other bugs detected so far, after 4 hours of play. Also using XBOX 360 controller.\n\nStory: 3/5. Generic, but solid revenge story. Split from 1970-2000's is great. Solid voice acting\n\nGameplay: 4/5. Difficult, but easier than previous installments (thankfully). GTA is much easier, especially the shooting, which is a little clunky at first. The driving is superior to GTA V, cars seem more solid and realistic. Upgrade system is pretty negligible.\n\nMusic: 4/5. Classic score, modern era kinda sucks. Overall, not as good as the Mafia games radio, better than GTA's.\n\nOverall: 4/5. Fun, great city, graphics hold up very well, and it runs smoothly. Driving is better than the shooting, so if you like cars, this is for you."}]}
