That being said, the music is fun, it's cool to have somewhat of a story, and the world is visually interesting.\n\nThe timing between issuing a command and having the character respond was incredibly hard for me to get down. I had another friend play a few levels and he had trouble with it, too, although he picked it up much faster than I did. Thus, the weird lag has made this game very difficult and frustrating for me. It's nice that each level has checkpoints, but when your character gets sent back to the checkpoint or replays the level after failing, there's a whole little dance+music thing, and it quickly gets annoying after you've tripped over an obstacle 5 times in a row.\n\nIf you are skilled at these kinds of games and just want to play a quick round of a game, enjoy some music, and watch a fun environment, this is for you.
