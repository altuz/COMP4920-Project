Its fun and entertaining... ESPECIALLY when you have a fun outfit who loves to pull jokes and pranks on eachother and enemys alike! \n\nTips to new players:\n1: Keep calm and respawn.\n2: You WILL die ALOT!\n3: Practice your aim, it gets better with time/experience.\n4: Work Together! Its a TEAM game!\n5: No weapon is the same as the other, they each have their own Strength's!\n6: Black and gold weapons are EXACTLY the same as their standard variant! They also cost real money.\n7: Learn your Keybindings! It Helps Alot!\n8: Pick smaller fights untill your used to the gams mechanics!\n9: If you can see them you can kill them!\n10: Be RESPECTFUL!!! If you are, others will be more willing to help you! Dont be afraid to ask for help, EVERYONE needs help!\n\nThese are the general tips/tricks/rules I live by! In any game! \nIf your on faction VS (vanu) on server Emerald, My name is Quicky262\n\nPlease, Have a good day and Have fun!\n\n\n2/18/2017 Edit: Some of my outfit/platoon mates gave me some ideas as to what to put for the 10 things as I could only think of about 4 on my own :P \nSo thanks to them to make this review entirely possible!\n\n3/1/2017 Edit 2: a few more tips for you are   \n1) dont run infront of your allies that are shooting, go behind them so you stay out of their line of fire.   \n2) use the terain around you for cover.  \n3) if your a Heavy Assault turn you shield on when entering cover, even if your not being shot at. reason is this is a CLIENT side game if you can see them, you can shoot them. so if your in cover they may still see you out of cover for a short time after because they havent recieved the info from you yet. so use the addage of \"I can see you, I can shoot you\" the same goes for the other players aswell   \n4) Don't go straight for the enemy UNLESS you have several teamates with you. Try your BEST to FLANK the enemy. don't attack them head on. come at them from the sides, above, or even behind them, if one tactic dosen't work... Try something else. the fight is dynamic, just like you!  5) Finally, LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of your weapons, it WILL take time.\n\n\nP.S. Feel free to add my on steam or PS2 (ingame) the name i listed is my primary although if you want i can tell you the others via PM or steam chat.\n\nP.P.S. I added some tips my teamates and friends gave me. some others on Youtube, like Wrel (Dev) Nico101, Joshino, and others have also said some of these tips. If you want to know more about the game look them up on youtube Especially Wrel, as he's a developer. Nico101 I'd recoment to Older audiences, as there is some \"Humor\" that younger audiences may find offensive or dont understand. (he and his team swear a bit aswell) i do squad ops with them and its mostly moments of WTF?! and general fun. Joshino and Wrel are a great choice to see if you want to Learn more about the game, its mechanics and also for general info/guides for weapons or tactics. \n\nNow all this is simply my PERSONAL opinion, while i agree that some others may not agree with me, i hold my opinions of the game and the players in fair judgment. \n\nAlso, if you have any ideas for tips/tricks/unspoken rules/etc. post them in the comments. I will add them to the list and give you credit. feel free do discuss this game in comments below.

This is a very special experience, I can\u2019t think of another FPS that is as ambitious, varied, and outrageous in its dedication to all out chaotic war as this game. Thousands, and I mean thousands of real people at sitting at their computers all across the world battle in this never ending sci fi conflict from a first person perspective, all in glorious real time, and for the most part, it works. It\u2019s astonishing to stare across a field at a giant group of advancing enemy infantry, easily larger than even the largest Battlefield server, snap to iron sights, and fire into the group and score a kill, only to get run over from behind by one of a hundred tanks cresting over the hill, firing in all directions like maniacs. The game is an MMO, but just the very fact that it still manages to feel like a standard FPS with decent controls and shooting mechanics is a grand achievement. Planetside 2 feels, at times, like the perfect game I wanted as a little kid while going \u201cpew pew\u201d with dozens of little plastic army men.\n\nLike other MMOs, you can join an outfit (guild) and fight for one of three distinct factions. The scary red space communists (guns are weak but shoot fast), the freedom loving space Americans (guns are strong but shoot slow), and the spiritual xenophile space hippies (laser guns). These factions are engaged in an eternal conflict over several continents, and the game centers around various control points. Choose a class ranging from the vital medic to the jetpacking Light Assault and help out your team crush the enemy forces. The size of each continent is mind boggling, and while large stretches are usually unused for long periods of time, it is easy to find conflict zones and jump straight in by the game\u2019s intuitive map system. See all of those flashing booms? Shit\u2019s going down there, get in the meat grinder, soldier!\n\nThe land and air vehicles are easy to operate, and the infantry controls are familiar if you\u2019ve played any recent FPS. There is a ton of variety in how the gameplay unfolds. One minute you are firing at distant targets in a barren desert from a tank\u2019s turret, the next you could be dropped from a hovering Galaxy troop carrier into the thick of an intense CQB firefight. However, there are definitely long boring stretches of inactivity like in other MMOs, boring car rides or endless sprints to the objective that can become pretty grating over time. Thankfully, you can always kill yourself to respawn somewhere closer, or spawn on a mobile spawn truck known as the Sunderer, so if you\u2019re an impatient type action is never too far away.\n\nThe game unfortunately isn\u2019t perfect. Performance is all over the place, despite having a good system expect things to slow down in some of the more hectic combat moments, which is expected since the game is trying to render hundreds of people shooting each other. The F2P system isn\u2019t too bad, the starting guns are definitely viable in combat, but in order to get another weapon or even to unlock a new attachment can feel very grindy at times. Players who spend a ton of money will definitely have an advantage over you in a 1v1 situation since they have access to more gadgets, scopes, etc. than you do, but since the battles are so chaotic and packed with people, this is rarely an issue. \n\nPlanetside 2 is an ambitious game that truly makes you feel like you are a small cog in a giant sci fi battle. I feel as if many multiplayer FPS games are becoming more and more obsessed with making every player feel like a cool guy special forces operator, but Planetside 2 basically says, \u201cYou don\u2019t matter, you\u2019re one of hundreds of dumb grunts running around and you are most likely going to die real quick.\u201d I really enjoy this and I wished more developers would work towards making a similar MMOFPS like this of our dreams. Imagine an MMOFPS set in Europe during WW2 (Not that Heroes and Generals shits), now that would be something I really like. Imagine Allied forces landing in player controlled LCVPs, while Axis Luftwafe strafe the beaches, and Panzer divisions massing for a counter attack. Now THAT's my dream video game. \n\nPlanetside 2 is definitely worth trying out, it\u2019s free, so why not?", "timestamp_updated": 1491335494, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487205447, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "30244541", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526950", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1497330574, "steamid": "76561198058415927", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "I love this game!
