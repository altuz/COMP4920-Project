It has a nice story, good cartoon art design, whacky characters and a simple to learn yet hard to master core mechanic of tower placements and upgrades as well as about 40 different maps counting all bonus levels and challenges, all of which have an alternate harder version in NG+. Complexity wise it's on the smaller end of the spectrum with only 6 different hero (tower) types and a maximum of 36 towers in total. It also requires to shift heroes (towers) on demand during a map which makes the whole game also a resource management game under great pressure, although it is always possible to completely halt the game while being able to issue commands as well as to up to speed up the game by a whopping factor of 16.\n\nAll in all: Great accessibility, time well spent and a good game to recommend to fans of the genre.", "timestamp_updated": 1503351181, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503351181, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33579536", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500536192, "steamid": "76561197999459739", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 250, "playtime_forever": 960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is quite amazing, a really great story with RPG and Tower Defense.

Sound, music and graphics are all acceptable and do not detract from the gameplay experience.\n\nThe story is surprisingly good and the dialog is generally well written.\n\nThere is a reasonable amount of strategy involved, as some levels will take a little trial and error to complete without taking any damage, and the unit cost and unit limit are well balanced in this regard.\n\nShortcomings are mostly that the game could have had much more depth on the RPG side - equipment is fairly limited in variety, and characters and units have relatively low skill/level cap compared to most games. This game has a more gradual progression to character power as you play rather than some games that ramp up quickly or more dramatically.\n\nOverall a perfectly enjoyable tower defense and certainly worth playing for fans of the genre.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1503234377, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503234377, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33415541", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417232", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498609425, "steamid": "76561198033624725", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "basic, confusing, redundant, difficult to see. don't understand the abundance of positive reviews", "timestamp_updated": 1499636132, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499636132, "votes_down": 40}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1335, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "review_score": 9, "num_reviews": 7, "total_negative": 34, "total_reviews": 1369}}
