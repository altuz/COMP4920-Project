The layout of the mansion is nightmarishly, twistingly huge, and a little demonic kid can only move so fast.  Plus the progression is really awkward; I get not wanting to hold the player's hand through the entire game, but a nudge here and there would be nice.  If I hadn't looked up walkthroughs, I'd still be wandering around Chapter 3, because my intended victim wouldn't spawn anywhere I could see them to get my hint that they are in fact the one I need to murder (whether this was a bug or just the outcome of a really terrible house layout, I dunno).  However, the deaths were pretty creative (and gruesome, very VERY gruesome), and I bought it for less than $2.  \n\ntl;dr?
