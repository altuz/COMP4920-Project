I never used a controller for this game, as it's far more smooth driving then say Renegade Ops, but I could see it being nice so I leave that to personal preference.\n\nThe power-ups and upgrades are definitely cool, as I found out you will probably use most of them a couple times depending on the level. The side missions are a nice touch as well.\n\nThe simplicity of this game is great, it's a straight forward game and really easy to pick up.

This alone is not the reason I am leaving a negative review, as even great games can have a hiccup from time to time. The problem is that after each crash I have lost a lot of progress - missions that I had completed were no longer complete and money / skill points I had earned were gone.  The game does not have a manual save feature as far as I know, and if autosave is the only option then it should autosave after each mission attempt. The crashes were not frequent, but for me that isn't the point. This is a sloppy game design and programming choice in a game that is otherwise well crafted.
