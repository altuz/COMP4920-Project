The entirety of the game is a digestible few hours long, depending mostly on your ability and tendency to rage quit. \n\nI think Hotline Miami hits just that sweet spot of true yet fair difficulty. Combat is quick, punchy, and immediate. Death is somehing the player will undergo very frequently, yet they're barely punished for it at all. Rather, they're allowed to dash back into the fight instantaneously, which does wonders to maintain the quick tempo of the game. Aiming can sometimes be a bit finnicky, but the controls are so simple that most slip-ups can be attributed to player error.\n\nThe music for HM is a particular highlight for me. The drawling and grinding beat of most of the tracks playing in the background provide a perfect atmosphere for going on a rampage. I honestly feel like the music helped fuel the bloodlust you feel as an extension of your character.\n\nThe story is simple yet has a few bit of intrigue hidden below the surface. The setting is excellent and the art style is really appealing and visceral. Hotline Miami is really an experience pretty much every PC gamer should try.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506159162, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506159162, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35160330", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503521396, "steamid": "76561198099262890", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 7687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great arcade style action shooter.
