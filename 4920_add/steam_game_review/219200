The graphics are bad, but this is too difficult to be a BAD game!\"\n\nThat is not what Droid Assault is.\n\nFirst off, I *like* graphic simplicity, but this feels \"slick\", as if the developers cared to make a game that doesn't look cheap.  Secondly, it IS difficult.  You'll win a bunch of levels, but if you start from the beginning every time, you'll find yourself stuck; getting past the upper levels requires starting the game at the later levels - which itself is difficult.\n\nGameplay: you have different bot models, and you have a limited resource with which you can take over new ones.  It's almost impossible to use pickups to buff up one 'droid to INVINCIBLE POWAH.  Healing is minimal (but it does exist), which means you have to strategize which 'bots to play, and which bots to leave to an AI death.\n\nThe more you play, the more you'll find that the strategy is all-important - and THAT is what I most often like about retro gaming.  This game has replayability, but not because you've built up an unstoppable 'bot; that's impossible.  Instead, Droid Assault rewards smart game play.  Honestly, for the price I'd say you can NOT lose, and you may just find yourself sucked into a game the way you used to when you were younger.\n\nI hope this review is useful...", "timestamp_updated": 1499711743, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499711743, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34491880", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500129", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506294587, "steamid": "76561198256755125", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great game, very addicting!!", "timestamp_updated": 1503701962, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503701962, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34714827", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500129", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505300706, "steamid": "76561198128834910", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I like (love) the gameplay, cute retro style, sound and video effects of the game.
