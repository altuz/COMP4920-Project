A colorful and cheerful world that is incredibly relaxing to delve into. There may be very little gameplay involved as you simply move around the world as you wish and observe but it's a nice game to wind down with. I think if you  are looking for that sort of game, then you will probably like it. However, replayability is rather low since there is no objective and no interactions. Still, I bought this game and do not regret it. One perspective I have of this game is that it's art. When you see the dazzling comets at night and the falling leaves of the trees, it's very inspiring and beautiful. At some moments I was completely stunned by the sights and sounds of the world.

It's an immersive game where your objectives are simply to walk and observe.  There is absolutely no HUD or menu, which creates a more lifelike experience. The colors are amazing.  The audio is dynamic and interactive.  There have been some remarks about the graphics, but I feel like they keep you from getting too absorbed into an area and on the move.  I'll find myself getting rather philosophical at times, as the game leaves any stories, etc. to the player.
