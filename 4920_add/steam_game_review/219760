They went a completely different direction with this game. In this game, you start at the bottom of the dungeon and you are escaping. You have a partner in the game which your soul is bound to. If one of you die, you both die. This game is hard, very hard, escaping with very little from the lowest floor is hard, however, very enjoyable. I like the death knight's personality, and I enjoy the idea that you can do all the quests then kill everybody after to gain more experience. How many games do you know off that you can kill anyone.\n\nBeyond Divinity has some improvements over Divine Divinity. Better menus, more meaning full skill/class system, and a second character. Beyond Divinity lacks the deep story and depth of Divine Divinity. The premise of Beyond Divinity is to get as far away from the dungeon as possible and find a witch to unbind your souls, where Divine Divinity has a big open world.\n\nDespite the some of the negative criticism this game has received, I found this game to be a breath of fresh air. Beyond Divinity is different from the rest of the dungeon genre and a cult classic that is worth a try.", "timestamp_updated": 1501276225, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501276225, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 36, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 28, "total_reviews": 64}}
