Nice touch is that reloads are very slow, which is as they would have been at the time the game is set. Major plus point is manual saves are available despite being mainly checkpoint driven.\n\nHowever it is badly marred by feeling like it's on rails, you are permenently fighting  the control system which tries to stop you moving the way you want to. But it's totally ruined by the duelling system which is frankly awful on a PC with a mouse, ultimately it sapped all the pleasure I got from the game and led me to stop playing it in favour of doing something I actually enjoyed. Gameplay is not repeating the same bit for an hour."}]}
