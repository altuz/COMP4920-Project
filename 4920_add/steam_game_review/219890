I didn't have any expectations what-so-ever, but I thought to myself that since this game has a lot of positive reviews here on Steam, that there's a slight chance I might actually like it.\n\nWell..\n\nWhat an experience this was! This has to be one of the most memorable and creative puzzlers I have played in recent memories. I kind of got obsessed with this game, to that extent that once I played through the whole game, I felt kind of empty inside. Like something's missing, a kind of sad feeling that a great journey now had come to an end, and somehow I'm not sure if I'll ever find a puzzler like this again.\n\nI have also played through both the Portal-games, but in my opinion Valve singleplayer games tends to be way to linear where you're always following a set path. Like the game the Witness (which I own on my PS4, great game), Antichamber grants you freedom to explore everything at your own pace. In that way every players experience with this game is somewhat different (which is a good thing).\n\nHighly recommended!", "timestamp_updated": 1504901176, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504901176, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34791118", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505240776, "steamid": "76561198050285870", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The game giving me the most WTF moments so far.", "timestamp_updated": 1504776953, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504776953, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34947824", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1470976226, "steamid": "76561197970214113", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of the best, more inventive puzzle games released in the past decade.
