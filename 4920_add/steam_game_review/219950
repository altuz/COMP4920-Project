The level was colorful, fun, and compelling in an enchanting way -- which brings me to this enhanced version and port of the 1996 game!\n\nNiGHTS Into Dreams pulled me in with its warm setting and upbeat music as expected. Two outstanding tracks include the DnB tune \"The Dragon Gave Out a Loud Scream\" with a likewise, screaming saxaphone and the \"Message from Nightopia\" track used in Sonic Adventure. However, what engaged me most were the score-attack mechanics. Controls were simple once I understood what was going on, like driving a super-simplified car for the first time. Next comes racking up points. It feels so satisfying to nail a 25+ combo from flying through rings and orbs at a fast pace. After getting that far, I would feel an adrenaline rush to keep the current string going.\n\nI had some frustrations when it came to boss battles, and it's not about the bosses themselves, but the clock and punishment. Each boss requires a different strategy to beat it, and some are less obvious than others. By the time I learned how to deal with said boss, time was too short to defeat it. When you lose to a boss, the entire stage is over, meaning you must start from the beginning. Not too bad, seeing as the courses prior to the boss take 8 minutes at most but it gives you a shot to get a higher score.\n\nOne other complaint is that any mode of movement that was not flying was not as fun, because it took more control of my character than I wanted it to. The worst was a rail platform that slams into NiGHTS and battled with my attempts to swing NiGHTS toward required orbs.\n\nMy complaints are however outweighed by enjoying the rest of the game and a fantastic soundtrack to boot. This one is highly recommended, especially since it goes for little over a US dollar during some sales.", "timestamp_updated": 1500123690, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499984232, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 198, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 19, "total_reviews": 217}}
