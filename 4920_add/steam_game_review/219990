I tend to go with the general conscensus on Diablo 2 being the best for a very, very long time though it had a handful of flaws that irritated me (enemy immunities would top that list, rendering a lot of builds non-viable).  \n\nWhere am I going with this? There is one thing that Grim Dawn does -extraordinarily- well.  It empowers the player to make the character they want to make.  You can focus on nearly any damage type or playstyle you like, so long as you do so by building your character in a way that maximizes whatever you're focusing on. You can go back to the well of character design over and over and over and still come away with something that feels unique and interesting.  There's no \"this is the current flavor of the month build for this class\" as there is with Diablo 3 where whatever gearset has been tweaked for the current ladder season is clearly the best option for end game success.  That doesn't mean Grim Dawn doesn't have some balance issues (it does) or that everything is viable (if you try to build around 4 damage types you're in for a bad experience).  \n\nThe main draw of any ARPG in my experience is replayability.  You're functionally going to be doing the same thing over and over and over again regardless of which game you decide to invest your time in so it really comes down to how much fun that repetition is.  For me, Grim Dawn is by far the best option on the market.  Every character I've built feels unique to some degree and the content the game offers continues to be enjoyable for me nearly 700 hours in.  With the impending expansion pack right around the corner I fully expect to invest even more time in this relatively inexpensive gem.  If you want to play an ARPG masquerading as an MMO, you're better suited to play Path of Exile or, if you like spandex, grinding the same zone for endless hours, and pay to win you can go with Marvel Heroes. \n\nGrim Dawn, however, is easily the best option in my estimation for anyone looking to play solo or with a friend or two.", "timestamp_updated": 1506790631, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506790631, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34790363", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507949", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505293917, "steamid": "76561198022480306", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 9797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Grim Dawn... *Iron well spent* was it or was it not?? \nAfter clocking about 100+ hours & completed the main campaign. I had fair share experience of what Grim Dawn could offer to players that are lookin into some action with ARPG title.\n\n Well I'm enjoying every moment in Grim Dawn as 1st playthrough but still Grim Dawn does fall short in certain area. Let's begin with storyline and the RPG. I gotta said I'm loving it, Grim Dawn come with different choices and consequence of decision that we took, choices matter! Not to mention our exploration to unfog maps; there are lot of hidden compartment & secret area waitin for us to be discover. Memoirs,notes & diary are stumble upon here and there that give us a glimpse of untold tales and left us wanting for more. All in all of the storyline; where does Grim Dawn fall short?? The biggest flaw in my concern of Grim Dawn storyline.... it come without the cutscene or cinematic trailer for player, thus that made Grim Dawn journey feeling bit linear that causes it to lost the feeling of GRANDEUR that it could potray. The satisfaction feeling of achievement is somehow lost when everytime we playthrough an ACT or kill a boss without those cutscene or trailer.\n\n Gameplay, action & lootwise, Grim Dawn progression are more s l o w e r and time consuming in comparison with Diablo 3 or the Torchlight series, both Diablo 3 and Torchlight gamespeed play through give us the arcade-ish fast rushing, where we hack & slash everything like a hot knife in butter and the rewards of gaining loots for both games are pretty fast pace whereas Grim Dawn is pretty s l o w & quite a pain for player whom 1st experience ARPG is begin with Diablo 3 or Torchlight series; The Grim Dawn drop loots is base on what you see on the monster and that's what you'll get when dropped ! But for me I'm loving every moments of it ! I could take my time to go through & explored an area, killin mobs and played em at more less rushing pace.\n\n Ahhhs Graphic, Grim down do really l00k dated but still bring out the atmosphere. Grim Dawn & Diablo 3 had it differences in term atmosphere and style both cater different audience but Grim Dawn does less polished in graphic in term of special effect, variety of skill effect and overall in-depth of game graphic. Grim Dawn is runnin on pretty old engine but still does gave us a very good immersion of the world and great gameplay experience. Now,now here the main issue the Grim Dawn's old engine come with a slight... hiccups, it may happened mildly, badly or none at all to all different player, that is MICROSTUTTERING. There is no ultimate fix for this problem on affected player due to the differences of pc hardware; but fret not there is fair share of method, guide and placebo way to fix microstuttering issue in Grim Dawn Forum and Guide. I myself had a very BAD experience of MICROSTUTTER issue on day 1,luckilly managed to get em fix somehow on later day.\n\n Audio and sound, Grim Dawn had a poor but acceptable voiceover dialouge for most NPC in the game, BGM played fine but not as soulful or immersive like Diablo 3 nor Torchlight series, the BGM score just seem to fall in between meh & nice but nothing special nor memorable either.\n\n After all the flaw that come within, why do I still give a thumbs up and love Grim Dawn so much?? For the value prices what Grim Dawn has to offer to everyone, Grim Dawn did a very outstanding job, it had been priced amazingly decent and fair. I had to sayeth Grim Dawn still does a very mindblowin gameplay & amazing experience for an ARPG title, it come with a very in-depth of skill of customization to variety of class combo mechanism, endless of replayability option, most importantly Grim Dawn doesn't bored me out when I'm spending my time in the world of Grim Dawn. Grim Dawn leave me a very fine after taste and immersive impression although with those flaw anmd shortcoming. I'm gotta admit my Iron is indeed well spent on Grim Dawn.", "timestamp_updated": 1504789211, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504772844, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34904681", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503191", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506306304, "steamid": "76561197998095669", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 371}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have to say, in early access I was extremely disappointed in this game. I loved Titan Quest and had high hopes for Grim Dawn. Unfortunately, when I first started playing, the loot felt lacking and the skills just didn't feel like they had that \"umphf\" that is necessary for an action rpg. However, after it's full release, I gave it another shot, and my opinion of the game was completely changed very quickly. If you had the same experience as I did initially, or you have heard some bad reviews of the game from the past, I employ you to try it out, because I seriously doubt you will be disappointed. The loot is cool, the action is fluid, and their are neat concepts that haven't really been explored in an arpg that I have seen.\n\n  One example of these concepts include the relationship bars associated with each allied and enemy factions, giving you shop perks for the allies, and more difficult spawns for the enemies, as the bar increases. Another example is the Devotion point system that gives an entire extra layer of character building, as diverse as the duel-class trees. These Celestial ability options allow you to place points into a large selection of passive properties that are part of mini skill-trees that, when completed, give you a passive skill that you can attach to your main skills. This allows you to get eruptions of fire, or healing, or poison spikes, or life-stealing, or a huge array of other effects that can be added to the skills you are already using. The campaign is very long and there is a great amount of side content along with hidden areas that add to that play time. All in all, this has become one of my top favorite arpgs by far.\n\n  Plus, if I know how this company works, they are only going to polish things and add quality-of-life improvements to the game with the expansion, much like they did with Titan Quest. From what I have seen from them, they are always bettering themselves, keeping the parts that are great, while fixing the bad and adding features to the good, always resulting in an improved experience.
