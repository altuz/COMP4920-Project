The game was a hit for fans of the original and brought some new elements and features to the battlefield. The plot takes place two decades after the black mesa incident and earth is under siege by a seemingly unstoppable alien race, the combine.\n\nPROS:\n-The story is very well paced and put together very nicely as all the others. You play as Gordon Freeman again during the aftermath of earths defeat in the Seven Hour War. Not spoiling the rest in case you haven't picked up a copy in the 10 years its existed.\n-The environment is very immersive as it is a long seamless road to the end of the game with, as the definition of seamless implies, zero cutscenes or immersion breaking interruptions.\n-The gunplay involves the same weapons from half-life with plentiful new additions such as a combine rifle and different grenades. The arsenal available is pleasently loud, very powerful feeling, and quite fun to use when eliminating the enemy as per tradition.\n-The game gives players a little down time after a while with some dialogue heavy playable \"cutscene\" like segments. Four in total.\n-New engine means new physics, and new physics means a whole new realm of puzzling to do.\n-The ending is fantastic with closing out the game but certainly could have been better.\n\nCONS: (Not even half-life is safe from sin, sorry) Please note that i am extremely aware that this game is sorta old.\n-Controls feel less floaty than half-life 1 but there's still some slip n sliding.\n-The combine is a painfully easy enemy throughout the entire game and even when their ranks change.\n-Cutscenes are replaced with you being essentially trapped in a box and forced to listen to dialogue every playthrough. There are four instances of this happening throughout the game but all are spread vastly apart from eachother.\n-The games puzzles and other logic based conundrums are bonehead easy and will just seem like annoyances on successive playthroughs. Sad part being this seems to be the games only ace in the hole as it will sometimes FORCE mundane puzzles(hope you like box stacking) on the player in order to continue.\n\nThis game is about as much of a must have as the first one. I picked the entire series up in a frantic buy in a summer sale and it was worth it. The game is very replayable to me, i went through it about twice a year ever since i picked up the orange box for the xbox 360. The game has some very valid criticisms from fans of the original and while i see almost all of them i still can't help but come back. if anything it's textures for gmod if you don't have much interest in it.\n\n9 more crowbars out of 10\n\nNext up is Half-life 2: Lost Coast."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505481610, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500151", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34971632", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198355635087", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1505479005, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 804}, "timestamp_updated": 1505481610, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Half Life 2 might not have been such an amazing experience as the first game was first time playing it, but very cool indeed nonetheless.
