It\u2019s a steal when on sale for 75% off but the collection is normally only $25 and totally worth the asking price in my opinion. I didn\u2019t want to review all 3 games and their expansion pack material separately, so I figured I\u2019d simply do a review for QUAKE III and do a brief breakdown for all titles.\n\nQUAKE: It\u2019s dark and creepy atmosphere takes a page from Lovecraftian lore and though its dated appearance and overly dark lighting (for some reason you can\u2019t seem to adjust the brightness at all, or at least I couldn\u2019t) may turn some off from playing this game, it still has a lot to offer whether you\u2019re a fan simply looking for a little bit of nostalgia from a beloved shooter series or a gamer merely looking to partake of some classic gaming and you\u2019ve heard the word \u2018QUAKE\u2019 thrown around for a number of years and figured it was about time you got around to checking it out. This game singlehandedly gave birth to speedrunning and rocket jumping in FPS games. Even if you don\u2019t want to give it a spin, or its 2 mission expansion packs (both just as good as the core game and they still maintain the Lovecraftian element but with some Egyptian elements as well), at least check out all of the crazy \u2018QUAKE done quick\u2019/\u2019QUAKE done quickest\u2019 videos and I think you\u2019ll agree that you can at least appreciate what QUAKE did for the FPS genre, if not the game itself.\n\nQUAKE II: A change in both tone and style (no more Lovecraft, total sci-fi setting now), this game will likely be much more enjoyable to play than its predecessor for most people. It is graphically much more impressive and the particle effects are real!! Seriously, they look great and the lighting in the environments is much better than the doom/gloom of QUAKE. Even without the inclusion of Lovecraftian lore/enemies, there are still some disturbing biomechanical abominations to go along with the sci-fi setting, so that\u2019s a good thing. Also, just like with QUAKE, there was sadly no music, at least for me, but the sound effects are good and it\u2019s still fun to play. Oh yeah, you can now look around with your mouse. Sure, that\u2019s nothing new per se but when coming from QUAKE and going directly into QUAKE II that\u2019s going to feel new and revolutionary all over again. Both expansion packs are just as good as the core game and combined, they at least rival its length if not surpass it.\n\nQUAKE III: Totally awesome! It\u2019s basically just Unreal Tournament Quake style w/ a crazy mix of characters/boss characters (essentially just regular characters but tougher) running around at a super high framerate, each trying to out-kill the next guy. This game makes me wish I would have been into the whole multiplayer deathmatch thing back when it first came out, but it also makes me glad that we now have QUAKE: Champions and there is still supposedly a reboot coming our way that would pull mostly from QUAKE and its Lovecraftian themes. I haven\u2019t tried QUAKE III: Team Arena yet but I figure it\u2019s mostly the same thing albeit with team deathmatch added into the mix."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504928691, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500062", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34828337", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198012002903", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1504935607, "num_games_owned": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 156}, "timestamp_updated": 1504928691, "received_for_free": false, "review": "You want some arena shooter action?
