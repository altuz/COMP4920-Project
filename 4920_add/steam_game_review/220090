The gorgeous backdrops each have subtle animated highlights which really bring the scene to life, are varried and feel alive. The self proclaimed Afro-Caribbean theme is handled well and lends a uniqueness to the game. I really enjoyed that traditional tribal masks and symbols influenced design. The puzzles were fun but are definitely geared towards casual p&c players, not puzzle veterans. \n\n      The $9 price tag seems a bit steep for 2-3 hours worth of content but when you consider a movie ticket is $15 and you don't get to keep the movie, it's not that bad. I think that if you get it on any kind of sale it's 100% worth the cost of entry.
