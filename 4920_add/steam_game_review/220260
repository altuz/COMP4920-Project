Driving that truck was some tranquil fun. However, just a few minutes of Farming Simulator 2013 felt very bleak, stark, lonely, and other related words. It's a big, empty field with farm equipment sitting around, waiting to be operated, and it feels more like a sandbox than a crafted experience like Euro Truck Simulator 2 was. In that, you have very clear objectives and above all else, a sense of purpose given to me by the game which I embraced. \n\nWith Farming Simulator 2013, you kinda have to make your own game out of it, sort of like much of Mine Craft and those sort of games where you're given the tools to have fun, but no one really bothered to design a curated series of objectives and goals for you. If you don't care about that, you might enjoy the game, but not having a sense of purpose in a game is a massive deal-breaker for me. If that's an issue for you, you may wish to pass on this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1502239212, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502239212, "votes_down": 7}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1304, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 159, "total_reviews": 1463}}
