It's good. Not fantastic or particularly memorable, but interesting enough that you keep playing.

His somewhat cringe-y, but still humorous dialogues make me smile like an idiot. \nThe only thing that bugged me is the gameplay. Without a controller it's a mess, and while I'm pretty good in these arcade-type games, I found it difficult to get SSS on every level.
