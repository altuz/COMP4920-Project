Yes he is still annoying, but I don't think he is quite as bad as he was in the original Deponia. Gameplay wise, things are pretty much the same as the original, but there have been a few added twists here and there that make things more fun.\n\nThe main wrinkle to things this time around is that Goal has three personalities now, and you can choose between each one, so if one of them refuses to do something, another may might react completely differently. Most of the puzzles are not too outrageous (a couple however are very \u201cout of the box\u201d) but there are occasions where you are doing the correct thing, just not at the right time, so you assume that is not the solution to the problem and move on (except it IS the solution)  Really, for most of the time you have a feeling that you know what you need to do, it's just figuring out how to actually DO it is the annoying part.\n\nBetter than the original in every way, if you want to keep up with Rufus and company, give this a go.
