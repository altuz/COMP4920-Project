It's basically pure trial and error. I guess there's something to be said for seeing all the animations, and you could say this is a game where the journey is more important than winning, but I just didn't think the animations were really [i]that[/i] funny, and it doesn't really excuse the poor design.

I wish there was a bit more logic to the madness of McPixel, then you could enjoy the nonsensical nature of it with more interactivity.\n\nAs it starts off with a loud explosion - showing no regard for the customers ears(better start this up at low volume) and the entire thing feeling like they used as few pixels as possible(it's blocky, even by pixel game standards) it feels too cheap for the $5 pricetag.\n\nIt's not bad; it just lacks polish.
