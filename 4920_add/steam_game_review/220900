Its gameplay is so shallow and its price so steep that I just can't recommend this to anyone, even if it is fun for sessions of 10 minutes. \n\nThe graphics are clearly upscaled which results in the game occasionally having blurry graphics and the sounds are actually pathetic. \n\nThe gameplay is all about cutting up trees, or pieces of lumber actually. You have to cut them up in a certain way and as fast as possible to gain enough points. At the end of a level is an animal that can be rescued by not cutting it up. Succesfully doing this will have the animal appear in your cabin.

Only evil, evil plants. As a plant hating vegetarian i approve (Please do imagine me seething and foaming at the mouth as hacking and slashing up the disgusting wood logs while laughing manically). I kid. Of course. No. But seriously. Death to plants!\n- Canadian simulator.\n- The sassy beaver is sassy.\n\nCons:\n- The intro to the level tends to get annoying over time with the whole cutscene that you just cannot skip no matter how much you bash your keyboard.\n- In order to purchase all items in the shops and try all the difficulties with different beards while having the comfort of being able to regulate the game difficulty with different syrups you have to play close to insane amounts of games to earn enough wood (currency),  Loses some appeal to me because of this as you need way too much wood to keep me motivated to earn it.\n- The noises of the animals tends to get annoying over time.\n- Somewhat replayable, but not really. I played it twice with a year between. Enough to forget the setup of each level. But the log tosses are always the same and if you replay it too shortly after last finishing (or have a photographic memory) you'll have memorized each log toss for each level.. if you're as anal about getting best possible ranking for each level as i am, anyway.\n\nSummary:\nA very good, charming game with a very calm demeanor to it. Although others may react differently as the tosses are timed I found it soothing rather than stressful and really rather funny. Keep in mind, though, that my humour is beyond ridiculous. \nFor me it was well worth the full price of the game and i enjoyed it enough to wish to support the developers enough to buy cards enough to get a full tier badge.
