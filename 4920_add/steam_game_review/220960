It cannot open files within a folder containing the same letters.\nThis error comes everytime one try to open a file by double clicking it from any filemanager or from explorer.\nyou have to open the folder manually within acdsee to see the files.\n\nIn its current state, i cannot recomend it. It has to be available without launching steam, or steam beeing active. and steam must stop logging the time you spend in it, it is not a game....
