After the big gun and Makron from Quake II are destroyed, the Terran Coalition of Man begins a full scale invasion of the Strogg home world. \n\nYou play as Mathew Kane, a man so far removed from other Quake protagonists it's almost like he showed up last second and they mistook him for the actual protagonist. Mathew is part of the elite Rhino Squad which consists of nine members, each of them has their own name and voice.\nI won't name them all. Because I don't care. \n\nQuake IV takes the same route Doom 3 did and steps away from the fast and frantic action of the previous games. While Ranger, Bitterman, and Sarge were these fast super gods that ran on a strict diet of steroids, poon, and Capri sun Jammers. Kane is more human, he's much slower and chunkier than his predecessors. \n\nThis actually gives credence to my theory that in the Quake universe, people actually get stronger and faster depending on how many other people are around them. The less people, the stronger they become. And since Kane spends the entire game with fellow marines, he's nowhere near as fast or as strong as Ranger or Bitterman, who dealt with everything by themselves because they are manly men. \n\nBut this isn't to say that Quake IV is bad, it's just different. Ravensoft did a good job fleshing out the universe and lore of Quake II while still adding their own pizass to everything. The Gothic sci-fi environments and chunky meat robots have been replaced with a more industrial horror science fiction setting. \n\nQuake IV's interpretation of the Strogg is this grotesque fusion of machine and human, a macabre rendition to their 1997 counterparts that are almost tame in comparison. The implants on even the most basic strogg soldier looks painful, like someone just kind of smushed metal limbs into a human body. The slack jawed look on the average grunt makes it look like the person that thing used to be checked out some time ago, and the larger forms all look so roided up and enraged that you can't help but be almost afraid of them. \n\nIt's sad as to how under appreciated the Strogg are in this day and age. Everything about them is just kind of terrifying. When you are inside a Strogg foundry or any building in general, you can find humans mutilated and strapped to machines, used like batteries or filtration systems, or even just a basic form of processing. The Strogg are completely anathema to humankind and Ravensoft did a good job getting that across. They're like the Borg but without the Borg's budget or those light show things from Spencer's Gifts. \nI like using the word anathema because it makes me feel smart. \n\nLike mentioned before, Q4 is much slower than previous games. But the trade off is you get some meaty feeling weapons. Each weapon feels impactful, makes loud noises, and does a decent amount of damage, making basically everything useful throughout the entire game. No weapon feels useless and you're rewarded with these big red splats whenever you hit your mark. You can also continue the time honored Quake tradition of turning your enemies into chunky soup, so that's also good. \n\nPart ways through the game, Kane is captured and turned into a Strogg. This would be a spoiler if they didn't keep advertising it in the trailers. As a Strogg, Kane is faster, has more health and armor, is bilingual, and is also less meaty. But what remains is very meaty. I like to use the word meaty because it makes you uncomfortable. Kane can also use those gross things on the wall and drink some sweet sweet Strogg juice to regain health.\n\nIt's actually a nice change of pace and makes the game feel like a more traditional Quake game. But you have to remember that Bitterman didn't need to get Strogg'd inside, he was just a man and a half right out of the box. \n\nBut the thing that got me is that very few people seem to mind that Kane is Robocop if Robocop was RoboKane. They just kind of radio out that Kane was Stroggified and, outside of a few mean comments, no one seems to care. You'd think Marines would see you from a distance and accidentally open fire or point their guns and go \u201cOh, it's you, Kane.\u201d or something. \n\nThe mean comments don't even make sense when you think about it. It's not like you went all Locutus of Borg and blasted a bunch of humans, they saved Kane before they got to install the \u201cKill all humans\u201d stuff into his brain. So they're just being mean and/or jelous because you can properly bunny hop now and they cant. You'd think they'd be more sorry for you than anything.\n\nQuake IV has multiplayer as well, but there were only 3 people playing when I checked so I didn't bother. Just play Quake III: Arena for MP. \n\nLike the other Quake games, there are different versions of Quake IV. And by \u201cversions\u201d I mean \u201cversion.\u201d\nQuake IV also launched on the Xbox 360, which is the first version I played back in the day. It controlled like crap and it couldn't hold a framerate, but it was still pretty fun to play. \nQuack IV also has mod support, with one of the big mods these days being False Dawn, a rather new mod for the game. It's pretty neat, you should check it out.\nThere is also Quake Wars, which is almost like a companion piece to Quake IV. It's a multiplayer focused battlefield style game set during the Strogg invasion of Earth. It's hard to come by, but last I checked there were still a few people playing it. I wouldn't mind Quake Wars suddenly making a comeback. \n\nAll in all, Quake IV is still a pretty solid game. It's not as fast and chaotic, or even as good as Quake or Quake II, but it's still a fun experience. Ravensoft did a good job nailing the atmosphere and fleshing out the Quake II universe, but it's just such a departure from the other games that it will probably ward off some people. But if you see it as more of a spin off to Quake II than a main sequel to the Quake games, then you'll probably have a good time. \n\nQuake IV gets a number out of a number. \n\nColorado River Toads secrete a toxin that contains 5-MeO-DMT and bufotenin. Do with that information what you will. \n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation]The Terran Curator of Man [/url]\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505044740, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502134", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34860127", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197983830693", "num_reviews": 32, "last_played": 1505044656, "num_games_owned": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 735}, "timestamp_updated": 1505044740, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A proper action-packed FPS.
