For being a small indie game on steam greenlight i spent more time and had more fun on it then some AAA titles i've played. Now thats not to say you'll love this game, it has bugs, annoyang build mechanics at times. but hell if you're interested why not buy it? :) just be warned the games not being developed anymore since the last update was september 2014 but in its current state it's playable, fun, and the bugs themselfs grant more challenge in my eyes. Love this game i r8 8/8 m8\n\nPS: i just noticed they stole a screenshot from my profile and used it on there store page without permission!

If you want depth and more complexity then get dwarf fortress, it's free.
