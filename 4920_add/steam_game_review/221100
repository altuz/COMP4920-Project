Every time I thought about buying it I would be bombarded with the always overwhelmingly negative reviews and that high price tag of 35 bucks (for a non AAA title that is). That would put me off for another 6 months. Then I'd come back 6 months later hoping something had changed, it had not. STILL negative, STILL expensive, STILL early access alpha. I'm not bagging early access games in fact I think they are better than AAA titles at times but DayZ just isn't one of them. There really is no excuse for the slow rate of development considering this is a TEAM that is working on this game, not just 1 guy or something. Bohemia Interactive is a studio of multiple devs supposedly \"working\" on this game but I genuinely question what they do at work every day because it doesn't seem to me like they've been all that busy in the past 3 or so years or however long this has been in early access for I've forgotten now. Either way, the game in its current state really isn't very impressive, yes it has some good functional mechanics like a unique inventory system (although I've found to be quite buggy and just uncomfortable to use at times) and solid graphics (nothing ground breaking but definitely not the worst I've seen in a game like this). Still however, the good does not out weigh the bad. When I eventually bought the game a few days ago after many years of waiting I hoped it wasn't going to be as bad as people had been saying. They were right. Upon loading up the game, straight away I found a bug. My character did not display in the Main Menu screen like it should or at least I thought it should have as there were many UI queues that made out it was supposed to be there. So I couldn't see my guy to customise him. Okay, I guess that can be excused since the game is early access after all albeit skating on very thin ice with its fans while continuing to be in this state. So I went on to connect to a server with the lowest ping I could find which was 50 so thats decent at least. I spawned in an open field not knowing what to do. There is no tutorial, no assistance at all in the game which means you need to source information from wikis or youtube or other people who you know already play the game. I think adding some sort of basic tutorial would be helpful in my opinion. Anyway after talking to some friends who knew the game already I quickly found I needed to make a knife and a bunch of other basic tools which could be done by finding a rock in the ground. After searching for some rocky ground I eventually found some and thats when a big old line of text just appeared in the middle of my screen in a really really ugly font. I mean this font is not what I would call a good font to be using in your game, it just doesn't look neat and tidy it looks basic like it was just thrown in there regardless of how bad it looks. There is only so much you can forgive an early access game for, thats at least 1 and a half strikes now in my book. So upon pressing the action key to search for a rock the text changes to say cancel action by pressing the action key again. It just feels clunky and robotic like the game is telling you exactly what it is doing all the time which I don't need to know. That leads me onto the animations. They aren't all that bad to be honest. I've seen far worse but of course much better also. The animation used when you search for items in the ground however really needs some work. It is not aligned it looks as though your character is waving their hands in the air. It's not that hard to change the animation to have the character kneel down or something and perform the same arm and hand movement down at ground level where they should be doing it. Little things like this can put people off a game if there are enough of them and they're not hard things to fix trust me I've made my own game I know how much effort goes towards certain things. One animation, a new neat looking font and a tweak of some code to show the player in the main menu screen should be but an afternoons work especially if there is more that one person working on the issues. You might be thinking \"Oh shut up you've only played 2 hours of the game you can't say any of that!\" well, firstly, it doesn't take more than a few hours to suss out a game and find its flaws (there's always at least 1 in any game) if you know what to look for and DayZ is no different. Secondly being in early access does give you a lot of leeway in the community and excuses you from some of the more minor faults in your game but particularly being in early access for so long couple with the fact it seems a lot of the old issues still persist to this day being unresolved entirely despite many reports from the community really doesn't garner a lot of respect from me as a consumer towards Bohemia. So, the verdict? In its current state 35 bucks is ridiculous to be charging for an early access title. This behaviour is typical of developers known across the lands as \"money grabbing a-holes\" which I really hope isn't the intentions of Bohemia but I can't be sure. I am aware the beta is coming \"soon\" but how long is \"soon\"? For all I know \"soon\" could mean 6 months maybe a year or more! They have long exhausted any trust they had to start with in the community, if they want to recoup any of their loses at all they need act right now and very very fast. I think for as long as this game stays around everyone is going to remember the early access days and never let Bohemia forget it, and rightly so, this is by far the worst the absolute worst early access progression I have ever seen in a game hands down. It has got so bad there are memes about it like this...\n\n\"2020:\nCall of duty 21\nHalf-life 3\nBattlefield 7\n...\n...\nDayZ Early Access\"\n\nWhen your game gets its own memes usually thats representative of the community liking it. However, in the case of DayZ that is the complete opposite. Bohemia, get a grip and get your act together please.
