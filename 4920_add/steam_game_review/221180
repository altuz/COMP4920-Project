Smart, simple, a cool and mysterious story with inspiring sci-fi elements presented in a mythical manner.\n\nThere are plenty of indie games that look really cool when you see their art and design that you think will be okay, then fall flat on their face with disappointing gameplay. Eufloria does not do that. It is amazingly fun and intuitive after a few minutes, with interesting challenges as you continue that make following the text based mystery even more exciting. It does get challenging, but if you need help, this is one of the only games with in-game hints that are actually super helpful. No random variables thrown in to frustrate you - if you mess up you know it's because you haven't figured out this tactic yet, not because the challenge is arbitrary. \n\nI did not know it was a hybrid RTS-Tactical Problem Solver. I just thought it looked pretty. I was very happily surprised that the game was basically exactly what I wanted.\n\nAbsolutely worth the full price.\n\nI got it on the summer steam sale for 3$ - I also got a bunch of others, and so far Eufloria is not only the best of them, but is carrying the banner for how good and indie game can be.
