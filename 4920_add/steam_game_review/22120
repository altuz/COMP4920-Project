[i]Black Plague[/i] is far more adventurous, filled with intriguing mythology, interesting puzzles, fantastic voice acting, and doesn't contain any ridiculously forced combat sequences that I took issue with in [i]Overture[/i]. Although, there are still a lot of issues with this game when it comes to graphical glitches and illogical gameplay.\n\nThe player continues where the story of [i]Overture[/i] left off, with the protagonist finding himself deeper in the mines in search for his father. Despite the developer's insistence to continue with a mostly silent protagonist, this time there are many eccentric characters to accompany the player on their journey, whether real or hallucinatory. The level design is also much more improved, containing many differing areas that do not overstay their welcome. My favourite sections of the game are the \"dream sequence\" type locations where developer, Frictional Games, really begins to show off their creativity.\n\nThere are no weapons with defensive capabilities, the only way to avoid enemies is to rely on stealth or through environmental elements, yet the enemies found in [i]Penumbra: Black Plague[/i] aren't ever as threatening (and frustrating) than the ones found in [i]Overture[/i] which is a welcome change. The puzzles are also not as strict or as involved and the solutions to these can mostly be found within the same room rather than having to venture across the map to find that one relevant item.\n\nThe sound design is fitting and the inclusion of additional voice actors, who can actually act, fill in what would otherwise be a dull and empty journey due to the silent protagonist trope. The directional sound for enemies is accurate enough that I was able to know when the area behind a door was clear of a patrolling monster.\n\nSome issues I took with [i]Penumbra: Black Plague[/i] include the absolutely ludicrous method of blocking doors where, once I had explored the opposite side of the door, realised it had been blocked by an empty barrel or a chair. These are things my character can pick up and fling across the room, not something that should be able to effectively block a door. There were also many instances of being blocked in a corner by the monsters as they devoured my face, with nothing I could do but accept my very slow and painful death. There was one strange glitch where the water completely stopped providing buoyancy and my character almost drowned as I climbed a ladder back up to the surface. Then there are the numerous typos and grammatical errors, too many to count. These sorts of issues really break my immersion of the game world and its internal logic.\n\nFrictional Games seem to have learned a lot with the development of [i]Penumbra: Black Plague[/i] as the game plays far better than [i]Overture[/i]. It's almost impossible to ignore how this series has progressed to the familiar gameplay and mechanics of [i]Amnesia[/i] but, for me, [i]Penumbra: Black Plague[/i] is where Frictional Games really hit their stride. The horror found here is far more psychologically subtle, where the player will be questioning whether the events happening right now are real or not."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505481881, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481887", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34971759", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198076221350", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1505480784, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2267}, "timestamp_updated": 1505481881, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The P.R. on this game says it relies on \"problem solving instead of mindless gore and violence.\" Maybe so, but this game makes the player work too hard to do something as simple as getting through a locked door. In fact, that's all this game is about, getting from one side of the room to the other, or finding a key to access the next locked room with another locked door. An additional problem is the English subscript. A phrase was written, \"There is know way.\" Hmm. Might we infer this game was not created in an English speaking country? I found it boring. The price was relatively cheap, but this game relies too much on moral sermonizing and an ethical \"message\" as a \"reveal\" at the end that supposedly makes the whole (boring) adventure worth the effort (and the money). That's not why I play games. I play for the exhilaration of winning against hard opponents and difficult environments. If I want sermonizing, I can go to church. You have no weapons, (though there are lots of monsters that ought to be killed) you must solve puzzles that are unnecessarily complicated (though the pay-off for solving the puzzle is very minor) and there is no spectacular \"Hurray\" moment after you figure it all out and the game closes. This game ought to be a add-on or a trailer for full-fledged adventure game, but not a stand alone. It's just too deficient in its content, mode and storyline to rate all the thumbs up it has been given."}]}
