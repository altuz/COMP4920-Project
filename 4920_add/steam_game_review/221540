Games have been devolving imo, to a cartoony appearance. Game creators think we want the bright colors ie: No Man's Sky, but it makes games look artificial, more unreal. The look of DGA was perfect and needed zero work. \nWith DG2 I'm finding it harder to differentiate between towers and I hate the way the HUD is now less informative. I loved that screen which showed us exactly what and when an enemy would arrive in DGA, but now I don't understand the icons. I have to relearn everything as pertaining to what I'm looking at. The new camera angles are awesome though. Idk? When something works....why do they change that?", "timestamp_updated": 1506786218, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506785639, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 668, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 176, "total_reviews": 844}}
