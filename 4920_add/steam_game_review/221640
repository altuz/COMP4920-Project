For over 40 years, he's been working on decoding the brain circuitry behind visuospatial integration and attention.  Very esoteric stuff.  To make a long story short, there's a point in the game about 10 seconds in, when the entire field starts to spin as a single frame of reference - i.e., your pure beleaguered triangle starts moving rapidly, but so do the walls.  My dad pointed out that if certain parts of your brain are working properly and you've played the game enough, those parts of the brain can learn to ignore the spinning and treat the field as stationary.  But that only works so far, and for the really hard levels, you might not get there anytime soon unless you have superb natural reflexes.  \n\nIn other words, this game is batshit crazy hard at first but there are verified and well-studied neurological reasons why it starts out hard and gets easier.
