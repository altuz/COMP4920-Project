They are both created by Frictional Games and share an almost uncanny amount of similarities in regards to art style, narrative, story, level design, gameplay, and puzzles - although the A.I. of the enemies in Penumbra is much worse. It's as if [i]Penumbra[/i] was a practice run in preparation for Friction Games' magnum opus.\n\nThere are an excessive amount of red herrings and redundancy in regards to inventory items and world objects. [i]Penumbra[/i] contains many useless inventory items such as the flashlight and glowstick that never need to be used due to how bright the game is overall, especially when crouching will also increase the brightness of the area around the player. This makes stealth incredibly overpowered; there is no disincentive to leave the comfort of darkness and to only crouch walk everywhere in order to easily bypass enemies. It would seem that the developers learned their lesson from this exploitative mechanic when they made [i]Amnesia[/i] as staying in the dark in that game will drain the player's sanity. There is no sanity meter here in [i]Penumbra[/i].\n\nThe silent protagonist is a tired trope, although there is dialogue in the beginning and some text near the end, the protagonist never speaks throughout the events of the game which makes for a boring experience. The enemies - which contain zombie dogs, spiders, and large worms - are more an annoyance than they are threatening and, while some of them can be easily disabled, others can not be effectively killed. There are a number of chase sequences that break flow of the game, where [i]Penumbra[/i] moves from a very slow, methodical, and deliberate pacing to a frantic \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" action platformer.\n\nThe engine of [i]Penumbra: Overture[/i] has many problems. I understand that it was first created to support 2D graphics and later adapted to 3D but there are issues that just don't make much sense to me, such as not being able to capture the footage with screen-recording software, graphical errors duplicating the screen as a picture-in-picture overlay, and camera culling where geometry will disappear when it reaches the edges of the camera's field of view. One instance of [i]Penumbra[/i] winning over [i]Amnesia[/i] is where the physics are taken more seriously here as objects feel they have real weight, meaning there are no ridiculous instances where I can fling heavy objects across the room with ease.\n\n[i]Penumbra: Overture[/i] is filled with puzzles where the solution contradicts everything the player has learned up to that point, requiring the player to unlearn and rebel against the vague rules it has set, such as placing gunpowder in a specific barrel that needs to be destroyed when all the other previous barrels in the game can simply be dismissed as filler set pieces.\n\nThere are a myriad of grammatical errors present that make it difficult to read certain passages of text. On that note, the tutorial text explaining what keybindings do are presented in a matter-of-fact fashion from the protagonist's perspective: \"if I want to grab something I should press LeftMouse\" is too jarring and immersion breaking. The text will also often dismiss itself far too early for me to read the entire sentence and, since inspecting items can sometimes not be repeated, means I would miss out on vital information.\n\nFrictional Games suffers from a lack of focus, in which they try to force so many different types of gaming conventions into an adventure horror game (platforming, object physics puzzles, vent crawling, running from danger) it starts to confuse what the game should be and takes away from the story. In regards to the story, Frictional Games also goes over the top with exposition. They are simply unable to contain themselves when it comes to story writing and their need to explain away what makes these types of games, and their mythology, scary - the unknown.\n\nMy playthrough of [i]Penumbra: Overture[/i] reflects my time with [i]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/i], where I began to dislike these games after the mystery and horror elements were replaced with platforming sequences, frustrating enemies, and the fear of the unknown diminished to a laughable level.\n\nThe final 10 seconds were the scariest, and most interesting, part of [i]Penumbra: Overture[/i]."}]}
