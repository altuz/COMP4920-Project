Many sore spots of the genere (such as having to click everything) have been cleverly ironed out, the scope of any given puzzle was limited. Most puzzles felt fair.\n\nThe art (3d rendered, cutaway side scroller) I felt was particularly pretty. I laughed at the jokes and enjoyed the overall story.\n\nMy one complaint was the repetition. There are seven characters and you play a game with three of the characters at one time. There are three common levels you have to play through in each play of the game and in addition to this, each character has a unique level. Thus if you want to see all levels (they are worth it) you have a decent amount of repetition ahead of you. While repetition in some games may be fun, I think it is less fun in a puzzle game. I'm surprised the developers didn't give the player a mechanism to skip these levels if you had already completed them. There is already a mechanism to skip the levels of characters that you're not playing with.\n\nThat's a minor criticism. It only matters if you enjoyed your first playthrough so much that you're ready to go back for more.", "timestamp_updated": 1502655433, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502655433, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34048565", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501361", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501975238, "steamid": "76561198088818372", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "An amazing game with a well created story and gameplay. 10/10", "timestamp_updated": 1501975330, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501975330, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "33599003", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498564", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1489800292, "steamid": "76561198031390153", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "We played through it two or three times to try out the different characters, but, apart from the character-specific rooms, their different powers don't really matter.
