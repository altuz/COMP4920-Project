Completed and loved it so much, I bought the rest of the Book of Unwritten Tales series!\n\nThe puzzles sometimes don't make sense (game humour logic) or can get very challenging, but if you figure it out without peeking at a walkthrough there's an immense sense of satisfaction. (No shame if you do look at a guide, sometimes I just don't know what I missed out despite combing the scene over.)\n\nPros:\n+Great graphics\n+Hilarious dialogue, great voice acting\n+Decent storyline and characters with personality\n+Mix of easy and difficult puzzles\n\nCons:\n-Like a few others, the game kept crashing in the Yeti cave at a certain part. I figured out how to workaround it after searching some solutions on forums. Here are some common workarounds you can try (may or may not work for you depending on individual):\n1. Disable steam overlay\n2. Verify game authenticity in settings\n3. In the Yeti cave, once you get to \"that part\" that keeps crashing, first you [spoiler] tie the string on the pepper shaker and place on the scales, then once you put the can on the scales IMMEDIATELY click the lampshade[/spoiler] to solve the puzzle and trigger the rest of the animation.\n\nOverall 9/10 recommend this game (had to take some points away cos of the crashing issue).", "timestamp_updated": 1499167327, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499167327, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 95, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 23, "total_reviews": 118}}
