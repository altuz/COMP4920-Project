and not at all worth it) \n-Less insightful than people give it credit for\n\nOverall: I almost feel bad for not recommending this game. I enjoyed it thoroughly. For about 10 minutes. In my opinion its main flaw is the fact that there are other games with more engaging stories that are cheaper. As satire it succeeds on the humor front but doesn't say anything especially profound. It wraps up its lesson nicely in the first few minutes and then proceeds to repeat it as many times as possible in case you somehow didn't get the point. Then revelation will kick in: We are all Stanley. Our choices don't matter. We are all doomed to play mediocre and overhyped games. \n\nRating: 4/10", "timestamp_updated": 1506427605, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506427605, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35169187", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494012", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1385625242, "steamid": "76561198017960033", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 165, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "i guess its cool but its too hard frankly", "timestamp_updated": 1506221327, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506221327, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34950950", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492783", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504470238, "steamid": "76561198058813482", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Absolute waste of time in my oppinion.
