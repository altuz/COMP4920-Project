One of the few FPS games I've played with melee combat other than a single fist or foot to use it, nonetheless, left me a bit frustrated at times as switching between attackers could be hectic and imprecise. Many times I found myself punching someone other than my intended target. The weapons were nice and few, forcing the player to rely upon their melee skills much of the time. I enjoyed the imagination which went into the rather well done characters (for the most part), though the number of character models seemed limited and I was either fighting the same characters most of the time or there were are number of twins and triplets. Sometimes the AI seemed confused and fought amongst itself or simply waited for the one in front of it to die before attacking. These are all rather small gripes in the grand scope of the game. My only real gripes were the short game play (3 hours) and the story was decently predictable and could have used some polishing. The voice acting felt a bit strange in the beginning but I warmed to it by the end. Not a bad game at $15 but I'd wait for it to go on sale to feel like you are getting your money's worth."}, {"votes_down": 11, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504925523, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472981", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34827687", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198059759140", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1472157462, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 187}, "timestamp_updated": 1504925523, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game isnt worth it. It looks horrible, the gunplay is bad, and the close quarters combat is worse. Everything feels slow and powerful in the worst ways. it made me grind my teeth every time i had reload the awful guns, and fight the same exact enemies over and over."}]}
