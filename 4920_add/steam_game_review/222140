But so many things are wrong here.\n\nGameplay-wise, all you can do is tilt your screen left and right. Which gives you minor control over the liquids. I hate that the automatic camera is going down the path so fast, causing you to lose your liquid just because it's out of your view. It sucks. I wish I had more control over the liquids' movement. Also, many liquids aren't working in the game like they'd work in real life. For example, water, coffee etc are too goo-ey and slow. You'd expect them to go must faster. I'd call them \"imaginary liquids\" because I feel like there's was not much research done about the actual physics of the liquids.\n\nI bought it because it looked fun and pretty in the videos. But due to this frustrating gameplay I am not able to reach the final stages. It's not trash though. But it's the kind of game that will sit and rot in your library. Whether you should buy it or not depends on your patience.\n\nI really love the art, and the music though. All those little sciency details and jokes are fun. It's very creatively done.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is beautiful, kiiinda fun, but average. The difficulty can also make you pull your hair, due to the gameplay flaws I mentioned above. 4/10.", "timestamp_updated": 1504958429, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504958092, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 126, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 60, "total_reviews": 186}}
