Solve logic puzzles and fight with monsters to uncover secrets, punish all the villains and rescue the princess.\nHamlet is a very short room-by-room puzzle adventure, more of an art showcase than a full video game. Still, the absurd humour splashed on the classic stage play may find its way to the appropriate audience.\nKey Features\nIn the best traditions of classic adventure games,The first indie game in the world based on Shakespeare's Hamlet,25 levels,Boss battles,Logic puzzles,No inventory\n\n[u]Release Date: 22 Oct, 2012[/u]\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\nTo carry out this epic quest, our Hero must solve a series of puzzles, arranged in a format that would fit web-based games: you are presented with a single scene, and you need to manipulate objects to be able to leave the room. Some of the puzzles are straightforward, some need good reflexes, and some are really devilish in design by looking extremely difficult, yet having a painfully simple solution.\n\nAll in All [u]Hamlet or the Last Game without MMORPG Features, Shaders[/u] is a really nice Point & Click Game!\n\n8/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep[/i]", "timestamp_updated": 1503689015, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503689015, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33959916", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495318", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500327611, "steamid": "76561198098055486", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Hamlet is a cute little point and click adventure game. Though the puzzles can sometimes be complex, it's pretty easy to zip through this game in one sitting. I liked the gameplay, and the puzzles, personally. The music notes puzzle was the most infuriating of the bunch, tbh. The storyline was fairly short and to the point, but I could easily see the influence it had from the original play. I enjoyed the elements of storyline.
