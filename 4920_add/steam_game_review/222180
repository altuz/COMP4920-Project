The puzzles have multiple ways to get by for the most part in the beginning of the game. Then the game quickly progresses to a harder bit more fast paced platformer with one solution puzzles. The whole time your going there is a wierd princess following you that has seemingly a crush on you but wants you for desert.\n\nThe art and cinematics are amazing as well.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5pql_h9M3w", "timestamp_updated": 1426461627, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426061052, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "25518972", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507576", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1473982343, "steamid": "76561198043911027", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "As much as I loved the Mushroom Men game on the Wii I this game doesn't really feel like a Mushroom Men game. It feels more like a puzzle game with \"Mushroom Men\" just slapped on so fans of the original game will play it. Now the game feels a bit like a Catherine clone, (another game I enjoyed playing) but with much more difficult puzzles to solve. Your biggest enemy will be the jump button as there is a big delay in the jump which will lead to you falling. The lack of checkpoints also make the game frustrating if you come to a diffuclt puzzle and fail to complete it in time you have to start the level all over again. Though fun for the first few hours it gets old fast. I recommend getting the game while it is on sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1473982921, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1473982921, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "15265662", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502464", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1435752587, "steamid": "76561198121485182", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "First off if you've played the other 2 games,chances are you already bought this/are thinking of buying it. If you have,this game dosent spoil anything from the first 2. That fact aside, Pros: This game is one of the best optimised pc games ever,the graphics are phenominal,the gameplay is very solid,and the challenge level is fair. Cons:music is recyled from the spore wars and the keyboard controls are a bit confusing. All in all,if you even remotley like puzzle platformers,this should definitley be a game you should play!
