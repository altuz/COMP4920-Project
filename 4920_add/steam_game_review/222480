That's not to say it is without action, because there is plenty of that, but the game feels genuinely scary at times and the atmosphere and music help reinforce that.\n\nThe storyline is not too bad, and your typical RE experience as far as that goes. Graphically, the game is very impressive - or was on the 3DS when it was originally released. Being ported to the PC however, it does look better than it did on 3DS thanks to the dramatic boost in hardware capabilites, but it is still not on par with the best of what PC can provide. Character animations and voice acting are good. Enemy design and animations are also good. and creepy. \n\nIn all, this game has been the most fun i've had with an RE game since RE4. If you havent played it yet, or are new to RE games entirely, give it a try! --side note, if you are unfamiliar with the RE storyline and lore, this games story will likely not make much sense to you. But it doesnt really take away from the game.", "timestamp_updated": 1505165505, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505165505, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34891155", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505167146, "steamid": "76561198037502679", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I only played through it as a campaign.\nI actually enjoyed the story in this game.

Characters besides Chris and Jill are not very interesting. Also, the Raid mode is not that fun here, and not many people play it at all.
