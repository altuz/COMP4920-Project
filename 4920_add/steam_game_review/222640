It looks good graphically, it is balanced really well and the combat plays like simpler version of the good old isometric RPGS.\n\nThe only thing it doesn't necessarily deserve is the RPG tag as there are no dialogue choices or any choices whatsoever regarding the story. The player is railroaded through the entire game and more often than not cannot even pick his party composition of characters by himself. The story is entirely negligible as well.\n\nThe main reason why I still do recommend this title is because the combat not only works, but is really well done and made me feel nostalgic. As a tactical fantasy game it does succeed, just don't except it to be a RPG experience.", "timestamp_updated": 1501655111, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501655111, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34583247", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502274", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1496356732, "steamid": "76561198018544554", "num_games_owned": 856, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The combat system in this game is its main selling point as far as I'm concerned and it is a fairly unique combat system that makes every fight a kind of puzzle challenge. The way the combat works is a mash up between party based real time with pause crpgs such as Pillars of Eternity or Baldur's gate with a MOBA. it does this by giving you 8 heroes to select from, 4 being useable at a time each with passives and 4 abilities that can be skill shots, AoEs or instants. the fights themselves play out in real time but the game is pause-able at any point and commands can be issued while paused. This turns every combat into a puzzle like encounter where you will want to read the enemy abilities, look at what buffs and debuffs can be applied, identify which targets need to be brought down first and aggro management which made almost all the fights engaging and require some thought instead of having completely forgettable trash encounters. The games length is perfect I feel for the combat system not to wear out its welcome at around 12 hours though I would be up for re-experiencing this combat system if used in another game or simply replaying this one. Issues come in unfortunately with the other aspects of the game such as the voice acting being pretty questionable, the characters being forgettable and the story feeling like its really just there to give a break from the combat sequences, which while appreciated I wish these elements were stronger as there is some cool design work and world building going on, just not enough is done within this rather compact experience. Overall this game left me feeling really positive towards it even if I had to question my competency many times from the frequent deaths I would suffer.", "timestamp_updated": 1504028534, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504028534, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34364480", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489078", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1484101231, "steamid": "76561198031201473", "num_games_owned": 468, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It was meh.

This game is very demanding of the player, asking of exact positioning, use of all your various abilities and strategies and punishing of mistakes. The difficulty is also set very high, it's not easy, medium, hard, it's more on the Super Hexagon Scale, hard, harder and harderest! Though I think the latest patch may have toned the difficulty down a little bit. But, don't let that scare you off as you'll miss one of the best tactical RPGs in years! Game play focuses primarily on a group of four characters, each of the characters have their own designated role within a group, such as tanking, healing and damage dealing. You will unlock more characters by progressing through the story mode however you can only have four characters in your group at any one time, meaning squad management plays a key role in success. Whilst each of the characters have their own primary role, there is some overlap with a few abilities, such as damage dealers may also have a healing spell to help out if needed, and healers will also have damage dealing spells. All characters have an \u201cauto attack\u201d which means your healers are still important when it comes down to burning enemies quickly. \n\nWhilst the gameplay is mostly played in real time, the pause mechanic allows you to break from the mayhem in the fight to plan out your next wave of attacks and precisely move your group members around the battlefield. Certainly worth having in your library if you are into this type of genre.", "timestamp_updated": 1500946644, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500946644, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 221, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 54, "total_reviews": 275}}
