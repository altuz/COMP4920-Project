As the cheeky Rick Rocket you begin the game at the end as you fire the last bullet into a formidable robot and save the galaxy from certain doom, only to plunge into a time vortex mere seconds later. Now you have to move backwards in time undoing your past deeds in order to keep the time continuum in tack (and more importantly Rick's reputation). \n\nLucky for you it seems Rick and the enemies he fought have a musical mind about them and have timed every shot and movement to the notes of songs, which is where you come in. For anyone who's played a Guitar Hero, Rock Band, or Dance Dance Revolution game this is going to feel right at home. Color coded bullets and obstacles come at you from the side of the screen, and you need to hit them in time with the beat and melody of the song to clear them. Where Retro/Grade differentiates itself is that while you are clearing your own notes (read: bullets) you also need to be dodging the enemies attacks as well, which range from lasers to giant robot legs to maze like bullet patterns and more. It's hard to truly understand just how it works until you've played it yourself, but it's the sort of idea that is so inherently brilliant that it makes you wonder how no one came up with it before.\n\nRetro/Grade's soundtrack is atypical of the games it emulates,. A collection of electro tracks with a serious groove to them, full of catchy riffs and fantastic breakdowns, it's impossible not to bob your head to the beat along with Rick. And what music game is complete without flashy epilepsy inducing visuals? The presentation on the whole is top notch, and the little details like the way enemies reconstruct themselves as you fly backwards and bullets suck themselves back into the barrels they came from add a lot of character.\n\nI do have one major problem, and that is there is both too much and too little here. There are only ten tracks to play, which while I wouldn't say any are bad, even the best songs become tiresome after you have heard it twenty times over a few hours. I also felt that the actual tracks dragged on longer than I would have liked, which is made worse by the repeating backgrounds going on behind you. \n\nGoing through story mode will likely take you under an hour to complete, but what is irritating is that you can't raise your difficulty without starting over from the first stage. There are challenge levels which unlock after you have completed the campaign, but here the repetition of the soundtrack becomes hard to ignore as there are dozens of challenges to complete all utilizing the same pool of songs. Had the existing tracks been cut short and a few more added I would have likely completed a lot more of them, but after a while I began to resent the game for making me replay what felt like the same stage again and again.\n\nBecause of the short tracklist it is a bit hard to recommend Retro/Grade at full price, but at a discount it is definitely something worth checking out. The basic ideas are very clever and I found it a lot of fun despite lacking much staying power. Although my preferred way to play was with an old guitar controller, you can certainly manage with either a controller or keyboard (albeit on lower difficulty settings), and each provides an interesting dynamic. If you were among the many who lamented the decreased innovation and change in the Guitar Hero games but never quite got sick of basic gameplay you will likely find Retro/Grade to be a very pleasant surprise.", "timestamp_updated": 1387177965, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1387177965, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "8683670", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513025", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1470576986, "steamid": "76561197998590461", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "a music/space shoter that you play in reverse, staring at level 10 and going back to level 1. people may this game samiliar to games like, guitar hero, but here you have to control a ship up and down and unfire your shot's, not only that, but you must avoid the enemies shots, which are comeing from behind you. its realy fun and a good challenge, and with 6 difficulties, each with 10 levels, and 130 challenge levels, unlockable ships, artwork, music for the in-game music player and cheats, it shuld keep you busy for some time, you can even play with both keyboard, controler, and a guitar.

It suffers from a number of issues, but it's still worth your time and money, if you're into this genre. \n\nThe graphics are very well done, but they're too obtrusive, often obscuring vital information. It's strange to see such a big focus on the graphics, when rhythm games function almost without any graphics. It's about timing and precision. The game has several little details on bosses and backgrounds that are lost, since you can't be appreciating how pretty a game looks when playing a game of this type that requires lots of concentration.\n\nOh well. It does have some options to disable effects and add guide-lines, so the problem can be diminished.\n\n\nThe game only has 10 songs, and thus, 10 levels on the campaign. While that may sound very little, take in mind that there are 6 difficulty settings, which creates different levels, effectively. It also have a very extensive challenge system. Too extensive, honestly. The challenges are the same levels as in the campaign, but they start in lower difficulties, and progressively introduce higher ones. They also change rules and unlock a ton of extras. They change color lanes, mirror things, some require perfect timing, etc. etc. Very cool!\nHowever, having 130 challenges does get painfully slow.\n\n\nThe biggest problem, in my opinion, is how the game never explains itself very well. It's a big issue regarding controls and higher difficulties. While it supports Guitar, Controller and Keyboard, using Keyboard is almost impossible in the 2 highest difficulties. \nI was playing with a controller. It was wonderful. The controls were perfectly timed with the songs, and it felt really good! Until I reached that difficulty wall. So, I tried to find my guitar hero controller and play with it. Well, at that point, it was very difficult to transition between the 2 controllers, with wildly different control methods. \nI had to go back a few difficulty levels and relearn everything, with a less interesting game, as the levels were slower than what I was used it.\n\nAll of that could have been avoided if the game was more transparent. Unfortunately, since it didn't do well on Playstation, the developer decided to shift focus away from the guitar... which was a poor decision, in my opinion.\n\n\nSo yeah, it's not perfect. There's a song that has an awkward transition, but all of the rest are really fun to play! They all have different sections, connecting the songs with the levels very nicely.\n\nIt's not a genre that we see often on PC, so definitely give it a go, it's great!\n\nP.S.: I played 10.6 hours without any issue of this sort, but the game just reset my progress after this whole time.

I've been a fan ever since the 2008 IGF demo and still keep coming back to the game every now and then. There are certainly better rhythm games, some of which are free, but there's plenty worse and few are as unique or as visually stunning as this one is.\n\nThe basic principle of the game is that not only are you playing a rhythm game, but you are also playing a shoot em up (in reverse!) which means you have to dodge enemy bullets coming from behind you at the same time as trying to hit the beats in front of you. This forces you to play different as you can't always line up in advance to hit the next beat; you may have to swerve around an incoming bullet. Sometimes there are sections of the song entirely based around avoiding enemy bullets giving you a slight break from all the chaos whilst still keeping you on your toes. It's a simple addition which adds a lot of depth and challenge to the game.\n\nFor me the difficulty felt just fine. It starts easy enough and steadily progresses harder. You are afforded plenty of mistakes and you can even rewind so it's very forgiving. There's two modes: Story mode and challenge mode. Story mode is just a straight progression through the game's 10 levels whilst challenge mode offers over 100 challenges with various stipulations such as playing at a faster speed or playing the track mirrored. The problem is that progress in one does not affect the other; story progress does not unlock challenges. If you complete the story, you'll have to start from the very beginning with very easy challenges for a long while before you can unlock challenging ones on par with the last mission.\n\nAnd while it looks beautiful, the visuals are sometimes a bit too much especially with songs that use all 5 lanes. Even with beat lines enabled it is sometimes hard to tell what's going on. However I find using the mono cheat which changes all the beats to one color and enemy bullets another significantly improves visibility and I would highly recommend it if you have issues. And the music is well composed but it's not very exciting and there are only 10 tracks.\n\nBut it's still a lot of fun. It's very mechanically solid and well polished. It supports pretty much any controller including a Guitar Hero or Rock Band guitar. An awful lot of work was put into this game and for the most part it shows.
