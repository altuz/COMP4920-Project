Granted, it's a little Black & White-ish, but that might be mostly coincidence.\n\nWhere the game falls short for me is in the execution of that concept: You are given the giants, a quick tutorial explaining how things work in the game, and then you're off to play 30-to-120-minute sessions of cultivating life, settlements, projects and the gradual unlocking of your various giants' powers. Sound intuitive enough? ...Yeah... it could have been.\nBut here's the thing: it isn't.\n\nFor starters, you've got your plants, minerals and animals to keep track of, with two types of each, in two out of three cases distributed between different giants. Depending on what terrain you place something on, it will create a different base object: Blueberries from creating a fruit plant in grassland, elderberries if you use the same ability in a swamp.\n\nThen you've got the 'aspects', such as the fruit aspect and leaf aspect, which are used to both increase the output of a resource (or some other characteristic) and to allow you to evolve it into a completely different, though usually more powerful thing of roughly the same purpose: A strawberry plant from a blueberry plant, for instance. These aspects come in different potency levels, and to ensure you get a strong enough aspect for the mid-range evolutions, you need to first use the forest or ocean giants' fertility-boosting abilities. To ensure a strong enough aspect for the really neat stuff, you additionally need to specialize your giants to the point where even in the fairly late stages of the game, you won't have access to all of their abilities, which can become problematic if you suddenly find yourself in dire need of the thing you didn't pick. This happens a lot.\n\nFrom each base plant, mineral and animal, you usually have two options of what to evolve it into; more rarely, one. Which you pick usually depends on what you need: For a village to grant you an ambassador with which to upgrade your giants, you need to help them build increasingly demanding projects by providing them with resources. Again, this sounds fairly intuitive, but quickly becomes convoluted, especially later on; you have a limited number of tiles claimed by the village, and the sheer amount of food, gold or technology (the three main 'resources' humans use) needed for the final tier of village projects is frankly ridiculous. There is no doubt an ideal way to produce the right mix of resources for each endeavor, but you will need to be so mind-numbingly efficient about the exact placement of each and every resource that it sucks the fun right out of the game. Some of the evolutions are incredibly arbitrary; for instance, you might be able to evolve the same advanced fish from either a basic 'exotic' (gold-yielding) fish or 'livestock' (food-yielding) fish, based on which aspect you give them. Not only that, but to get the same fish out of different fish, they must be given different aspects, which means the fish you started with affects which aspect the evolved fish will have locked into it. This sort of thing only further tangles some evolutionary trees that are already very convoluted, and turns resource-management strategy into a sort of chess game where you have to play seventeen moves ahead in your mind...\n\nAdd to this the very large number of mineral, plant and animal tracks there are to keep track of, and how random some of their synergy properties are (which, as you may guess, are not optional to exploit to the maximum possible)... and we have a memorizing-random-trivia simulator topped with a hefty dollop of obsessive micromanagement, masquerading as a god game about a planet and its giants.\n\nI could go on to mention how if you do too well at providing the villages with resources for their projects, they'll get greedy and start attacking each other and eventually your giants, potentially ruining a great deal of progress and/or ending your game early the moment a giant is killed. I could mention how there are two additional 'resources', danger and awe, whose only real purpose apart from triggering or supporting a few oddball synergies is to suppress the aforementioned buildup of greed, generally rather inefficiently. I could go on to say that it's generally not even worth bothering with those, as dangerous animals tend to be hunted down and wiped out by the village, whereupon they will resume their greed buildup, and awe is so ridiculously hard to accumulate significant amounts of that you may as well not bother, especially as you're constantly on the timer to gather enough resources for the next project before you lose a chance at the next ambassador to upgrade your giants with. I could mention that the projects themselves provide bonuses, that there are many projects, and that each project and upgrade stage of a project has its own little selection of potential bonuses; you can never tell just by looking and seeing that there is a market, that the market is providing a given bonus; you have to click on it and read the tiny text to find out what it's selling in this particular instance. And I suppose I have mentioned all of those things... for better or worse.\n\nAll in all, Reus is a game that could have been fun, cozy, casual, relaxing. As it stands, it is very little of any of those things. Instead it is a confusing mess that I can only recommend to people who are extremely confident in their ability to retain obscene amounts of arbitrary information in their short-term memory, and who find enjoyment in showing off their ability to do so. For those like myself who prefer more intuitive and consistent gameplay patterns where you can just learn some basics, refine your skills and make up your own style of gameplay as you go along, this is sadly not the game you're looking for.", "timestamp_updated": 1505084154, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505084154, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1344, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 334, "total_reviews": 1678}}
