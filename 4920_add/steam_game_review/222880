The game is so awesome, I am suprised it Isn't more expensive\n\nIt feels awesome and satisfying to get a kill in this game as well, I haven't felt more victorious getting a kill.\n\nYou definitely need a normal Nvidia video card for this game, if you have a low end PC (Dell/Intel) you won't get the best frames. It would be best to follow the system requirements. Thank me later :D\n\nProbably the best thing about this game is that the community Isn't toxic. It's all the more silent than friendly or mean. (To me at least)\n\nI would rate Insurgency a 9.5/10. It has barely any cons, and It's very cheap.

One of them is that the bots turn into \"Zombies\". In this case they mostly have no weapons and act stupid, this makes it very boring because theres no challenge anymore.\nAaand there was one very stupid glitch where you flew in the air but this one doesn't matter anymore because they fixed it. One bug is still there but it doesn't appear that often, sometimes it happens that I can't see my gun or just the mag which makes it hard to aim. XD\n\nPROS: To my opinion the whole game is a pro.\nThere is no shooter I can compare with Insurgency. The tactical feeling is awesome because you have to communicate with your squad mates to achieve an optimal result. Of course you can play as a lone wolf and kill everything that comes in your way but I think playing as a team is the best experience. \nThe different gamemodes extend the game, so theres even more to experience. There are many weapons which are different in usage and appearance. \n\nYou can play as Insurgents or Security Forces. There is no campaign but therefor this game has a COOP and a Multiplayer Mode which is more than enough to my opinion. The graphics are good and the gameplay is smooth and great to handle.\n\nSo if you think of buying it, do that.

You will die with one or two hits by either friends or enemies.\n  [*]Teamkilling is not as bad is Rising storm Vietnam. The community is very nice. Players are friendly and patient towards everyone. More often than not you will be the last player and whole team will be dependent upon your ability to handle the pressure of taking an objective all alone. Let me tell you if you do capture the objective, it will give you the deepest pleasure this game has to offer and even if you don't you will never be chastised.\n[*] Coop mode is the best way to enjoy insurgency with friends.You\u2019d think that playing against bots will be easy, but on brutal difficulty you won\u2019t even know what killed you.\n[*]This game encourages you to play together with your squad. Although they have VOIP in the game but it will be much easier to just use Team-Speak or Discord.\n[*]As if the game wasn\u2019t hard enough the Night variants of the maps are terrifying.Yes you can use NVG but you will realize after sometime that it is not so useful as you thought.\n[/list]\n[*] Maps:\n  Insurgency has large and highly detailed maps. For example there are smartly placed cover items that can help you to device a tactical plan to reach an objective. Certain rooms are designed as Killbox if you won\u2019t play together you will die.\n[*]Modes:\nInsurgency has many different types of game modes but the ones I love the most are Checkpoint, Survival, Outpost , Skirmish,push and conquer.\n[*]Mods:\nSteam Workshop has some very nice mods. Gun skins, SFX , Maps , UI overhauls and many more.\n[*]Servers: \nEven though there are no local servers in my country (India) but there are multiple servers with below 60 ping and most of the servers possess 120 ticks.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] I have faced glitches while playing on server with 130-140 ping.This glitches can be benign such as momentary black screen or it can be fatal as a freeze.In addition to that I have also faced some server disconnection error but that can also be due to my ISP.\n[*] (Pro disguised as Con) AI is too smart on brutal their grenade throws and RPGs are too acurate and you will die most of the time when you hear \"RPG!!\" \n\n[/list]\n\n[b][I] TL;DR?
