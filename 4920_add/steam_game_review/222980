RCR with guns and zombies is a fun idea. Too bad the gameplay of DP is one-dimensional and boring. Instead of twin-stick running + aiming, the player attacks directly left or right and aims by moving up and down to align the player sprite with zombie sprites. Worse, if a zombie sprite collides with the player sprite, the player easily gets pinned at an angle that prevents shooting the pinning zombie.\n\nHaving said all this, DP would be an incredible Flash game to promote a reboot of RCR.", "timestamp_updated": 1507006791, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506483203, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35077452", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461993", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505872649, "steamid": "76561198373291040", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Damn har\u010f", "timestamp_updated": 1505881793, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505881793, "votes_down": 17}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 836, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 135, "total_reviews": 971}}
