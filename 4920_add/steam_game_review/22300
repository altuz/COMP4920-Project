Sure Fallout 3 is an old game, but who cares? I sure dont. Fallout 3 has a great storyline and amazing quests. It has a lot of amazing guns and armor, a huge map, around 4-6 Vaults, a few major factions and many minor factions, great DLCs and a HUGE modding community on the Nexus full of great mods. Yes, its a pain in the rear end to play on Windows 8 or higher, but very much worth it. If you're looking to spend some money on a game to play, Fallout 3 is the game to get.\n\nThe ONLY things I didn't like about Fallout 3; The fact that followers can and WILL die, the fact that it crashes every now and then for Windows 8 and higher users, and the few bugs and glitches in the game.\n\nSummary: I rate Fallout 3 with a 9.5/10.

Let's take a look at the pros and cons...\n\n[h1] The Quests: [/h1]\nThe quests have variety and don't get too boring. Although the minimap and compass is confusing and can be hard to navigate certain places. Certain stretches of land don't have too much happening aside from the occasional NPC, enemy, or location. Fast travel is useful and is going to be used a lot over the game. Another problem with the game is certain places lack more sidequests or interaction with a community after there is a major choice made. A good example of this is Megaton, the first town you encounter. After making a big decision, there is only 1 meaningful sidequest and doesn't give any attention to the town or characters, aside from Three Dog mentioning it on the radio.\n\n[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]\nGameplay is solid and with addition of VATS, it does stand out. Don't take VATS seriously, as in it is pretty goofy looking now, but I don't really mind it. Good variety of weapons and armor, so I think they nailed this pretty well. Another complaint is that the game doesn't become challenging. The AI is dumb, they don't hide or take cover from fire. After getting a couple of solid weapons, the gunplay is pretty consistent and no major challenges, not even from the main enemies. The only truly terrifying threat were the Deathclaws, and they are the hardest enemies. However, Deathclaws don't come up in the main quests so you are going to have to look around a bit to see them in action. There is a TON of content available, so that is a plus.\n\n[h1] RPG-Elements:[/h1]\nThe RPG elements are solid, but there is no \"moral grayness\" going on, which would be MUCH more interesting. Most choices are blatantly good and bad and you can tell which is which. The Karma system is implemented and tells you if you are a \"good\" person, or a \"bad\" person. Depending on how you look a this, it can be a negative since it doesn't let you truly think about what is the best course of action. I don't think it bothered me, so it didn't ruin my experience too much.\n\n[h1] Optimization: [/h1]\nLet me tell you straight up, THIS IS NOT OPTIMIZED. It will not run unless you install modifications. After installing them, it runs pretty well, even on a potato computer like mine. The gameplay is smooth and I encountered no lag. Besides the game not running at the beginning.\n\n[h1] Atmosphere: [/h1]\nFallout is known for its post-nuclear setting and RPG elements. I think the game nails the aesthetic well, but the color palate is lackluster, with only shades of grey, green, and brown. There is also the radio, which is spews out old 40s and 50s songs or patriotic American songs depending on the radio you listen to. You can also hear the effects of your actions on the radio, so it is a great addition to the atmosphere.\n\nPeople say New Vegas is better and the best modern Fallout game. I have not played NV yet so I cannot tell you if it is better or improved on the problems in Fallout 3.\n\n[h1] TL;DR The game is solid and is worth the price tag of $10. There is missed potential in the story, the quests, and gameplay. RPG elements can do an upgrade, AI could be smarter, story needs a more cohesive villain. Optimization is absolute trash and will not run unless mods are installed, but can run on a potato. Overall, solid game, worth playing.[/h1]"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506684440, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35290203", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198223939436", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1499230066, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 166}, "timestamp_updated": 1506684440, "received_for_free": false, "review": "i played this game many times on pc and ps3... a lot even with windows 10... a good game... but a few days ago it stopped and when i try to load a game or start a new one it crashed while loading....
