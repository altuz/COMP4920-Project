Yeah, I know it got slammed when it was released b/c of all the bad language, but you gotta admit,  for a laugh, you need to play this. Think of it like this, the more this game got slammed, the more people knew about it, the more popular it got. If you don't mind a really short game(2 hours), that does have bugs, and don't mind listening to  language that you wouldn't repeat in front of your mother, then buy this."}]}
