The storyline was fairly good.  There are some side missions, but generally all missions advance the story line.\n\nOne thing I would recommend is to get the \"gameplay\" DLCs and then play the game in this order:\n\nHomefront: The Revolution - The Voice of Freedom (DLC)\nHomefront: The Revolution (Main Game)\nHomefront: The Revolution - Aftermath (DLC)\nHomefront: The Revolution - Beyond the Walls (DLC)\n\nIMO, this will both allow you to get the full story, in order, AND bring you up to speed with this game's particular gameplay.  Sure, the looting system, etc. was different than other games, but, IMO, easy to adjust to.  Besides, I have yet to find the \"perfect\" system in any game as they all have their quirks.\n\nI did have a couple lockups and crashes during the course of playing the game, but I have definitely had more from other games.  I didn't find them objectionable.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game and would recommend it to others.  If you have a large number of crashes, it could be because of your system.  I've found that a weak power supply can cause a lot of problems when a system is taxed by some games.\n\nMy system: \n\nIntel I7-3770 (stock)\n32GB RAM\nNvidia GTX 780Ti\n1000w power supply (with a single 12v rail (important!))", "timestamp_updated": 1506386285, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506310394, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35112357", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506289", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494914033, "steamid": "76561198064721925", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Buy it on a SALE, otherwise you might be disappointed with what you get.\n\nIt's okay. Nothing ground breaking or spectacular but not completely terrible. It's just okay.\n\nThe gameplay could have been more refined, mechanics from other games could have been implemented to make it better. It's sort of like a Far Cry in a City - which is an interesting idea, (I was very much looking forward to this) but the execution just kind of missed the mark.\n\nUnlike Far Cry, there is no way to reset the Red Zones (enemy controlled areas) once you finish the game, so in terms of replayablility whilst keeping your upgrades, there isn't. Some of these upgrades are fun, but some of them you get while near the end of the game - leaving you wanting more time to play around with them but guess what? the game's over and you can't. \n\nEnemies can pop in behind you, sometimes even in front - just so that they're far enough. That's one of the problems, enemies can respawn just from a few meteres away - making sniping kind of pointless. You can snipe enemies, but as soon as you get close, they will have already respawned. \n\nThis sucks when you love long range, but it also affects players who like to play like assassin's/ninjas. You can sneak in a stronghold and knife everyone to your liking, but some times enemies will respawn literally seconds after you turn away and they'll sound the alarm.\n\nEventually, you'll get used to this and develop your own sense of where and when to be most cautious - so that you won't alert the whole block, it just sucks that you even have to worry about that in the first place.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the gameplay was OK, it's just not great. Small things like this detracts from the experience.

Things take a turn for the weird at the beginning. \n\n\nI played about 20 minutes of this game, and it was aaaalllllll cutscene, followed by a little walking, and more cutscene. And what happened in that cutscene? I saw two executions, got the childhood memories beaten out of me by my 'allies', ALMOST got tortured for information, with the assurance that my character would be dying faster or slower depending how much got spilled, and THEN FINALLY, the actual leader shows up. Now everything's supposed to be good? Fuck that. Fuck whatever mental handicap Dambuster thinks I have, fuck the resistance in light of THAT kind of reception, with only a couple people being... mentally stable, and the rest reminding me of the junkie raiders from Fallout. Developers, did you actually think that would be endearing? Get me to like the characters or their goal? Perceive them as any less evil than the occupation? Go on the resistance leader's say-so for help, to find two guys that want to kill you on the spot, then the \"more sensible\" one says no, bring him to the psychobitch with the torture fetish? \n\nI started actually playing the game after that, finally, and I gotta say... the actual game is actually halfway decent. Two hours of frantic run-and-gun later, and this review goes from a total panning, to admitting that the game really isn't that bad. I'm still hoping I see the eviscerated corpses of three specific people, but I'm... having fun.  The find-craft-use mechanic feels a bit farcry-ish, but it's believable and relatively enjoyable. The moddable gun thing? Kinda nifty.
