Oblivion, taking place in Cyrodiil, was modelled after medieval Europe. But Morrowind, it travelled in areas unknown, with a hint of Mongolian architecture every now and then. \n\nMorrowind is dangerous and beautiful, it's like a parent telling you \"you're responsible to make your own descisions, but be careful\"\n\nThere are no quest markers and no fast travel, so planning ahead and reading is very important to stop you from getting backtracked.  \n\nWhilst I appreciate how far TES has come at fixing problems and refining the series, something was really lost. Morrowind has some kind of charm to it. Being able to level up acrobatics by enduring fall damage and being able to superman jump if you dedicated enough time to it, making custom spells including levitation, faction notoriety and infamy. \n\nIf you're wondering on wether or not to get the game due to it's age, I'd would say yes, and this is coming from someone who started from Skyrim and worked their way down. \n\nThere's also the work of OpenMW, a standalone version of morrowind running on a more stable engine that has a fully working multiplayer and many bug fixes.

I played Oblivion but spent less time playing it and even less time playing Skyrim. (Skyrim was a bitter disapointment for me I'm sorry to say but better than Oblivion and Im still trying hard to get into it - Im not giving up that easily). \n\nYes Oblivion and Skyrim look better and the character movement doesnt look like they sh*t their pants. Yes I love the way archery works in these two games and even how melee combat looks (hence looks, not works). But goddamn did they take away vital elements of the game. The rpg and quest/storytelling in these two games are watered down and ultimately disapointing. \n\nYes, Morrowinds graphics are dated. Yes, you run around like you sh*t your pants.....Running speed is slow (at the beginning). If you are fresh to this game you will suck at combat (fatigue and weapon skill actually matters in this game). You will bump into enemies that you may not be able to defeat and may have to run away (get that eh, bet you never came accross that concept before). NPCs will dislike you. You will start with nothing. Your character is not special (at least in the beginning). \n\nBut these are some of the things (after a little patience and time) that I love about this game; \n\n-You can steal from the vaults of the three Great Houses of Morrowind (Im not talking about little trinkets either, and its no easy feat). \n-Become as powerful as a God (Many people have complained about this - but they never took into consideration that you actually fight Gods.)\n-Playing as a mage is amazing in this game. Yes you can craft your own spells, yes you can create powerful enchantments, yes you will become powerful in time. Yes you will break the game (but in a good way and its also ironic when you consider the main questline). \n-The other titles, Oblivion and Skyrim are missing some of the features that Morrowind has which makes me cherish this game more. \n-The game is hard, its unforgiving, it will punish you when you make a mistake or do not prepare enough. Want to visit the area beyond the ghost gate at level 1? Go ahead, you can try but ill guarantee you wont last five minutes in there - no I dont mean hanging around at the door at the gate for five, I mean actually venturing out there....(You will struggle to actually get to the fence/gate itself, likely get hunted down by cliff racers). But if you ever make it, its a real reward - just like everything else in the game. I also felt the later titles failed in this respect, I didnt really feel intimidated or concerned that I might get my a** kicked. \n-You cant become Arch-Mage at level 1 or with no magic skills at all. This ruined my experience with the later series. You need to actually be a mage to be arch mage, actually need to master some magic skills. Again, when you get there, rewarding. \n-You dont get quests like [url=http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=14422]this [/url]that insult your intelligence. The story telling and lore in this game are unmatched. \n-The main quest is epic. \n-The bloodmoon and tribunal (Solstheim and Mournhold) expansions are amazing. \n-The atmosphere and music is great. (Skyrim is great in this way too). \n-Stats. Yes stats, this is vital. It reduces the mindless hack and slash and encourages thoughtful decisions before entering combat. It gives you more options and choice on how to approach certain situations and opponents.  \n\nThis game is not for the impatient. Its not for the individual that wants to switch on the game and start a new character slaying monsters left, right and center. Its not for the gamer that needs quest markers because they cannot be bothered to pay attention to what they are actually doing (your character will die otherwise). \n\nBut I promise you if you are patient, you will be hooked. If you give this game time you will understand what all the fuss is about. Oh and one last thing its not nostalgia talking (okay maybe a little), Oblivion and Skyrim have as much depth as a puddle compared to this game. \n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505193254, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34895322", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198080078424", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1469815523, "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 9159}, "timestamp_updated": 1505193321, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This was the first game I ever played as a child (besides mesing around in my brothers Ocarina of Time) and will forever be my favorite game of all time ..
