This is a single-player action RPG in a fantasy setting, with first-person and third-person view options.\n\nThe first thing you encounter after the opening cutscene is a character creation menu, where you can enter your name, choose your race and gender, and customize your appearance. You can change the shape of your face by adjusting a series of sliders, much like some \"make a mugshot\" police sketch software, or have the game randomize your facial features until you find something you like, and tweak it from there. You can also pick from a variety of hair styles and hair color, adjust age and skin tone, and rotate the camera around. The tech is a bit outdated, but it gets the job done.\n\nYou begin the game as a new inmate at the Imperial Prison. Soon, a unique opportunity presents itself: The Emperor is fleeing a coordinated assassination attempt, and the entrance to his secret escape tunnel happens to be in your cell. He pardons you in exchange for your help, having forseen an otherworldly threat to the entire mortal realm in his dreams. Is it merely a stroke of good fortune, or is it your destiny that placed you in his path for a higher purpose? You'll have to ponder that later, because the assassins haven't given up yet, and they apparently don't want to leave any witnesses...\n\nThe mouse and keyboard controls are pretty simple and easy to use: Use mouse to look and aim, left mouse button to attack, right mouse button to block, middle mouse button to switch between first- and third-person view on the fly, mousewheel controls third-person camera distance, WASD to move, and most other functions like spellcasting are near those keys by default. Keyboard and mouse are rebindable and responsive. Switching weapons and spells, and using potions and gems, are done by opening your Journal, which has pages for your stats, map, inventory, abilities, and quest log. Items and spells can also be hotkeyed to the 12345678 keys on the keyboard for quicker access, but since the game is paused on the Journal screen anyway this is optional. (I bound spellcasting, use, and grab to mouse buttons for the sake of convenience.) Gamepad controls are also an option, but I don't recommend them for this game.\n\nA short tutorial mission leads you through catacombs and sewers to an exit to the overworld, and from there a wide open world awaits you. You can continue your mission to save the world, or ignore it entirely and go raid some ruins. The main questline will still be there if and when you decide to pursue it, and you'll likely do many sidequests along the way before you tackle the endgame. Finishing the main questline does not end the game, so if you want to get it out of the way early it can be finished at low level. There are also several long questlines attached to various guilds and such.\n\nYour character class is picked during the tutorial mission (someone will even suggest a class based on what skills you've been using, or you can make up a custom class) and this controls your advancement. There are 21 skills in the game, 7 of these will become your class skills. All skills in the game advance individually with repeated use, but you need to gain 10 points in your class skills to gain a level, and others advance more slowly. Levelling raises maximum Health, and lets you raise up to three of your eight attributes, depending on how much you used related skills since your last level up.\n\nYou also get to choose one of thirteen birthsigns: Some just give attribute bonuses, others give special powers, like the ability to turn invisible for a minute once per day. These can help you out of some tight squeezes in the early game.\n\nCombat is relatively simple. Your weapon skills and attributes modify how much damage your weapons do, and weapons and armor quickly degrade and need repairs between fights. Armor effectiveness also depends on your skill with that armor type. As your skills improve, and you find gear made of better (and more durable) materials, you become much more effective. Blocking with a shield or weapon reduces damage and interrupts an attack, allowing you to counter. Holding the attack button launches a power attack, which may hit hard enough to stagger even a blocking enemy. Attacks use up your Fatigue meter, which regenerates quickly whenever you're not running or attacking. Attacks made with low Fatigue do less damage, so walking and making your hits count works better than running around and flailing.\n\nMagic spells use up your Magicka bar, which regens much slower than Fatigue (or not at all if you took a certain birthsign) and can be restored quickly by using potions or Welkynd Stones. The Magicka cost of spells drops as your relevant magic skill improves. There are seven schools of magic: Alchemy is used to create custom potions. Destruction spells are mostly elemental attacks. Restoration is mostly healing. Alteration has useful buffs. Conjuration summons creatures. Illusion can charm people, paralyze enemies, or change lighting condtions. Mysticism is a catch-all for things like telekinesis, detecting life (like a \"heartbeat sensor\") through walls, and trapping souls to recharge magic items.\n\nStealth options include moving silently, sneak attacks, picking locks, and talking people into trusting you. Stealth mode movement takes into account footstep noise, facing, and line of sight; as well as lighting conditions and magic effects like Chameleon. A target that hasn't detected you can be sneak attacked for extra damage. Lockpicking and speech get their own minigames, which are tricky at first, but once mastered allow even low-skill characters to reliably beat them. The bow and arrow are the signature weaponry of most stealth classes, and can be used for sneak attacks as well.\n\nEvery town, including the Imperial City where you start, has a few quests you can get involved in if you talk to the right people. Or you can leave town and wander the wilderness in search of trouble. Some interesting dungeons are in very remote areas of the map, and the Imperial City itself is built over ruins that can be accessed by manholes. The main quest revolves around portals opening to the demonic realm of Oblivion, so these are another type of dungeon to raid.\n\nAny marker on the world map that you've visited can be reached by \"fast travel\" to save the trouble of backtracking.\n\nThe official DLC is of varying quality, mostly different types of homes for the player to improve, but Shivering Isles is like a sequel in itself. The official creation kit is also availble, and the modding scene has done plenty of good work with it.\n\nThere's lots of impressive scenery, amusing voice acting, inspiring music, and overall the game builds a lot of atmosphere that gives a \"hero's journey\" feeling to the whole experience. It's worth relaxing and taking your time to soak it all in.\n\nI have some minor gripes, however. Terrain pop-up is annoyingly common, as are clipping and stability issues. A lot of quests have bugs that can trap you or halt quest progress. Level \"scaling\" is way overused, it feels wrong that common enemies like bandits and goblins get tougher as you do, and this drags out fights at high level. The level system tends to punish you for sticking to your class skills, as your attribute gains may fall behind, compounding the \"scaling\" problem. There's an animation bug which will eventually (after 200 hours or so) make your character unplayable, which is bad news for players who just want to develop one character indefinitely instead of starting over. Community mods address many of these issues, but the game was clearly rushed to market, and the final official patch hasn't fixed everything.\n\nOverall, despite its flaws, this game provides a truly engaging single-player experience, and I enjoy playing it to this day."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506667415, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514563", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35284535", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198176765602", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1486848105, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1473}, "timestamp_updated": 1506667415, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion is one of bethesda's great games, not because of the rpg mechanics, graghics or soundtrack but because in this game you are not the hero, your the sidekick that inspires hope within the true hero.

However, my opinions will be based on this game in comparison to the series, and to other RPG's. I am doing this because I played Skyrim first, then Morrowind, then this. Also, the points I make in this review will be considering the fact that this game was released in 2006, so comparing to games much later isn't entirely fair. Enough rambling, let's get started.\n\nTLDR; Great game, don't compare it to Skyrim solely, and if you keep an open mind you can discover what this game has to offer like I did.\n\nPROS:\n+ First and foremost, follows the formula very well for what makes a good Elder Scrolls game, as well as an RPG and open world game.\n+ Fantastic world, argued by many to be the best in the series.\n+ Almost unlimited player choice when it comes to character creation and progression.\n+ Tons of variation in the world, from NPCs to shops to entire towns, you won't see the same thing twice.\n+ Most quests in the game are fantastic, and are not like other TES games where you are always fetching item A or killing person B. There are some truly memorable quests from this game, both good and bad.\n+ Factions in this game are the strongest and most diverse in the entire series. Most of them are structured differently as well, offering even more variety to your experience.\n+ NPCs in the world react to the things you do and the feats you accomplish, making the world feel the most alive and believable it has ever been.\n+ Despite what you may read online, there is no specific way you must level your character to remain \"efficient.\" Play as you like.\n+ Character progression is well balanced and makes sense.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n+- The Main Quest in this game is beloved by many, but for me got tedious and repetitive towards the end.\n+- There are several factions in which you can \"join,\" but can't progress your rank in any way.\n+- The game, for anyway, requires some basic mods to be playable in 2017 (UI mods, patches, etc.) This is listed as neutral as this is something to be expected a games age, but graphics, content, or gameplay mods aren't something I consider essential for a 2017 playthrough.\n\nCONS:\n- Probably the least believable TES game in terms of the player's position in the world. There is absolutely no reason for the player to be in the position they are in at the start of the game.\n- No reason the player should be able to be good at so many things. In Morrowind, you were the Nerevarine, and Skyrim the Dragonborn, so at least in those worlds it made sense for you specifically to turn out powerful and amazing at some point. In Oblivion, your character is not anyone special, and thus makes it hard for me to believe that they are just naturally willing to help anyone and everyone they see once they escape the opening level.\n- This game practically forces you to follow the main quest. In other games, once you complete the often horrible tutorial levels, you can go anywhere you wish and ignore the main quest if you like. In this game, even though you mean nothing to anyone from the start, you are thrown immediately into the conflict because of a \"vision\" someone has.\n- User interface by default is designed for consoles, even though this game doesn't offer gamepad support.\n- The system in which you must use to level up is atrocious, and one can find themselves very easily over or under-leveling their characters if they don't choose appropriate major skills from the start.\n- As is TES fashion, the tutorial level is terrible.\n\nI know that my CONS section is almost as long as my PROS section, but don't let that stop you from buying and trying this game. It is an excellent Elder Scrolls game, and has its share of flaws like the others do. I do recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the series, or action RPG's in particular.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505503888, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504902", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34979597", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198059458007", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1504892767, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4305}, "timestamp_updated": 1505503888, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Better than Skyrim"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506683385, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35289795", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198271682080", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1466686499, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2553}, "timestamp_updated": 1506683385, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely,\nLovely, lovely, lovely, lovely,\nLovely, lovely, lovely, lovely,\nLOVELY game.

Listen to the peaceful soundtracks in the game, the wonderful combat attacks and the immersive gameplay overall, it just makes so much sense, the graphics are beautiful and there is SO much colour, and anyone who doesn't like the White Gold Tower should really see a therapist. There's so much to do here, you can be a mage, you can join different organizations, and one thing that really caught my attention above all was the Mage's Guild.\n\nThe Mage's Guild has a wonderful storyline in my opinion, and best of all, it grants you access to spellcrafting. Yup, spellcrafting. What could be better than that?\n\nThe game has a beautiful day and night cycle and the characters feel very real, they actually have conversations with each other, sometimes they can be kind of stupid, goofy or make you laugh, but they act like people.
