I try to enjoy it, and at times I do,\n\nSo many little things about this game that irritate me, like not being able to find stupid quest item to start \"the caleuche\" DLC, yet its been years in game since i finished the quest needed in order to start it.\n\nNPCs being able to keep swinging their sword when out of stamina, NPCs sailing up wind twice as fast as I can and me not being able to hit crap with my cannons although my cannons skill is maxed yet they have pinpoin accuracy. Being chased by every pirate or enemy nation fleet that pops on screen, a fleet can consist of 2 to 6 ships from what I've seen. Some of these battles are unavoidable so you need to run if you are fast enough.\n\nTryingto look got guides or goggling answers, seems near pointless. Some quests  like \"Dutch Gambit\" and the long and confusing(for first timers) tutorial have guides. I can find  little info on things here and there, but sometimes you simply can not find the answer at all.
