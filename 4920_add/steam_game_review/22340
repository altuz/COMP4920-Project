I've spent almost four hours on it and have just now made it to the sewer section. A lot of my time was spent taking in the atmosphere and letting myself get scared. For instance, when I was walking through the lovely town known as Innsmouth, I stumbled upon a large building marked with the words 'Esoteric Order of Dagon.' Now, me being an avid reader of Lovecraft, I instantly recognized it and realized how much trouble I was truly in.\n\nThe hotel chase scene has an amazing build up as well. Just seeing the men with the 'Innsmouth Look' walk up to your door, all the while speaking of killing you, is an amazing experience. The actual chase itself is difficult and very stressful. Knowing that you they're just around the corner and about 30 seconds from killing you only adds to the immersion and tension.\n\nContrary to what I've heard, this game hasn't crashed at all during gameplay. The only time I've encountered a bug was an audio glitch when I was walking directly into a wall.\n\nThe game does, however, crash when you alt+tab, so don't do it. The Steam overlay works in this game, so don't be afraid to respond to any messages you receive.\n\nI did download the unofficial patch and I recommend you do the same.\n\nAll in all, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth has been an amazing experience so far.

Many memorable parts, especially on the ship. \n\n[*]\tBrilliant horror atmosphere; can be quite spooky, especially in the sewers. \n\n[*]\tI liked the 1920s weaponry, especially the revolver. \n\n[*]\tThe character can interact with Npcs and objects throughout the game. \n\n[*]\tI like how you have an inventory to store items which you will need to progress through the game. \n[*]\tUnique health system.  \n\n[*]\tGood soundtrack; fits in well with the horror theme.                                                                 \n\n[*]\tI like how the game starts off stealthy and then becomes more action packed.  \n\n[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]\n\n[*]\tExtremely buggy. I highly recommend you download the unofficial pack, because there is one part of the game that bugs out completely and stops you from progressing. \n\n[*]\tNeeds a sanity bar and a mini hud for ammo amount.\n\n[*]\tShame you can't run. \n\n[*]\tThe game can be very confusing; I had to look at the walkthrough several times throughout the game, especially when it comes to the puzzles (safes) and where you have to go next. \n\n[*]\tShame you can't pick up the ammo from killed enemies.\n\n[*]    Lantern or candle for dark areas. \n\n[/list]\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u] \n\nVery interesting story, I will probably consider reading the book.
