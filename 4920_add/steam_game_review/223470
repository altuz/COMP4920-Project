You wield a variety of weapons; ranging from shovels to sledgehammers to M16's and shotguns, the latter two of which you can \"accessorize\" with a feline. The difficulty balance is great as well. Difficulty only really changes how tough enemies are versus how tough you are, plus some fun modifiers on high diffs. (i.e everyone has guns, hates you, or both.)\n\nIs violence not your style? Well, POSTAL 2 can be beaten non-lethally. Get ready to abuse the tazer and your own piss!\nSeriously. POSTAL 2's notorious slogan is \"It's only as violent as you are.\" \n\nNot only that, but this Steam version, dubbed POSTAL 2 Complete, you have the luxury of the Apocalypse Weekend expansion, and a modified version of the Week In Paradise mod! (meaning you can play Monday-Sunday in one run but you figured that out unless you are an idiot) \n\nThis is by no means a \"new\" game. It was released in 2003, but RWS still updates the Steam version! Really!\n\nHonestly, if this is what you've been craving for a while, get it at full price. It's only 10 bucks CDN!\n\nIf you are unsure, wait for a sale. The fucking kick.a.ss devs mark this game down to around a dollar!\n\nSeriously though, buy ten copies of this game and POSTAL Redux and praise our lord and savior Running With Scissors.", "timestamp_updated": 1504741023, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504741023, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34924793", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506183825, "steamid": "76561198062287526", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 483}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Funniest game I have ever played in my entire none regretable life!!!

It flips the middle finger off to everything and everyone including its own devs, and especially the current triple A game companies like EA and Ubisoft. It's entirely meant just to dick around, sometimes literally in a video game classic that can be considered one of the classic FPS, being that you can hold every weapon in the game, and is meant for fun instead of plot.\n\nOther:\nIt's got many bugs, although you can find fixes to these bugs in the discussions, where even the Devs are active to help solve them.\n\n\nSummary:\nThis game is for fun. It's for light hearted people who can take a joke. If you happen to want or like something of the sort, I highly recommend and suggest you buy it.", "timestamp_updated": 1505494672, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0,
