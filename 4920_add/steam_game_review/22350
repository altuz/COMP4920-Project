It seemlessly blends the single and multiplayer gamemodes by making the full campaign playable mission by mission with either the AI or online with other humans. The leveling system feels balanced and the challenge modes are great for learning the game and practicing outside of missions.\n\nI played on console a couple years ago and decided to grab it again now that it's free to play, and it still plays just as well as I remember. Great game, try it out."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505781583, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506556", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35055498", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197982565433", "num_reviews": 105, "last_played": 1505072375, "num_games_owned": 1173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1029}, "timestamp_updated": 1505781583, "received_for_free": false, "review": "very mediocre game, gunplay is not that exciting and the parkour that is advertised isn't really used.

The game feels really clunky, AND as a person who only put in 10 hours back in the day into leveling up, I could not get into a multiplayer game now a days because I was too \"over leveled\". It just feels bad. \n\nHonestly guys, there are free games out there that are way better than this in every way.
