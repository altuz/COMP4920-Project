It really is. Why? Because as of writing, both servers up right now have 0/32 players.\n\nI really doubt anyone will even read this review, only because this is a game time forgot. I bought it when it first came out on steam, and since nothing has changed since other than going free to play (with no bonus for people who previously bought, something that would anger most people but I had my fun with it so I feel it's only fair) all I can do is reminisce on previous times I've played this game in 2013 when it wasn't horribly dead.\n\nI feel like AirBuccaneers is a game that if it had a thriving playerbase it wouldn't be at \"mixed\" of 60% positive ratings. It's rough around the edges- but not in a way that negatively impacts the game. The game works like most air combat simulators, you fly around in airships and shoot different types of weapons at the enemy while the pilot tries to steer you out of the way of projectiles incoming so you don't horribly crash and burn to your pitiful death. What makes AirBuccaneers different than guns of icarus? Ground combat. It's a lie to say you can walk to your enemies base and kill them via one on one fistfights as the ground is covered in poisonous mushrooms, but in AirBuccaneers you spawn in your home base and can choose what ship to board either by walking onto a docked one or using an hangglider to get to one in the air. But how does this equate into ground combat? You have free movement and aren't locked onto your ship, meaning it's a legitimate strategy to either dismount your hangglider in mid air and jump onto the enemy's ship or to jump from your own and engage in proper swashbuckling- or just take their helm and drive their ship into a cliff. You can also use one of the diverse ship types like the Kamikaze ship that instantly destroys anything when touched (but it horrendously underarmoured) or the massive, immobile fort that has a huge cannon on it but can only move via air maneuver which takes a long time to recharge.\n\nAnother great thing about airbuccaneers is the perks and flaws system. I found this very unique at the time, and it still sticks out to me as one of the only multiplayer games that has something like this. There are very overpowered perks in each level progression tree that you can pick to make yourself better suited to one role, but there are negatives in that tree (or other trees) you must choose from as well. This would be just OK if the perks were something generic like \"move 10% faster\" or \"repair 20% slower\", but they're all mostly fun stuff like \"you're drunk and your screen is tilting\", \"you don't take fall damage\", \"you have an eyepatch over half of your screen\", and \"your gun works like russian roulette and has a random chance of killing you\". I didn't get that far in the perk tree as this game died pretty quickly, but it was the main thing that kept me playing and I really wish another multiplayer game would pick up something similar.\n\nSo all that positive said, do I recommend AirBuccaneers? Hell yes, if you can find players. It's free to play now, and is a great arcadey game with an interesting character creation system. I just really wish it wasn't dead.", "timestamp_updated": 1426640388, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426640388, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "12936472", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508419", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1418728713, "steamid": "76561198048712102", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "this game suffers from only a few problems \nthese problems are the lack of people.

Well, it could be that game. Unfortunately, nobody plays it.\nI've been [trying] to play it for the past couple of days and have had a grand total of 2 populated sessions. With a few exceptions, it was the same group of players each time. I'm not really surprised that this is the case, have you heard about Air Buccaneers? It was featured on Steam when it released, but then it just sort of vanished. \n\nThe developers seem to be neglecting it too \u2013 when I first played it near release among my first thoughts were \u201cwow, this will be great with a bit of polish and some content updates.\u201d I don't think either have happened. A quick visit to the Steam community forums would show you that the small player base echoes this opinion. \n\nIt's a crying shame, really. Air Buccaneers could be a really fun game. During my time playing I met a player called Keel and truly were we the gods of the wind! Single handedly we held off barrages from. . . AI controlled airships because only one other person was in the game. While I'm glad that bots take over when there aren't enough players, it's just not as satisfying. Especially since AI ships can't be boarded and captured \u2013 which is one of my favourite aspects of Air Buccaneers.\nSeldom did me and Keel get a chance to clumsily weave through a barrage of cannon fire, pull up to the enemy and leap through the skies \u2013 swords in hand \u2013 to claim an enemy ship for our own. But when it happened, it was glorious.\n\nAir Buccaneers has 3 game modes: Deathmatch, Domination and Protect The Golden Ship.\nIn Deathmatch you blow up enemy ships to score points, in domination you blow up enemy ships to score points and in Protect The Golden Ship you blow up enemy ships to score points but also have to blow up the golden ship \u2013 One team defends and the other attacks. So there isn't much variance there.\n\nThere are 3 roles in Air Buccaneers. Captain, shooter and Everything Else Guy.\nThe captain pilots the ship, shouting out orders to the crew and calling out the locations of enemy ships. The shooters man the cannons, manually aiming the cannon and trying to predict the ball's trajectory [there is no aiming reticle]. The Everything Else Guy does everything else, if you aren't behind the wheel or behind the cannon then you're fixing the ship, spotting enemy ships, firing off air-mines or supporting the cannons by reducing the cooldown time on their shots.\nThe roles are flexible, at any time the captain can ditch the wheel and hop on the cannons or the shooter can decide he's had enough of missing shots and instead just leap onto the enemy ship to engage in an exciting battle of who can click their sword the fastest. Melee combat leaves much to be desired, which makes boarding less exciting than it could be. But is melee combat really important in a game about piloting an airship to shoot other airships?\n\nThere are 4 types of ships in Air Buccaneers. As before I'm going to make up their names because I don't think the names of anything are mentioned anywhere in game.\nFirst up you have what I call the Classic. Not particularly fast, four cannons and hardy enough to soak up a few cannons before dropping out of the sky. Then you have the Speedy McGoFast; only one cannon, fairly small and weak, fast enough to get close enough to an enemy ship to initiate a surprise boarding party. \nThere is also the Flying Fortress. Very slow, very big, I think it has a strong defence? I've never actually seen a cannon hit it. It's an incredibly long ranged cannon platform that nobody really uses. And finally you have the OH COME ON. A speedy little kamikaze ship fit for one person. No cannons because you are the cannon. Pick a target and smash right into them, sacrificing yourself for the good of the team [only to respawn a second later to do it again].\n\nI took a break from writing this to see if I could play Air Buccaneers. Nobody was online.\n\nSo, would I recommend Air Buccaneers? Well it depends on how many people are listening to me. A couple of friends? Probably not. The servers are too empty. But if I had an audience of enough people to populate servers? Heck yeah.
