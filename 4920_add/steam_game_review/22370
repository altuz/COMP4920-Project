I'm enjoying it without any crashes! Give me few minutes to explain!\n\nI purchased the Steam edition few years ago (I had Win 7 then 8 then 8.1 then 10). I have installed it two times before the last one (once with Windows 7, and then Windows 8.1). It worked following one guide by installing a mod and modifying the ini file ..etc. But, it never worked well. It also never registered the game spent time within Steam. So, I uninstalled it, and added it to my 'abandoned' category.\n\nFew weeks ago, I thought to try it again as I really want to play it years ago (damn it!). So, I installed it. I did one modification and that is changing the exe file compatibility to Windows Vista! When I run it (no administration rights playing around), it did notify me to install 'Games for Windows - LIVE' s**t, it said, the one I have is not compatible, so I clicked yes and it was installed, but I didn't run it, I just clicked 'OK' and exit.\n\nI run the game and changed the resolution to 1920x1080 and also the details to high. Since then I'm enjoying a great game without any crash for over 20 hours! Now, there are still minor bugs, but those are experienced by all, not only by me (they are very minor, like got stuck between rocks ...etc).\n\nI have checked the installed apps in the settings and found those two:\n-  Microsoft Games for Windows - LIVE Redistributable (version 3.5.92.0) \n-  Microsoft Games for Windows Marketplace (version 3.5.67.0)\n\nMy PC is nothing special at all! i5-4570 with GTX 750 and 8GB RAM. Windows 10 home 64bit with the latest update.\n\nNow, for the game, I think there are really very good reviews about gameplay and everything else. I agree with most that said it is a great game :) I give it 9/10.\n\nAnyway, I might add some notes of my experiences in the game although I'm still level 5 and only 22 hours into the game!\nThe start was very tough for me (after leaving the Vault), and I found myself to replay the game two times again because my character wasn't what I wanted. I read many advices on how to choose different attributes ..etc, but in the end I found that:\n\n- Whatever you choose, you can't be all-rounder character. You win something but lose something else! \n\n- Physical strength is important especially in the beginning! But it is far from the only thing needed!\n\n- Choose specific weapons and put high points on them. I found Melee weapons come very handy against some mobs and when other ranged weapons useless (almost!).\n\n- Fighting and looting have a major part in the game. Repairing is also useful. so I tend to care more about those aspects. But as I said, you can't have everything, so choose only the ones that suit your style of playing. You might replay the game more than once to understand the mechanics.\n\n- Finding a bed to sleep is not easy in the very start! It is crucial to sleep as it restores health to the max.\n\n- After discovering it, I used fast travel a lot within the world map ;) \n\n- I lowered the difficulty from Normal to Easy (hihihi) What?! It is a damn difficult game! I died a lot! what can I do?!\n\n- Assigning shortcuts for different weapons/armor are very useful in combat. Also for the aid/food.\n\nNow, after knowing where to not go (yet!) and what mobs to avoid, I'm enjoying a great game really. It is a dark story and filled with sadness and a**h***s, but that's life after a nuclear war. I got used to it in the game! After all, it is a very addictive game when you found yourself into it (after few hours from the start though).\n\nI really hope it would work with all, because it is a shame not to play such a great game that suits all players, not only RPG/Action fans."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506862108, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35380455", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198347761730", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1507139594, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 681, "playtime_forever": 2557}, "timestamp_updated": 1506862108, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Can you make a Ultra texture DLC?"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506799020, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35351048", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198015843925", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1504274552, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 411}, "timestamp_updated": 1506799020, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Fun"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504947178, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502334", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34832470", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198018647806", "num_reviews": 46, "last_played": 1506047164, "num_games_owned": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "playtime_forever": 1198}, "timestamp_updated": 1504947178, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Still my favourite Fallout in the whole series"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505708699, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35038722", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197990461767", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506301816, "num_games_owned": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 248, "playtime_forever": 4016}, "timestamp_updated": 1505708699, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game.

If you have Windows 7 or later on your system, you may not be able to run this game at all! If it does run, it may run poorly and crash often. Various tweaks detailed on the forums may help with this, but they require some technical skill and don't always resolve these issues on every system. Consider yourself officially warned.\n\nThis is a single-player action RPG in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting, with first-person and third-person view options. In other words, it's Oblivion with guns. If you've read my review of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, also by Bethesda, a lot of it applies here. They seem to have learned from Oblivion, and many improvements have been made to the basic formula. (There will be a lot of comparisons to Oblivion here, as I never played Fallout 1 and 2, which were turn-based RPG titles.)\n\nFallout 3 takes place in a world much like our own, but where history took a different turn in the fifties, with much more rapid technological progress. It was a futuristic golden age of robots and rayguns for about a century, then America had a nuclear war with China. Oops. Fast forward two more centuries, and that's where our story begins.\n\nDuring the build-up to the war, many families reserved space in underground cities called Vaults, just in case. You are a resident of Vault 101, beneath the ruins of Washington DC, where the descendants of some of those survivors have lived for generations. But circumstances soon force you into the Wasteland above, a lone wanderer fighting to survive.\n\nCharacter creation uses much the same \"make-a-mug\" method as Oblivion: Choose a name, race, gender, face, hairstyle, and hair color and you're good to go. The tutorial quests walk you through key moments in your character's young life, from birth to adulthood, and then the main questline kicks off with the mysterious disappearance of your father. The Vault's paranoid Overseer is convinced you have something to do with it, so escape is your only option.\n\nThis game also uses much the same control scheme as Oblivion: Mouse to look around, left mouse button to attack, right mouse button to block with a melee weapon or aim with a ranged weapon, middle mouse button toggles first- and third-person views, mousewheel adjusts third-person camera distance, WASD moves you, and most other stuff is nearby. (I bound VATS, use, and grab to mouse buttons.) The keyboard/mouse controls are rebindable and responsive.\n\nOne your eyes adjust to the blinding daylight, you can head to the nearby town of Megaton and pursue leads about your father's location... or not. The main quest can be ignored if you'd rather run around adventuring on your own for a while, and it will still be available to pick up if and when you decide to return to it. There's no shortage of other trouble you can get into in the meantime, from disarming a dud nuke (or not...) to helping a mad scientist write a survival guide. If that doesn't interest you, there are always raiders, radscorpions, and other menaces that have lived long enough...\n\nThe combat system is a bit more complex than usual, as hit location can make a big difference to damage and its side effects. Limbs can become crippled, slowing a character or making them drop a weapon, blows to the head can leave you dizzy with a concussion, and many of the meds and chems that are useful in combat are addictive and have crippling withdrawal effects. All of this can be fixed if you survive, but that and weapon and armor degradation are drains on your resources. Repair skill quickly becomes valuable, as you can combine parts from junked weapons and gear to repair your own, or you can pay someone to repair it for you. You can also use Repair to craft your own weapons from various junk items at a workbench, once you acquire the rare schematics that tell you how to assemble them.\n\nThe biggest change to combat is VATS, the Vault-tec Assisted Targeting System. The Pip-Boy wrist computer that you use for inventory and such doubles as a targeting system, pausing time and letting you pick targets and hit locations, then resolving the attacks in bullet-time according to the character's skill levels rather than the player's reflexes, adding a taste of turn-based combat to the game. Your \"action points\" for this take time to recharge between uses, however.\n\nIn addition to the usual stealth options like sneak attack criticals, you can pickpocket a character and leave them a live grenade or mine as a free gift, with spectacular (and hilarious) results.\n\nInteraction is much quicker due to various changes, like empty containers being marked as such on your hud, and characters with no unique dialogue brushing you off without entering the conversation menu. There's no speech minigame this time around: If a character can be talked into something, there will be a percent chance based on your Speech skill, and you only get one shot. (This can be save scummed, if you insist.) Many also have dialogue options that are only available if you have certain perks or skills, and these always succeed if you meet the requirements. The main difference regarding lockpicking (and hacking) is that locks and computers have a minimum skill requirement, so you can't attempt them with insufficient skill levels. If you want to be a Master of Unlocking, spend those skill points wisely.\n\nThere are many bizarre and fascinating locations to be found in the Wasteland, from ancient caves to abandoned shopping malls. A lot of them have a story to tell you as you search through the debris and collect notes and audio logs. If you played Oblivion, do you remember Vilverin, that dungeon you started out facing when you finished the tutorial? Remember how a weird tale unfolded as you went deeper and found more clues? Well, this game has a lot of that in it.\n\nLike in Elder Scrolls, you can play as a good or evil character if you so desire. Instead of the Fame/Infamy system, you have a Karma stat that tracks your reputation. How you choose to finish a quest may have unforseen consequences, and sometimes there are no good options. The \"fallout\" of your actions can spread far from your original intentions, and in some situations, the only winning move is not to play... or at least, not to play by the rules, if you can change them.\n\nThe advancement system is much improved, as you have a more conventional experience point system based on kills and quests completed, and you can improve whatever skills you like when you level up without having to grind them.\n\nThe game is not without gripes. There are still some random crashes, quest-stopping bugs, and other nuisances that crop up from time to time, and also strange physics glitches, like finding a monster or a junk car floating in midair for no reason, or bodies spontaneously ragdolling again as you return to where you killed them. There doesn't seem to be much of a \"scaling\" problem this time around, except for lock difficulties scaling to your level, eventually putting them out of reach of any character without a lot of points invested in Science and Lockpicking. The gunplay could have used an \"aim down sights\" option, as aiming just zooms your view in, and doesn't help accuracy nearly as much as it should.
