The influence of Silent Hill (especially 2) is clearly visible on both gameplay and theme, but capturing that kind of atmosphere and mood can only be a compliment, A huge one. And worry not because Cry of Fear does have a really strong identity of it's own.\nThe limitations of the Gold Source engine are barely noticeble due to just how much the original game was modifyed, however, like Half Life, Cry of Fear also changes gameplay mechanics from times to times, depending on the scenario you're in. For a horror game, Cry of Fear does this tremendously well, and except for a few moments of the game (like the falling train sequence) the game manages to use the change of it way of playing as a way of provoking fear into the player rather than frustration, since from a moment to another you will be forced to think in a different way if you want to progress. \nThe story like I said earlier, is incredibly influenced by Silent Hill, however, it is obvious that alot of it came from the creator's life experiences. One thing I must criticize is that not all monsters seem to represent imidiatly Simons guilt and fears, some of them are just twisted and disturbing for the sake of being twisted and disturbing, but, while they dont offer much in terms of the main characters' psyche, they do offer more variety of gameplay, since Cry of Fear does have many diferent types of enemies. All I can say plot-wise is that it takes it's time to reveal what's actually going on, and the closer you get to the truth, the more twisted and nightmaqrish the visuals of the game will become, to express the depression and suicidal tendencies of the protagonist.\n The gameplay is filled with subtle details that are mostly overlooked even by the greatest of the surival horror genre, wether old or new. The presence of those elements only make this game grimmer and genuinly terrifying, since they add depth to the game, and you will have to consider their use if you want to survive due to the scarce resources.\n I was also incredibly impressed due to the quantity of bonus material. You get a bunch of new game modes, extra weapons, developer commentary, diferent outfits, trophys, pages of Simon's book, and also, parts of the game switch simply by starting new playtroughts. For example, codes for specific doors change so you cant simply resort to online help to solve a puzzle. There are also TONS of easter eggs in the game, 4 diferent endings on the main singleplayer, theres multiplayer and 4 different difficulty settings. Also, props to the sound design and music, it's also great.\n\nFor a free game this is absolutly amazing, and for such a small team of developers... Then my god you guys have created a masterpiece. It is one of the scariest games I've ever played, dont let the terrible jumpscare screamer at the beginning reflect how the rest of the game is gonna be. And if you like Cry of Fear, then I highly recoment Afraid of Monsters as well, but that one you will have to install like a regular Half Life mod. This game, at least for me, proved that both game with combat or without combat can be just as scary as one another, taking diferent routes for their game design.\n\nSo, if you are a horror fan, why arent you playing Cry of Fear yet?", "timestamp_updated": 1391343598, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1391343598, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "29856070", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494755", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499000920, "steamid": "76561198202537473", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of the greatest games of all time ;D", "timestamp_updated": 1486843137, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486843137, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29521879", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1496260095, "steamid": "76561198286456951", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is quite amazing.
