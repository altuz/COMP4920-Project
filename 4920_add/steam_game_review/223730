The world design is awesome and unique and the music fits it perfectly. The mechanics are for the most pretty tight and easy to use while the slightly abstract world design throws you into new challenges every time. The devs seem to be a pretty cool bunch as well from all the little jokes they put as easter eggs and unlockables. Big reccomendation from me for this game!", "timestamp_updated": 1502194794, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502194794, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 110, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 12, "total_reviews": 122}}
