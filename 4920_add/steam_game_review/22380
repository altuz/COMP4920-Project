Great fun, with some issues that I won't overlook. Categories typically get a base score, followed by pros and cons.\n\n\nGraphics: 8/10\n===========\nGame came out 7 years ago upon writing this review, so the graphics get a handicap. That being said, they look okay for the most part. Flat textures and very little bump mapping on most surfaces is kind of a let down though. +9\n\nI have a beefy computer, and this game still suffers from Mouse Delay with certain options enabled, such as shadows. Game appears to run better in Windowed Mode, than Full screen mode, for whatever reason. Optimization issues are clearly present. -1\n\n\nPerformance: 5/10\n==============\nThis game gets a unique category, that being performance. It's acceptable for the most part but has some noticable  problems. +8\n\nI understand a game of this scale will have bugs present. A glitch here and there is one thing, but crashes on the other hand, are not acceptable in any sense of the word, and Fallout New Vegas is full of them. Explosions have a chance of causing crashes. Loading a game has a chance of causing crashes. Sometimes the VATS mechanic (see below) will get stuck on the \"camera mode\" (There's a word for this that isn't coming to mind), forcing you to reload your game. Lets hope you saved recently! These issues aren't one in a hundred; no they are rampant, and will happen more often than they should. Bad bad bad. -2\n\nDual Monitor users beware, as some of you will have the screen locking issues I had. A quick google search reveals this is a hit-or-miss problem. Even in Full screen mode, the mouse of the game did not want to lock to my screen. In order to fix this, I had to either disable my secondary monitor, or install Cursor Lock software, manually locking my mouse to one screen. This shouldn't be an issue in any game, ever. -1\n\n\nSound/Music: 8/10\n==============\nSound effects work and have some impact behind them. Music is high quality but nothing magnificent (except the classic tunes you hear in Vegas, those are great). +8\n\n\nStory: 7/10\n========\nYou are the Courier, paid to deliver a package somewhere. During this delivery, one of the guys who hired you decides to shoot you in the head, leaving you for dead, and taking your precious cargo. You survive the gunshot, and it's time to take back whats your's (and possibly get revenge)! +6\n\nThe \"official\" story behind this game, is lackluster and boring (-1). There is no drive behind it, no real characters you will ever care about, but that's okay for a game like this. This is a game where the story you create with your own character is far more important (+2). You make your character, you turn him or her into whatever badass you envision, complete with whatever companions and allies you desire, whether it be for good, or for evil (or the lesser of either side). +1\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n============\nGameplay is primarily First Person Shooter, Secondarily Third Person Shooter, with RPG elements, skills, and perks to go along the way. For combat, you can use guns, explosives, futuristic laser guns, melee weapons, or your bare fists if you so desire. Outside of combat are some more \"worldly useful\" skills, such as hacking (science), sneaking, and picking locks. There are also passive abilities enhancing your medical knowledge or bartering skills. There is also a skill called VATS (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) where you can zoom into an enemy and select which body part you would like to shoot, with a percentage of whether or not you'll hit the selected part(s). There is alot to do! +8\n\nCounter Strike players beware! Reloading your weapon causes the game to finish the reload entirely before you will be able to execute any other action. Not sure if a bug or poor gameplay mechanic. Bad either way. -1\n\nHardcore mode is a really cool mechanic, where you actually have to find food and water to survive. Great addition from Fallout 3. +1\n\nCrafting system is intuitive and makes all those useless things you find in the wasteland useful. +1\n\n\nOverall: 7.4/10 (37/50 = 0.74)\n======================\nFix those damn performance issues and this game would be golden for generations to come. Then again, it'll still stand out as a gem in the horde of other bad games out there. It's fun and it felt good to finally go back and beat it (despite having to start all over). Highly recommended for those looking for an open world Western RPG.

You will encounter several factions and NPCs on your journey throughout the Mojave Wasteland, and each essential one has something very fun and exciting to offer. You can choose to be the good guy, you can choose to be the bad guy, you can be completely independent and tackle whatever objectives you wish at your own pace. As you complete each objective, you level up. You can use your leveling up to acquire many useful perks and abilities to aid you in your journey. You can add points to skills to help build your character. Do you want him to be a psychotic gunman, or do you fancy the sneaky lifestyle? Everything that defines a roleplaying game is delivered in this sweet $10 package. You can expect to get over 40 hours worth of playtime if you choose to complete every single quest and storyline. In order to see every \"ending\", you have to start a new game multiple times, and that really adds to the excitement and variety of building a new character each time to test what playstyle you are more comfortable with. An immersive world, great stories to tell, and overall entertainment from this game is something I recommend to anybody who is looking for a fine RPG/first person shooter experience. \n\nThat isn't to say this game doesn't have its flaws though. There are many flaws to be found in this beautiful wasteland, and those flaws are pointed directly at the bugs this game has. While it is a fantastic experiene, expect yourself to get frustrated at points as you will most likely encounter minor to game-breaking bugs at regular intervals. These bugs range from the laws of physics being completely broken on NPCs to even game-crashing when you want to fast travel. They are more than noticable and it overall takes away from the experience and immersion. \n\nThat isn't to say that completely ruins this game though. I do believe New Vegas is the definitive Fallout game for any newcomers. It has nearly everything a first person/RPG fan would want in a package and I recommend it to everybody who hasn't played it. You have a chance to be sucked into the apocalypse, and you should take it.\n\nI give this game an 8/10. \n\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505073394, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506178", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34870030", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198159225959", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506797955, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2063, "playtime_forever": 4429}, "timestamp_updated": 1505073394, "received_for_free": false, "review": "better than fallout 4"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504849962, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504318", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "34808657", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198071717864", "num_reviews": 42, "last_played": 1445123906, "num_games_owned": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 95}, "timestamp_updated": 1504849962, "received_for_free": false, "review": "obsidian please save us from todd."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505596167, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35007296", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198139913329", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506251286, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 61, "playtime_forever": 4668}, "timestamp_updated": 1505596167, "received_for_free": false, "review": "70 hours\n\nPlayed the game 2 times\n\nDidn't understand how to play Caravan"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504739709, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502664", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34784821", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095207942", "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1506986607, "num_games_owned": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1760, "playtime_forever": 20930}, "timestamp_updated": 1504739709, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Can you people stop crying about paid mods and be happy that Nexus and Obsidian blessed us with this godsend of a game?
