You need to bump the enemies to deal damage but avoid bumping them at center of the sprite because you will get damaged too. \nOn Ys I bosses, you can bump them anywhere on their body, because their source of damage are different from the normal mobs. While Ys II bosses will be damaged by using your magic.\n\nPlayed them on nightmare on first playthrough and I truly had nightmares on Ys I. The difficulties are so good, I love it.\n\nWhy Ys I so hard? Because the level cap is 10, and I already reached level 10 at 3rd boss fight, so you can't just beat the bosses by being overleveled, you need to get better at the game. \n\nLovely, isn't it?\n\nUnlike the Ys I, the Ys II's difficulty isn't as hard as Ys I because it has much higher level cap (I was level 50 when I ended Ys II) and there is magic introduced in there so you can do ranged attacks.\n\nThe only thing that I don't really like about Ys II is that cancel button are the same with walk button and the magic button are the same with OK button (Ys I doesn't have magic). Sometimes I want to charge my magic while walking so I need to press A and B together, on Ys Origin, my magic button is on LB and walk is on RB, it's much more comfortable that way.\nYou can rebind the button but OK and cancel button should be separated from magic and walk.\n\nThe story are okayish but the OSTs are so beautiful and the boss' fights are so enjoyable, I love'em all, I ended buying the other Ys on steam.\nI recommend that you play Ys I & II first then play Ys Origin.\n\nYou can find the play order for the rest of Ys on digitalemelas.com", "timestamp_updated": 1505659379, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505595120, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35050233", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500413", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505576020, "steamid": "76561198069750929", "num_games_owned": 982, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I decided to play Ys Origin before touching Ys 1 & Ys 2 and I sort of regret it.
