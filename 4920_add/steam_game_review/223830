If your looking for deep gameplay with RPG and strategy elements you found it. Xenonauts is an updated version of the 1990s game X-Com. It has tactical combat that is first and foremost its bread and butter. Entering alien crashes or incursions is where this game shines. It's UI of the Earth also gives the player of strategy on an epic scale. Working with your troops, scientists, and your budget you have to fend off the ever growing threat of the alien invaders.

Build your force and assualt the mother ship.\n\nWith awesome mod support I highly recommend beating the game on vanilla and then go crazy with mods!", "timestamp_updated": 1505844011, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505844011, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35254761", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499778", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507183612, "steamid": "76561198009097529", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 9165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 778}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Really great game.  For organizational strategy buffs or turn-based people you'll really enjoy it.\n\nIt's very classic in it's feel yet contemporary.  \n\nThe graphics and affects are good enough.  The gameplay is where it is at.  It's got multi-levels of play which is what I like.  Base building, great customization (which is key in any game), a lot of strategy...\n\nSome people are bitching like babies about teh gameplay... well turn down the difficulty to puss mode then.  There are 4 settings.  I play Veteran.  It's challenging, but not undoable if you really read close and pay attention and are super careful.  You have to read that the Aliens do not suffer night vision penalties and things like that... they can hide below windows which makes it so you cannot see them sometimes looking in... consider all doors and windows at angles...  keep your team together (which I never do and pay for it).\n\nThe more careful you are or simply the way you put your playstyle together such as squads and vehicles or whatever you are choosing to do... that's going to be key.  There's multiple routes to winning. \n\nGames like these can be incredibly HARD or really EASY.  It all depends on how you set everything up and how you're playing.  They do take work and attention to detail at higher levels.\n\nI love games like this and King Arthur.  Which is another to check out if you love strategies.\n\nA lot of work and care went into this game and it shows.  \n\nIt's a complete game that's not buggy.  Which is hard to find these days.  It's hard to build good games like this without the big companies backing you or those big budgets; they barely ecked this one out. \n\nI like having it in my rotation.\n\n1 thing I wish there were more of (not to say there's too little of...) but I wish there were more MAPS.  I love A LOT OF MAPS.  Maybe a cool (perhaps free.. or at least cheap) DLC with additional maps like cities and buildings to go through.\n\nI love maps with lots of different cool building and shops and whatnot.\n\nThe Newer XCOM Enemy Whatever from 2012 or something was only good as far as the maps were concerned early in the game.  They were pretty fun.\n\nThe rest of XCom 2012 was total garbage and buggy as f#$%.  It was a joke.  And 2 is the same copied trash with no innovation and tons of DLC.\n\nSo thank God for good games like this.  I don't really need awesome graphics and physics, Mount and Blade Warband didn't have any of those but like this game all the features were awesome.  There was a lot of game there and it was just right.  Warband's mistake is they could've added more to that instead of working on other offshoots.  It would've been cool to add more to that game in particular; especially to such a huge map.  Instead of ADDING most companies CHANGE things which is ALWAYS a mistake.\n\nSo if we could see expansions to this or map packs or new content brought in I think that would be rad.\n\nMore random maps rotating to run through for one.  Get creative with them.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506574271, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506574271, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 987, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 114, "total_reviews": 1101}}
