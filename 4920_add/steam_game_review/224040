As a collector, sometimes it is worth it to have one of a kind, unique, random stuff in your library, and LocoCycle fits that bill perfectly. This game is full of odd jokes (like the \"how to play\" screen on the main menu being in spanish) and a character who constantly speaks spanish with subtitles and is misunderstood by everyone. The cutscenes are fairly high quality with a surely intentional \"B-Movie\" feel to them, and the gameplay is solid. I've owned this game for a few years now, and I put in about 2 hours per year! I kept forgetting about it, but slowly and surely I came back unti I finished the story. This game won't win any awards, but it sure was a good chuckle and some fun gameplay for a solid 4-5 hours. -PR0XIDIAN", "timestamp_updated": 1496790633, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496790633, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31057985", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1491820005, "steamid": "76561197962296785", "num_games_owned": 1088, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Lococycle is a tragically under-appreciated game.\n\nIt's like a B-Movie made into a B-Game (plus a short movie's worth of live action cutscenes). It's one of those things that's so stupid, it's brilliant.\n\nI imagine it's gotten a lot of bad reception because of people taking it too seriously. It's short (took me about 3-4 hours to do everything), it's not particularly difficult or complicated, and it isn't built to amaze with fancy graphics or high production values (which might also be part of the problem - it was an XBox One launch title). Lococycle isn't a deep game.\n\nWhat it is, is a slapstick comedy spectacle fighter. Clearly it isn't the sort of comedy that appeals to everyone, but for those who have a high tolerance or love for ridiculousness and cheesiness, it's an absolute gem.
