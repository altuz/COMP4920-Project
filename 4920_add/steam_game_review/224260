Another fact is that such maps possess variation between rounds, so you will have another route of objectives to execute.\nMost of the maps also contain secrets and special features.\nYou are not a superhero: you will bleed, you will be infected and you can also suicide yourself for the greater good of the group.\n\nOverall review:\n\nPros:\n\n- Free game.\n- Extremely fun with friends (the more people you play, the better).\n- Realistic gun mechanics and decent melee combat while keeping a good gameplay.\n- Nice graphics (taking in account the fact that the game was made in 2011).\n- Extremely well made animations of itens and weapons in first person.\n- Very good optimization (very few bugs, and no performance issues at all).\n- Good gun and attack sounds.\n- Characters possess a varied soundbank of quick chat commands, giving you quick communication with your fellow survivors.\n- The VOIP inside the game simulates real conversation, the far you are from another player, the lower is your voice (you can use an in game walkie talkie to communicate from afar without issues).\n- Lots of maps with good level design.\n- Two map types with lot of variation.\n- Very good amount of guns and melee weapons (arround 20 firearms and a bow, and 20 melee weapons, there are also 3 throwable explosives).\n- People still play this game to this day (so you will find people to play with you without a problem).\n\nCons:\n\n- Few zombie models (you will kill the same zombies all over again).\n- Some animations of ammo checking are wrong.\n- Playing alone is difficult in most cases (not recommended to play alone, this is a cooperative game after all).\n- Sometimes the zombie attack animation can be quite poor (depending on you position).\n- The music is quite boring (my personal opinion, maybe you will like it).\n\nWhile the game has minor flaws, it is a very enjoyable experience and will bring you and your friends lots of desperating moments and agony (the good kind of it).\nA good adventure.\n\nOverall score:\n\n91/100", "timestamp_updated": 1487017810, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486942177, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "29560529", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515173", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1485689608, "steamid": "76561198117849570", "num_games_owned": 1233, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "I used to play this a lot back in 2012 with my roommates when I was in college.

One of bests free games on Steam.\nYou can play chain objectives maps or defensive maps (where you can make barricades). \nIf bitten you become a zombie and attack your friends.\n\nIt\u00b4s not just a random shotting like left 4 dead. Here you have few bullets, and must make a good use of them.\nTeamwork is the key here.\n\nI have found 1 or 2 bugs in some maps, where the player get stucks in the wall. But still a great game.\n\n-- Better than a lot of paid zombie games on Steam --", "timestamp_updated": 1488027297, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488027297, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "30164997", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498761", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1491553522, "steamid": "76561198142635376", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 12, "review": "CRikey", "timestamp_updated": 1488023232, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488023232, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "29948555", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1487192065, "steamid": "76561197975705171", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I loved it!", "timestamp_updated": 1487189199, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487189199, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "29594462", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1465016879, "steamid": "76561198080725573", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 4, "review": "Joined a server and met a guy name John.\nJohn looked nice.\nHe had a pretty cool shotgun.\nNow I have the cool shotgun.", "timestamp_updated": 1485816640, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485816640, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "29715877", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504599753, "steamid": "76561198285615261", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I love this game but I hope you are doing an update", "timestamp_updated": 1486292943, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486292943, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "29710092", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505599625, "steamid": "76561198031334118", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 16703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[i]Bash the heads of zombies and occasionally your teammates with fists or a sledgehammer.

Don't forget to bring a friend![/i]\n\nNo More Room in Hell is a neat little HL2 mod, that i'd honestly recommend over other zombie games for many, many reasons, such as having an unique atmosphere that really takes you into the game on a perspective where you'll have to work as a team instead of just being a mindless shooter that literally anyone could play.\n\nThat being said, NMRiH takes a more realistic approach on the zombie scheme; slow paced action, everything can be used to save your or someone elses ass, ammo is (fairly often) scarce and should be saved rather than just used on the first enemy on sight. It may not be as action driven as one may think but the slow paced gameplay fits really well to the impression of the apocalyptic world, where everyone is trying to survive till they get to safety.\n\nSo what about the techinal thingies?\n\nYes it has some bugs but most of the time you'll barely notice these minor things. Yes there could be some further fixing with the game but overall but in general the game works and functions really well.\n\nIt's a really good addition to anyones zombie game collection, no need to wait for sales or anything because it's for grabs at anytime for free!\n\n10/10 Would bash my teammates heads in with fists again and again till i get kicked/banned", "timestamp_updated": 1486269948, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486269948, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 311, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 59, "total_reviews": 370}}
