The action segments often come to have a gruesomely satisfying feel to them, and are kept interesting by unlocking various combo attacks throughout the game.\n\nIf you have played the Soul Reaver games, you will probably be absolutely horrified by the camera controls (or lack therof) in this game, at least I was. I went as far as trying to install a 3rd party application to make the camera more akin to the earlier games. When that didn't work out, I begrudgingly decided to give it a go anyway. Don't despair! It IS possible to get used to, and in the process you get a kind of increased cinematic feeling, which is very suitable for the epic scale of the story at this point.\n\nThroughout the game you will encounter both boss fights and puzzles, but honestly nothing as inventive as Soul Reaver 1 and 2 respectively. Be that as it may, the enjoyable combat system and ever-present epicness of the story, is quite enough to make me give this game a resounding thumbs up.", "timestamp_updated": 1506603586, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506603586, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 155, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 21, "total_reviews": 176}}
