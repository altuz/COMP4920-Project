It's thoughful, clever, stylish, and just a bit challenging.  It pays some homage to Limbo, but the machanics here are more in-depth (more action buttons than just move and jump).  The vibe is early 20th century noir.  You might find the game short, but to me, it simply doesn't overstay its welcome.

The story is kinda clich\u00e9 and predictable, but the gameplay makes the game worth playing.\n\n[h1]What's so good about it?[/h1]\nThe concept behind the game. Each puzzle is unique, which makes the game bring a variety of complex puzzles demanding creativity and fast-reacting action-based levels.\nI did say the main story was clich\u00e9, but I didn't say the lore behind the Contrast universe is back. The illusionist Vincenzo, a character in the game, leaves many questions as to who you are, why you are there, and if the story is happening in another universe or not.\nBesides the story and standard objectives, you can also find some collectibles along the way. They aren't essential for the game, but they do clarify some of the background concepts. One of which is who your character, Dawn is. [spoiler]It becomes clear throughout the game that people cannot see you. Close to the end, at the lighthouse, you can find a letter about a woman disappearing, including photos of your character. [b]SUPER SPOILER:[/b] I'm still not sure, but I'm guessing Vincenzo asked Dawn to \"disappear\" and take care of his daughter.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Is the game still that perfect...?[/h1]\nNo. Naturally, there are some things to say about the game. Sometimes, you can't find any solutions to cross a gap, so sometimes you're finding solutions that make you feel like you're not solving the puzzle the way the developers wanted you to do. The borders of the map also are giant gaps, where the world just literally ends. Later on in the game, you'll find out that it's supposed to be like that, but I personally think they could've thought of something esthetically more pleasing.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] (+) Cool shadow concept\n[*] (+) Predictable but enjoyable story\n[*] (+) Increasing difficulty - from easy to harder\n[*] (+) No repetitive puzzles\n[*] (+) Sexy main character (everyone know what her [i]real[/i] job is ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n[*] (-) Some of the shadows are little buggy\n[*] (-) Some objects and textures seem a little out of place\n[/list]\n\nI would give this game a [b]6/10[/b].

It's not the longest game, but it doesn't need to be either. The characters weren't overly engaging, but intersting enough that you actually want a happy ending.

Right up there with Bastion and Transistor.
