That said; here is my honest review.\n\nPROS:\n+great storyline\n+fantastic music\n+good cutscenes\n+detailed environments\n+decent dialog/bantering\n\nCONS: (serious flaws)\n- gamebreaking bugs\n- non-replayability\n- no restart (developer FAIL)\n- abilites lack flavor and limitations\n\nBeing an original Dungeons and Dragons fan, I enjoyed the dungeon crawling and mix of outdoor scenery.  HOWEVER, their was a crippling lack choices in this game that make this game irritating beyond measure.\n\n1. 6 abilites to choose from, but only have buttons for 4?\n2. AI will fail to pick up potions/heath or Mana, crippling their use.\n3. Once you start a game, you cannot restart ? !!! That's right, you actually have to go into your game folder and delete every trace of the saved games - if you don't like your spell build and want to restart mid-game, well, sucks to be you because you CAN'T.  Want OLD SCHOOL hard mode, well you have to finished every side quest with no clue as to where they are, and your glowing wisps (directional hints) will send you astray, and if you hit the wrong button, oops, well you have to complete the entire game ALL OVER AGAIN, first !!!\n4. Once you spend your \"very limited\" crystals on spells, there won't be any more, so you better choose right the first time.\n5. Adventurers collect gold drops - apparently for no reason at all, this is NOT a RPG as one might expect, its uber-linear, \n6. Dangles a giant Ogre in the face of the player, which you never get to fight.  End of the game, simply makes no sense. \n7. Hope you like sticking like a bug to flypaper, becuase you get glued to every cover wall you get close to as if you were wearing armor made of magnets. \n8. The aiming mechanics are \"aweful\" okay, worse than that, they're entirely  horrendeous. \n\nIf you like 3rd person camera man - not actually in the game / duck and hide gameplay, they this is for you.  The Developers should have fixed the glaring \"RESTART NEW GAME\" feature, but failed to do so, sending it down its dark dreary path of despair and unplayability.  This game had so much potential ~ yet was handicapped by its own designers.  DEV's, here's a word of advice, a player should be free to restart a new game at any time - instead of being shackled to a single play-through. AND - give gamers choice of Third  or First person - to appease both crowds (and you can actually see what you are aiming at!)  \n\nUnfortunately, I had to give this game a NEGATIVE: because of its start game function failings and lack of aiming and camera angles & player models that will actually block your line of sight - which is the main form of combat for an archer, silly Dev's."}]}
