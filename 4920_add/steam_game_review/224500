Most of even the negative ones have 70+ hours invested. In my opinion at least 20$ for minimum 70 hours of gameplay, thats well worth the deal.\nFor a little on the game itself, the initial learning curve is fairly steep but not hard to figure out. It's a lot of fun to get things rolling start planning on the next expanion or project to have your gnomes work on only to have the next enemy attack be just a bit stronger then you had expected and now you have another fallen kingdom to look at and reminisce.\nA tip for newer players is to disable zombies, they really can just domino your entire populace into the ground.\nAlso make sure to check the battle logs after larger or interesting fights. Once had a gnome transporting cotton when an attack came, he decided NOT to drop the damn cotton and pull out his sword, instead just fighting with a shield, the goblin on the other hand had picked up one of the doors it broke on the way in, and was swinging it around. So a shield gnome vs a door swinging goblin, it was a hilarious combat log to read that ended with every single bone in the goblin body broken and his lungs crushed.", "timestamp_updated": 1505944062, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505944062, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34911979", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498826", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505273428, "steamid": "76561198049479077", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fun on a bun.", "timestamp_updated": 1505269644, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505269644, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1399, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 8, "total_negative": 385, "total_reviews": 1784}}
