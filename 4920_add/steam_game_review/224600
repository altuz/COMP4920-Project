Wont even begin to go into detail with their seemingly corrupt customer service that has banned accounts on whims and false information, in some cases people are getting banned for NO reason.

Not trying to spoil anything, but to find the real story behind the Defiant few was very powerful and shows the horrors of war.  If you watched the TV series you can see how Nolen would look down or ashamed when they called him one of the defiant fee.  I liked the episodes they added, Defiance just had the same problem as most MMOs with end game being sucky.  Also I am not a big PvPer, but being a very big PvE player, the PvP was actually very good.  Also I did like the challenges they added into the game to give players things to do.
