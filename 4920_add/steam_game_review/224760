Absolutely yes, but not to everyone.\n\nThis 2,3,4 dimensional game can be amazing IF you are looking for a challenge and you love to solve puzzles for hours and hours or if you love an artistic experience where, but I can't recommend this to you if you get tired easily, because in my opinion this game is intended to be played the right way, solving every single and hard puzzle that it challenges to u.\n\nMY final score: 64/64\n\nPS: A M A Z I N G  S O U N D T R A C K", "timestamp_updated": 1502942564, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502942467, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33870511", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505086", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1478513450, "steamid": "76561198066596658", "num_games_owned": 415, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 7, "review": "Game me several headaches\n\n10/10 would cry again", "timestamp_updated": 1501294628, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501294628, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "33426238", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1483296895, "steamid": "76561198046992905", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fez plays smoothly for the most part, there were some issues where the game crashed a few times, but nothing more annoying than simply having to restart the game.

Luckily, not much was lost and it allowed for the ability to start over and explore a different path. These are minor issues though and the game runs pretty well, so do net let that issue scare anyone off from buying this great game.

At a certain point you need more gold in order to continue and then the \"fun\" starts. Where did I miss the needed gold?
