It is but in a \"so bad it's good\" sort of way. The flight controls are super basic and most of the enemies are trivially easy to beat once you know what you are doing but it's just fun to blast nazi space saucers. I can't even point my finger on what makes the combat in this game enjoyable, I should hate this game given how primitive it is but I enjoy it. \n\nAnother thing to note is the cutscenes, the closest thing they remind me of are the cutscenes in Red Alert series, they are corny, full of stereotypes and display a \"pornstar\" tier of acting ability but dammit I love them. I missed cheesy game cutscenes that don't take themselves seriously and I reckon this game is worth getting just for them but only at a discount.\n\nDon't get this at full price but get it on 50% off if you like basic space games and deliciously cheesy cutscenes.", "timestamp_updated": 1500959172, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500959172, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33734760", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502735", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500855597, "steamid": "76561198079763299", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "As far as movie tie-ins, this one's rather good. It's a simple space shooter, similar to the old Tie Fighter and Wing Commander series, narrated in the same style as the movie. What sets it apart from the basic cheap space shooters is the fact that there is persistence between the missions and the AI keeps fighting among themselves even when you're not around. It can be played in first person view but there is no cockpit. It supports the Xbox 360 controller but not a proper HOTAS setup. \n\nDefinitely worth the price of admission.", "timestamp_updated": 1500778007, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500778007, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 107, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 64, "total_reviews": 171}}
