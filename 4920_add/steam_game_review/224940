While the story in this game continues to be very engaging, the enemy variety is sadly quite small, and there's rarely a reason to fight unless you are barred in by invisible forcewalls.\n\nThe eponymous wraith blade has in this game been re-imagined to be more of a kind of \"skeleton-key\" than an actual weapon. Although the blade can still be used to f*** people's s*** up, there's a certain game mechanic that makes this less desirable than using other weapons. I find the evolution of the wraith blade to be quite interesting between the three games featuring Raziel.\n\nWhile I consider this to be the weaker entry in the series (especially due to the complete lack of true boss-fights), it's still highly enjoyable, and sets a perfect jumping point for the climactic finish in LoK: Defiance.", "timestamp_updated": 1506602268, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506602268, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35153868", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502017", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506172640, "steamid": "76561197970645929", "num_games_owned": 395, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Something is not right on a modern system (win 10), my guess is the internal game engine timing if off. Very spazzy attacks and devour button only works half the time.  I cannot progress past like 15 min in when you have to faze through the metal gate. The games gets locked in a weird broken state where the sphere selection menu breaks leaving you stuck in a weird limbo thats inbetween both realms. I tried multiple times, same result.\n\nI loaded up the ps2 version on a emualtor just to make sure and its this port as the ps2 plays fine. Plus no gamepad support on this one, not that it would fix anything.\n\nThought I would add the reason my gameplay time is over an hour is cause I literally had to watch the unskipable intro area cutscenes like 5 time haha.", "timestamp_updated": 1506174271, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506174042, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 86, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 31, "total_reviews": 117}}
