Do i try to get an advantage by being more mana-efficient than my opponent, do I try to win via board control or do I just rush my opponent? If you want to win you have to play to your decks strength. Also a big part of the game is reading your opponent and predicting what cards he has. \n\nOne example: I'm ahead in board control, my opponent just played a very low impact card and he has a lot of fire mana saved up, that means that he is probably preparing to play Armageddon which deals a lot of damage to all creature on the board. So if I correctly predict this I can take advantage of it by not overcommitting and not playing any expensive creatures next turn because they'd probably die.\nAdvanced players will use this to bluff you. e.g. a player might save up a lot of air mana which makes the opponent afraid of the spell Lightning Bolt, which deals massive damage to the enemy player's hp. So the opponent may waste his turn by casting expensive heals even though it was a bluff and the opponent doesn't have Lightning Bolt.\nAll this predicting and bluffing wouldn't work as well if the game didn't have a limited number of cards.\n\nOh I almost forgot the most important point about not being a TCG, the game isn't pay to win, it's all about skill.\n\n\nOther important points:\n- The game has still an active online community even though the game is 5 years old\n- The computer AI is really clever and good at predicting your moves, so if you don't like online play, it's never boring to play against the computer\n- The campaign is pretty okay, every fight has special rules, so it's nice and varied, though as I said the best thing about the game is the online play\n- you can get a lot of value out of the demo. I played like a hundred online games before I bought the game (but a year or so ago they added a 5 games per day restriction to the demo)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1454758493, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478748", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "20993498", "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967626206", "num_reviews": 37, "last_played": 1454835336, "num_games_owned": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 723}, "timestamp_updated": 1454758493, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a good game.

If you don't like sometimes losing because you draw a bad hand, you shouldn't want to ever play card games. Well, Spectromancer is a bit different.\n\nThere are 4 basic elements and 1 special element depending on your mage. For each element, there are 4 cards you can play costing various amounts of mana. These cards can either be spells or monsters. These cards are reused throughout the entire match. You don't get to choose which cards you get, and you don't draw cards. You may get a different combination of cards in different matches however as there are more than four cards in each element.\n\nYou can have up to 5 monsters on your side of the field. Normally you get one of each mana per turn, but some spells give mana and a few monsters boost mana generation. \n\nI believe you start with 20 hit points and you can play a single card per turn. Gameplay is generally fast paced. You can die in a couple turns if your generated cards are weak against the enemy's. Since you get mana every turn, you can play several weaker monsters while waiting to cast a strong spell or monster. \n\nBalance between monsters is pretty good. Some are virtually unkillable with regeneration, some hit the entire enemy row, some are immune to magical spells. Spells can range from healing the player to wiping the entire field. \nThere are quite a few deck strategies to use, but since you don't pick you cards you generally decide the strategy on the first turn.\n\nCards that enhance mana generation are generally weak, but are very powerful in combination with monsters that grow stronger based on that type of mana. \nUse tanks to hold the line while nuking your opponent's life directly. \nRushing the enemy down with swarms of low mana monsters. This isn't as strong since there are several spells that do damage to multiple creatures. It could be used to safely bring out a stronger monster once your opponent has nuked the field.\n\nThe campaign is pretty fun the first few times you play. The opponents start off fairly easy and then get pretty brutal. Different decks help keep the game fresh, and the random combination of cards means you can't rely on solely one combination of cards to win games. \n\nI haven't tried the DLC, but they seem to add new mage types. These mage types represent the fifth element of mana. They are the unique cards that add even more depth to the game. \n\nI believe this game has been in an Amazon bundle recently. Therefore it probably stands to reason that if you have a backlog, you can probably wait for the eventual sale to buy this game. With Hearthstone coming out in the future, I can't see much reason to buy this game. But since that's not out yet,  you should pick this up if the game goes on sale.
