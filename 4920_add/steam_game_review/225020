AOD is a mixed bag with very few positive qualities. \n\nThere are a couple reasons why AOD deserves a bit of praise\u2014story writer Murti Schofield and music composer Peter Connelly. Schofield gives Tomb Raider/Lara Croft a darker edge and provides an intriguing direction. Connelly with help of The London Symphony Orchestra both add a beautiful and moody score. Visuals are decent (for the time) despite apparent glitches (missing textures) that I only noticed in the PC version. \n\nAOD\u2019s biggest stumbling block is the gameplay. It\u2019s no secret AOD went through development hell. Yet, that is still no excuse for inferior controls and gameplay to that of the original Tomb Raider games (TR1-5). Certain non-Tomb Raider elements such as dialog conversation trees and stealth should have never been in AOD to begin with. Other features such as the RPG/ability mechanics are so wrecked and elementary it just feels gimmicky. Lara Croft moves awkwardly in the game. Often sluggish and slow and a downgrade to TR1-5, which use outdated technology/ game engines. Luckily, there is a control fix mod (look up Sasho\u2019s Control Mod) that help the experience a little.  \n\nThe first-half (Paris segments) is where the player will likely notice AOD\u2019s pitfalls mostly as it\u2019s very non-Tomb Raider and showcases the majority of AOD\u2019s broken elements (dialog tree\u2019s, useless items, gimmicks, etc.). Mid-way through the game (Hall of Seasons) AOD certainly picks up and the game starts resembling Tomb Raider. At that point you\u2019ll be pulling levels, collecting treasures, dodging traps, and fighting skeletons straight out of Army of Darkness (minus evil Ash). Sadly, AOD takes a slight nose dive again as the player is forced to explore more bare cities before confronting more tomb raiding territory once more. Surprisingly, these bits are okay.  \n\nAOD ends on a cliffhanger, and it\u2019s unfortunate the story was discontinued. With that said, there is still a lot of lore within the game as well as the web (via documents and artwork), and books by AOD\u2019s writer, Schofield. It\u2019s worth checking out, but only if you are a big fan of the series. Otherwise, it\u2019s best to say Core Design probably should have ended with the fourth entry, Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, which was Core\u2019s true efforts at delivering the ultimate Tomb Raider experience\u2014it truly was Core\u2019s swan song to the fans.  \n\nPROS:\n+The darker storyline\n+Musical score\n+The second half of the game (the bits that involve raiding tombs). \n\nCONS:\n-Broken gameplay (items that have no use, empty city hubs, cheap gimmicks)\n-Broken controls \n-Too many grunting (Lara Croft literally grunts at everything...she is miserable in this game)", "timestamp_updated": 1506401517, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506278721, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 97, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 67, "total_reviews": 164}}
