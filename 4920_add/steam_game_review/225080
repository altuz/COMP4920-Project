It does not rely on any words at all, excluding explanations on controls. The characters do talk, but you are not supposed to understand them, and you really don't need to either.\n\nThe story is simple but effective. You probably already read it in the game's description. That's about it.\n\nThe gameplay of solving puzzles and basic platforming with two characters at once is not challenging but unusual and it takes some getting used to. However, it is fun throughout the entire time and does not get boring the slightest. The game *can* be played with a keyboard, but you really shouldn't; it was made for a controller.\n\nThe soundtrack is very sweet and the scenery is quite immersive, covering a large variety of environments in such a short time. Graphics aren't top-notch but it doesn't bother me at all.\n\nSince it is a few years old now, you can easily get it during a sale, which makes up for the short gameplay.", "timestamp_updated": 1504837153, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504836094, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35193972", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498405120, "steamid": "76561198123748482", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "That moment at the ending... if you played the game, you will know that moment.
