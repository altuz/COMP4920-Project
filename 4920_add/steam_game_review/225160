I remember having a great time with it. Much has been said about this game in terms of racism and the stereotypical approach to  the world in which it develops and the characters that take part in it. Some have written interesting essays on the subject.*\nI believe it should be taken humorously as it appears the intentions behind the character and world development are naive and satire-laden. I know there is a fine line between being satirical while remarking cultural cliches  and utter bigotry. When we get overserious on some matters we stop enjoying and having fun.\nThat said, shadow warrior, along with other build engine games from that time, set an important precedent for the FPS genre.\nSW redux allowed me to revisit this great game and realize once more how far the genre has evolved ever since.\n\n\n[code]* Ow, Jeffrey A. \u201cRevenge of the Yellowfaced Cyborg Terminator.\u201d Race in Cyberspace.
