For the RTS part you do stage battles where you build towers that make energy for your troop production, there are about 4 factions and each have their own unique play style with their own cool units. You also can use solos to summon more troops, build towers, move troops, use special powers and even buff or debuff others.

He's not an awful person, I just find his persona to be a bit annoying. \n\nAt the same time I like Metal music, I'm not an uber fan, and I feel like at times this game expects you to be an uber fan of Metal music to really love this game.  Since I'm not at that level, I still enjoyed the music, but banking so much on one style of music is a pretty gutsy move. \n\nThe story feels like it almost lags in the second half of the game, what began as a really interesting and funny premise seems to be monotonous in the second half.   You go from a gorgeous landscape to well three rather dull locations.  The game switches from the action adventure feel to more RTS battles which each feel quite dull especially after you had a Zeldaesque experience. \n\nAnd finally there's the gameplay.  I like Zelda, and I mostly like RTSes, Brutal Legend though found a way to make me kind of hate it's gameplay as a mix of the two.  The RTS sections aren't exactly thrilling, and the adventure parts of the game are dull.  \n\nSo clearly I dislike it right?  \n\nWell the first half of the game has a lot of great moments.  While the second half really isn't as good, the first half is pretty sweet, the second half just is ok.  The gameplay as an RTS isn't annoying like many RTSes and it allows you to fight instead of just being an RTS, so it's not fully committed to RTSes, where some games are all or nothing, and the final battle is kind of cool and different.  It's not a battle you can just win, but you have to just barely survive, if you know how (and if you don't, you'll have to figure it out) \n\nThe metal in the game is awesome.  Having Ozzy Osbourne have a cameo is brilliant, so much of the music is awesome, and the story is quite metal.  In fact the entire sound and music in the game is AMAZING.  Definitely worth playing. \n\nAnd as I said I'm not a huge Jack Black fan, but I liked him in this.  So that worked.  Even his over the top antics works great for when you're doing a stage slide past an enemy and grinding on a guitar. \n\nThis is a game where I recommend it with some big caveats.  If you don't like heavy metal (or just metal/rock in general)  you're going to have a bad time.  If you don't want to play an RTS (because make no question about it, this is an RTS even if it starts off as an adventure game) you're going to have a bad time.  If you want a really strong story, you're ... you get it, right? \n\nBut at the same time I'm not a huge Tim Schaeffer/Double Fine fan, and most of his games leave me a little flat.  This game really made me happy, even if it's not perfect, so I recommend it, but you really have to understand that even the demo doesn't give a good representation of the final product, and that does kind of annoy me(the bait and switch).  But if you want to see a new take on an RTS, or hear some awesome Metal music while playing a game, this is really your only option.", "timestamp_updated": 1504661773, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504661773, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34887942", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498700", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1398109014, "steamid": "76561197980567554", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Through the woods a girl came sadly.\nSomething broken in her chest.\nShe had dared to love another.\nAlas, no better than the rest.\nUp my path the girl came gladly.\nSomething opened up my doors.\nI longed to stop her bleeding heart.\nAnd so I called her to my shores.\nThose you trust will hurt you badly.\nSomething now I'm sure you see.\nSo drown your tears in me my dear.\nAs you drown, my dear, in me.", "timestamp_updated": 1505154653, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505154424, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34964315", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499456", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1451959828, "steamid": "76561198066662281", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Few would argue that Ozzy Osbourne is one of the biggest characters rock and roll has ever produced. He\u2019s certainly lived a life filled with adventures, misadventures, sex, drugs and rock and roll, and craziness of all sorts, some of it hard to believe. Yes, indeed, Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s life is the stuff of legends. 1. Born in December1948, Ozzy Osbourne graduated high school at 15 (they graduate younger in the U.K. than in the U.S.) Before Ozzy turned 18, he was arrested and convicted for burglary and sentenced to three months in prison. (Ozzy had to do the time because his father refused to pay the fine.)2. While still in school, Ozzy\u2019s metal shop teacher, Mr. Lane, often punished Ozzy by slapping him on the arse with a big piece of wood. To get even, Ozzy liked to heat a penny for three or four minutes and then slip it into Mr. Lane\u2019s desk. At some point, Mr. Lane, out of curiosity, would pick up the penny and \u2013 yeow! - Ozzy would get a good laugh.\n3. While still a teenager, Ozzy got a position in a slaughterhouse. His job was to kill cows by shooting them in the head with a gun that fired a steel spike. At times, Ozzy would end up covered with blood and guts.\n4. While singing with Earth, the band that would eventually become Black Sabbath, Ozzy, in an effort to always play the clown, would do just about anything to get the audience\u2019s attention. One time he found some purple paint backstage and covered his nose with it. Unfortunately, the paint was indelible and didn\u2019t wear off for weeks!\n5. While on the road with Black Sabbath in the early 1970s, the hotel where the band was staying was invaded by Satanists, some of whom had camped out in front of Ozzy\u2019s hotel room. To get rid of these fanatics, Ozzy blew out their candles and sang to them \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d\n6. When Ozzy\u2019s first wife Thelma Riley began giving birth to Ozzy\u2019s first child \u2013 the girl he would name Jessica \u201cStarshine\u201d Osbourne \u2013 Thelma insisted he had to drive her to the hospital. The trouble was, Ozzy was drunk (\u201cpissed\u201d as Ozzy often expressed it) and didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. He drove anyway.\n7. At the end of an American tour in 1972, Ozzy, who had been sampling groupies for months, got a blast of penicillin before returning home to the missus.\n8. In those days, Ozzy and Thelma had lots of new cars. When Thelma\u2019s brand new Mercedes inexplicably got all these scratches on it, Ozzy investigated and discovered that stray cats were climbing on it while it was kept in the garage. So, one night, Ozzy sneaked into the garage, whipped out his shotgun and blasted as many cats as he could.\n9. Once day when the vicar paid the Osbournes a visit (Ozzy is a member of the Church of England), Thelma inadvertently gave the priest a big piece of cake that Ozzy had laced with some potent Afghan hashish. Soon the vicar passed out, and the Osbournes had to carry him to the car and take him home. For three days the vicar was ripped and, fortunately for the Osbournes, didn\u2019t remember what had happened to him.\n10. On a flight home to England, Ozzy was carrying four grams of cocaine in his sock. Worried about taking the dope through customs, Ozzy gave the coke to the stewardesses, who snorted the stuff while still working on the plane.\n11. Thelma, in an effort to keep Ozzy from partying all the time, bought him a coop filled with chickens. But Ozzy hated the chickens and hated feeding them. One night, while drunk, he took his shotgun to the coop and began shooting the birds. Then he set fire to the coop and into the flames he threw live shotgun cartridges, and they soon went bang-bang-bang!\n12. One night during the \u201cBlizzard of Ozz\u201d tour in Germany, while dining with some straight-laced folks, Ozzy climbed onto the table and began doing a striptease. Once naked, Ozzy urinated into this man\u2019s carafe of wine. After that, Ozzy wasn\u2019t invited back to Germany for many years.13. During a meeting at CBS records, Ozzy, now a solo artist, in order to impress the public relations people, pulled out a dove, bit off its head and threw it on a table, where it twitched about, spilling blood and feces everywhere. Soon, somebody shouted, \u201cGet this animal out of here! Now!\u201d Then they threw Ozzy from the premises.\n14. During Ozzy\u2019s \u201cDiary of a Madman\u201d tour in the early 1980s, he would use a catapult to hurl pieces of meat into the audience. Enamored of Ozzy\u2019s bizarre routine, young people would bring pieces of animals to the performances. One time, a kid brought an ox\u2019s head \u2013 after he had killed and dismembered the beast!\n15. During one performance, somebody in the audience threw something at Ozzy. He thought it was a rubber bat, so he picked it up and chomped down on it. Soon, realizing something was wrong, Ozzy spit out a live bat. Later, as a precautionary measure, Ozzy had to get rabies shots.\n16. While touring in San Antonio, Texas, Ozzy got drunk one night, and Sharon Arden (later to become his wife), took Ozzy\u2019s clothes, hoping to keep him at the hotel and hopefully out of trouble. But Ozzy donned one of Sharon\u2019s frilly frocks and took a walk. Later, while still dressed in drag, he took a leak on the walls of the Alamo, a historic national monument, where the cops soon busted him. It was a decade before the authorities allowed Ozzy to play in San Antonio again.\n17. When Ozzy had guests stay at his house at Outland Cottage in England, he would slip into their rooms at night and shave off their eyebrows. Ozzy thought this was hilarious fun.\n18. In Memphis, Tennessee one night, Ozzy, drunk and looking for a place to urinate, chose a white car parked in a lay-by. Then he soon discovered this was an unmarked police car, and the lady cop at the wheel arrested him and threw him in jail for the rest of the night.\n19. While in Germany once again, Ozzy Osbourne, drunk while seeing the sights, may have been the only person ever thrown out of Dachau concentration camp.\n20. This time in Albuquerque, New Mexico, while drunk and coked out of his head, Ozzy took a ride in an aerial tramway. When the vehicle suddenly stopped a thousand feet up, Ozzy took a ladder to the roof of the vehicle, lifted the hatch and climbed atop it. Then, when the thing started moving again, Ozzy rode there, his arms wide, as if surfing at Malibu.\n21. During the AIDS scare in the middle 1980s, Ozzy finally realized that you didn\u2019t have to be gay to catch the deadly disease. So, one time, after sleeping with a groupie, he had himself checked for the virus. At first, the doctor thought Ozzy had AIDS, then he later changed his diagnosis. Ozzy was so freaked out by the experience he vowed to never again cheat on Sharon.\n22. While flying one time, a woman sitting in front of Ozzy kept annoying him, so he slipped a Doom Dot into her drink and soon the lady fell asleep. This Doom Dot was a so-called Mickey, actually a gel cap containing chloral hydrate.\n23. In September 1989, at perhaps the worst period of Ozzy\u2019s drugging, he was arrested and charged with attempted murder by strangulation of his wife, Sharon Osbourne. Later, Sharon dropped the charges.\n24. Invited to a White House dinner during the administration of George W. Bush, Ozzy got blasted on alcohol and, while screaming wildly in front of 1,800 people, Bush could be heard saying, \u201cThis might have been a mistake.\u201d\n25. During 2002, when The Osbournes, one of television\u2019s first reality shows, was a big hit on MTV, Ozzy was taking as many as 25 Vicodin pills per day, and this was among as many as 42 different prescriptions drugs he consumed on a daily basis.\n26. Happening in more recent times, because it was something Ozzy had always wanted to do, he and his friend Zakk Wylde pushed a 50-inch TV set through the ninth floor window of a hotel and let it fall to the pavement below. When this huge TV set hit the ground it exploded like a nuclear bomb. The hotel charged Ozzy $38,000 for the destruction of the television.", "timestamp_updated": 1505451667, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505451667, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35455980", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497572", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1488958378, "steamid": "76561198170902655", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "good game quality, great gamplay controls, and a fun story. classic music.", "timestamp_updated": 1507062247, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507062247, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34845473", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495334", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504986910, "steamid": "76561198016477228", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is Metal.
