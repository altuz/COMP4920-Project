Essentially, it's Tomb Raider I and II on steroids. Core Design focuses more on opening the environments up a bit more by making the levels bigger and non-linear. Honestly, Core achieved this better with The Last Revelation.\n\nTRIII has a variety of content, probably more so than the other classic TR installments. Core implemented new effects as well such as; a new lighting system, weather system, water effects, and triangular geometry\u2014all a first for the series (at the time).\n\nConclusion: \nTomb Raider III does for Tomb Raider what The Sims: Livin\u2019 Large did for The Sims. It\u2019s basically more of the same with slight upgrades here and there. \n\nPROS:\n+Challenging and rewarding\n+Nice effects\n+Variety of weapons, levels, moves, outfits, and vehicles\n+Good Boss battles \n+Lara\u2019s Mansion (Training Level)\n\nCONS: \n-Sometimes too challenging\n-New crawling move slows down the pacing\n-Lots of urban environments that feel a bit out of place\n-Tedious vehicle sections that suffer from bad controls\n-Vague story.", "timestamp_updated": 1506638105, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506638059, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 126, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 22, "total_reviews": 148}}
