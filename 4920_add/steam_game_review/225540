(16gb ram and a 970, so im not really running top tier hardware either)\n-replayable settlements (something i wish was added in JC2)\n\ncons: \n-the WORST i repeat WORST driving physics of any game in existance GUARENTEED. motorcycles are practically undrivable, as any controll input will barely move the bike unless held for a long duration. however, once you get it to turn past a few inches to each side, there is no middle ground. the bike makes a sudden and unexplainable 90 degree turn, sending you careening off the clifside and resorting to your parachute\n-the biggest issue i have with this game by far is that it feels like the designers just stopped trying when they reached the top half of the map. the bottom chains of islands are densely packed with all manner of locations, and things to do, where the top half feels empty and repetitive\n-takes quite a beefy PC to run anywhere close to max settings\n-the typical Just Cause glitchyness\n\n\nOverall, i love this game and play the hell out of it, however i understand its not for everybody. i recomend this game immensely, and give it a solid 8/10", "timestamp_updated": 1507079503, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507079503, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35198211", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509968", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506325347, "steamid": "76561197999983175", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Constant Frame stuttering, followed by glitched sounds.\n\nJust utterly broken garbage.\n\nHell, the first time I launched it it slowed my PC down to the point I absolutely had to restart it.", "timestamp_updated": 1506325579, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "6", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506325497, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "35221882", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503093", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498853971, "steamid": "76561198161730687", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Haven't completed the story and I probably never will just because no one gives a sh\u00a1t about the story.

At least until they come out with a fourth one. One of the best qualities about this game is its replayability. I finished the story at about 100 hours (It's a long story), but after that there was still a good 75 hours left of gameplay.

With a game that has over 50 achievements, it can take a long time. EVEN AFTER THAT, there's more.

Using the keyboard during flying was just absolutely horrible.  You would have to machine gun the keys for fine adjustments, especially in the jet (up/down motion).  Driving cars in this came using the keyboard is horribly rough, the keyboard response in the GTA series was a lot better than this game by far.  \n\nThen there's the tank cannon/heli gun movement with the mouse, the movement is so ridiculously slow.  When you\u2019re in a fire fight and it takes you literally 3 second (+/-1) to move the tank cannon or the helicopters guns into place, you\u2019re either already dead or about to be.  \n\nThe graphics were really good, the story line and plot was great (at least up to were I stopped playing) \u2013 but without smooth (or smoother) keyboard sensitivity the game is just terrible.  If certain hitboxes were bigger, or certain missions were skippable (penalty of some sort given to compensate), I would be ok with it.
