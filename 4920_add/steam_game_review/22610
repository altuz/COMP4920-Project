This review goes for all three games despite that initially I only played ep2 (check it in my library if you don't believe me). I upgraded the whole trilogy recently because of the cheap price and because of the name.\n\nI am a huge fan of the original Amiga games. I played the floppy disc versions so much that my discs stopped working and I had to get replacements from the store (yes - floppys could malfunction after being used a lot). I was hyped when a new one was announced finally but unfortunately it disappoints. Not because of core gameplay - that is okay. nothing exceptional but very solid. It disappoints because of lack of polish:\n\n1. Sound and Music.\n\nThis is my biggest gripe with the game. Everything feels like it's placeholder for an unfinished product. Speech is emotionless and is queued in game (and cutscenes) without any sense for timing or drama, whatsoever. Some effects are over the top while others are way too quiet. All the sounds are super minimal. Music is completely absent. It feels like there was no budget left so things were handeled as cheap as possible.\nThis is the thing that keeps the player distanced the most because it never pulls you into the game into the first place.\n\n2. Muddy to no accentuation in the environment\n\nThe art in general is absolutely fine. Animations are smooth, environment (especially for a low budget 7 year old title) are very detailed. The Unreal Engine 3 renders as crisp an with nice effects as one expects.\nWhat doesn't work at all is that gameplay targets can't be made out in the environment without referring to the minimap. Terminals and interaction points blend into the uniform environemt so good that you have no choice but to walk near with help of the minimap and wait for the interaction text to appear when you get close to the target. This is no fun and it's bad design.\nGunshots feel solid until you shoot aliens. Then it feels like the shots are fired in the general direction and the enemies (like B-movie actors) just drop dead when they think they should be dead. Gunplay feels like it has no impact.\nYou shoot in a general direction while the laser pointer even shines ABOVE the aliens. So you actually feel like you shoot the air above small enemies. Still they just drop at some point.\n\n3. Minor gameplay decissions that interrupt the flow.\n\nNearly all interactions need 1 or 2 seconds. You can't just explore and grab stuff. you need to stop to interact for everything that doesn't lie around in the open. And each interaction takes time. It's like the game couldn't decide if it wants to be a tactical game or an arcade shooter. Ultimately it fails at both.\nAlso there's only checkpoint/terminal savepoints.\n\n\nOn the other hand there are a lot of good things to be said as well:\n1. Art and details\nThe art is really detailed. The environments are fleshed out and look superb for a 7 year old low budget title. The artists gave everything it seems.\n2. controls are fluent and snappy. No sloppy, sliding things. Everything that needs to snap at angles snaps and everything that needs precission has enough precission. Switch between gamepad and mouse/keyboard works without any problems.\n3. Local 2 Player coop. Not many games still have that today.\n4. The levels are not only linear corridor runners like so many newer games. They are in a very similar style of the other games from the 90s even though the environment types aren't as varied.\n5. It's a new and official Alien Breed! The core gameplay stays intact. Find money, shoot aliens, buy upgrades, search for keycards.\n\n\nUltimately the lack of polish drags the game down and keeps it from being fun.\nI love you Team17 and I hope you do manage to release another one without these problems.\nUltimately I still cannot recommend it except for hardcore fans."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500243094, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514497", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "33595366", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198070162754", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1500241176, "num_games_owned": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 361}, "timestamp_updated": 1500243094, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Huge fan of the original Alien Breed games.\n\nVery dissapointed in this remake, although it looks and plays (for the most part) ok, it constantly make you backtrack.\nI don't remember if there was even one objective where you'd go and finish it without a problem...\n\n-go to this room, get a smart card- says the game...\n-ooooh, the room is on fire- go to the other side of the map and switch on sprinklers.\n-gosh, sprinklers are not working, no power.

Nonetheless, gameplay is solid - the story isn't bad, with a nice cliffhanger ending. I do recommend it, but it's not my cup of tea. I found myself more often than not kinda bored when playing. The weapons lacked in variety, and I found the creativity uninspired. The enemies made me think of Starship Troopers, which was a plus for me, and they varied in size and types. The game isn't incredibly long, but with all the back tracking and the visual monotiny of the levels, it was easy to get lost and take longer to do things. If you are a big twin stick shooter fan, enjoy games with bug-like aliens, or back tracking for about 7 hours, then this game is for you. If none of those ideas tickle your fancy, then perhaps give this game a big-ol-pass."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501927270, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500797", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34034767", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198113014119", "num_reviews": 340, "last_played": 1501926881, "num_games_owned": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 461}, "timestamp_updated": 1501927270, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Alien Breed: Impact\nfast game with modern day graphics with easy controls that moves from location A to B to C and so on.\n\ngood game.\n"}]}
