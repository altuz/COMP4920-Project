While there are similarities in some of the environments and enemy types, the game's gameplay, pacing, and visual design are all separate from that franchise. If you approach this game as a simple, arcade-y experience, with stealth elements and bright, colorful graphics but can accept it has simple enemy patterns and somewhat limited features (navigate areas, find health boosts, shoot dudes in the face... sneak up on them to shank them, etc..) I think your expectations will be somewhat in line with what this game offers. \n\nI had heard this game was horrible so my expectations of it were really low upon booting it up, but I found myself immediately a fan of the somewhat cel-shaded, colorful graphics, and the violent, bloody effects. \n\nOpening the game with a ninja-type character as you go forward through the tutorial, dismembering lurching zombies and sneaking up on them to perform stealth kills was something I wasn't expecting. Unfortunately, your time with this cooler tutorial character is cut short and you are then shifted to play as the main protagonist, who many people have found annoying in a \"Far Cry 3 douche lead character\" kind of way. I found his character tolerable/not that bad. The other characters in the game as well can appear a bit one-dimensional, as well as the story (Shipwrecked. Hidden Zombie Labs. Escape with other survivors.) but the cutscenes themselves have a cool illustrative / anime type look to them, and the gameplay inbetween the somewhat lame story developments or vocal delivery is solid, so to me I can overlook the somewhat bogus context in which the game takes place. \n\nIf you think the game's graphical style looks cool, I think the gameplay itself is fun enough to at least recommend giving it a try. I do think the game is very simple and somewhat generic, but whereas I was just looking for something a bit mindless, colorful, and violent to play through I enjoyed it.", "timestamp_updated": 1496909911, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496909911, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "32958118", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505315", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498683346, "steamid": "76561198098325894", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is a stealth based spin off of the action packed Dead Island series.
