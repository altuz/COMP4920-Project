However, every time I find myself enjoying the game, its short comings slap me to my senses and prevent me from ever getting immersed. This has been an exercise in identifying poor user experience and player discomfort. I cannot recommend this game when there are twin-stick shooters out there, like Shadowgrounds, that I've enjoyed with a lot less effort to stay engaged.\n\nWhat I liked:\n-------------\n+ Visuals are decent, and do a sufficient job at making things look credible. I found the voice acting to be above what I expected.\n+ Good variety of aliens.\n+ The length of the game is ok for its price.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n---------------\n- The controls and camera were highly uncomfortable to use. Your hero aims where your mouse is, which is what you'd expect from a twin-stick shooter. The problem is with the camera. There's a tilt just enough to create a parallex error, which makes it really uncomfortable to aim and shoot, especially when you need to do it quickly before getting swarmed at times.\nI highly recommend you enable FPS mouse aim in this file:\nSteam\\steamapps\\common\\Alien Breed 3 Descent\\AlienBreed3DescentGame\\Config\\DefaultInput.ini\nChange bUsingFPSMouseAim to TRUE.\n\nThis will make Alien Breed feel like Shadowgrounds in terms of camera and controls. You always aim north of your screen, with the mouse rotating your guy. This elimates the parallex error. The problem is, there are specific parts of the game (in all three episodes) that lock the camera and revert the controls back to the original feel. At times, this is fine. At other times, like at specific boss fights, if you have the FPS mouse aim set to TRUE, you're unable to aim, and have to revert the controls to fight properly.\n\nWhat I also found uncomfortable was the way you use items like grenades or health packs. No quick bar here - you have to tap buttons to browse through your item list, and hold the \"use\" button (to various durations depending on item) to actually use them. They were clearly not designed to be used on short notice, but I've found myself frequently needing to do so. Most of the time, it was either the flashbang to stun the horde mauling you to death, or a medkit to survive long enough to fight back. Because of the cumblesome way to use these items, I could only use one of them in a hurry, never both.\n\nSpeaking of grenades, the frag grenade also weren't designed to be used as a reaction to an incoming horde. You have to charge up the \"toss meter\" to throw them far enough to avoid killing yourself, but the meter charges up so slowly that by the time it's tossed out, the horde would be in your face. This usually causes the grenade to blow up on impact, which kills the aliens nice, but would also seriously hurt if not kill you.\n\n- No unlimited/quick save. You can only save the game at specific in-game consoles that your hero comes across on the levels. At times, the frequency is fine, at other times, it's rubbish. It's possible to go on for what seem like 30 minutes of game play without encountering one of these consoles. I've once the game crash after a boss fight, only to reload back to a save console a short distance before encountering the boss in the first place.\n\n- Lack of hit/kill confirmation audio/visual feedback. Shooting the aliens feel weightless and floaty because there's little/no audio indicating hits/kills, just green blood particles and the alien flipping over to die. This makes the gun mechanics feel unrewarding and unsatisfying. The only satisfying weapon is the shotgun, because a lot of stuff die to it in one hit, effectively making the firing sound fx feel like the hit/kill sfx.\n\n- No stamina indicator for sprinting. There are boss fights where you have to manage your sprints, so the lack of a stamina bar makes it annoying to know when you will be forced to stop sprinting, or when you can sprint again.\n\n- Uncomfortable/tedious level design. You are made to backtrack quite a bit to flip switches in sequence so that you can eventually proceed. I found it hard to get immersed in the narrative significance (or lack thereof) of these switches, so it got repetitive quickly for me. To add to the discomfort, your hero sometimes gets caught in the level's props  that looked passable, forcing you to back off a bit to walk around them. This can either harmlessly break the flow, or cause you to get swarmed and die. There's also one level with overlaying bars at the top which blocked the camera's view of your hero, which can also be annoying or fatal, depending on the situation.\n\n- Unclear weapon effectiveness. You can upgrade your weapon's damage/reload/fire rate. I've only ever found it worth upgrading the damage since ammo/credits are precious. The problem is, it's unclear how effective the upgrade weapon actually is. The upgrades are described qualitatively instead of hard numbers, so you don't really know how much damage you're dealing. At times, the same alien dies noticable quicker, other times, they can withstand a longer barrage. It may be due to the range drop off, but it feels random and frustrating, because the inconsistency prevents mastery of how many rounds/long to shoot for each kill. Also, despite the impressive visual fx of the \"later game\" weapons, their damage output appears disappointing when used on bosses. The shotgun at close range was the best for me almost all the time. Maybe this was by design, but the ammo was so precious on those weapons that I never felt it worthwhile to use them on mobs."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500849343, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501383", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33754400", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197980037258", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1500849253, "num_games_owned": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 217}, "timestamp_updated": 1500849343, "received_for_free": false, "review": "fun game play, great graphics..  easy controls.  its a fun alien game.  but OMG..
