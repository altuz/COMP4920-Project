I love the simplicity of it - conquer cities, build improvements, make more stuff and throw it at your enemies again. Diplomacy and economics are shallow, but they're all they need to be (no upkeep on buildings is a godsend for my sanity) - the focus is really on warfare, with a bewildering array of units and factions and spells and bonuses that can tip things one way or the other.\n\nI particularly like how your faction isn't just a race, but a combinaton of your race and your leader. So all Elves share things in common, and all Rogues share things in common, but playing as an Elf Rogue is different to both an Orc Rogue and an Elf Cleric, for example. Races and leaders each contribute their own units and bonuses and so forth, and learning how to use your favourites and counter unusual combinations is great fun. This extra dimension makes for a ton of variety and flavour.\n\nEverything looks great and the music is pretty good, and the tactical battles where you're winning by the skin of your teeth really shine.

Around that time, I so geeked out about the possibility of an AoW sequel that I thought of a whole document full of half-baked ideas and sent it to Triumph.  Lennart Sas was so nice about it.  In this light, it pains me to not recommend this title.  I don't dislike it, but I can't recommend it. It's more neutral than negative.  It boils down to utter disinterest during combat, and there's really not a game left if you don't like the combat.  That surprised me, as I used to love the previous games as well as games like Master of Magic.  \n\n+ Triumph games are reasonably priced and very well supported.  How many games still get patches 3 years after release?  These aren't cash grabs in an industry full of them.\n+ There is a ton of variety in leaders, and the diverse gameplay of their various classes is a genuine development for this genre.\n+ Simultaneous turns, which I first was amazed by in AoW1, is still the gold standard in the genre.\n+ The graphics are colorful and illustrative of what's going on.\n+ Music is excellent and varied\n+ Between the different leader classes and features, your setup really is different between games.\n+ There's a lot of care put into each individual part of the game; again it just doesn't add up in a way I like. \n- There are tons of units, but little unit variety.  Each race has a bounty of units you should never build if you don't want to lag behind economically, and they're samey.  What's +1 here and -1 there in a game with basic HP ranges around 30?  This isn't interesting variation to me.  \n- It feels like there's a ton of depth to the combat potentially, but it's mostly hidden away on character pages that you'd have to seriously study before making a move.  There is a log that shows you your mistakes after you make them, but it never answered my questions in a way that I could learn from.  The battles felt the same to me: having not played it in 4 months at the time of this review, I cannot remember even one single combat apart from others.\n- Units start too close together, or at least too close in a game that won't let you use formations.  Forming up should probably be done before you're 20 yards from the enemy.  Add to this: units start so close together that range is basically meaningless outside of a siege.  Combat ends up being about doing chintzy facing hits so that real hits can flank and/or playing a mean element resistances game.  Whee.  \n- Heroes are diverse in theory, but in practice they are more or less their class and any lucky items you've found. This is either a clever commentary on dull MMORPGs or another lost opportunity.\n- You will probably never get used to the fact that enemy squads are an illusion - they just have a health total represented by the number of soldiers.  Heal 1 guy and get 6 back.  \n- The story I'm told is good, but it happens on a big narrative dump between missions, so I have no idea.  If you can look at static art while a story is slowly narrated at you in 2017, then I admire your patience.  Keep in mind that I know all the old characters and still can't do it.\n- Cities have a progression, but it really just feels like a temporal one.  There aren't very interesting choices there for most classes, partly because you can't seriously build most units because of the limited space in battles; you can't waste any on a horde of low tier soldiers.\n- With this little of interest going on in the strategic layer, why do games like this bother with random campaign maps?  This has basically never been satisfying in tactical games.\n\n\nTLDR: Watch a non-steam video of the combat.  If it looks fun, give it a try: Triumph is still one of my favorite developers.

The problem is that  AOW3 should be much  better. Of course the graphics and UI are more advanced than its predessors but AOW3 has been sustaintainly dumbed down.\nI am currenty playing a random map, which I prefer over the campaigns or senarios, because I dont like being led around by the nose by the not so great storylines in those modes. AOW is a TURN BASED STATEGY (or Simultaneous Turn Statagy) game and not a mindless Action RPG as the developers seem to be going for.  \nMost battles I auto-resolve because the combat and battlefields are too simplistic and repetitive. For instance in the older AOW games seiges were 360 degrees around a walled city. The battle map was related to the campaign map- where you positioned your armies mattered. Your armies began a siege on the same side they attacked from and that could be the difference  between victory or defeat.\n In AOW 1 if you chose auto resolve there was this really cool battle screen that played out an abstract version of the battle in fast motion- BRING THAT BACK! Now in seiges we have a single long battlement and my strategy is always the same because options are so limited. Another bone-headed decision was to not allow armies to use formations  which was a big tactical element in the old games. \n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1505911377, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505911377, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "35193068", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498381", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1497884653, "steamid": "76561198089742535", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I think what happened with AoW3 is that after I played through each race at least once I started to realise a common trend between them all.
