Not to say I am not a big Gal Civ III fan but at that time I strongly felt it was.\n\nAfter the new update 2.5, I now feel that title has been won and earned by Gal Civ III.\n\nJust after playing with the new update for a few hours I can already tell it has finally fixed some of the core issues.\n\nGal civ 3 from what I can see now has:\n\n1. Vastly improved diplomatic AI.\n\n2. Resource system finally feels balanced. Im really looking forward to seeing how diverse each empire will be as the game progress. \n\n3.Grand strategy and overall game depth which I feel Gal Civ 3 now has no real rival.\n\n4.Improved overall AI.\n\n5. Improved turn time.\n\nNow looking at combat yes Stellaris does have real time combat. That being said after playing both games for 2 years now, the Gal Civ combat I feel is overall a more enjoyable experience.\nAlthough not real time combat GAl Civ 3 has great cinamatics and balance. Stellaris has ok graphics but the combat model....well I am waiting for the new update to see but it really feels like the whole thing has to be overhauled. \n\nI'm gonna post this in the Stellaris discussions.

It has around 25 different factions you can play, plus the ability to create your own custom factions and to download others'.   \n\nWhat makes the Galactic Civilizations series different is the presence of the developers online, and the game is still evolving even as you play it.   The game is not really a finished product when it first walks out the door, but you get to know the devs' personalities, and they are continually changing and rebalancing the game as it goes along.   The game you play 6 months down the road is not the same game you first bought, but that means you sink more hours playing it; because it's a different game.

Please leave me some feedback on the format of my review, if you take the time to read it. Thank you![/i]\n\n[i]Note that my review is of the base game, after the changes/upgrades made to the base game with the launch of Crusade, but without owning the Crusade expansion.[/i]\n\n[b]Summary[/b]: Overall, I'd give this game an 7/10 \u2013 Better than most 4X games, but it still feels a bit shallow. I think the genre still has a lot of growth potential. That said, this might be the peak, at least for right now.\n\n[b]What is it?[/b] A turn-based 4X that feels slightly faster paced than most, filled with familiar faces, to those of us that have played previous games. For those who haven\u2019t, those faces will become familiar enough.  \n\n[b]Why I like about it:[/b] I love the fact the this is a 4X game where you can actually turn your empire on a dime from a cultural powerhouse to a war machine, if needed. No, it won\u2019t be quite as advanced as if you had planned for that from the start, but you won\u2019t just get run over, either. Nobody likes that in 4X games, watching all of their careful planning get plowed through because the RNG placed the game\u2019s version of Klingons on their door step, and their race is optimized for an influence victory. In GalCiv III, it\u2019s actually possible to defend yourself, through diplomacy and through intelligently building fleets that counter your enemy. It\u2019s a nice change from most other 4X games. \n\n[b]What I don\u2019t like about it:[/b] You can\u2019t control anything about the fights. The ships simply fight, and that\u2019s that. You can watch, and it\u2019s pretty, but you can\u2019t interact. It seems like, in space, a big part of the fight would be the strategy, but you don\u2019t get to have a strategy. You only get to watch. \n\nAlso, it feels like a lot of the game is poorly explained, if at all. For instance, you have asteroids that you can mine. It shows the distance to the nearest planet. It doesn\u2019t show what that means. For example, is there a drop off in benefit? What is the benefit, anyway? You can do some digging to find some vague info, but only after you have built the asteroid mine. Cultural influence is similarly vague, and apparently changed almost entirely with Crusade, so even the answers you find online will conflict with each other. This is a game that needs either tooltips or a user manual, yet has neither, at least not in enough quantity or detail. Also, the game leads in like there is a story (campaign), but that only lasts about 2-3 hours at most. That almost feels scammy. If people are looking for that experience, they\u2019re going to feel pretty let down considering that\u2019s just enough time to not be able to get a refund, and then they\u2019re left to play \u201csandbox\u201d games because that\u2019s all there is. That said, with many 4X games, that\u2019s all there is, period. \n\n[b]Who should buy it?[/b]  I would recommend it to those 4X players who enjoy turn-based, balanced repetition, that produces clear results. Don\u2019t expect deep storyline or replayability by way of new and interesting surprises, though. The current \u201cRecent Reviews\u201d score of \u201cMixed\u201d seems way off. This is a much higher quality game than that would suggest. \n\n[b]Is the price fair?[/b] The $29.99 asking price seems fair to me, considering the infinite replayability, so long as you like the core game mechanics. It\u2019ll take a while to get all the Steam achievements, if nothing else. It also goes on sale fairly often, so if you\u2019re on the fence, you can count on an eventual price cut.  \n\n[b]How does it stand out?[/b] This game is the culmination of decades of hard work and expertise in this genre. Nobody else comes close, when it comes to experience. Unfortunately, any longstanding lore advantages are absent, as the stories of these persistent races are largely forgettable, and so most of us who have played the older games have, in fact, forgotten. I would love for them to port the old games\u2019 stories into the new game engine, just so that we can remember where it all came from, but I know that costs money.   \n\n[b]Graphics:[/b] The graphics are decent. The cinematic space battles are especially nice, but seem almost wasted, considering watching them instead of clicking \u201cQuick Battle\u201d is, in essence, a very pretty waste of time. It changes nothing. \n\n[b]Music:[/b] The music is good, but there is only so much of it, and it starts to drone pretty quickly. You will switch to your own music soon enough. \n\n[b]Sound Effects:[/b] Meh. Not great. The space battles are about what you would expect, and destroying a planetary improvement causes a sound that is so irritating that I have to believe the developers wanted to punish us for some reason. \n\n[b]Stability and Polish:[/b] The game is very stable, and seems very polished, now that they have gotten over the few bugs from the initial launch of the new content. \n\n[b]Age and Future of the Game:[/b] The new updates are very recent, as is the Crusade DLC, so time will tell if they continue to release new, quality content. I hope they do, or get to work on GalCiv IV!\n\n[b]Replayability:[/b] Story-wise, there is none. 4X-wise, there is quite a bit of replayability. It plays just like any other 4X that way, especially if you want to gather all of the Steam achievements.  \n\nAll things considered, this is definitely a buy for lovers of the 4X genre. For others, maybe not so much, but then again, 4X games are kind of a love \u2018em or hate \u2018em kind of thing, aren\u2019t they?\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506985958, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506985958, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35036243", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499489", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506035007, "steamid": "76561198229305600", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 204}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "great time killer, great customization", "timestamp_updated": 1505696026, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505696026, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34826469", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497814", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503953101, "steamid": "76561198079236810", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's pretty awesome.
