The RTS portion is perfectedly paced, and isn't too fast or frantic. This gives you plenty of time to use strategy and tactics. \n\nThe campaign is beautifully illustrated and offers all sorts of diverse missions, and even includes boss fights. Along the way, it yields a steady stream of card unlocks that offer lots of card diversity. Just don't expect historical accuracy because this is Steampunk in a Civil War setting, and not a Civil War game with a bit of Steampunk added.\n\nThe entire thing can be played cooperatively. Throw in the free DLCs, and this game is another homerun by the developer. It may never gain the attention it deserves, but Zachtronics should be proud of the innovative game that they've made.", "timestamp_updated": 1502189732, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499804657, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34308761", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496898", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1415927802, "steamid": "76561197999730961", "num_games_owned": 3988, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's definitely a nice concept, well polished and all, but the gameplay and strategy element felt weak and gimmicky to me.\n\nIt's one of those game sI wish I could've enjoy much more than I actually did.
