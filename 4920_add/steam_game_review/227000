It does fantastically with art, voice acting and plotting but falls a little short with design and original story. Still it is a fantastic game worth your time.\n\nWadjet has the production quality down.  While the visuals are still pixel-art, the quality and detail rich world are superb. Visual design is reminiscent of Mad Max, the world is a dystopian nomadic future. However, the color palette does leave you wanting as the game is entirely brown and gray.  This is understandable due to the setting being a post-apocalyptic world, but it makes places feel smaller and objects in the scene indistinguishable from one another.  That said the world is actually full of characters. NPCs move freely about with their own purpose, unrelated to the story but framing the world. \n\nGame design is closer to standard point and click than Wadjet\u2019s previous Blackwell series.  You find objects, rub two of them together and get a new object. But there are a few problems.  Pixel hunting in this game is abundant.  I had to refer to a guide multiple times only to find out there was some inconspicuous spot on screen that was clickable. This is not just a failing of the art but a failing of design. If something is vital for game progression it should be noticeable inside the massively detailed visuals. With the abundances of clickable spots and NPCs that do nothing it is easy for little things to get lost in the details. There are also some awkward quizzes that kind of pop up out of nowhere, but they are mainly for achievements. But despite that there are some interesting choices.  You have multiple solutions to problems. Some are just for variety, but others actually affect the possible endings in the game. With that in mind, choice matter, so save often.\n\nThe first part of the story plays out like a dystopian techno-fantasy, but once the setting changes to the city the style changes somewhat sharply.  The second part of the story resembles Raymond Chandler novel.  A gruff character minding his own business gets pulled into a conspiracy that only he can sort out. Also there is a dame and a bunch noir-esque characters. Overall, the themes are nothing new, you can see similar from Planet of the Apes, Mad Max, or Wall-E. Despite the un-originality of the plot, it is well written. The main character Horatio Nullbuilt has a few interesting parallels to the Shakespearian Horatio, but this time playing the lead and foil to man.  The multiple endings are quite varied.  The Characters ultimate choice for his sense of justice is entirely up to the player.  \n\nPrimordia suffers a bit from pixel hunting but overall is a fantastic game. It has great visuals, great voice acting and an interesting story where choices matter.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1505578800, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505578800, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35199022", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500041", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506293814, "steamid": "76561198261895606", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 574}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Primordia has an awesome atmosphere that drags you into its apocalyptic world and holds you there.
