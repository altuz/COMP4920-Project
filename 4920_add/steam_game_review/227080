Gameplay is straight forward and linear. No exploring, don't need hints for puzzels.\n\nI enjoy playing an easy straight forward game. The game is very unique to me as it is not American. It is Briazlian and has cultural influences (different language spoken by characters with English text, shamans, colorful murals, non-white main character). Also, a very emotional storyline of a boy and his alcoholic father. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the in game experience, the story line, and the scenery.", "timestamp_updated": 1503628570, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503628570, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33608596", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501010", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500092761, "steamid": "76561198084987585", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I like puzzles.\nI liked this game.\nControls are very good, graphics too.\nA good story that makes you think about some aspects of life.", "timestamp_updated": 1500300475, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500300475, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 455, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 19, "total_reviews": 474}}
