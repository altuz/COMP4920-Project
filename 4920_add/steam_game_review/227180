The singleplayer is straight forward but the online is rather unique allowing you to build a home city that acts as your main hub to build forces, upgrade and defend against incoming invaders. The battles can be very epic along with sieging another player's city or a npc one but sadly there is a bunch of issues such as balancing as there is many high level units that can destroy pretty much anything and of course you could be invaded by anyone making it a bit painful when your starting out going against a high level with a huge army against your 2 tower defense with 1 milita. \n\nThere is also a few bugs such as units getting stuck, path finding a bit broken (units can't always get through broken doors or walls to advance into a castle, siege equipment not mounting properly and workers not mining or building properly. \n\nOverall it's a decent take on RTS but can be fustrating a lot of times in multiplayer due to the balancing issues.", "timestamp_updated": 1506007955, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506007955, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 255, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 207, "total_reviews": 462}}
