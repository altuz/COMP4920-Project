I have so many games in my account that I'll probably never play half of them. I'm really happy I tried this one. I bought it a couple years ago and finally got around to playing it. The voice acting and dialogue for the most part are low-budget. It's the strategy and action gameplay where this shines. I loved unlocking new weapons and traps as the game progressed. It felt great getting stronger and choosing where to spend the currency earned on upgrades. It doesn't take long to complete on the normal difficulty - which is great when you have a lot of games still waiting to be played.

Sang-Froid is a challenging and intense game of the same ilk with a great sense of suspense and dread because of its dark atmosphere and story. \n\nTraps are satisfying to use and you have to manage quite a lot by the time you approach the endgame. This was probably going to be the first part of a series but there haven't been any announcements of a sequel as of yet. \n\nYou can level up your character and traps as well as buy new gear and equipment that help you survive each night. The creature design is very attractive albeit everything looks a bit on the \"low-budget\" side. Music and SFX are used to great effect.\n\nCombat is a bit clunky but once you get your head around it it's pretty fun and exciting. It's all about stamina management. There are other systems at work as well such as intimidation which plays an important role when you become overwhelmed with enemies.\n\nOn a final note, this game has some of the WORST voice acting I've ever heard. But I suppose it's better than reading text dialogues and the dev is a small team after all so I can personally forgive that shortcoming. \n\nHighly recommended if you're a fan of the genre or even curious.", "timestamp_updated": 1502106561, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502106561, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33844316", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486082", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1404527449, "steamid": "76561197970665174", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 2654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "So under the radar, so good.", "timestamp_updated": 1501200630, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501200630, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "34095739", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494776", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1420860609, "steamid": "76561198051569088", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Beards!", "timestamp_updated": 1502646743, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502168009, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 666, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 88, "total_reviews": 754}}
