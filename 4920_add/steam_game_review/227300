I had never before this game had an interest in trucks, but now I do, thanks to this game and ATS. It's a relaxing but fun game-- peaceful, but there are challenges. You get to customize your truck to every little detail- even more with DLC and Steam Workshop. Pros and Cons--\n\n+ HUGE MAP! You can expand it even more with Scandinavia, Vive la France, and Going East DLC (which are all worth it). Soon Italia DLC too!!! (Don't be afraid to throw money at SCS for more content- they deserve it.)\n\n+ Customizations! There are many brands of trucks in this game, and so many things you can tweak down to the square inch with your truck-- Wheels, (+rims), decorations DLC (Like the Hanging Dice), bull bar, top light bar, horns, engines, chassis, etc\n\n+ Realism-- Road signs, if you wreck, there's damage unlike original ets, realistic landscapes, etc\n\n+ Challenge-- The game is quite peaceful, but there are many challenges. You have to deal with fuel stops, damage to your truck, other cars (sometimes the AI doesn't pay attention), or if you get TruckersMp Multiplayer (third-party), you have to deal with the many asshole drivers that are real people, and the major lag\n\n- The only thing I could possibly say is a con is that SCS didn't implement multiplayer. I thank the good people at TruckersMP for doing that, it makes the game more exciting to play (but is sometimes less realistic, as there aren't many cars, mainly trucks, and there are more bad drivers).\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506723790, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506723790, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35156921", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506604069, "steamid": "76561198203805705", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 94}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great game, play it alot!, Really worth it!", "timestamp_updated": 1506181573, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506181573, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34803446", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502587", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507186204, "steamid": "76561198142564079", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1388}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The best truck simulator ever.\n\nAnyone who likes truck and simulation should try this.\n\nDriving through the twisted roads in the countryside, listening whatever you like as well the turbine gently whispering in the cab is a cool way to chill out from a stressful day.\n\nA must-buy.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1504821947, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504821947, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35329213", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505037112, "steamid": "76561198129227156", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Relaxing game", "timestamp_updated": 1506762175, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506762175, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34845690", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507163", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502415907, "steamid": "76561198083312920", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great game!
