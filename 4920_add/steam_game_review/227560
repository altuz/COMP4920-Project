It looks ten times better, runs ten times smoother, and best of all, I have not encountered a single bug. Although I played through the original twice already, this one still feels like a fresh new game. They really did an amazing job at making an already fun game into something brilliant. However, the AI is still kind of dumb for the most part. Other than that I am beyond impressed as to how much this game has changed.

I'd even say ever, but I did not play this in Co-Op, so there you go.\n\nNo, really, the reason I start out this review this way is to glaringly point out how not only incapable but absolutely TERRIBLE the teammate AI is in this game.\n\nThere are games, such as RE5, where the AI can be made to function well enough given some adjustments. (in that case, give Sheva a bolt action rifle and suddenly she's a bullet preserving aiming goddess...)\nScourge's teammate AI has absolutely NOTHING to redeem itself. I know I'm beating on a dead horse here, but allow me to point out from what aspects the AI is absolutely failing.\n\n- The AI often fails to spot an enemy, even if it's blatantly attacking them. This becomes blatantly obvious when the small alien critters come into play. They'll crawl next to your teammates, take a moment before leaping with their overpowered attack (get hit twice by it = down) and take out your entire team. That skill of theirs has no CD but it's impossible to miss. And the AI... just glares at it. It takes one actual downing before they'll even know it's there!\n\nIn other words, the AI is blissfully unaware of it's surroundings until its almost too late to react on it. This changes when they are in cover. In fact, when in combat with other humanoids toting guns, your teammates are well capable if you babysit their positioning. Because if you don't... ohhh boy, they'll take cover in terrible angles (exposing themselves) and run from cover to cover just because their AI can't decide.\n\nSo a part of the game is against armed humanoids. You got your positioning worked out, you place the markers for your teammates...\n\n- And the teammates don't always listen to your commands. You'll place a marker in one spot, and they'll take cover behind something you KNOW you did not intend for them to hide behind. Usually it's okay, cover is cover. But the game likes to throw enemies BEHIND you from time to time. So if your teammates don't listen to your planning, which would've accounted for this...\n\nWell, then there's lots of reviving to be had, speaking of which...\n\n- Your teammates are pretty incapable of being smart regarding Reviving. Let's bring the example of earlier back. A small alien critter has taken down a teammate. What would a smart AI decision be? Take down the critter, then help your teammate up.\nWhat do your teammates do? They go straight to reviving. Even if the same enemy is still right besides the downed teammate. In fact, any teammates that are not busy reviving will not AID the teammate coming to the rescue. No, they'll just... Mind their own business. It's really quite dreadful.\n\nThe one thing the AI does 'sort of' okay, is using their shield skill in tandem with reviving. Sometimes they use it when needed, sometimes they don't (while they really should). Stonewall in particular has a shield he can keep up while reviving, so he's usually assigned as the designated reviver... or at least, so in my mind. There's no actual mechanic to assign him to this role, because...\n\n- All you can do with your teammates is point at something for them. Luckily there's a way to pick WHO does what, but in general the only interaction you can do is keep your mouse on something, and context will decide WHAT they'll do. Unless it's a wall. A wall does not mean 'go there' for them. It just doesn't work. You need to point at the actual floor. Which makes pushing up a pair of stairs an absolute hoot.\n\nSo, let's summarize. Your teammates are terrible at shooting at enemies unless nobody is downed and they're not downed immediately themselves. They're pretty suicidal when it comes to reviving and there's little you can do to guide them other than force them at a spot, where they have free reign to decide what cover to use, and not the cover you meticulously picked as ideal for them. Got that? Alright, up to the next set of issues.\n\nThe Gameplay itself is... clumsy? I can't think of anything better. The guns that are not meant to be super strong, are super weak. The pistol is useless unless scoring headshots, and the Firefly (the Assault RIfle class, apparently) feels like a BB gun. Shoots fast and takes too long to damage anything, let alone kill even the weakest of things. The Raptor is a burst fire rifle with good enough DPS, and the shotgun is instakill at point blank and useless at any range beyond that. We're talking \"right up in your face\" range. No exaggeration.\n\nFor most of them, usage just does not feel good. And when the animation quality is laughable (just look at AMP sprinting, it's hilarious) it just doesn't help when the characters are absolutely boring as well.\n\nStonewall is what I assume the leader. He has a little bit of a potty mouth and a dumb attitude, Absolutely unlikeable and boring.\nAMP is the female-with-attitude because we certainly haven't seen that before... mind the sarcasm...\n\nMass is... a shotgun toting Scot/Irish/I-can't-even-tell-anymore and absolutely uninteresting.\nAnd Shade... is supposed to be sneaky? But the game doesn't really employ a stealth system so everything about him is... he's sneaky but enemies spot him immediately so... he's just really weak. Not to mention they advertise him using akimbo pistols but so far that doesn't seem to be a feature in the game. Apologies if it does come in later, I kind of gave up after a certain point in this game.\n\nEvery character has an AoE and a shield attack special skill. Largely, they're useless for how resource consuming they are, which only refills at certain tanks found in the game (no auto-regen) and for most characters these AoE's are awkward to aim.\n\nLevel design is in general made for firefights, Even in situations where you're only pitted against Aliens, which CAN and WILL crawl on the walls to maneuver their way around. I have to say, for how stupid your Teammates are, the Enemy AI sure is capable at killing them. Cover tends to mean very little unless you're holed down an actual corridor waiting for an Elevator to arrive.\n\nThe story? I heard some ridiculous leaps in some video games, but this one took the cake right from the start. Also, the tutorial doesn't seem to mention that your AoE (if ranged) has a fixed range. I was stuck in that section for 10 minutes until realizing that.\n\nI have to admit, up until the Aliens arrived, the game was playable as a 'shitty that you could tough through'. But as soon as the critters came into play, only the cheesiest of cheesy tactics can work and not even always then. And, just to remind you, it takes TWO leaps from a mass of small critters to down you. If a teammate goes down, sure, the Player can cover the AI reviving. But if YOU get downed? Forget about it. Prepare for a slow and cringeworthy display of terrible AI that, one by one, come to revive you and find themselves downed by the enemy thats RIGHT BESIDE YOU. It takes actual geography to block an enemy for a revive on you to generally succeed.\n\nSeriously, avoid this game. I know some people love playing games that are terrible, but this one just... it's not fun, not even in a laugh-at-a-bad-game kind of way. The only way this can MIGHT redeem itself is if you have a team of four HUMANS that know what to do in order to properly tough through this game. Forget about it on your own, you'll hate yourself trying to finish it.\n\nCripe almighty.", "timestamp_updated": 1438043116, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438043116, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "12538434", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531805", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1413916488, "steamid": "76561197971191860", "num_games_owned": 338, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Great game!! \n\n   Pure action, straight to the point, co-op campaign, multi-player mode...

Very few other Gears-style shooters really have this focus, instead throwing QTEs and cutscenes and slow-walking segments at you and too much other boring crap.\n\nIt is not quite fun enough for me to recommend, sadly, but it is still good enough that it is worth playing if you come across it or crave some co-op TPS action.", "timestamp_updated": 1400378543, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1396485971, "votes_down": 33}, {"recommendationid": "11861749", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506223", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1423342522, "steamid": "76561198017418708", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Hmm... this game... how should I put it....\n\nIt tries to be serious and likeable but at the same time it slaps you with a raw fish in the face...

Not only that but even little enemies take tons of bullets to kill.  Remember the tiny flood things from halo?  Imagine an enemy of that size taking 25 machine gun bullets to kill, I wish I was exxagerating but I am not\n\n-a few extremely frustrating parts.  Level 2-3 is particularly bad, and while most of the game is relatively balanced you will run into these parts where a combination of bad A.I and bad level design will make you want to smash your computer\n\nI give this game a very lukewarm rec.
