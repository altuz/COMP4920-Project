Taking damage through enemies pushes you even further quickly, getting kills among other things pushes you to the right again.\n\nYou play by dragging a line or column around and then having at least 3 of the same tile in a line. There is only a few tiles that dont change either and each has its own use, swords and staffs do physical and magical attacks, keys unlock doors and chests etc. Above the field you can see what you are currently faced with and therefor know if you for example need to match key tiles.\n\nDuring each run you gain ressources that all serve the purpose to make you stronger and go further, be it by having your attack tiles do more damage or by increasing your defense or increasing critical hit chance etc. While this means you grind for ressources run for run it doesnt really feel like a grind upgrading is more like something on the side to do next to playing the game. \n\nAnother distraction is the little side quests that you get, many are luck based or happen sooner or later anyway, like matching 5 of the same tile in a single strike multiple times in one run, others require you to use specific items (that you randomly acquire during runs and since you can only carry 3/4  use quickly again anyway)\n\nWhile you will gain ressources no matter how you play the game does reward you for playing well, for example if you manage to be so far ahead of time that you end up on the right edge of the screen and can keep that up for a bit it gives you a nice amount of bonus experience or gold and big chain reactions or 5 tiles in a row etc also benefit you.\n\nIn the end getting to the 10000000 scorepoint isnt that complicated, especially if you have every single upgrade and think carefully what potions to use, however the steam achievements crank it up a notch requiring you to achieve that same score with a much lower point multiplier, setting an endgoal even people who are good at these games will have to work for to reach.\n\nYou can probably beat the game in less than 4 hours though i would say it isnt really made to rush through in one sitting, rather to unwind with a little puzzlegame for a bit every evening, or something like that. And while the pricepoint is higher than many similar games I would say it is almost worth it and totally worth it when on sale for even less.", "timestamp_updated": 1504957554, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504957554, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35078194", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503214", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505176899, "steamid": "76561198043646225", "num_games_owned": 704, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Good twist on the match three genre.
