It's really supposed to bring the classics back to life with new multiplayer servers (since gamespy is long dead), new weapons, , enemies, resources and a updated graphics engine to support modern systems. However, the inconsistant update schedule has punished this game severely and has left many angry with alligator pit.\n\nLets start with the pro's, shall we?\n\nPros:\n+New Weapons (Ghost Buster from SS:Test 1. PlasmaThrower and Minelayer from Warped DM)\n\n+New Enemies (Alpha Enemies have been restored, Unique new enemies, such as Biomechanoid Artillery, Biomechanoid Spawner, Beheaded Commando, Beheaded Vaporwave and more.)\n\n+New resources for mappers and modders alike.\n\n+Updated to get along better with modern graphics cards.\n\n+Classic mods are backwards compatible for the most part.\n\n+Merged TFE and TSE so you don't have to switch between.\n\nCons:\n-Workshop is heavily glitchy, unstable and tends to not function properly for the slightest mishaps. The game can get hung up on one wrong addon and refuse to update workshop until you flush the cache, delete the workshop folder and then reinstall SSR\n\n-Development is unreliable, not abandoned but they do take a long time between updates. (last update was Christmas 2016)\n\n-Most workshop content is pretty much reuploaded from various sites or just horridly/lazily made.\n\n-Game is clearly unfinished, multiple crashes happen when using certain mutators (randomized enemy spawn is a huge one) or just in general some massive rendering error occurs.\n\n-Changing certain settings breaks certain parts of the game, especially with the Xbox HUD and some levels.\n\n-Bug Reporting site is pretty much full of bugs but none of the have been tended or answered to in quite some time.\n\n-Modding community is pretty dead, no one has really taken advantage of the new content revolutions brought in. Almost no workshop levels have the new weapons or enemies in them. Most of the workshop levels are russian ports where enemies are thrown right in your face and you get swarmed in a room the size of a studio apartment.\n\n-Community in general is really dead, outside of the forums you'll only see around 7-8 players on at once. That's on weekends.\n\n-Netcode is horribly bugged and unstable, hasn't been patched since release.\n\n-Bright Island has pretty much became the HL3 of the Serious Sam Community.\n\nIt's sad to see this game in such a hurt locker. I know alligator pit is busy with other projects, so I can't get too mad at them for how the game is. I just wish it got more love and attention.  It's not bad but it's clearly unfinished and buggy, and given it's in beta, it was bound to happen.\n\nThe classic versions of Serious Sam are available in the Serious Sam Gold Pack or the Serious Sam Complete bundle, which drops to 10 bucks on all sales and is on sale frequently. So if you really want the classics, I suggest getting the originals instead, even though the multiplayer is dead on them.\n\nSerious Sam Fusion is much more updated and shows quite a bit of promise, it comes with the bundle and if you want it, you need to buy Serious Sam 3:BFE, TFE HD and the TSE HD. I also recommend adding TSE and BFE's DLC bundles for more mayhem and potential workshop content.\n\nAll in all, the game means well, it just doesn't do well. I hope they come back to it someday and fix it up. Because in it's current state, it's nowhere near ready.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1504765540, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1504765540, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34916836", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501392", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505764287, "steamid": "76561198050374170", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's been almost AN ENTIRE YEAR that Revolution is not updated. \n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/227780/discussions/0/1473095331490420700/]And even if the main dev stated that is not abandoned[/url] it's still unacceptable that we didn't get informed about the progress of the game for almost a year, instead they focused in Bogus Detour, stating that a different team is working on it. \n\nFor the game itself, It's like I remember, the old classic Serious Sam games with workshop support and an improved(?) engine . It runs pretty well on both modern hardware and even toasters. HOWEVER it's still very buggy sometimes and doesn't support fullscreen apparently, so I don't reccomend buying it both for the bugs, and for Scratch's awful behaviour on his community, unless you really want to play the classics instead of the HD versions (at this rate, you better go stick to Serious Sam Fusion 2017 if your pc is pretty powerful).\n\nEDIT: Fixed a typo", "timestamp_updated": 1505768361, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505298390, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "34769914", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500228", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1492133488, "steamid": "76561198047957742", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This fan project served it's purpose well during it's time, there was no other way to play the first serious sams with 4 controllers.
