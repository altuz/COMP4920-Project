In D, you're in AN UNDERGROUND MINE. It's gonna be crampped and kinda confusing. A personal computer's busses are not gonna come anywhere near that, and it does become quite klausteric in some portions, emphasising quick judgement and 6DOF-CQC, like Descent. The graphics are supposed to be fancy to reflect modern computers, although I will say that the engine the game runs on is quite inefficent, but powerful nonetheless.\n\nOne of the only negative aspects I can find about this game is the AI, where they're just kinda point-and-shoot, and don't move around much or do anything special like Big D had. I also didn't like how the conductor has this OP hitscan weapon while infected, but when NOT infected, he's defenseless. Don't do that.\n\nOkay, good elements: THE SOUNDTRACK. OH MY GOD THE SOUNDTRACK. It ain't D's techno shenanigans, but it fits the game damn fine, the synths come in warm and cold flavors and the boss themes are on-point, the neurofunk and Amen work is immaculate, and aranged OST is a standalone album - no question. Jonanthan Peros did a wonderful job composing and producing both the procedural and aranged work. I couldn't fathom how many bassbins would be destroyed if he ended up with a record deal on some label like Mindtech.\n\nThe story was grand. There were two layers: The good ol' fashion blow everything to Kingdom Come and save the babes, and then there was the email layer that told a deeper story for all those >muh immersion folks. I also like how the protag you play as actually IS a retrovirus. Able to function independantly through the system with no operating AV controller, change it's code on the fly, and then there's the Oracle's ability to forge definitions for unknown malware. \nThis level of AV tech simply does not exist yet. It is some next-level shit. Most of the time, you have to have someone in meatspace to hand-scan lines and lines and lines of code before pushing it through with the next definitions update.\nI also LOVE the little detail at the end where the only weapon that can hurt the final boss (which takes place in the BIOS, obviously) is the Interupt (shotgun). If you know anything about computers, you'd know why that is.\n\nLastly is the gameplay. It's a bit slow, but the open Steam Workshop allows for gameplay modifiers, and Big D's was actually fairly slow too, until you mastered chording and/or the AB (D2 and especially in D3 where pulsing it at 100% can accelerate you to breakneck speeds). Honestly I found it completely playable, but the framerate kinda made it hard, but I pushed through anyway beceause it was enjoyable. I also liked the upgrade system, while it didn't seem complete, it was very useful and I got a lot of use out of it - switching between abilities while under fire to fulfill a situation that my current loadout can't eat.\nThere was one bug that bugged me, and that was that rockets that hit walls don't hurt you, but if they hit a target, they do hurt you.\nOH, and there are bugs that prevent you from 100% the whole game. But I got all the emails, so no biggie.\n\n[b]Overall, 8/10[/b] would play again. In fact, I actually have played it twice. Oh, and I bought the album.

I like the visuals of Retrovirus and the music (would buy the soundtrack). The story is nicely presented in a way that isn't intrusive but not overly vague either. There is enough concrete information given to me to follow along, while enough is left unsaid to keep me curious and exploring for more.\n\nI have been playing on \"Admin\" (medium) difficulty. The gameplay has been challenging in certain areas but not to the point of making me want to break my computer. I've died frequently but instead of making me frustrated, it's caused me to reconsider my approach to the room and strategy. In other areas I have the freedom to take my time and really absorb the visuals. Certain levels \"deeper in the machine\" were pretty impressive and I like how the interior of the computer has been portrayed. Some optional areas are so well hidden that I couldn't find them. There is replay value in exploring to find all those hidden gems.\n\nI use a gaming laptop and have not really noticed much in the way of performance issues that some people have commented about on the Steam forum. In some areas there is an FPS hit, possibly due to the size of the map, but it doesn't compromise the gameplay. There are some graphic glitches that the devs could spend some time polishing, and a few bugs (like Oracle speaking but the UI showing Courier's icon). I've broken out of a level once and had to reload, and there are a number of typos and grammar errors in the emails and displayed dialogue that should be fixed.\n\nI've played just over 12 hours and thought I was basically finished.

Taking inspiration from games like Descent and Portal and the classic CG show Reboot, Retrovirus puts you in the shoes of a no nonsense antivirus program living inside a computer. What makes it stand out is how injects its own sense of self into the gameplay to rise above these inspirations.\n\nTake the gunplay for example. While the game features six degress of movement ala the original Descent, meaning you can fly around in any direction, the game has health and ammo regeneration similar to what you find in today's cover based first person shooters. You can store a limited quantity of ammo packs and health pods, but most of the time you'll be doing your best to manage your health and ammo as the viruses try to kill you. There's also a skill tree that lets you customize your agent's powerset and weapons loadout, and you can opt to switch your talents around as well for when you run into situations that require some abilities over others. That said, oftentimes in combat I felt like I was always exactly one bullet too short to wiping out a virus, which can get frustrating when you're fighting a swarm. Fighting feels much slower in the beginning until you can start acquiring upgrades and more weapons, but the ammo problem leaves a bad first impression. It does eventually bring the awesome.\n\nLevel design is another area where the game shines. While mostly linear, they create good arenas in which for you to fight. Cadenza Interactive has helped make navigation a snap most of the time; the paths through the levels are marked with red and green portals. Green portals mark the way to go forward; red portals mean you're going backwards in the level. In some of the twistier levels where all the rooms start to blend together, this makes finding your way a lot easier. There's also an auto-levelling feature where your ship orients itself to the 'ground' depending on the room you're in, also helping to keep you aware of your surroundings. Finally, there is a 'help' function that guides you to your next objective path, but it's not always helpful for finding the last enemy in a room you have to clear. It also won't help you with any optional objects that the game can throw at you, but half the fun in these instances is hunting down the missing monsters or collectibles themselves.\n\nThe viruses themselves look like real monsters and things you might find in Aliens or the Matrix. However, I found the bosses disappointing in the design; they just look like bigger and beefier versions of the little creatures you've fought before. Some variety here would have been nice. In addition to the viruses, there are nodes of corruption that have sprung up all around them that give off a distinct neon purple glow.  Clearing these isn't just for show; hovering around them damages your ship. Taking them out gives a satisfying crunch as you sanitize an area not unlike shooting Aliens in the original Aliens Vs. Predator PC game. Unwillingly fighting alongside the viruses are program constructs, most of which look like variants of the AIs from Portal. They give off sad whines when attacked and can be even more dangerous than the viruses themselves when in groups. They add another wrinkle to the shooter formula as you have to manage the zombified AIs while taking down the viruses. It would be nice if they helped you but it's only in the late stages of the game that you encounter other programs that will join the fight. Most of the time they mingle and get in the way, which can be annoying.\n\nThe story is what it is: an excuse to get you into fighting a lot of nasty bad guys. What starts as a typical day for you and your handler, Oracle, turns into a nightmare when a worm invades. There are twists here and there, but they are expected for the most part and you won't be seeing anything new here. That said, it's well done and entertaining. The AI programs you meet all have their own personalities and help push the computer story along well, from a bubbly web client to the gravel and static voice of the AV Vault's Warden. The plot is a chase throughout the computer system, and you get to see the inner workings of a city inside your computer. The file systems of the email client give way to the rail systems of the web browser, and the environments do a great job of being varied so you never feel like you're retreading ground... until you hit some levels late in the game that  recycle content. Level recycling dampens the impression of the game because it wasn't hurting for content, but the level retreads make the experience feel a little fat. At least the game has a sense of pace to break up the super heavy infected levels with quiet strolls where you get to rearm and plan your next move. One set of levels introduces stealth mechanics that are serviceable enough for what they are. Inside the computer things are never dull.\n\nYou can uncover the real world story behind the virus by finding emails hidden throughout the levels. While not as compelling as the game itself, they do add an extra level to the narrative even if it's not as great as the invasion story playing out inside the computer. The humor found in the spam emails you find is too over the top to be funny, but they serve as nice breaks when you don't want to read about hackers getting in over their heads.\n\nRetrovirus clearly has its faults. The game's narrative over-extends its welcome, and some mechanics, such as using your system scan setting to activate alternative uses for your guns, feel tacked on rather than integral to the experience. There is also multiplayer and co-op, which I cannot comment on because I haven't played it. That said, the game makes for a complete packaged experience and the stats screen and Steam achievements will make this game good for die hard completionists.

Many people are calling it a Descent clone or comparing it to Descent, which is completely wrong; just because this is a 6DOF shooter doesn't mean it is the same game. That's like calling Serious Sam the same game as Call of Duty, because they're both FPS shooters.\n\nSure, the multiplayer's a bit dead, the bosses are too easy and the final boss is more of a monotonous grind than an epic last fight, but apart from that this is a brilliant game that isn't getting the recognition it deserves. The concept behind it is, as far as I am aware, totally original, there is a pretty good backstory, and the levels are well-designed. The soundtrack is pretty funky too, almost perfectly matching what you are going through in the game.\n\nThe only major issue with this game is the optimisation and the lack of graphics options apart from \"make the pixels visible or not\", but if you have a good computer or you're willing to deal with a less good-looking experience, this game will be incredible.", "timestamp_updated": 1463306421, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463306421, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "7993376", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504634", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1487003789, "steamid": "76561198041757550", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I like this game; Its fun, but there needs to be a way to tone down the graphics, because I eventually can't play ecause of the intense graphical lag.", "timestamp_updated": 1386685416, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1386685416, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "2141694", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500738", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1384241250, "steamid": "76561198002924926", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "You'd never think it in a game where you play as a computer program in a computer with other computer programs trying to fend off a computer virus, but this game actually has character(s).
