Honestly, this game could be amazing- but AI optimization issues are bogging down all long-term games. This game is apparently not designed to be able to function past a few hours of building, which is an absolute tragedy. One of the things that's made games like Minecraft so amazing is the ability to keep building for hours and hours and hours- huge maps and custom designs that take days, weeks, even months to complete. Unfortunately, because of how Castle Story is coded, any map with NPCs is destined to begin experiencing massive lag spikes after only a few hours and an absolutely abysmal framerate a few hours after that. It doesn't matter what hardware you're using either- my rig is near top-of-the-line and I cannot escape these issues. \n\nSauropod needs to address this core issue before anything else if this game is going to remain playable. New units, new play modes, improved graphics- none of it means anything if the game will not run properly. I want to play this game and I would pay again to be able to play a fixed version of it, but I won't play a minute more until these problems are fixed.", "timestamp_updated": 1504897883, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504897883, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "34989746", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516779", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505953855, "steamid": "76561198002531211", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Alright its time I write a review, \n\nI've played this game both in earliest days -  mid days and now final release.\n\nHad I wrote this review a year ago I would have told you to stay away from this game, with the distance comparable to that of earth and mars. But instead I tell you this, If you think the game looks cute, looks fun, well It is... Its cute, Its Fun, Its unique.\n\nHere's how my experience went with this game..\n\nDay 1 (few years ago)\n\nCrash.. Loadinnnnnn CRASH.... Loadinggg Ouu menu *clicks* Crash\n\nDay ??? (year ish ago) \n\nHey man lets play Castle story Multiplayer! (Connections impossible!)\n\nToday ? \n\nHey Let's play Castle story Multiplayer! now that its released. Game runs smoothly, New build mechanics are amazing. Much better than the original, granted, I CAN'T say this game is PERFECT.. You will find things you like and dislike about it. Personally I think its just enough to spend some time letting your inner child and creative juices flow.\n\nMy friends and I tried all sorts of Multiplayer Configurations from Coop, to vs, to team battles.. All went very well (be warned, if you have a newer player on your team.. and he decides to.. well.. zerg rush.. you might just win - thats what happened to us today, very unexpected..) It's also very satisfying to destroy your friends hard work built castles! as they rage at you for betraying them this way.\n\nIn Single Player, again game ran rather smoothly, there were few little hiccups such as bricktrons (Yellow dudes) still making crafting animation and sound after leaving their crafting task.. Other than that, waves are fairly well balanced gets challenging is fun.\n\nSo my honest opinion of this game? Should you buy it? Well Maybe... Don't let its past determine its future! If it looks interesting to YOU buy it' play it an hour and a half two hours in single player, learn the game.. test it out see if it works, if it doesn't work for you, so be It' Thank you steammm refund.. Personally, I plan to play this game often enough to recomend to friends.\n\nOther Pros :\n\n-Good little \"Sims like\" background music.\n-Actually feels complete.\n-Canadian Game (ohhhh yeahhhh)\n\nHope this little unorganized probably full of errors review helps ya.\n\nTake care.", "timestamp_updated": 1505545876, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505545876, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34787114", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507870", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503447146, "steamid": "76561197978559846", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If it was not for the lag spikes that get exponentially worse as you play, this would be a great game,", "timestamp_updated": 1504753072, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504753072, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "34747861", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508597", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504576894, "steamid": "76561198108168269", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I had this game pretty much from as soon as it was released into alpha; back then I was enticed by the concept they built the game around and hoped it to be spectacular.

It includes some relatively unique mechanics and can be a lot of fun. Unfortunately, there are some major drawbacks, which, hopefully, the developers will remedy soon:\n\n1. Overwhelming micromanagement. At present, you cannot do anything but look around the map while in pause mode. This means that if you have more than a handful of \"bricktrons,\" they can be impossible to control in a timely manner, much like herding cats, especially consdering #2.\n\n2. Lag. As the number of units and structures in the game increase the lag gets extremely frustrating as it can take several seconds (up to about 15-20) for your units to respond to a direct order. The developers seem to have based this game on the brictrons having a modicum of intelligence in that they can determine, on their own, the priority of the next task on the todo list (subject to any priorities you assign in the UI). The cost of this is that it takes time for the bricktrons to deduce this priority and, depending on the map and mode (Sandbox, Invasion, or Conquest), can literally make or break your game.  BTW, Invasion mode is, unwinnable, like any castle defense game. The best you can hope for is surviving multiple waves of bad guys (\"Corruptrons\").\n\n3. Need for Optimization: Some might say the lag problem is the fault of old or less powerful equipment. While this may have some truth to it, the game needs to be tweaked and optimized. It's a bit of a stretch to expect people to go out and drop a couple of $K to be able to play a $25 game. (I say this as strictly a PC player. I do not own nor do I play consoles, so I have no idea what problems or costs might be related to those game systems.)\n\nHaving said all of this, I still would recommend this game. It's fun (to a point) and is reasonably priced in today's market.  I have only played the game for 5 hours or so, at the time of this review but so far the entertainment value has been about $5/hour, or about equal to seeing a movie. But the longer I play the game, the cost of entertainment decreases, unlike seeing a movie multiple times.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is where the devs will take this promising game as it matures.  IMHO.\n\nUPDATED 9/24/2017: After several more hours of game time, I want to add a few more items to my list of fixes needed.\n\n4. Pathfinding: As the game progresses and you have about a dozen bricktrons, you'll find that they easily get lost and sometimes wander off into enemy territory. One thing to watch for is if their path is blocked by fallen bricks, etc., but beyond that pathfinding degrades quickly at about 12 bricktrons.  Coupled with lag as your structures increase, late game activities involve a lot of work if you are to survive.\n\n5. AI: The AI seems to either go to sleep or is unable to handle complex situations. For example, say you build a wall that's 2 rows deep. If the outer layer gets damaged to the point where you need to replace bricks (not covered by a repair task), the AI doesn't seem to understand that you are patching a hole and the hole in the outer layer persists.\n\nStill giving this a thumbs up in hopes the devs will fix these problems.", "timestamp_updated": 1506308018, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506093126, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35245242", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502576", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506891099, "steamid": "76561198174698149", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 285}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is great.
