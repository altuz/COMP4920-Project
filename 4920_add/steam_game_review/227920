If you are short on time and feel like a quick game to conquer the world. The game is a GOOD singleplayer game , because it is risk , what more do i need to say.\nMultiplayer has never been a priority to have fun gaming. As loads of singleplayergames are on top of the most played gameslist as well. Plenty of people out there that dont want to be forced into multiplayer experiences anyway. \n\nThis Risk version has only a few difficulty settings , and its adviceble to play the hardest setting for the challenge it will give you , all though the diehard gamers might argue even this mode gets too easy in the long run. And they are right.\n\nStill , get it on a sale , as there are not a lot of options in this basic type of game. I just need to mention this is the most fun version of the riskversions on steam..if you dont count the big europa universalis, civilization and those type of games in that same list.\n\n However , if you are looking for a game with challenges, extended options, and events get these instead. Risk is for the risk boardgamelovers with not a lot of people around them to play the boardversion with.", "timestamp_updated": 1499435860, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499435860, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 47, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 63, "total_reviews": 110}}
