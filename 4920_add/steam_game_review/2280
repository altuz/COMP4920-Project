But let's review this nevertheless for the sake of doing it.\n\n- Setting. Game might be about blasting monsters mindlessly, but there is definitely a pretty solid lore in there. A mega-corporation with low morals. Space marines. Risky scientific endeavors. So put shortly, UAC conducts teleportation tests between two sites built in Phobos and Deimos. Surely enough demons, bored, decide to pour in both facilites in masses after noticing the convenient wormhole made by UAC's teleportation test. Phobos quickly gets overrun, same happens to Deimos facilities but even more unpleasantly The whole damn moon disappears from Mars's orbit to someplace else entirely..so you are now alone, in Phobos's hangar. Only way out is through the masses of those foul creatures. Angry demon slaying ensues.\n\n- Protagonist, while he suffers from the classic problem of FPS-protagonist wordlessness, there definitely is a lot of character to him. Seriously. A lone marine armed with weapons and his hatred for demons goes through the 2 overrun UAC sites and lastly goes through Hell and is at the end teleported back to Earth..only to discover an unpleasant revelation. Is able to withstand a strength enhancing drug that allows to punch humanoids to a bloody mess in a single hit, while for an average fit person the drug can be fatal. He is also good guy material, he refused to attack innocent civilians when his superior ordered so.\n\n- Weapons. Standard FPS guns, for weapons 1-5 there is the pistol, pump shotgun, hilariously slow firing gatling gun and a rocket launcher that fires hilariously fast. Last 2 weapons are plasma ordnances, a rifle and then the BFG that can clear a room of baddies in a single shot's blast.\n\n- Gunplay. Not bad for '93. Super shotgun, rocket launcher, plasma gun and BFG got great sounds.\n\n- Enemy designs. Simply iconic foes. And by mechanics side too good design although the enemies lose out to Build engine games' enemies in threat level.\n\n- Atmosphere. There seriously is that. First episode, you romp through the Phobos base, consisting of a high tech theme.\nThen, deimos base, which has from first level off, been modified by demons, there starts to be marble, wood and holy shit, even flesh as building materials. So yeah episode 2 is a cool sickening combination of human tech and demonic architecture.\nLastly, blast through the vicious hordes in Hell itself. Diabolic undertones aplenty. And gore. Tortured to death humans are seen every level.\n\n- Thrash metal soundtrack. There are however more ambient pieces. I recommend to use Virtualmidisynth and a proper soundfont to maximize musical greatness.\n\nThe bad:\n\n- This release doesn't come with an option to launch either in dosbox emulation or to use a source port..come on.\n\nAnd lastly for some mod recommendations (not all of these are complete yet) Hotline UAC, PSX Doom conversion, Demonsteele, Zharkov goes to the store, DoomZ, Russian Overkill. Not gonna include Brutal Doom here since that mod has gone way too complex and overall in many ways inferior to version 11-16. And it never was a mod as magical as people make it out to be."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506351316, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35204335", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198321162970", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506131369, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 100, "playtime_forever": 776}, "timestamp_updated": 1506351316, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A pioneer of the first-person shooter, Doom holds up thanks to strong map design and a unique atmosphere.

All i can say is, IT'S, FREAKING, AWESOME! The first level is perfect, it throws you into the game with pumping music, simple enemys and loads of easy to find secrets. Oh yeah, there are secrets in the game too! come up to the right wall and interact with it, or press the right switch and you'll find a secret, which include things like bonus health, bonus armor, early access to powerful weapons and more, and some are really well placed, just don't act like an idiot and spam click on a wall. Also Speaking of Enemies, the enemies are also great! think of most FPS games you know, most of them have generic zombies or generic army characters, But DOOM, NAH, the enemy designs are unique and memorable and mostly don't shoot a gun at you generically, and even when the bosses do it, the designs are memorable and how they shoot there gun, I still remember when I got DECKED by a Cyberdemon, And the size and design of the Spider Mastermind, They all do different things like some have slow projectiles, some have fsat projectiles, some are on the ground and some fly in the air, It's these little things that make every enemy unique and memorable. Those are the keywords here, \"Unique\" and \"Memorable\", cause that's what DOOM is, Unique and Memorable, I swear that you will remember everything about this game on a second playthrough. I won't spoil the rest of the game because it's so worth playing THE game that innovated the FPS genre. My final rating for DOOM is a BFG/10. The game is as classic as it gets and everything about is Unique, Memorable, Fun, Difficult, And self aware of its Traits. The game is worth the $5.49 on Steam, or on Xbox360/XboxOne.
