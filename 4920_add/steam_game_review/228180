The fps drop when you start recording is really low, pretty much depending on the game, the biggest drop i had was about 9fps in Hitman. Good quality of the videos recorded, it has customizable hotkeys, streaming to twitch or youtube is easy to do, decent clarity when you stream. Never had any big problems with the program , it always worked for me( that's why i have 2000hrs of recording time with it). if you are not convinced here is a video i recorded for youtube with it :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj-NvYJCSLw&t=8s\n", "timestamp_updated": 1505285089, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505285089, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35127056", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495114", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507179541, "steamid": "76561198313438788", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 7620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 666}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "causes my computer and all games to lag", "timestamp_updated": 1507086160, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506084652, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 348, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 122, "total_reviews": 470}}
