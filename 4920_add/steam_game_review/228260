You have to quit the game to make them reappear. Ever wondered how to play any civ game without seeing your borders? Now you know. Take this, save scummer....\n\nThough it can be argued, that disappearing borders are the lesser evil.  Every now and then your save gets corrupted, from outright crashes to the inability to build anything. So: quit, restart, load game, pray. Sometimes praying seems to work, some recipes floating on the  net recommend counting to three after reloading, no kidding\n\nThe documentation is bad. By accident I discovered a key, that quick-saves the game. Undocumented. They didn't even bother to update the list of key bindings. The in-game documentation is equally worthless.\n\nThe UI is...to be fair..functional.  Bare-bones. Prolly the only 4x game, that doesn't allow you to sort your cities by production...\n\nStardock: how about *finishing* a game instead of releasing a clone of a clone of a clone. As it stands, welcome to the illustrious club of EA/Ubisoft/Paradox type companies.

I come back to it all the time. Shoot, I even played Elemental: War of Magic back when you could buy it in Walmart (blew my fooking mind).\n\nA quick list why this game is dope:[list]\n[*] Master of Magic style 4X\n[*] Unit designing & customization\n[*] Town building is done on the world map\n[*] Tons of little features and improvements to find (ex: increase shard harvesting for more mana, increase production per material to become a production powerhouse)\n[*] Satisfying cartoony graphics\n[*] Character progression for heroes\n[*] Not really a pro but I lol everytime: Watching Magnar attempt to 1-man a giant with only his ruler, many, many times. [spoiler]Eat sh*t, Magnar. jk[/spoiler]\n[*] Monsters on the world map talk crap on you, which is a little bit of sauce that I <3 so dearly\n[*] Simple diplomacy, but you can make some delicious gildar from it\n[/list]\n\nSome critiques:[list]\n[*] Zone of Control disappears if you load a game after loading once\n[*] Items & upgrades in the store for heroes are ridiculously expensive (ex: You might get 4-6 gildar per turn, a leather cuirass is 64 gildar, a horse is like 100, etc.)\n[*] It would be nice to deploy troops manually on the battlefield, instead of having to run your archers & casters away everytime (even if you could only deploy on defense it would be welcomed)\n[*] Unit equipment can be upgraded, but you can't retrain or retrofit them to new designs\n[*] The game doesn't attempt to stop you from ending the turn if you have any cities on idle or troops who haven't moved - be careful :) I let too many cities sit idle for too long\n[*] No option to start a game \"fresh\" without any previous unit designs\n[*] Unit designs are automatically uploaded to the steam workshop, and idk, I didn't really see a way to remove them without removing your whole faction\n[*] Can't edit a custom faction once it's created - need to delete & remake, so be sure you have that primary color 1 juuuust right\n[/list]\n\nSeriously though, this game is super dope magic master # 1 conquer-arama building empire simulator.
