You can organize your journal to track quests properly! I hated having to scroll through the entire journal in the original game in order to remember what I was supposed to be doing (and I'm sure I'm not the only one), especially if I had left the game for more than a week.\n\n\nFor those who have never played the original:\n\n- CRPG (pen and paper adaptation to computer game)\n- Utilizes Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition classes, lore, and rules (option to display 'rolls' in scrolling text window)\n- A lot of dialogue to read, no voice acting beyond the narrator between chapters and click/movement activation (I know many now prefer hearing instead of reading when long bits of dialogue are dropped on you).\n- Pick-and-choose up to five party members to join as you meet them (it is possible for choices and dialogue interactions to cause them to leave you permanently, so keep alignment in mind)\n- Can control the level up and skill distribution of all party members, or set it to automate (good for new players or those unfamiliar with D&D system)\n- Perma Death is optional, may set it so characters only faints in battle\n- Much steeper difficulty curve than present day RPGs\n- Requires strategic thinking over brute strength (dodging traps, exploiting weaknesses, spell conservation, etc.)\n- Gives minimal guidance in terms of plot/solving the quests; you will need to pay attention to dialogue and your journal entries to track them (although the journal is much more useful/specific than in the original game)\n\n\nMy positive recommendation comes from the fact that I'm a huge fan of this genre, and this company's adaptations of D&D lore and rulesets is very well done. If you liked games such as Pillars of Eternity or Divinity:Original Sin, this is where the inspiration came from. While simpler than their modern counter-parts, this is a classic game that challenges the player to use more than brute-strength and puts emphasis on exploring to find or solve quests.", "timestamp_updated": 1505087857, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505087783, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35055184", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506541", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506624355, "steamid": "76561198098039440", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 233}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A disappointment when it comes to multiplayer, but it is worth the buy for single player alone.
