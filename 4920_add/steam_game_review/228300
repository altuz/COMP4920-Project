It's odd to play the game and view the memories of your family in the past, only to alter what they remember for your \"personal\" benefit.\n\nIt makes you think, \"What if we had this ability in the real world?\" Though I'm glad to say we don't.\n\nRemember Me shows through the story that removing your bad experiences in life can lead to living a life that isn't worth living at all. It shows you that everything that has happened made you into who you are today, and removing those memories removes yourself. Nilin, thoughout the game, recovers the memories that were stolen from her and realizes that the pain that people have been through needs to stay with the people, not locked up where \"it didn't happen at all.\"\n\nGameplay-wise, while the combat can get repetitive pretty quick due to the two-button combo system, walking around the environments were a pleasure visually to look at. The linearity of the game will definitely put some people off, and the parkour mechanics aren't as refined as, say, Mirror's Edge, but it works out for this game.\n\nThis game has become one of my favorites, and I'll definitely be doing a replay of it for collectable hunting and to enjoy the story again. I recommend everyone play it for the story, at least.

If you have any sensitivity to camera shake, do not buy this game. Even worse than all the camera sway and forced movement is the fact that I found myself constantly fighting it. The game resists allowing you to look up and even if you are standing still and manage the force the camera to look up at a poster or something interesting on the wall, after 5 seconds, the camera yanks it back down to mid level on its own. Its difficult to look at what I want to look at and far too frequently I found myself trying to move the camera in one direction while the game was pulling it in another making it feel super frustrating and clunky.\n\nIt\u2019s a super intriguing environment even with exploration elements but just taking a moment to observe the area was irritating.
