Animations were smooth (though obviously based on some simple figure rendering program like Poser), the control scheme worked, the story didn't make much sense but a lot of 90s shareware didn't so I could at least poke around with it and be vaguely amused.\n\nYou will note that I only have 19 minutes on record with [i]A Valley Without Wind 2[/i].\n\nI'm going to hold off on explaining why for just a moment. This sequel--if it can really be called that, since the whole [i]AVWW[/i] \"broken reality\" thing never made much narrative sense to begin with, and apparently intentionally so--has you running a rebellion against a big bad. Unlike the original [i]AVWW[/i], where you had followers who you would make go away for so many minutes to go gather firewood or whatever while you ran around the infinitely side-scrolling (well, infinitely transitioning, at least) map, this actually has a strategic map for you to tell your followers to go to places and do things and fight baddies. It's a nice touch, adding some level of strategic force movement rather than simply \"Bob has a 57% chance of getting a carrot with a 99% risk of dying because Bob is a loser.\"\n\nWell, I lie. It would've been a nice touch. If it worked.\n\nIf anything worked.\n\nIf [i]AVWW[/i] has the quality of decent 90s shareware, [i]AVWW2[/i] has the quality of [b]bad[/b] 90s shareware, the kind that I have spent a good decade and a half trying to forget that I grew up on. The characters have gone from smoothly-animated pre-rendered 3D geometry sprites to poorly MS Paint'd cartoons that move as though they're suffing grand mal seizures. In [i]AVWW[/i], everything was made of pre-rendered sprites so it all fit together visually. Random elements in [i]AVWW2[/i] are pre-rendered, some are drawn, others are painted, and they're all mashed together in incoherent tilesets so it's actually extremely distracting. The control system went from a simple but effective \"keyboard to move, mouse to aim\" system in [i]AVWW[/i] to a clunky and incoherent keyboard-only system. For a comparative example, let's say you want to shoot your magical ball-o'-death at some critter at an angle: [i]AVWW[/i], point and click. [i]AVWW2[/i], hold the right and up and fire keys at the same time and pray to whatever gods you have that you timed that perfect 45\u00b0 angle shot just right because 45\u00b0 angles are all you're going to be doing and also if you don't do the fire button at the right time then you're just going to jerkily leap your character up and into the target in a valiant but utterly stupid attempt to smash the enemy with her face. That's how [i]Archon[/i] worked back in the late 80s. It's as though the [i]AVWW2[/i] was coded for a particularly archaic D-pad setup. Everything about it is completely retrograde from the original.\n\nIt's completely unforgivable, since these people were able to make something competent, if not particularly impressive before. However, it's also unimaginably hilarious. It is so bad you just have to stop and laugh at everything.\n\nAnd then just stop, since there's absolutely no point to go on any further with it.\n\nThere's certainly no point in actually spending money on the experience.", "timestamp_updated": 1426718037, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426718037, "votes_down": 16}, {"recommendationid": "10013535", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541653", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1363503600, "steamid": "76561197972351208", "num_games_owned": 602, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "There's some interesting ideas here, and it's a multiplayer game in the strictest sense of the word, but at the end of the day when you cross genres you want to blend them rather than keep them in their own awkward boxes.  This game has an art style that will be off-putting to many, but I found it charming in an odd way.  The different powers are interesting, but could be a little more imaginative and balance between them is basically non-existant.  For the most part, the powers don't make good use of the movement- and neither do the randomly generated maps that generally end up being narrow tunnels to fall down and strange ceilings.  The boss fights are slightly better by being a little more open, but overall it's very static and repetitive.\n\nThe game has a metric ton of good ideas, but the implementation and integration is so poor that everything steps on each other's toes.  In addition the game uses strange terminology and despite explaning itself is still pretty difficult to puzzle out.  Figuring it out is kind of fun, but once you unlock the puzzle you realize that it's a lot simpler than it lets on in a bad way and it's more about getting lucky early on with a co-operative starting area than anything else.  Speaking of Co-op, it is barely functional and requires a great deal of patience.  Still, it's nice to have the option to be able to suffer together.\n\nTo it's credit, I can't say I didn't have any fun, but bad platforming, dissonant storyline, confusing mechanics and characters and luck-based play (a decent beginning can trivialize the hardest difficulty but a bad one makes all but the easiest one impossible) as well as terrible implementation of platforming means I'm not going to be missing it.", "timestamp_updated": 1399179792, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1399179792, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "12665439", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547526", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498817751, "steamid": "76561198047173163", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Listen.  I love this game.  It's one of a kind.  If you like metroidvania type games you should definitely check it out especially when it's only 2.99 right now on sale.  What makes it so unique compared to other games of the kind is that every level is a tile on the turn based strategy game portion, and what level you will want to do is going to be decided by what you need to be happening strategically.  \n\nWhat makes the game such a fun challenge is that each tile has a difficulty percentage that can vary widely depending on different factors including what is happening in the strategy portion.  So, you might really need to open up a section of a map that's blocked by a tile with %500 difficulty level, but have fun with those crazy fast enemies and projectiles that knock off a third of your health, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.  Or, what if you can't make it through?  Time to rethink your strategy,  work on earning enough coins to hire mercenaries to open it up for you, tweak your character to go for speed over health, or or whatever else you can think of.  The world has it's own rules and mysteries and a lot of the fun is these things slowly becoming apparent to you as you play.\n\nWhat I love about the game is all the variety in the side scrolling action and it's effect in making your strategy come together to win the game.  I think personally this game is tied with Red Faction Guerilla for most underrated, but this probably even more for all the hate it gets from people that can't look past its subpar graphics to see the amazing gameplay and feeling of being in a coherent world with its own inherent logic all coming together in a challenging and satisfying experience.

This game is the ActRaiser successor I never realized I wanted until I played.  It's a strategy board game tightly integrated with run and gun action.  The regular threats to my units and structures provided by Demonaica and summoned monsters along the way kept me alert.  You need those units and those units need at least some of those structures.  While I won on the default settings, know that this is a game that allows you to lose after hours and hours of investment.\n\nThe duration might be the only real gripe I have.  I could be biased by my analysis paralysis and the time it took to learn my first game.  However, the promise of another procedurally generated map to conquer loses some of its charm for me when it takes double digit hours to finish.  I realize that's probably not uncommon for the strategy genre, but I have to too many games in my Steam library to bother.\n\nAs a bonus, the game also comes with the prequel.  Some may enjoy the more freeform exploration, but the branching pathways contain a lot of empty, useless space.  It's big for the sake of being big.  I much prefer the sequel's selection of more linear playfields.  The prequel also allows players to gather much more loot and micromanage their inventory.  Though I may whine when my equipment breaks, I much prefer the sequel's limit of a single, temporary piece of loot that disappears when replaced.  With the collection of perks, feats and mage classes tied so closely to one's progress, there's enough to gather and worry about as it is.  In short, the sequel cuts out a lot of the cruft and is a better game for it.\n\nFinally, forum complaints can largely be ignored.  Mouse control has been added.  It allegedly makes the game too easy at the moment so I'd suggest gamepad or keyboard controls for now.  Either way, it shows that Arcen listens.

With landsharks.\n\nWeird mash-up of different genres. Plays really well, both in the world map's strategy mode and in the platformer mode you go into when exploring tiles of the map. The art style and graphics are... interesting, but very low quality. \n\nThe objective of the game is simply to survive in the Valley, until you're strong enough to beat the evil boss, Demonaica. Survival is pretty damn hard at times, as Demonaica's stronghold regularly spawns nasty creatures to try and kill your survivor buddies. \n\nOn the world map, you get to move around survivors you've rescued, construct buildings that increase resource generation on specific tiles, heal nearby survivors, etc. The interesting bit is that because the game spawns monsters regularly, you need to keep your survivors mobile, while still balancing the resource generation with losses taken in battle.\n\nThe platformer sections remind me of Terraria's combat system: you run and jump around in randomly generated levels while monsters try to eat your face. Every class has 4 spells, usually one long-range spell, two short-range spell and a unique, extremely powerful special spell. \n\nThe objective in the platformer sections is to find wind generators and destroy them, allowing your survivors to move to the tiles you've 'purified'. Certain tiles also have perk tokens and other things for customizing your character, usually found in dangerous caves. \n\nThere's some weird time travel stuff going on in the platformer sections, as different tiles represent different time periods: you can explore the ruins of a modern city, with skyscrapers and stuff, and next turn find yourself in a steampunk city, or perhaps the ruins of an ancient, Egyptian style civilization. The level art is quite diverse, but as I said, the assets are pretty damn low quality.\n\nFun game, and very much worth the low price if you'd like to try a platformer with a strategy game element.

I still haven't wrapped my head around the mechanics and differences between those characters, their classes or whatever it's based on, but it does look promising when considering replayability value, as it looks like it could be interesting to try the game again using a different type of character.\n\nI'll update and post comments as I accumulate more game time, as long as I learn anything worth adding, but so far, the game does look like it's going to drain quite a lot of my spare time. :D", "timestamp_updated": 1385415365, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1384868813, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "12642677", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495784", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1368687600, "steamid": "76561197990036156", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 206, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Much worse than a valley without wind, the lack of mouse controls rendered this impossible to enjoy.", "timestamp_updated": 1414335067, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414335067, "votes_down": 10}, {"recommendationid": "24384607", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498304", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1468819612, "steamid": "76561197973957436", "num_games_owned": 636, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Well, that's enough for me at 22 minutes in.\n\nI *just* started playing the original and have already put in 10 hours.  It's not perfect, but it's *fun* and even exploring the game world and it's mechanics.\n\nFor the sequel, it seems the devs wanted to change everything for the sake of change and experimentation.  And it is decidedly much less enjoyable.  Perhaps if I hadn't played the original at all, but no... this game is too much of a mess.\n\nIt appears to want to be a more straight up platformer and has a control scheme to match, encouraging you to use a gamepad over KB and mouse as in the original.  In doing so, I can't help but feel that most of the gameplay and mechanics that made the original fun have been removed or extremely stripped down.\n\nFor example, via spells and enchants, there was a significant amount of character customization you could do in the original.  Granted, I've had only a brief look, but being able to use only one item at a time in the sequel really limits things.\n\nI'm guessing here, but I think that the devs, or perhaps too many players, found the original *too* complex and daunting and that explains the more limited gameplay.  Personally, I much prefer the complexity.  Yes, even the unusual \"graph\" based dungeon map that they needed to take a couple of help pages to explain.  It worked, and it was a good idea on their part.\n\nSo, skip this game unless you find it on a really steep sale price.  The original is worth your time regardless of sale price.  It's looks dated, but it runs great even on old machines, and is a lot more fun.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1468820474, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468820474, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "8964334", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504909", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1393914422, "steamid": "76561198113316759", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "You know what? This game is damn horrible. Don't play it. Just don't. They hired an art studio which makes the game look better, until one of the animations is triggered; then it makes you wish to cry and pluck your eyes out. There are not enough frames to the misaligned animations, especially in comparison to A Valley Without Wind I, which I highly recommend. In addition, they destroyed the combat system by making your magic become the choice of which colour kills your enemy, and also by implementing this silly caliber system. Next is the fact that you come back to life in your archenemy's palace, yet he doesn't really do much to stop you.\nHmm... what else is horrible about this game? That damn font. Don't need to say anything else on it. The loot system is also weird, because as soon as you find an item you actually want to use... it breaks. Then you get an achievement for every single tiny thing you do, which is just EXTREMELY annoying. You enter a certain kind of zone for the first time and you get an achievement! Then for each bloody type of equipment you pick up you get an achievement. It is like Arcen are trying to get the players to keep playing by making them feel like they are achieving something through their boredom and eye-plucking. Speaking of eye-plucking, you have to use the standard OS cursor, which just looks really annoying if you try playing with a mouse. That, combined with the fact that its predecessor had a perfectly fine mouse cursor that they could have just pasted right into this game, annoys me.\nI would highly recommend the intro song though. It is a good intro song.\nBuy this game, because you unfortunately have to to get its predecessor, which has a better combat system, better graphics, more to do, a better world exploration system and a lot more variance.", "timestamp_updated": 1394410675, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1391449513, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "1489984", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.997145", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1395016189, "steamid": "76561197993730325", "num_games_owned": 748, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is a curious mix of 2D RPG Platformer, and Turn Based Strategy.
