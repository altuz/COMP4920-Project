This remaster is very thurough, well done, clean audio and video, runs seamlessly with my upper end gaming laptop (MSI Apache Pro), and holds very true indeed to the original.  The option to play it old skool exists if you like pixel glory. Worth the coin!  Simple to pick up and play; dont need no tutorial though there are a couple of spots in game that are truly random and may give trouble.
