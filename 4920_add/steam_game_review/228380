It's now representative of a game created by a first year english major, who does not possess a driver's license, has never seen a real car drive on dirt, and has never even been a passenger in a vehicle, on a remote alien planet, where gravity's strength is dependant upon an objects forward speed. Posessing only a vague understanding of what a \"transmission\" is, on this alien planet an object's forward momentum is all-powerful; even when sideways, the gearing of a car takes orders according to speed, rather than RPM. This hypothetical \"intelligent\" being also has the quaintest of understandings of tires and grip - leading to the puzzling feat of a 319 horsepower engine transferring it's power to a dirt path, in a straight line, and accelerating at a comparable rate of that of a 400 horsepower car on earthen concrete, but unable to accelerate at 10% throttle in a slight bend without sending it's rear bumper out to graze the spectators.\n\nThe game used to be wonderful, as I said. Somewhere in the 4 year period I stopped playing the game it was sucked into the vacuum of space through an industrial woodchipper and handed over to an isolated child-colony of never-never-land to be plastered back together with only 1 roll of gaffer tape, a melted chocolate bar, and their own excrement.\n\nIn short, it is now an orphaned disaster worthy of at most thirty cents.
