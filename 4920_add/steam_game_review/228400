The well established world and nations of Strangereal are replaced with a generic Russia vs. America plot that feels lifted right from Call of Duty, the beautful visuals and art direction have been replaced by sand, run through a brown-filter, and are now subject to constant shakey cam.  \n\nThe most aggregious change to the formula is the highly scripted missions.  In previous games you were free to move around the map and prioritize targets as you saw fit.  In Assault Horizon, you are given brief tastes of this freedom, only to have it constantly taken away as the game forces you into mandatory quicktime events called \"dogfight mode\".   The only way to engage the majority of targets, or to escape from enemy persuit, is to complete these quicktime events; and in doing so it strips away everything that made Ace Combat so special. \n\nShame they decided to port this turd to PC rather than 4, 5, Zero or 6; hell, even the PSP and 3DS games would have been better titles to bring to Steam.", "timestamp_updated": 1506229830, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505349697, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "34957688", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526110", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503193724, "steamid": "76561198135922426", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've been playing Ace Combat since the first game released for the PlayStation 1, Air Combat, (or Ace Combat in Japan).

But, get to the chase, Ace Combat Assault Horizon is probably the worst title in the whole series. Your character is not a mute and shows his face unlike in all the other games where I liked my pilot to be a mystery. DFM is just annoying and I can't even stand the zoom effects, there were a lot of instances where I've went through structures and did not crash. Oh and how the fuck can your aircraft regenerate health??? That's almost like playing Battlefield, when your chopper or Su-35 Flanker-E regenerates armor points by not taking anymore damage. Come on NAMCO!... You're better than this!

This title shares most of it's name with the Nintendo 3DS title Ace Combat: Assault Horrizon Legacy (+) but outside of the name; it's not really the same. Legacy has a much better story and is far more entertaining to play; but I'd say neither really hold up to the Ace Combat name. Although it has a lackluster plot; the multiplayer aspect is where this game is at it's best, being able to play the story missions Co-Op made them a bit more tollerable. The standard multiplayer features a few modes, Standard Team Death Match, Free For All, ect. This is where I'd say the main focus should be for potential players of Assult Horrizon. Get a few friends to buy the game; make an online lobby, and just have at it. It's far more fun the more players you have in the dogfight (up to 16 potentially) and a good old 1V1 is fun every now and then. THe game has somewhat compotent AI, but they're nothing amazing as to be expected. $19.99 is a bit high for a game with very few active players; but it's fun none the less.
