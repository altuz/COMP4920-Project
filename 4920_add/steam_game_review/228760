The only thing that keeps this game alive for me is the multiplayer. \n\nThe multiplayer: The online really makes you strive for perfection in this game. the tracks are so complex and memorable that its very easy to learn the corners and braking lines so you can keep striving for that first place time. i am very glad there are no collisions because this would be the most hated racing game on the market if there was. The need for a better time online in this game is the best reason to play this game. You will keep wanting to improve and get to the top of the leaderboard.\n\nThe customization: The map customization is great, its not that detailed but is very fun to mess about with for an hour or so. The car customization is non-existentant but what i am very happy about is that with mods you can change your car model to anything you want without changing the performance! it is very cool to see lamborghinis and ferraris in -game alongside with the stock cars in the game!. \n\nOverall Score: 8.9\n\nCons: \nNo Game-core (campaign, Story, proper leveling system)\n\nPros:\nMultiplayer\nThe arcade handling\nModdable cars\nTrack builder\nGraphics", "timestamp_updated": 1505055325, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505055325, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35053645", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503546", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506885501, "steamid": "76561198108520374", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 77}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "FFS they broke hotseat and removed split screen in Maniaplanet4 update.\n Pretty much used to be a fun lil game to kill time, now is complete and utter\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 good job ubisoft, you never stop amazing me with your bs\n I just tried to change my name and flag. \nThey wanted a validation code. This was the first ever time I've seen this message ever playing since the early 10's.\n\nWhat do they want? Power and more control over their users?\nPlatform mode is bugged and split screen is missing sincer the update to Mania Planet 4. I'll keep this a negative review until these things have been fixed\n ManiaPlanet4 Update ruined the game. You gain nothing but errors. \nNew interface is just terrible. Most options are just broken.

If you bought the game before update you will get the demo-version when you try to install the game (108mb instead of 4GB+).Best solution: get the maniaplanet3 FrozenState Version and play your beloved TM2 offline.\nWow, I would really like to see what they did with Maniaplanet 4..\n\nOh wait, I can't, my key doesn't work anymore!\n Installed all Maniaplanet updates, suddenly signed out. This is after just buying the game (though I had Stadium as well). When trying to sign back in, the game said I was not connected to the internet. Funny, I thought. I made another account to test if it was a problem with my computer/internet.\nNope! Connected fine, but of course my key is tied to my real account. So I couldn't even sign in to the new Maniaplanet, let alone play the game. A shame, because I've wanted to play Canyon for a while. Tried using Stadium as well, which refused to work.\nThanks DRM, I guess I didn't need any Trackmania games.\nDon't buy it, don't believe the positive reviews. Is the game good? Based on the demo I played a few years back, hell yes. It's excellent. But this outdated DRM, the ridiculous server connection problems, and (from what I have seen) absolutely HORRID customer service destroy what is honestly a fantastic series of games.\n\nI just hope I can get my refund before the summer sale ends.\n\nUpdate review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atuFSv2bLa8", "timestamp_updated": 1505771807, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505771616, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34983642", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496692", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506817032, "steamid": "76561197997313715", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 99}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "i think ubisoft cancled trackmania or something. it says i dont have the game", "timestamp_updated": 1505518803, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505518803, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 311, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 76, "total_reviews": 387}}
