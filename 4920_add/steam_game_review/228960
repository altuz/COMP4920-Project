The former is not as deep and doesn't follow the 'grid rule' (like a chessboard) like the latter. You move units anywhere within a certain radius, and you are limited to five actions per turn (in contrast to AW, where you can spent a whole lot a time in one turn moving your whole army). Games like these need a good competitive AI player to fight against. 17-bit knows and shows that.\n\nThe downfall is when you have trouble overseeing the battlefield. The artstyle of the units tend to blend in with other units and surroundings. I often didn't notice that I had another unit behind my archer, making me reload the last autosave. The free-movement also makes it difficult, at first, to understand why you can't move a unit between other units or objects. Even the AI seems to fidget around specificly with that. In the end, these annoyences aren't gamebreaking, but they do leave a bad first impression, which means you'll get used to them.\n\nThe 'stretching animations' and the corny - sometimes fourth wall breaking - jokes aside, I can full-hearthedly say that I enjoyed the music, challenge and general length of the game. I didn't check it out myself, but apparantly the multiplayer is really fun too. I should warn completionists, though, for more than 50% of the achievements are either time-consuming or just difficult to unlock because they require you to build specifc setups/arrangements in the battlefield.", "timestamp_updated": 1507068288, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507068288, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 124, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 13, "total_reviews": 137}}
