Graphics are really bad, and in some of the levels, you can't even differentiate walls or paths, so you're walking blind. I'm guessing this version was supposed to be played with cheats, because sometimes you start levels with around 10 people firing at you. That kind of defeats the purpose, I don't always want to play with cheats. Unless you really like Doom and want to play it because you're a huge fan, or this is included in a Doom bundle, I'd pass on buying this one. I only started playing Plutonia levels and became frustrated."}]}
