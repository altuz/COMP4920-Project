It's bursting at the seams with original mechanics and a fresh take on match-3 games, but seemingly forgot to test if any of the ideas it presents actually add anything to the experience or makes for a game that's worth playing. It continually tries too hard to insert itself as something unique in a broad spectrum of derivative peers, that it forgets that the reason those games bare such a resemblance to each other is because the formula works, leaving it standing awkwardly on the sidelines like an odd kid who has been ostracized at his own party.\n\nBroken down into its simplest elements, Dungeon Hearts plays like a combination of Collapse and Guitar Hero. Colored gems come horizontally across the screen toward your characters, and you must combine three like colored gems to form a power gem that allows you to clear away skulls which hurt your character if they make it all the way across. This basic system is continually and rapidly expanded as you play, with unique levels for your four characters, blocks that can't be moved, skulls that take multiple hits to clear away, and so on and so forth. It all combines to make for a game that starts out simply enough but quickly becomes entirely and utterly overwhelming. There begins to be so much constantly happening on screen, that it's nigh impossible to begin to keep up.\n\nI kept hoping that maybe if I just played another round or two Dungeon Hearts would finally click for me, but the longer I stuck with it the more annoyed I became at its cumbersome controls and incessant need to constantly throw more at you than you can handle. There are undoubtedly some really neat ideas hidden in Dungeon Hearts that could potentially be spun out into a better game, but what Cube Roots has done with them feels more like they threw everything at the wall hoping something would stick, than careful and deliberate design.

I don't think I'm alone in this because almost immediately after this game was released they made an update for it including an \"easy\" option and even that one still hands my own butt to me every time.  What i want is to meet the developers and watch them play it in front of me so I can see what kind of freakish experts they are.  It is entertaining and useful when you have exactly 10 minutes to waste on a game and it's colorful and innovative which are all things that I like.  If it just weren't for the unrelenting difficulty then this one get such a better recommendation from me but as it stands the easy mode eventually starts sending out more bad tiles than good tiles and I feel like Lucy in the episode where she and Ethel work in the chocolate factory and I just can't keep up.", "timestamp_updated": 1394174409, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1366468222, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 121, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 66, "total_reviews": 187}}
