There is less content than a [i]demo[/i] would normally offer.\n\n[i]The developer seems to be very active and eager to take suggestions from players. However, there is currently very little content, so unless you want to go along with the ride from virtually the start of the project, I suggest you wait six months before looking at this game.\n\nThe game also seems to have a very strong fanboy base. On the upside, that means that at least some people have found the previous games to be excellent (despite their mediocre ratings). On the downside, that means that this game's rating may be superficially high for the time being.[/i]\n\nOn to the actual review...\n\n[b]Note:[/b] I have played many hacking games before, starting with Uplink in 2001 and most recently HackNet. I have not played any previous Hacker Evolution games.\n\n\nMore detailed review below:\n\n[h1](Lack of) Content and Pre-Alpha State[/h1]\n\nThis game has literally five minutes of gameplay -- one minute if you know what to do -- and [i]all[/i] of it is shown in the 1:18 minutes long video and screenshots on the Steam store page. The game seems to be level based, and the game currently has [i]one[/i] level. When you complete the level, you are taken back to the main menu and your only option is to start a new game.\n\nThe options menu is completely empty, and there is no saving or loading. During my five minutes of gameplay, I also experienced a CTD.\n\nThe developers even say so themselves in the Early Access description:\n\n[quote][b]What is the current state of the Early Access version?[/b]\n\n[i]\u201cThere is a [b]small[/b] playable level which gives you a good overview of how the final game will look and play.\u201d[/i][/quote]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe game has a fairly standard setup with a CLI (command-line interface) where you type commands. When you start the game, you are prompted to type 'help' to see available commands, of which there aren't that many available. Your objective is to retrieve a file, even though you are not told from where or why you should retrieve the file. The game seems to be 'roguelike', in that failure means you start over. There is no saving or loading.\n\nIn order to download the file, you must gain access to one of two available servers. This is done using a balancing minigame, where you must balance your CPU, firewall and network resources using dials in the lower-right corner. These resources seem to deplete your firewall depending on how they are set up. They don't add any real depth to the game, however, as there is a single setup that works best at all times, making any tweaking pointless. The same minigame-ish setup is used both for gaining access and to download the file.\n\nAnd that's pretty much all there is to it at this time.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Good music\n- The interface looks nice\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Virtually no content(!!!)\n- Unstable\n- Empty options menu\n- No story, no purpose, no nothing\n- Unsure about balancing mechanic\n- Bad GUI / UX (no tab completion, no mouse click adjustment of balance wheels)\n\nIf it actually had any content, a decent story and great gameplay, this game could be good. As it currently stands, it is barely an empty shell (no pun intended) with virtually no content.", "timestamp_updated": 1469952510, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "9", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1469820976, "votes_down": 25}, {"recommendationid": "29829343", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503426604, "steamid": "76561198009014243", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very little engagement from the developers.
