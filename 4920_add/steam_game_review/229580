(I just now got a computer that can handle the game properly, so that's why I'm reviewing it now.)  In reality, Howard's dreams are not very powerful or atmospheric.  They're quite dull and lifeless.\n\nThe game does create some realistic environments, but they fail to create any kind of mood.  Are Howard's dreams scary?  No.  Are they depressing?  No.  Are they suspenseful?  No.  Are they at least creative and interesting to explore?  No.  Does anything bizarre and dreamlike happen in any of his dreams?  No.  Every dream he has is just meh.  They are expansive, but there's so little to do it all feels like an enormous waste of space.\n\nYou don't do much in them aside from one or two thoughtless, contrived puzzles that have nothing to do with the environment or story.  The only things that tie the dreams to the story are the snippets of interpretation pages which spell out what everything is supposed to mean, but they are not enough.\n\nThe game has one cutscene (audio only), and it makes you listen to this longwinded conversation after each act, and then once again to complete the game!  It progresses more each time, which means you must listen to parts you've already heard up to 4 times, and it is tedious, not to mention trite.  The entire conversation goes like this:\n\n\"My mum and dad want me to get a job, but I dunno what I want to do.\"\n\n\"If you work hard enough, Howard, you can achieve your dreams, and everything will be all right.  Just look at me!  I worked hard and I succeeded, so if you do the same, you'll succeed, too!.\"\n\n\"Bloody hell, you're right!  Thanks!  This emotionless conversation has changed my outlook on life!\"\n\nPuh-leeze.\n\nThis conversation is all we learn about Howard.  For all that work you do traversing Howard's dream worlds, you learn little about him, and the big revelation at the end is lukewarm: Howard doesn't have a job, he wants to be a writer, and in the end he decides to get a job and start writing on his free time.  Is that it?  Is that the whole story?  It's not nearly enough, and the dreams he has are not interesting and do not mirror his life situation or convey any emotions regarding it.  (Except for the first nightmare.  That one came the closest to furthering a story and connecting me with Howard's situation, and it's the only dream Howard has that creates any kind of mood and takes the player for a ride.)\n\nIn terms of creating realistic models and utilizing its game engine, Dream shines.  In terms of creating atmosphere and telling a story, the creators didn't take the idea far enough.", "timestamp_updated": 1505690356, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505683351, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35074222", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506245", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1454830860, "steamid": "76561198215382525", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Basically what this game has to offer is a few puzzles and a very mediocre story.
