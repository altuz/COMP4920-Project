Bient\u00f4t l'\u00e9t\u00e9 isn't a game. It's an artistic piece, and this needs to be understood. From what I could gather, the goal of it was to demonstrate how people can communicate, even if limited by language, actions, or possible phrases (as seen by the chess board in-game). However, this requires that someone somewhere is playing at the same time you are, unless you want to talk to an AI. It's a beautiful experience when it works well, but this is so rare I can't recommend a purchase at any time other than during a sale. Due to the game's artistic goal and nature, it was heavily slammed upon release, driving away potential players. Without a community waiting for another person to chat with, more people slammed the game for not having a community. This is Bient\u00f4t l'\u00e9t\u00e9's biggest problem, without players it simply cannot achieve the desired effect.\nFor this reason I suggest buying this when it's on sale.

Except in Bient\u00f4t l'\u00e9t\u00e9, both players are chat robots stating phrases at random while smoking cigarettes, drinking wine, and playing chess (with a catch: you have to find the pieces first, but one at a time). The highlight of the game should be the multiplayer, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be very populated (a symptom of its avant garde concept, I guess), and the interactions are severely limited.\n\nWhat should be a virtual date with a stranger in a surreal world becomes tedius, with no real interaction or connection with said stranger.

Once clicked, the screen goes black and you can actually hear your character click the flint, light up, and take a long, smooth drag. You can almost taste the tobacco. A puff of smoke fills the screen upon return to the scene. The cigarette is then seen majestically smoldering in the ashtray on the table. If clicked again, another drag is taken until there is nothing but a snuffed out filter left. \n\tOh, but that's just the beginning. It seems there is no limit to the amount of cigarettes you can smoke! My only complaint would be that there aren't enough ways to put out your coffin nail.

I went into it with low expectations and an open mind, I left questioning exactly what should be considered \"art\" in gaming.\n\nBient\u00f4t l'\u00e9t\u00e9 is the most pretentious of pretentious indie art games. One that is \"too deep for you\" to even understand whatever trivial message it's trying to put across. Let me just say right now that when a developer needs to address their entire userbase in a forum post, revealing what their inspiration for the game was in order for you to understand its purpose, then the developer has completely failed to convey any sort of rational thought with their game. Still, no one slightly understands the purpose of Bient\u00f4t l'\u00e9t\u00e9 and those who do are obviously elitist intellectuals whose thoughts and opinions on the matter are also \"too deep for you\" to understand yet again. It's hard not to call Poe's Law into play.\n\nThis game has a mechanical crutch which becomes limited by its users. The main attraction of Bient\u00f4t l'\u00e9t\u00e9 is being able to connect with other players in a cafe of sorts, decked out with a chess board, a glass of wine, cigarettes, and the ability to communicate intricately with one another. Except this all falls apart when you realise you're the sole person in existence to be playing this game at this point in time, forcing you to instead substitute a human presence with artificial intelligence. This severely impacts the game as a whole.\n\nI never found a partner to play with so I had to resort to A.I., and after collecting all of the chess pieces I managed to find a gun... although my character holds it backwards. Does this gun do anything more than intimidate the opposing player? If not, then there is no point to this game since there aren't enough people playing this game at any one time; you can't really surprise artificial intelligence.\n\nThe entire process of Bient\u00f4t l'\u00e9t\u00e9 took me little over 80 minutes to achieve. After collecting the gun and positioning all the chess pieces in their correct order, hoping for something to \"unlock\" or tell me I've done something right, only to find out nothing much happens.

The graphics, sounds and music give you an eerie feeling, it's dream-like, surreal and transcendental, and for this alone it's interesting to look at and listen to, eventually even admirable.\n\nYou select a male or female character stored inside tubes. \"It's nearly summer\" you are told. You appear with your character on a simulated/virtual beach shore and walk it. Random phrases will appear drawn onto the ground. You \"collect\" (\"remember) some of them by closing your eyes, you also hear them voiced  in French then (they are always subtitled in the language of your choice). You collect some object \"hidden\" beneath some worldly, \"holographic\" thing (a tree, a bush, a crane, ...) that disappears to reveal this object (chess pieces mostly, and one more unique and confusing one which leaves room for interpretation). You enter a house, meet with a virtual partner of the opposite gender in some sort of bar, put your objects in turns on a chessboard (freely, you don't actually play chess - some spots trigger the words/phrases you previously collected to appear on the screen and be voiced), take a smoke, drink some whine or select some pre-set of music tracks to play music-box like in the background. The lines you collect and make appear are circling around the two characters and their relationship, who are or used to be lovers  After that you leave the house, walk along the shore again, collect more phrases and another object and enter the house again. This you repeat as many times as you wish, at some point the simulation starts over again with you collecting about the same pieces again (the game however seems to remember all pieces you once collected - I've just started up the game again and could place all the objects I once picked up many months back when I first played this game).\n\nThe partner in the house is either A.I.-controlled or an actual human who is playing the game at the same time as you do. You don't see his/her name, he/she is a stranger, there is no text or voice chat to use, you only communicate with the words and through symbolism you can do with the chessboard and the objects, and the only indication whether there is someone else playing/waiting in the house is - from what I've been told and noticed - a window you see from the outside that has lights on. I haven't been able to meet up with a real human yet, because either the mechanics to match you up with one are not working too well or this game was never played by too many people to begin with. There is a Steam group one can join, and sometimes people try to group up through it. However this is a bit of a misleading way of playing this game, since it was obviously intended to meet strangers, an idea Tale of Tales originally came up with in \"The Endless Forest\", but which isn't executed too well in this game. A game that did this better was the PSN game \"Journey\". But I guess one must probably consider that \"Journey\" was a larger success than any of Tale of Tales' games ever were - the more players play these games the higher/better the chances to meet up with them. At some point no one will play these anymore, I guess, not even \"Journey\".\n\nThe control scheme isn't entirely bad but not exactly too enjoyable. This is a problem I keep seeing in the games made by Tale of Tales. You look around by moving the mouse to either side of the screen, you walk by holding down the left mouse button, you close your eyes with the right mouse button and run with spacebar. It feels odd/awkward and not very comforting. They could adapt to the more classic control schemes that games with a first- and third-person view give you, the usual WASD and mouse-look thing. I don't see any good reason in doing things differently there. Has it to do with being different for the sake of being different? Or are they inept and don't play their own games? I don't know, and I don't like being harsher to them than they deserve.

Because that's what this game is, a fanciful and supposedly symbolic experience in which you will reflect on whatever you can imagine to be the depth of the 'piece'.\nSecondly, are you seeking an actually meaningful or deep experience that doesn't require DIY symbolism, perhaps with a strong but non-violent narrative? If you are, then turn away immediately, the game simply isnt worth your time.\nAnd thirdly, do you mind performing repetitive actions with very little benefit? If you do, then perhaps you should try something else, like the Stanley Parable or something.\n\nMy personal opinion of the game is that if I have paid good currency on a piece of content, then there should actually be content and that content should be legible and self constructing. I should not receive a random set of letters and have to conjure up some sentence. The sentence should come at least partially pre-made to give the thought some sort of legitimacy. If I have to make it up without any kind of confidence that that is what the media was saying, then the thought won't only be short lived, it'll probably be too weak to have any kind of effect when it is in my mind. Deus Ex Human Revolution creates a moral dilemma out of a slowly constructed jigsaw that you see pieced together before you, the Stanley Parable hints at the deeper meanings of it's gags but only so much as to force you to complete the meaning yourself.
