I really love the space map as it's easy to navigate, great to look at and shows everything you need to know. One of the biggest difference to other 4x games is that each race has it's own goals. So it's not so much about conquer everyone but to achieve your own objectives (happiness etc.). The game is really complete with very different races to play with. While the combat could still be better, i really like it because you can lead many ships as well as ground troops on a single screen. This game is a classic and any 4x player should have it in it's Library.\n\nSome special key aspects:\n\n- This game works great on Windows tablets (surface etc) without any touchpad or mouse. Perfect to play it on the go (train etc.)\n- The game scales really well on any screen sizes i've played it on.\n- Multiplayer by pbem is easy and great.", "timestamp_updated": 1502268948, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502268948, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 24, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 17, "total_reviews": 41}}
