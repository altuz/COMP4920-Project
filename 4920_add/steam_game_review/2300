Otherwise aiming with keyboard and no looking around will turn you off from the game.\n\n    [*]With mods like project brutality,brutal doom, doom 64, brutal \u201cinsert old fps game\u201d mods are all really great and offer tons of variety and fun, along with tons of maps and you can never run short of mods to play\n\n    [*]The combat is you with a lot of standard weapons and iconic plasma, BFG and unmaker that all serve a role and none are useless even with more powerful weapons. This paired with a lot of enemies that all have different attack patterns, whether hitscan bullets, fireballs, lasers, or missiles, offer engagements that never felt boring and always had me on my toes, thinking which ones to take out first, like the damn revenants. \n\n    [*]The game does not tell you where to go with markers or text. The game has a map that you can use to help get around, but doesn\u2019t have doors with the color coded keys to help you if you get lost. Luckily with this, some won\u2019t like the hand holding and may get stuck or lost. This happened very rarely with me, as the level design helps guide you where you need to go and you\u2019ll learn how doom hides buttons and you\u2019ll learn the game.\n\n    [*]Overall the game is just as good if not better than original Doom. The new enemies, great level design and new weapons all offer up a violent bliss that is good for a short session or a binge of chaos. The game is short, but with mods, the longevity of the game is well worth a purchase.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]A+[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $1 [/b]\n[b]Completed in: 5 hours[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Strife\n    [*]Doom and DOOM\n    [*]Wolfenstien (new series)\n    [*]Shadow Warrior Classic and 2013\n    [*]Serious Sam\n    [*]Hotline Miami\n [/list]"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504602262, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508333", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34752559", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197967643963", "num_reviews": 50, "last_played": 1504602047, "num_games_owned": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1504602262, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Brutal Doom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSzYliSASKc\nThats why I spent my monies, for the WADS ;)\n\nI've been playing Brutal Doom & Doom since they were released in '93.

It may not have been the first to do it, but it was the first to do it [i]right.[/i]\n\nWell, if you enjoyed Doom, then this is pretty much more of that.  While it adds a new weapon and some new enemies, I might have trouble telling screenshots from the two games apart.\n\nThe formula can be boiled down as such: You are in a maze.  You need to find the exit to said maze.  However, the maze is full of monsters who want to tear out your liver and shove it down your throat.  Throughout the maze, you can find supplies -- both hidden and in plain sight -- which will help you defeat the monsters on your way to the exit.\n\nThere's not much to it, and that's what makes it so great.  With no deep story or friendly characters to slow the pace and pull away your attention, you can focus on what you're here for: slaughtering demons.  Other single-player FPS' might seem like a step back, with their linear levels and terrible pacing.\n\nBecause of this, I'd argue that this game has aged rather well.  It's levels are well-designed, and the formula it works on is timeless.  This is a game you can always come back to, one that you can boot up to blow off steam when the alternatives just seem too exhausting and unrewarding.\n\nThis game was released years before I was born and I'm saying it's great.  That's how good it is.\n\nThe two things I'd say have aged poorly would be the resolution and control scheme, both products of this game's time, and both are easily fixed with a healthy dose of GZDoom.  Just go to [url=https://www.zdoom.org/index]zdoom.org[/url] and forget DOSBox exists.\n\nThe one biggest reason one might buy Doom II over [i]The Ultimate Doom[/i] would have to be the game's modding scene.  Thousands of mods (called patch WADs, or 'PWADs') exist for the game, and more continue to be made to this very day.  A combination of improvements in technology and many, [i]many[/i] years of experience means some of them arguably [i]surpass[/i] the original games in terms of quality, and definitely in terms of presentation.  If you're so inclined, you could buy this game and play its mods for years without ever playing the base game.  You shouldn't, the base game is still great.  But it's something you can do.\n\nI'd recommend this to any fan of the FPS genre.  This is the grandfather of the first-person shooters multiplied by two.  Because of the simplicity of the gameplay, it doesn't seem obsolete compared to newer games of the genre.  This is a game you can pick up whenever you're not sure what to play and always leave satisfied."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506122440, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501424", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35139749", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198125014244", "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1506122397, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 219, "playtime_forever": 278}, "timestamp_updated": 1506122440, "received_for_free": false, "review": "bang bang"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506136221, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501424", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35142815", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198069525376", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1498347794, "num_games_owned": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 77}, "timestamp_updated": 1506268893, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Project BRUTALITY + Gzdoom and a couple of hours and u got a gud tiem boi (UNTIL YOU FIND A FUCKING ARCH-VILE)"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504818846, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34802743", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198283259067", "num_reviews": 16, "last_played": 1504818797, "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 17}, "timestamp_updated": 1504818846, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Not as fun as the original (in my opinion) but still a great classic.\n\nAt least this game works, f**k you Doom 2016."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506051276, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35119349", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044081373", "num_reviews": 78, "last_played": 1506050467, "num_games_owned": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "playtime_forever": 11}, "timestamp_updated": 1506544291, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Best played via ZDoom or GZDoom with the Brutal Doom mod.

I dismissed the first two games as unplayable in today's age and that everything since then has far improved from it. I knew I was \nabsolutely wrong when I decided to really start playing the games. However, the level design and butchering of the enemies utterly destroys any enjoyment of the game for me despite having virtually the same gameplay as the original.\nWhat could have in essence have been a nice game sized expansion pack to the original was turned into nothing but frustration and artificial difficulty.\n\n[b]The Great:[/b]\n++The simpicity of the games graphics and audio is totally subversive of the timeless gameplay. Some of the best goddamn straight FPS gunplay 20+ years after release. A true achievement especially considering that as the foundation of \nFPS, it had nothing to play off of other than ID's own work with Wolfenstein.\n++The weapon arsenal is perfect in its simplicity and execusion. They feel impactful and are, and the balancing to use the weapon for the right occasion is incredibly well done.\n++Enemy design provides perfect auditory and visual feedback\n++With GZDoom, I could never ask for better compatibility\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+The music in this game is similar to some of Led Zeppelin's material, and I don't mean that in the way it sounds. It may be a total rip off here and there of other aritsts, but it does it so well you really just couldn't care less.\n+The graphics are cartoony and pleasing to the eye. A contrast to a lot of games of the time, especially many of the games that went on the emulate it.\n+The audio is never grating despite its low quality and repetitive effects and works well to give you indication of what is happening during combat as well as suitable atmospherics\n+Co-op? Fuck yeah\n+Multiplayer? Yes, please\n+Level design has good variety and has tons of depth. I never had the issue of getting lost like some seem to, so I would keep that in mind when buying.\n\n[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]\n+-Nightmare, unlike the other difficulties, isn't even remotely fair, and it isn't meant to be, so I can't really fault it. \n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n-Levels feel gimmicky\n\n[b]The Horrible:[/b]\n--DOSBox sucks. Not the games' fault. Thank god for source ports.\n--Difficulty is so cheap in this game. Having hordes of the toughest of enemies in small corridors is ridiculous.\n--The level design is atrocious making the game a downright chore if you actually want any challenge from your game\n--The new enemies are often totally frustrating, breaking any sort of flow and making the game tedious as all hell\n\nSound: 7/10\nGraphics: 8.5/10\nGameplay: 4/10\nContent/Replayability: 10/10\nOverall: 5/10\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nLook, it's still worth it, but personally the level design is cheap and infuriating. Don't under-estimate level design. The original is one of my favourite shooters of all time, yet this with the exact same gameplay is soooo less enjoyable\nto me. If you don't like challenge and only play on easy then get it. If you do, still get it, you might like it. It's not that it's hard that's the issue, Quake is super hard on the hardest difficulty, it's that it's extremely cheap.\nFor me, playing on easy makes me feel like I'm losing brain cells from how dull it is. That's not an elitist thing either, if you enjoy it then I wholeheartedly recommend it. But if anyone feels similar to me then it's far less recommended."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504746081, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496454", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34785921", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198229655396", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1505062756, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 516}, "timestamp_updated": 1504746081, "received_for_free": false, "review": "pros\nclassic \nits very cheap\nmoar scaryer den fnaf\ndoes look like a game\nyou can MOVE SCOTT.\nvery hard sometimes\nIDFA\nIDCLIP\nBoss at the end\nclassic 2 much classic\nlooks very good\ncons\nit looks 2 old (NOT 4 ME I L0VE THE OLD THIS IS 4 PUBLIC)\nblood etc.\nlots of stuff that may des overs\nwell hard\nthere is not alot of scares\nat the end\n10/10 IGN R8ING I REC TO CLASSIC PEOPLE.\n[spoiler] a game that is 99999999X BETTER THEN FNAF and at the end shoot him!1111!!!\t[/spoiler]"}]}
