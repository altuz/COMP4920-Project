Y'know, \"early access\", \"pay-to-play\", \"retro\" kind of stuff? I read the description of the game on Steam and kind of chuckled to myself: \"You have to buy sound? And the ability to jump? And animations? And a pause feature? (what if you have to go to the restroom? too bad, I guess...) Um... are they serious?\" Even though I think I only spent maybe $1.50 on this game (thank you Steam sales!), I kind of wish I didn't have it in my Steam library. It was mildly enjoyable, but it probably will not be to the vast majority of people, even diehard platformer fans like me. Do yourself a favor, and let it pass with only a chuckle.\n\nGameplay: 5\nThere's not really much that you can screw up here. It's a basic platformer, not really inventive or revolutionary, but it gets the job done. Luckily, it does control just fine.\n\nGraphics: 2.5\nThey're supposed to be cheesy and stupid looking, and while it does add to the satire level of the game by looking cheaply done, I'm sure the developers could have put their time and effort into designing art assets for a different game and it would have been much more worth their while, although I will say that Edguardo looked kind of adorable in his armour.\n\nSound: 1\nYou have to buy sound. Honestly, you shouldn't. It's forgettable, at best.\n\nCreativity: 4\nIt's an overexaggerative satire of modern gaming practices. I guess you could say that's creative (it's certainly not a genre you see too often), but it could have been much more tastefully done. You can take that topic and still make a great game based off of it.\n\nFun!: 1.5\nIt was mildly fun to play. The only reason I kept playing it was 1) backlog completion and 2) it devolved into a collectathon of the gold. I did end up getting all of the gold in the base game, but I kind of wish that I didn't now. This game is also essentially un-replayable. I felt like I wanted to stab myself when I tried it a second time.\n\nGenre-Specific Categories (2-D Platformer):\n\nLevel Design: 2.5\nThis is a platfomrmer, after all. Just because it's some metagame commentary about the way the industry is going doesn't mean it gets to escape from that. It's bland, it's linear, and there's no interesting and creative platforming mechanics introduced. Move, jump, walljump, lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nCombat: 1\nWas there even any? It's so forgettable that when I'm writing this I can't even remember how I fought a boss. That should really tell you how amazing it is.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI honestly don't know how this is at 4.5* on Steam ratings right now. I guess it's for the \"Lol sick sarcasm bro!\" factor. This developer knows what they're doing making a platformer. This game was fine as a platformer (albeit bland, though if they didn't put half the effort of the game into making it a satire, it probably would have been a better platformer), and probably would have been fine if they stuck with that and didn't go for the 'super-meta satire' kind of game.", "timestamp_updated": 1504987712, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504987712, "votes_down": 7}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2909, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 476, "total_reviews": 3385}}
