The writing and worldbuilding are good enough to still get me through two extremely aggravating playthroughs, both with social characters.\n\nThe game has two parts: an intricate combat system and a social system where you try to talk your way through quests. I haven't paid much attention to combat yet, as it would have been a death sentence for my two social characters. Combat in this game is extremely unforgiving, and if you don't have a combat-focused character, you will die without even denting your enemies' armor. So, I'll only talk about the social part of the game here.\n\nIt takes place in a fallen empire. Once spanning much of the world, after a great war it has been reduced to three crumbling cities in a blasted wasteland filled with ruins. Social order has broken down - when not fighting raiders, the remnants of the Imperial Guard happily extort those they're supposed to protect, and the other characters you meet aren't any better. If you want to get ahead in the game, you'll have to let go of your idealism and any delusions of saving or improving the world - really, the community calls them 'combat-focused' and 'social-focused' characters, but 'thug' and 'schemer' would be better descriptions!\n\nSo what's wrong with it? There were some things which drove me up the wall when playing it:\nFirst of all, it's really easy to accidentally screw yourself over with something that seems reasonable at the time. This is because dialogue options need a certain skill level to succeed (no random die rolls!). You do this by gaining skill points, which are mainly earned through quests, which usually require a high skill level to complete! Make a few mistakes, and you can easily run out of skill points later, unable to finish any quests. In my first playthrough, I messed up a quest for the Commercium by taking a completely reasonable, safe-seeming choice. This led to me being kicked out of their guild, permanently. Which ended up costing me so many opportunities, as well as precious skill points, that I was unable to finish the game due to an early-game decision! This was six hours later! The only way to prevent this is by knowing what's coming, either from knowledge of earlier games or by trial and error. This is not fun and, more seriously, discourages experimentation.\nSecondly, despite the creators' warnings to avoid combat, this is unfortunately not always possible. If your social character says the wrong thing to the wrong character, you end up in a fight. Some conversations always lead to fights - which for a social character, means they always lead to death. Quicksave is your friend here, but it's not very enjoyable to  have to reload five times to look for the only dialogue option that lets you live! This problem happens even with apparently reasonable and safe choices.\nFinally, there are the little annoyances. Why can't I hire help when my skills are too low - if I don't make a lore check, it would make sense to hire a loremaster instead of having my character just sit there, moping. Why do I have to mouse-over every last person to see if I can talk to them - would immersion really be so damaged by just putting a yellow dot or something over their head? And why can't I flee when a fight or conversation threatens to turn deadly?\nThese things are not so bad by themselves, but increase the aggravation from the big problems.\n\nBut the world... The world is fantastic. The fallen empire is fascinating, and despite the frustration, I couldn't stop pressing on, hoping to find more knowledge, information and locations. The atmosphere is great - Teron looks and feels like a ruined town barely scraping by. It has monumental, Roman architecture crudely but effectively fixed with wooden beams. Maadoran, with its crumbling temples and dry fountains, looks like a filthy hive that was once glorious. Ganezzar looks exactly like you'd expect a theocratic dump to look. Combined with the far more advanced construction and machinery in the many ruins, it is carefully crafted to evoke a once-great world in ruins. And you get to find out how and why it fell! Even the many unexpected deaths work out when they're not driving you up the wall, helping to bring a world to life where death can strike anywhere. And every detail fits - the squalor in the houses, even the description of the gold coins 'bearing images of emperors of various antiquity' serve to underline what this world has been, and what it has become. The hours of discovery made up for the hours of frustration, and I still haven't discovered everything yet.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is as frustrating and unfair as roleplaying with a smug killer DM, and I am looking forward to my third playthrough.

As I didn't know there's a demo available, I admit I've pirated it to check if it's worth paying for.  And, as I've found out, it definitely is. Now, I haven't finished the game yet, so take the value of the \"review\" with a grain of salt.\n\nWhat makes this game different? I'll tell you a story of my first character.\n\nI've played an assassin, doing what assassins do until the final mission of the first town. There was a battle, and I ended up as the last assassin alive. What's so special about that, you'll ask? Well...\n\nIf this was a Bethesda RPG, my boss would just lie down until the battle end when he was killed, then get up as nothing happened, as important NPCs tends to do, and the story would proceed. Or maybe not, but in that case, he would be scripted to die no matter what I do. But if he lives or dies would be out of my hands\n\nIf this was a Bioware RPG, I would get a big, dramatic cutscene of my boss being killed before the final fight starts. I would fight the battle, and then perhaps find out he's still alive but wounded, and, after some dialog, would be presented with *nice guy choice* of trying to help him (but he would die anyway), *neutral choice* of ending his suffering at his own request, and *evil bastard choice* of leaving him to bleed out slowly and painfully. The end result wouldn't matter, he would still be dead.\n\nIf this was pretty much any other RPG from the last 15 or so years, I would get black screen with \"You let the important NPC die, load last save?\" button, because the story just wouldn't work with the NPC dead.\n\nWhat happened is that the boss (and other friendly NPC) died because I wasn't that great fighter, I held back because I was low on HP, and I didn't feel like \"wasting\" consumable items. I felt their deaths were my fault and the result of my choices, not some prescripted event. I could've save them, I could've loaded previous save to try again, hell, I could've loaded even older save and either betray my fellow assassins, or (try to? I wouldn't be surprised if they just killed me if I chose that option) walked away before the battle. I didn't. I made choices, and I faced consequences, and the game acknowledged that. The game would acknowledge if he was still standing at the end of the battle, and (while I haven't tested it, I've played with it for a while before I've bought it) I suspect it would also aknowledge if any other members lived. Or if the last companion lived and the boss died.\n\nThat feeling that my actions *really* matter, that it's not just \"select the color of the explosion in the final cutscene\" (and yes, I'm still bitter about that), that is something I haven't felt in an RPG in a long, long time. That's what make this game awesome.\n\nDeveloper's time and money invested in making the world seem alive and react to my deeds, not in the latest graphics, not in hiring VAs so the NPCs can talk about arrows in knees or how horrible mudcrabs are, or whatever. That's what make this game great. Is it perfect?\n\nOf course not, there's a lot of room for improvement. It requires a different mindset from other modern RPGs. But as far as I'm concerned?

The worst kind of Gygaxian \"Old School\" RPG where you should expect to unceremoniously die dozens of times because you had 6 instead of 7 Perception or because you didn't get the One Thing to activate the Plot Device.\n\nAfter getting stuck in the starting area with my first character (who died frequently and relentlessly) then figuring out the only way to escape with his build was going down a rabbit hole I hated, I gave up: went to the wikis and forum posts and researched all the doodads and gamed all the stats and looked up most of the Important Events. Then, after crafting a character specifically to get the one Morally Ambiguous Ending I liked, I beat the game half out of spite.\n\nSpeaking more clearly: certain plot things only happen if you meet skill or ability prereqs. The former are forgivable, but the latter are maddening because there's no way to increase stats in-game and the only way to beat those checks is to start over from scratch (barring one exception where you can boost ONE of a FEW specific atts by 1 once, in the mid-to-late-game).\n\nAlso frustrating is that, no matter how much obscene wealth you accumulate, you can never just hire somebody else to do the stuff you can't do. Painfully, unless you micro with forum post help, you can fully expect to suck at \"not getting killed\" if you want to not suck at \"doing anything cool.\"\n\nWhy is this review positive? Because the writing and story are some of the most brilliant shit I've seen in gaming in years. Creativity like that deserves to be treasured + supported.
