It is everything you wished for DK3 and more. I will list a few pro's and cons about the game.\n\n[b]Pro's:\n-Humorous, fun campaign that teaches you how to play the game very well\n-Lots of new units: minions and beasts.\n-Unlock rooms, constructs, defences and more with sins, generated by the archives\n-Very noob-friendly map editor\n-Lots of different fun game modes: My Pet Dungeon (slow paced gamemode), The Crucible (survive waves of enemies), skrimish, multiplayer, campaign.\n\n\n[/b]\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-[b]Fast paced.[/b] Unlike the original Dungeon Keeper, this one feels like an RTS at times. Especially when playing multiplayer or VS hard / master AI, you will need to be able to do[b] a lot of micromanagement.[/b] Many players complained about this aspect, and the developers released two DLC's that take away this feeling. My Pet Dungeon is a must-have in my opinion, you can check out the first 2 levels for free. Heart of Gold is a new campaign, consisting of 4 very slow-paced levels.\n-[b]No personal feeling with minions[/b]. In the original keeper your units would grow bigger the higher their level was. That one level 8 fatty would always stand out in a crowd of minions, and you would remember him as the first minion of his kind to enter your dungeon, have memories of him killing overlords, training him with posession, etc. In this game, all of the units are the same, and you usually just put down a rally flag and spamdrop all your minions at once when fighting the enemy.\n-[b]Performance[/b]. When playing bigger maps, the game performance drops. Doesn't matter if you have a beast PC like me. I tried to play one game on the biggest map possible, but after 5min the lagg would be so big that it would be impossible to select a 5x5 terrain to dig out without fucking it up (selecting 2x5) because of the input lagg.", "timestamp_updated": 1505036189, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505036162, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35020761", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504958", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505747613, "steamid": "76561198051332744", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Brief summary of the ramblings below: All in all, this game is a beautiful tribute to a game I played to death as a kid, and an outstanding game on its own merits, rammed with some of the best dark humour I've ever encountered in a game. Richard Ridings returning to his iconic role as the Mentor is what inevitably sold this game for me, the man is a living legend.\n\n---\n\nAn absolutely brilliant game with some very minor flaws, defintely deserves higher than \"Mixed/Mostly positive\". As yet another fan of Dungeon Keeper, I feel like this game had a hell of a lot to live up to if it was to brand itself as a successor to the franchise. While this does in part feel like just another modern remake of an old game, it goes to great lengths to differentiate itself and stand on its own two feet, which it does extremely well.\n\nMy only real issue with the game is one I see has already been mentioned numerous times and catered for in the DLCs, and that's the linear map design. I always love the sandbox elements of these kind of games and want to build up my dungeon and level up my minions before charging into a raging battle, but a lot of the maps in this are heavily time-sensitive. I feel I've only had the chance to build up my dungeon to a point where I was happy with it on a single map, because generally the enemy comes barrelling through my walls at a moment's notice, or I have a timer counting down until they do.\n\nThat said, I never once got bored. Every map was different and instilled a completely new form of panic whenever the grey markers on your map suddenly swarm towards your dungeon core. The maps all vary a lot in terms of strategy and difficulty and I found myself on almost every map eventually scratching my head wondering how I was going to get out of this one, which is just what should be expected of a well-crafted game like this!\n\nI've seen a lot of people making complaints about the bugs and glitches in this game, and am happy to say I encountered very few. I'm on the final mission of the main campaign and have only had the game crash twice, both times while loading a quicksave in. And I've reloaded a LOT due to my inability to, well, not die. I've never once lost my campaign progress or had it crash mid-game, only ever on the loading screen.\n\nAs for the complaints about optimisation, I only once encountered a point where the game started to stutter, and it was on the penultimate map when I unleashed a mighty army against another mighty army, with probably a few hundred fights going on all at once. I'd say that's pretty reasonable, it was absolute, delicious chaos.\n\nBuy this game.

I have been looking to scratch that DK2 itch for a long time, and this is the first game that ever fully did it. It is for all intents and purposes Dungeon keeper 3, meant all in the best way. It understands and meets the old gamplay and additude of DK2 and then finds the loical paths for improvment on that model. Ive played Dungeons 1 and 2 and they are ok, but they dont hold a candle to this. Add to that, the developers are spot on fantastic. They charge fairly for any DLC, while at the same time, continually updating the base game with new features to improve it free of charge. All the best skins and awards are earned in game, and you will enjoy doing it.

It is an enjoyable game, especially if you liked Dungeon Keeper 2. However, the graphics are surprisingly bad in comparison to DK2 and some mechanics feel clunky or overloaded.  There are so many more rooms and mechanics that it can feel overwhelming and I'm only on level 4.  What I liked most about DK2 was how it introducd the new mechanics with a fun level but it feels to be a little lacking in what is basically a remake.  \n\nMany of the mechanics are lifted directly from Dungeon Keeper, and while monsters are somewhat unique on their own, they perform many of the same functions that troops from DK2 did.  Some of the troops feel kinda stale, and lack the coolness factor that a lot of the art and creatures in DK2 had.  \n\nYou can't expect this fan made successor to live up to all expectations of a true sequel, but it does its best to improve and expand the mechanics of DK2.  It has a long way to go, but I fear it is already too complex for its own good.  \nopinion may change as I play it more, but trying to multitask potions, traps, troops, and mining is often difficult, but maybe I've just lost my dungeon keeper touch.  I like their ideas but it feels like its missing a little something. Maybe making me care more about the characters themselves instead of being bombarded with mechanics and troops.  I remember how cool it was in DK2 to have an army of vampires that could oneshot any troop, but the troops feel sorely lacking in punch and coolness factor that make me feel like im in control of powerful minions.\n\nSome of the graphics look clunky, especially the creature animations.  This is unfortunate for such a new game. Despite everything I've said, I still had fun with the nostalgia factor. \n\n6/10", "timestamp_updated": 1505268699, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505268699, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35155968", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506943286, "steamid": "76561198178400465", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1220}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If you like Dungeon Keeper, you will love War for the Overworld.
