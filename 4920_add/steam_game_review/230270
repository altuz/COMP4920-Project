N has had fantastic controls and gameplay from the beginning, but N++ really adds to the formula with both the absolutely disgusting number of levels it offers, as well as the various color schemes, and the FANTASTIC soundtrack. N++ is tough as nails, but it never feels unfair, and the quick-respawning and heavy dub beats will keep driving you through a level until you eventually win... and then move onto the next one.", "timestamp_updated": 1506522042, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506522042, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35183555", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506720617, "steamid": "76561197997927151", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 198}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Ninja thumbs worn out.", "timestamp_updated": 1506266237, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506266237, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34820531", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494539", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506911398, "steamid": "76561198087562108", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 67}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "If it had multiplayer would be a perfect game", "timestamp_updated": 1504895744, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504895744, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35164346", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483661", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506202040, "steamid": "76561198013258156", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 59}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "This game is essentially auto hotkey simulator.
