Yes, it had its flaws but I actually liked it, hence my playtime. \nI return now, I found out it's free-to-play, abandoned, and simply terrible. \nThe gameplay itself is the same which I do like, however, the rest of it is absolutely terrible.\n\n+Fun mechanics\n+Looks nice with a decent concept and theme\n+All the achievements are very easy to obtain if you already had a character.\n\n-Abandoned\n-Eats up RAM like it's a buffet\n-Runs like crap\n-Clearly fully undeveloped\n-Just terrible\n\nOverall the game is NOT playable at this stage. There is simply no point leveling up, collecting or even playing for that matter. Unless some Gandalf type wizardry appears this game is NOT going anywhere positive anytime soon.\nI feel sad that this is my first negative review in all my time on steam :(\n\n3/10", "timestamp_updated": 1498684515, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498684476, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33233952", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500568", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1455239707, "steamid": "76561198055379937", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Abandoned by the devs in a woefully under developed state", "timestamp_updated": 1499179972, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499179972, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "31063545", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498749", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1490416533, "steamid": "76561198112601143", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's broken and support has shut down.

I dident always like the camera, but np, and it did get somewhat repetitious, if you feel playing the same map or mission at harder lvls is repetitious.\n  I am at missions 14 to 16, and missions all the way down to 7 could use more stars. so lots of game, and choices of gear, from drops.\nCrafting is  about, but some mats seem not easy to get, depending on what I want to upgrade, some I have none of.  As your powers increase, you are free to build your type by ranking up your chosen abilities as you want. Abilities are chosen under 3 catagories, prowness, fortitude and cunning, and you meet criteria and purchase more or upgrade with earnings from missions, which can take grinding.\n I checked it out a couple of weeks ago one night, my characters were there, but the map had no stars, so I uninstalled thinking dead. So today I am checking steam and see its free to play and whatnot, so I reinstall and yay map is full of stars and all good. Store was all out of stock, so guess its just game as is, starter pack only I guess, which is np for me. too bad its on server and just single player, but it is up and running.
