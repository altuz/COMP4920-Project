La mulana is a non-linear puzzle based action RPG (Metroidvania as most call it) where you take control of Dr. Lemeza, who may remind you of a particular action hero of the 80's. This game is great for its exploration, platforming, and fun enemy combat, but is held back by ambiguous puzzles and lame boss fights.\n\nThe gameplay: This game is absolutely full of puzzles. It's very common as a first time player to get lost or die to beginners traps. This is one of the few games I had to crack open a guide because I was so lost after wandering for seemingly hours not knowing what to do next. Nearly every puzzle I can think of has a clue to help you solve them, written in the game as notes on tombstones; however, these clues range from obvious to extremely ambiguous. Finding illusionary walls (breakable or not), having the right item at the right place, killing all enemies in the room, pushing blocks in a certain order, teleporter shenanigans, or pushing switches in the right order are all examples of what to expect in this game. \n\nI wouldn't consider my self a great puzzle solver, but I'm not too terrible at it (I study Mathematics), but sometimes the puzzles are too ambiguous. For example, there's a puzzle near the midde of my playthrough where I had to push down and enter in a particular vase like Mario enters a tube, but this mechanic was never used before this situation, and it was never used again after (except having to do something similar to enter in an invisible floor). There may be a tombstone hint to help solve this, but I couldn't figure it out after hours and hours. This brings me to my next point about the puzzles: Multi-area puzzles. Context: This game is very large and is split into different zones (there's around 20), and many of the puzzles require to hit switches or use items in one area, which will open a path in another area, and then that area will open a puzzle into the area you're trying to progress. This is a common type of puzzle in this game and it's extremely ambiguous and frustrating.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I would say I solved over half of the puzzles in this game without any guide (maybe around 2/3), and I always made the attempt to figure out what's next before reading a guide. This game IS possible to solve with no guide, but prepare to be frustrated constantly.\n\nAside from the puzzles, this is a huge game to explore. My favorite thing in this game was the exploration factor, and getting to new areas. While sometimes you need to solve a puzzle to enter a new area, there's only one example I can think of where the puzzle is as ambiguous as mentioned above. Finding all of the treasure is great fun, especially the new weapons you get. Much of the exploration is done by how well the player can get used to the platforming, which means I should discuss the control of the game. This game plays mostly like a platformer with fairly limited arial movement and extremely limited combat (like a classic Castlevania), but this shouldn't be seen as a detriment to the game, but as a new layer of puzzles the player must solve. Combating the enemies, escaping deadly hazards, and moving around the map all add to the puzzle and exploration aspect of the game, with a unique feel compared to other platformers.\n\nSpeaking of the combat, I must address the second weakest point in this game, the bosses. The boss battles in this game are either too easy (you have the right gear to cheese it) or nearly impossible to beat due to the behavior of the bosses. Most of the bosses have attacks which you cannot counter attack, or need to take damage to counter attack. Sometimes a boss will choose to do a move you cannot counter attack over and over and over and it's frustrating. Many of the sub weapons are useless against a lot of the bosses because they simply cannot reach. Many bosses also have ambiguous hitboxes and collision boxes, which makes it all the more difficult to hit them without getting hit your self. \n\nOverall 7/10.\n\nMusic: The music in this game is really great. I'm quite picky about these type of soundtracks trying to emulate retro games or being pretentious in some other way, but this soundtrack is very fun and I even find my self listening to some of it outside the game.\n9/10\n\nVisuals: La Mulana is really colorful. Every zone in the game has a particular color pallete, the boss fights I previously mentoined are really colorful, and even the Professors attacks are very colorful. It's really easy to tell platforms from backgrounds, landmarks, and easy to notice many of the objects needed for puzzles in the backgrounds of the stages.\n10/10\n\nStory: The story in this game is good. I really like how the story is weaved in with a lot of the puzzles you need to solve. This is the type of story I really like in a video game, where it's not pushed in my face but rather it's subtle and you get more of the story by playing the game.\n10/10\n\nOverall I highly recommend La Mulana for anyone willing to explore, solve puzzles, and obtain a lot of treasure/loot.

The thing is, puzzles are the focus of the game, it should be noted that from the start to the end of the game you'll be solving them left and right, nonstop puzzle action, 100 years you and puzzles, those take from visual to sound to sheer wits, and solving the simplest of puzzles makes you grin and feel like you made progress, nothing I solved felt useless or not worth the brain power to solve it.\n\n[code][h1]Gameplay[/h1][/code]\nLa-Mulana is the representation of the over-used phrase:\"easy to learn and difficult to master\", you have only 3 actual buttons to learn, those are:jump, attack and use sub-weapon, with commands this simple it shouldn't be long until you've got movement figured out, but the game goes out of it's way to show you how much you can do with those, mixing and matching all possibilities and making puzzles and enemies that need you to be on your toes to not get hit, but in the old Dark Souls fashion, the more you play and fight those enemies the more you learn on how to take 'em on and the easier it gets.\n\n[code][h1]Graphics[/h1][/code]\nThe game takes us back to Final Fantasy(FF) days, those where 16 bits player and enemies were enough to make a game look okay and distinguish anything from each other, but just like the good old FFs the graphics really shine through bosses and locations, making you pay attention to every single new room you walk into since most puzzles require visual cues, little weird/mystic auras, strange platforms, and fake walls are not at all obvious so you need to pay attention in order to progress and find out about what happened to all Mother's children and how it is all connected thorugh a world of not only telling but showing.\n\n[code][h1]Music and sound design[/h1][/code]\nI sometimes hum a few songs of the game to myself and even tough I don't think I'll be doing this for much longer the music is really good, they capture the mysterious atmosphere of a long lost dungeon filled with monsters to the core, they are a bit scary and a bit funky to keep you in the mood for adventuring, weapons sounds are satisfying and those \"you solved a puzzle\" fanfare just makes the dopamine gates on your brain to open up.\nI really recommend you playing the game at least with sounds on, since they help you with puzzles and some other secret thing ;)\n\n[code][h1]For new players[/h1][/code]\nI'd recommend getting someone to play either alongside you or with you, to chat and exchange information and hints, since the game has so many secrets I think that would be fun to do, if none of your friends like this kind of games and it's a bit hard on your brains don't be ashamed to look up a thing or two on the wiki, I myself used the maps to help me find the mantras, but only do it if you're really stuck, otherwise I don't thing \"solving\" the puzzles are going to be rewarding.", "timestamp_updated": 1502418560, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502418187, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33697011", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502304", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1496246892, "steamid": "76561198362080215", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a fantastic game for anybody who likes brutally hard puzzle and metroidvania games. This is not a game that any casual player can sit down and enjoy this is for a very specific audience but other people will also like it for the combat and platforming. I currently have 70 hours in the game and I have not beaten it; and, this is because of the insane puzzles. These are why i think that the game is too difficult for most people. Do not read on unless you want me to spoil one puzzle so SPOILER ALERT also for people who stopped reading get the game. One puzzle you need to read a tablet then you need to go to an area and press the down key in a specific pot. You get a hint for this in a obscure area of the ruins. Then you break a seal. Then you walk through a wall that is actually not there and break another seal. Then you can progress in the game. That is a MANDATORY puzzle to beat the game.
