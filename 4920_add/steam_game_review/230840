Your character's head constantly bobs like she's in an earthquake, especially when you're running. I cannot imagine who thought this would be a good idea, because I've never, ever had \"head bobbing\" remotely close to this in real life (nevermind the fact that your eyes will automatically adjust to the body bobbing in real life). It's stupid and makes the game unplayable for me because I can't play it for more than 10 minutes without wanting to puke.\n\nFor the game itself, it's very dull. You go around extremely similar-looking corridors, looking for notes with a glowing red sigil on them. Occasionally, ghosts will appear, but you can \"defeat\" them by simply not looking at them. Yes, the only threat in the game can easily be defeated by walking backwards while staring at the floor. I've done the same shit against the Boos in Mario, but at least Mario has the courtesy of making the damn Boos appear in inconvenient locations for a challenge. There are some bullshit moments where one of them will suddenly pop up and bring you close to death, which is stupid as hell. \n\nThe map design is slightly more complex than Wolfeinstein 3D's, and that's only because it has stairs you can use. It even lacks the various landmarks and differently-shaped rooms that made Wolfeinstein 3D's maps possible to navigate, meaning it's level design is somehow more primitive than Wolfenstein 3D's. Wowee!\n\nThe \"scares\" are either random junk rattling around or the previously-mentioned ghosts suddenly appearing and taking off most of your health with nothing you can do about it. You are trapped in some evil haunted building that has souls corrupted by darkness or whatever in it, but apparently being consumed by darkness makes you like to pull out drawers, bang on stuff, and generally engage in acts of petty vandalism. Truly an evil force that requires your character to brave through to find the truth or end the evil or whatever. Might as well make your character a street patrol cop, since they deal with petty vandalism better than your character does. What's the sequel going to be about, a cop that's called to a haunted house filled with darkness-consumed teenagers that are partying and drinking alcohol or some other stupid crime? Will you have to collect glowing notes to find the 17 year old guy getting an awkward blowjob in the bathroom?\n\nIf you want a good horror game, play Outlast. If you want a game made up of rectangular corridors that is actually fun and enjoyable, play Wolfenstein 3D.", "timestamp_updated": 1499935887, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499935669, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34260394", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502818559, "steamid": "76561197997678124", "num_games_owned": 911, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have mixed feelings about this game. I would say to grab it on a 50% off sale.\n\nFirst impressions: Aggravating. Upon starting the game, it prompts me and asks if I would like to run the game or the diagnostic. I select the game and it decides to run the diagnostic anyway. Why bother asking me then? This causes the game to start up alt-tabbed. Which at this ungodly hour(5AM) takes me a couple minutes to notice since I can hear music playing and thought that the game was just taking a while to load. \n\nSo I tab in, see the menu screen and it seems neat. I find the aesthetics pleasing and my grouchiness subsides. I can never stay angry at my precious video games for long. Oh moodswings, never change. <3\n\nI navigate my way to starting a new game and I'm immediately hit with an over-pronounced head bob. If you've read my other reviews, then you know that I am helpless to the demon they call motion sickness. If you have the same problem with head bob then you know exactly what I'm talking about. Motion sickness with sneak into the room, circle your chair, and when you least expect it; kiss you on the lips. Effectively forcing you to nope the fuck out of orbit so that you can go barf. \n\nAnd thus my darlings, I have lost count how many times I've said this. HEAD BOB NEEDS TO BE A TOGGLE!! JFC!!\n\n-ahem-\n\nSo as I begin to wander, a voice comes in over my phone? It's a total stranger danger playground predator sounding guy talking the the main character. He seems to be offering insight into things, but a lot of the stuff he says is creepy in a not so good way. I think maybe the intention was for him to be cryptic or like Hannibal Lecter, but they may have missed the mark a little there. The voice never goes away and I kinda felt stalked by a lecherous sociopath. After a while I kinda tried to ignore him. Now that I think of it, I didn't really like the voice acting for either of the characters. They read their script well enough, I just felt like they were a little too over the top. \n\nI tried to play this several times and I kept getting stuck in the exact same spot. Then I figured out what I was doing wrong. If you keep getting stuck in the beginning area with the boxes, try this:[spoiler] Look for a box with ropes on it and drag it over to the taller ones before climbing up. If you try to climb up before you move the box, you will clip through and get stuck permanently, forcing you to restart the game.[/spoiler]\n\nI appreciate that there is a map on the phone provided, even if it does seem to change a bit as you go along. And I like the glow stick mechanic as well. It's neat how it detects strange writing. I also really like that there are notes and pictures everywhere that talk about the people who once existed within the institution.\n\nStrangely enough, I got acclimated to the head bob and it wasn't so bad. The phone ended up helping a lot by taking my focus off the head bobbing. I had some trouble on the first level because I didn't realize that I was supposed to pick up an item that was floating in the air to unlock a door. Once I figured that out, everything else seemed pretty straightforward:[spoiler] Collect the red notes, find the power item at the 'sigil', and use it to unlock the next area.[/spoiler]\n\nSadly, this is the way you solve every single level throughout the game and it begins to feel redundant. After the fourth level, the story is really the only thing keeping me going. It's a good story too(with tons of little notes that fill in the blanks)! So I am happy for that. \n\nIt doesn't feel really scary in the traditional sense. It's got a very spooky atmosphere and it can get a little intense when you're getting close to the end of a level. But for the most part, I was free to explore and collect items without being bothered by the ghost much. Take what I say with a grain of salt though, I am playing on Easy.\n\nThe ending was a bit strange but acceptable. It didn't leave me with a bad taste in my mouth which is pretty important.", "timestamp_updated": 1503072056, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502818729, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34407631", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500707", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1455389287, "steamid": "76561198164955997", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 5, "review": "Finally a game that simulates the part of my job where I read papers and avoid people in the hallway.", "timestamp_updated": 1503372698, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503372698, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34647974", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495604", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1400317283, "steamid": "76561197965937612", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game taught me to never buy pre-order again !!!", "timestamp_updated": 1504226546, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504226546, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 231, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 268, "total_reviews": 499}}
