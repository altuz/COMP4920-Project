Now that I've binge played for a few days I'll take the time to review in a more positive light.\n\nPros: Character Costume Customization,  nice-looking cartoonish avatars, towns/cities well realized, extensive pet-trainer with many pets, card collection, easy to pick up and make money right off the bat\n\nCons: environments outside of towns and cities seem half empty, poor quest translations (which effects story immesrsion), RNG weapon/armor upgrades (does NOT = pay to win)\n\nIf the idea ok a kooky cartoonish and casual mmo sounds fun I definitely give this a thumbs up. The community seems a little low, but the AH is active enough that I made quite a bit selling items already and there are noticable peak times in the cities.

When I heard news that RO2 was coming out, I, like everyone else was extremely excited given how many good times I had in RO. I don't quite remember, but I believe the release of RO2 was extremely delayed due to how many bugs & errors they had encountered in trying to make it.\n\nSo, once they got tired of trying to make the game work, they just started beta trials to get ready for the release. I was in one of the first few betas and was shocked by how bad it was. The only thing that I remember enjoying was the pets system. Nearly any newer MMORPG is better than RO2. I actually went back to playing RO once I found out how bad RO2 was...\n\nRO Initial release date: August 31, 2002\nRO 2 Initial release date: March 26, 2012\n\n[SinX/Crusader Forever~]\nu_u the high-level crusader farm though.", "timestamp_updated": 1485514455, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485514455, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "29739445", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499773", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1484737531, "steamid": "76561198030541385", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of the best anime games, i recommend it but not my type.", "timestamp_updated": 1486381139, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486381139, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "30182773", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499773", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1441470871, "steamid": "76561198120394459", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I honestly love this game.
