In addition to creating a satisfying sense of progression and accomplishment by allowing players to tackle obstacles at their own pace, the excellent level and puzzle design also serve to reinforce and give depth to the powerfully evocative story. All this is then further elevated by a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, and the unique, athmospheric aesthetics. This is a game in which everything comes together to form a cohesive, masterfully crafted whole and it's about as perfect of an example of the genre as you'll find.

It reminds me of a mix between Metroid and Portal. \nThe surprisingly dark story is told in a very subtle way and is more a \"can\" than a \"must\" for the most part,\nwhich is realy pleasant. The graphics and physics are well done and the machanics are very innovative and pure fun.\n\nNegative things to say:\nThe different areas are just eye candy and not involved in the puzzles. It's basically the same kind of puzzle in every area.\nA few more items/mechanics in general would have been nice. (a beam which swaps the moving direction of a single clone for an example) The game is very short and you CAN finish it in one sitting. There isn't anything like a \"Boss\" or an antagonist.
