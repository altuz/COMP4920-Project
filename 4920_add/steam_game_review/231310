Without spoiling anything, the wider universe is randomly generated and it immediately becomes a problem. So you'll just have to keep mashing buttons going to random worlds to uncover what you need, and that isn't exploring - it's tedious. \n\nI am giving MirrorMoon a thumbs down, but it's actually a \"meh, try it on sale if this is the kind of game you like.\"", "timestamp_updated": 1499602682, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498903101, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "32540817", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512900", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494464166, "steamid": "76561198370535442", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[MirrorMoon EP]\n\nNo instructions, but that makes this particular game more fun!\nGreat art and landscapes / skyscapes\nAwesome music\nThis game is a \u2018take your time\u2019 game and not fast-paced.\nFocus: Exploration & Discovery\nIf you don\u2019t understand how to do something, there are always Steam Guides to help you!\n", "timestamp_updated": 1497799803, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497799803, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "31071095", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504771", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1440249466, "steamid": "76561198074531553", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I /really/ want to like this game, and I did at first.
