Only worse.\n\nGameplaywise it's a mix between meh-to-good puzzles and your standart shoot all the bad guys in the room in order to move on to the next area.\n\n[h1]What's good[/h1]\n1- The game has managed to capture the spirit of adventure movies. You'll see Egypt, travel to the Antarctic and and make your way through Mayan city, with each section broken up into subsections like pyramid, mines and catacombs, etc.\n2- Collectibles in the game actually have a purpose. They can be used to improve your character's abilities.\n3- The main protagonist.\n4- Separate difficulty settings for combat and puzzles\n5- Some of the puzzles are really quite fun\n6- Really good variety of weapons. Sadly there is 2 weapons limit.\n7- Your flashlight. Being the annoying flashlight guy is really entertaining.\n\n[h1]What's not so good:[/h1]\n1- The AI is frustratingly dumb. The enemy soldiers will desperately trying to shoot you [b]while being hidden behind cover[/b], which means they will constantly shoot into the walls. Sometimes they stand still (this holds true for enemies further away), sometimes they will hide behind cover [b]while their head is clearly visible[/b]. But if you're an idiot like me and play on hard combat difficulty, you'll discover they hit like trucks and their little melee attack is an instant kill (WHY?!!) and has ridiculous range. It's really sad that the mummies seem more intelligent than the living soldiers.\n2- The game is crawling with glitches, nothing gamebreaking though (EDIT: my game has crashed). But sometimes I had to reload the game in order to fix my character's hand spazzing out while using the diary/compass/treasure map. There is also a notable texture pop-in. Some puzzles require you to scale down FOV in order to be playable without you losing your mind, because the higher the FOV, the further away the puzzle is (notable examples- a sliding puzzle). On topic of FOV, don't turn it all the way to 140, because objects in your peirpheral vision will be stretched (it's especially funny if the leading lady of the story suddenly gains 100 kg by being at the side of the screen).\n3- I said you can upgrade your character, but the upgrades themselves aren't particularily interesting.\n4- Some puzzles are snorefest, especially when the right answer (not just a hint, but the solution) is inside Quatermain's diary.\n5- Quatermain is allergic to water, so entering larger pools of water is lethal to him. \n6- Some treasures can be obnoxious to get. Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but there is particular treasure piece, which will make you pull your hair out, because it involves crossing water pit by jumping on sinking/resurfacing platforms. There is clear pattern, buuut sometimes it doesn't work and the platform that [u]shouldn't sink[/u] will sink with you on it and kill you. Also, you need pixel perfect precision for the last jump, because the platform is so tiny.\n7- Lame boss battles\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's a mixed bag. Parts of it are really good and parts of it are really bad. But at the end of the day, I was having fun, so I'm going to reccomend it with a warning- if you want to get this game, wait for sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1505510739, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505493131, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34839729", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496310", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1497300204, "steamid": "76561198186570270", "num_games_owned": 443, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Would buy this again if i had the chance to", "timestamp_updated": 1504970206, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504970206, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 225, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 89, "total_reviews": 314}}
