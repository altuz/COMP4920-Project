Wait for sales if you want, the price of CoH2 + DLCs is ridiculous.\n\nSeeing all the Negative Reviews here, I felt like I really have to give my own opinion about this.\nSo yes, there are plenty of Microtransactions, DLCs and stuff and Yes, you can pay a lot of money after buying the base game for getting them all. But the keyword here is the 'can pay' and not 'have to pay'.\nYou can always see the bad side of the game and write a 5 liner review saying you are being milked, and Sega should extinct and that \"it's not what it used to be\". You can, and if you wish, don't buy the game, but you are losing a gem here because of some salt over the DLCs.\n\nThose DLCs have been in PLENTY of Sales, you can buy all of the DLCs including the base game for a real tiny price, and not buy it mid-year when the prices are normal. I myself to this day don't have the British DLC, or the Ardennes Assault DLC and I am doing just fine - Those DLCs are NOT pay-to-win, they just offer a different arsenal of factions, playstyles and more. Don't let this decide whether you want or don't want this game.\n\nThe Microtransactions in-game are nothing but consmetics and small boosts, which some you can get by a little bit of grind. Let me tell you that - You are not going to be \"1337 Hax0r\" if you're going to buy all those commanders, boosts and other bullshit, it's RTS, a bad player will still be bad.\n\nI myself played both CoH1 & 2 for a lot of time, the game is a quality RTS which you can't see much following the same formula in today's market. CoH2 had a tough launch, balance issues and more, but now the game is much more absolute, and updates are still being made, even though a lot of time has already passed.\n\nCoH2 is being sold real cheap, and in sales the price is ridiculous - If the RTS is not burning in your bones but you want to try out this game and maybe stay for long, go ahead and wait for sale.
