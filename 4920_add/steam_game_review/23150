It's just like a ton of other matching puzzle games but without any features other than the actual matching part.\n\nThere's a \"survival mode\" (read: there's a time limit to make a move which resets after making a move) and (the well-named) \"endless mode\" (where... there's absolutely no win or lose conditions at all), either one of which basically just means you sit there and match things until you get bored and quit and/or fall asleep and let the timer run out. \n\nI don't like giving short reviews that just say \"I don't like it\" but... there's really nothing else to say about the game because there's nothing else in the game to talk about.  There are achievements for getting big enough chains, but outside of that, there's literally nothing to strive for, you just match things because you've been trained to match things by other matching games up until you realize the game has no feedback and doesn't care, and you shouldn't either.  Some of the other reviews call this \"relaxing\", but I honestly never felt Bejeweled was terribly stressful enough to start with that it required a version with no levels, win, or lose condition.\n\nMy previous review was taken down because the developer went under, but now it's back, so here's the review again!"}]}
