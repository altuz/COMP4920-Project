Yes, Larry 1 is the lightest in the series in terms of pure gameplay, but many aspects of the game could have been better than what we're given.\n\nThe 2000s weren't kind to the Leisure Suit Larry series as other developers tried their hand on continuing the franchise.  However they made the mistake of resorting to raunchiness as a go-to source of laughs.  A risque joke, like any joke, is only funny if it's timed right, and the older games were a bit better at picking their spots.  That's not to say the series was consistently good, but when it got things right, it was hard to resist Larry and his quest to get some tail.  Unfortunately this game follows the trend of its recent predecessors, and a lot of the original's charm is largely gone. \n\nLand of the Lounge Lizards came out in 1987 and was remade in 1991.  But I honestly can't say this reboot did anything better than the '91 version.  One of the biggest draws for me was the return of the always great Jan Rabson as the voice of Larry.  He's still good, but it being the first Larry game as well as relatively weak writing by the new producers, there's not much witty dialogue to deliver.  The other VAs are serviceable, but none really get a chance to do much as NPCs are only given a few lines and in some instances via a bare-bones dialogue tree.  Also as a matter of personal preference, I did not like the narrator this time around.  Rather than being a teasing side-kick like older Larry misadventures, he comes off more condescending than amusing.\n\nThe other obvious change in this reboot is the graphics.  And well, they work in some instances.  A lot of time definitely went into the art for the women Larry gets to have extended dialogues with.  It can actually get kind of disorienting in comparison to other things in the game.  The game seems to cheapen out on other aspects.  Transitions into animations are obvious.  Lost Wages has some added details on their map, but they're just there for looks.  The addition of a new girl is kind of nice, but feels tacked on and rushed.  There's a new buffet with a hidden gimmick, but it is hardly logical.  Oh and death scenes?  Gone, you just get a black screen and get to reboot to where you were before.  This game was created via a kickstarter, and I would definitely be upset if this was where my money went to.\n\nThere was some talk about Al Lowe being upset with the direction the company was going with the reloaded series, and as of present date it looks doubtful the other games will be remade.
