It's a bit too easy even on hard mode, but is otherwise masterfully made.\n\nHowever, here's a review of the Ground Zeroes expansion because steam doesn't allow me to post this on the Ground Zeroes page itself:\n\n\" Some time ago I bought the other expansion for Quake two called The Reckoning and almost immediately thought that things couldn't get any worse. While not necessarily worse, Ground Zero is certainly not much less disgusting. It starts fairly well, and after an hour or two becomes obscenely bad.\nMany reviewers here have mentioned the Turrets. There are no words to describe the Turrets. The Turrets ruin this expansion - period. It doesn't matter that the level design is solid, or that the levels are larger, more challenging and more loaded with enemies than in the original. The Turrets destroy any slight chance of Ground Zeroes being anything else than an offensively repulsive experience to the FPS gamers who are unfortunate enough to become its victims.\n\nThe other new features suck. The developers did absolutely nothing to even slightly improve id's work. The spider-like enemies are garbage. The new Icarus enemy variations are worthless. The new rapid fire rifle is complete filth - it feels like the Hyperblaster, but without important features such as damage and the ability to hit something, because, obviously, when an enemy crouches, bullets go through their bodies. The new grenade launcher is, well, a grenade launcher, but with a new color. The creativity of this expansion is admirable. As admirable as Imagine Dragons featuring Charlie Frigging Puth.\n\nIf this was the original Quake two, it would've become a sad, sloppy laughing stock instead of the legend it is today. John \"Daikatana\" Romero would be proud. \""}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505358910, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492971", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34941425", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198078327027", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1505871553, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2144}, "timestamp_updated": 1505358910, "received_for_free": false, "review": "this game made me cumm 12 times in 3 milliseconds."}]}
