You start with a begining primary (that depends on your class), a 9mm pistol, and a class specific knife. the waves will start off simple, yet fun, and they'll get worse, and worse (worse=better ;3)\n\nI would stand at the top of a skyscraper and praise this game, this is how you do a sequel. \n\nThis game is a fucking masterpiece, if you love guns, gore, carnage, and mayhem, get this beautiful game. \n\n10 out of mother fucking 10.\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\nTotal Rating: \u272e\u272e\u272e\u272e\u272e of \u272e\u272e\u272e\u272e\u272e\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550", "timestamp_updated": 1506679762, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506679762, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35343134", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500070", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506788921, "steamid": "76561198169396597", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 51}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Love it best zombie game!\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506785966, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506785966, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34767712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501068", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504660506, "steamid": "76561198162464384", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "You will have a bloody good time!", "timestamp_updated": 1504661565, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504661565, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15515, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 2692, "total_reviews": 18207}}
