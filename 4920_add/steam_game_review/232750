Though, there is something here. It isn't great nor is it the worst. Mostly it's missed potential. \n[*][b]BSERC[/b] - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): Being made the studio \u201cSpiders\u201d it's very similar to Bound by Flame and of course the the non direct sequel to MWL -- Technomancer, making this more of a novella. [i]\u201dTechomancer 0.1\u201d[/i] \n[/list]\n[h1]Concomitant Exposition and Summation[/h1]\n\n[b]Mars: War Logs[/b] is a melee focused, narratively driven game with some very lite RPG elements. Now, the game seemingly tries to do way too much and never really succeeds at any of them. But somewhere deep, very deep, in it's bowels lies some potential. Granted, it never shows it itself but you know it's there. \n\nThe combat is very simple. It consists of regular attacks, guard breaks, counter attacks and rolls. Technomancy adds a modicum of depth but nothing that'll re-write the book. The roll actually feels a little like the roll in Fable but more loose. Allowing you to roll directly into the backs of enemies from their front. It uses a radial menu to assign certain attacks to shortcuts and to be used directly from as well. Additionally, it can used to have your party members given orders. Though I never found a reason to implement that feature. You can see it's clear inspiration from Of Orcs and Men (same studio) though [i]Mars[/i] is much more action-based rather than the active pause with queue mechanics. \n\nNow, the environments are relatively plain. Granted, it's a barren desert planet. But the hallways and corridors are extremely closed in -- almost coffin like. I'd like to give the developers the benefit of the doubt being that it takes place on a Mars colony that the quarters would be tight and that that would be more realistic due to money constraints or whatever manufactured lore reason you can come up with but it seems TOO cramped. To the degree where it starts to impede gameplay. The camera is too tight, when evading it's quite easy to become stuck on the geometry. These are things that are easily overlooked IF the rest of the game was truly something to behold. Now, I do still recommend the game on sale when expectations are much lower. Because, as I said, there is [i]something[/i] here.\n\nThere is also this weird Serum mechanic that acts as an economic barter tool aka money. I suppose the weird part is it also acts as the resource required to craft health packs. It reminded me of the ADAM economy within Rapture. \n\nThat [i]something[/i] I keep mentioning may be nostalgia. This game feels like something from the early aughts. Thematically, it's quite similar to Red Faction or even RAGE. Albeit, it's not a shooter or even as good as either of those. \n\nThe game has some very odd voice acting, it's really rough. Personally I think the game may have benefited from being text only. For 2 reasons: It would have allowed more time for the dev team to write better and more diverse dialogue options. Secondly, it would have likely cost a lot less to implement. Since we are here, I'd like to bring attention to the fact that the dialogue options/character interactions that are present sometimes feel very forced or don't represent the paraphrasing regarded in the selection menu. At times they don't seem to have almost any impact aside from a very few more [i]non-trivial[/i] moments. \n\n[i][b]THE GIST\nThis game is plagued with small bugs and glitches. A mediocre story and even more average combat. But there [i]is[/i] something here. I just can't tell you exactly what it is nor do I think It'd be that simple to explain. Not concisely anyways.
