Most adventure games, the fun, and reward, comes from the difficulty. All the objects you needed in this game were the ONLY objects you were able to pick up or look at. The puzzles were simplistic. It was basically an interactive story. I finished it fairly quickly. Maybe 2 days or less. Adventure games should take a while. A month a two, with at least dozens of frustrating moments. Sometimes spending 1 to 2 days (or longer) attempting to figure out one task. Classics like The Dig, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, and Syberia definiately met this paradigm. I have yet to find a contemporary adventure game that matches their genius.
