The sequel to one of my favorite games, [i]Stronghold Crusader[/i], this game was [i]Firefly Studios[/i] most recent 3-D foray with their stronghold series. They\u2019ve struggled in the past with going from 2-D to 3-D and their stronghold games have struggled in this regard. Games come out buggy, limited and generally suffer from lack of polish. That being said, [i]Stronghold Crusader 2[/i] is the closest they\u2019ve come to making a good 3-D stronghold game, it feels the most familiar and polished out of all of the previous 3-D titles and it has great potential if only they tweak a few things with the gameplay. There is a good amount here content wise, graphically the game is serviceable not the prettiest [i](I would like to see more detail in everything)[/i] but, the physics and graphics get the job done. The game lacks a bit of color I feel but, otherwise I\u2019ve no major complaints from the games presentation, where it fumbles is in its gameplay, specifically the balancing of the game.\n\n     I won\u2019t prattle on too much, check out my video for some examples, the gist of it is the economy of the game is imbalanced, your expectations of what resources you can reliably gain vs what you have to spend to get your kingdom up and running is completely imbalanced. Woodcutters don\u2019t bring in enough wood for the cost of some of the most basic buildings, same thing for stone quarries for building your castle and towers, same thing for food supporting larger populations, and again there\u2019s a lot more here and there [i](for example, why can you spend more wood to repair a structure then what it originally cost to build, it makes no sense)[/i], the combat is slow and the unit AI seems stupid at time, just standing there waiting to strike the enemy, lots of problems in this department and it makes the entire experience frustrating and not fun. Strategy ultimately amounts to buying the cheapest units in bulk and swarming the enemy to win, rinse and repeat.\n\n     As it stands, I can\u2019t recommend [i]Stronghold Crusader 2[/i], it\u2019s a [b][u]$49.99 USD[/u][/b] game and for the amount of frustration that exists in the game I would say stay away from the game till these issues are addressed in some manner. I hope the folks at [i]Firefly Studios[/i] see these complaints and maybe come up with a way to rebalance the game, the potential the game has is great and if they just got the base game figured out and made enjoyable I know a lot more people would change their minds about the game, I know I would.\n\n-Thumb Down from Royial [/code]\n\n[code][h1][b][u]Stronghold Crusader HD:[/u][/b][/h1] Coming to us originally from [b][i]2002[/i][/b], a spiritual sequel to the original Stronghold [i](also in HD and also amazing)[/i] one of the few games in existence that can claim castle sim as one of its genre tags.  [i]Stronghold Crusader[/i] is first and foremost a strategy game, build your castle, run your economy and stomp your opponents into the sands. The game offers a ton of different AI characters to vs, some easy, some challenging, all very distinct and fun, the strategy layer offering a multitude of ways to run your kingdom and build your army. Have an entire kingdom run off religion and ale? Go for it, use the taxes from your god fearing drunk peasantry to fund your army; will you use purely Arabian or Crusader forces, or mix them to completely destroy your opponents. It\u2019s a fun strategy game, with a decent amount of depth, mixed in with great extras like map building, sandbox castle building and a ton of different scenarios or custom skirmishes. Multiplayer is a blast and pretty easy to setup, with it being in HD the game looks and runs great on newer systems and it\u2019s cheap only costing [i][u]$9.99 USD[/u][/i] regularly. This is an easy recommendation from me, it\u2019s not a hard strategy game to get into at all and there\u2019s a huge community so there\u2019s tons of ways to play the game or add to it, it\u2019s one of my all-time favorites and I still play it to this day!\n\n-Double ThumbsUp from Royial [/code]", "timestamp_updated": 1506653423, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506551266, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34912459", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500826", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1476591882, "steamid": "76561198153850402", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's pretty fun but also buggy..\n", "timestamp_updated": 1505272613, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505272613, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34908514", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496390", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1492272387, "steamid": "76561197995527763", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A total Waste.", "timestamp_updated": 1505250276, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505250276, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34848624", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504526128, "steamid": "76561197991282850", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Garbage!\nWalls are useless since they are so easily destroyed by everything. \nWood.. everything costs way too much in wood. \nSimplified gameplay over the original Crusader. \nFramerate is horrific no matter your setup.
