The controls are flawed and the similarity of the levels and the crappy physics engine mean 9 times out of 10 the correct solution to finish the level is to build the exact same fucking bridge, varied only by the material used in its construction and whether most of the support goes on the left or the right hand side.

Messing with physics was intriguing even though the game stressed out my old hardware beyond its limits. Looong did I hope that a modern version of such game would appear and there Bridge Project hit the target. After all, it's the same developer. They've gone up with the size from 32 MB (Pontifex) to 511 MB (Bridge Project). New maps to play, more decent graphics, perhaps a bit more casual feel to it but still, the essense is there.\n\nThe basic interface is simple. Select the material to use, click on a joint and draw the piece where you want it to be. Simple mode helps you out quite a lot adding blocks, mirroring blocks and adding cross beams to support the structure. You can get far with it and be happy to see how the vehicles cross your newly built bridge.\n\nHowever, the most facinating part of the game is to scrap the simple mode and go expert. How far can you strip down the bridge and make it withstand the stress from the vehicles without it falling apart? To build a bridge with least number of elements, as light as possible, and with lowest budget is where you compete with yourself and globally with other players. The game has in-built global leaderboards where you can check out how well the best ones have done it.\n\nAnd this is where the interface gets in the way of the fun. You use the mouse to control pretty much everything (in addition to some keyboard shortcut keys). The left mouse button is for selecting and building, the middle button lets you dolly the camera, zoom works with mouse scroll, and the right button is for turning the camera and selecting the items for deletion.\n\nUnfortunately the last one simply doesn't seem to have any logic to it. The mouse pointer, humangous arrow, seems to be little off at all times. And despite of which item is highlighted on screen when mouse pointer is on it, the right click either selects another item or it simply turns the camera! Why?!? Why can't I select an item with LMB and then hit delete key from keyboard? That's how every other software works. No, here you need to find a specific spot of an item somewhere and then right click on it and select delete option. More often than not I was unable to find the correct spot and I ended up restarting the map instead. The cables seemed to be the worst. Using the separate select mode makes selection much easier and then even the delete key works. But why is it a separate mode? Fortunately space bar is the shortcut.\n\nThe game is fun and it'll keep me playing it trying to best myself over and over again. If you're into semi-realistic physics simulation and construction then you probably will like the game. However, if you're easily irritated by cloggy interface then I'd recommend testing the game before purchase.
