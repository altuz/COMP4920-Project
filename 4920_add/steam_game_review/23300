BLOCKS!\n\nEach stage sets you objectives, ranging from the simplistic, like removing a quota of specific coloured blocks, to the more challenging, such as clearing an entire board with one move (this move being where the game gets its name, in the same way Tetris is the name given to clearing the maximum of four lines in a single drop), with each stage being cleared by completing all of these objectives.\n\nThe whole things starts off at a very basic, and even mundane degree of difficulty as you breeze through the majority of the opening stages in the space of a couple of minutes, but by the final quarter or so of the game this is turned on its head as the ever strangling time limit can soon grind you down unless you have very sharp eyes or a lot of luck finding the right blocks to match. This deceptively high difficulty spike of the final stages seems very at odds with the \u00fcber casual, child-friendly presentation of every aspect of the title and may see many quit before reaching the end, even with the extra added help of bonus unlocks which act as perks to aid in varying elements of play.\n\nBut even if you do quit by then, ultimately you're not really going to miss out on all that much. The opening few hours play much the same as the final hours save for some minor added elements and complications added to proceedings that actually change things very little of the game beyond its initial premise. So a pretty throwaway, repetitive, yet inoffensive title (except for maybe the audio, which you might want to mute) that might not stick with you too long after you play it, but which still holds some fun for those looking for their quick puzzle fix to dip in and out of. Pick it up when it's cheap, play it, enjoy it a little, forget about it, move on with your life.
