If you fight everything you come across like most games, you'll have a harder time winning in the end due to the experimental Battle Rating system which has enemies scale alongside you.\n\nThe system encourages you to avoid all fights but the most deadly and then to milk those.  The goal is to be high ability, low level.  Ultimately you end up running around as though you were dodging battles like plyons on a race track.  When you get the sense that you just can't play naturally it's disheartening.  They gave their BR system a go and it didn't pan out.  Would have been enjoyable otherwise."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505490825, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34975251", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198091346146", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1501483769, "num_games_owned": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4161}, "timestamp_updated": 1505490825, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's like... a good kind of self-torture... Typical Square Enix game. I like the battle system and I liked how Renton from Eureka 7 did english voice for Rush Sykes... (Protagonist). What I don't like is the 'Curses, the Poisons, etc' hitting everyone just because it hit one of a group, so the whole group takes afflication. I'm not a speed runner and I'm not an elitist or anything, so I like to train units and character build but there is a hidden Battle Rank that sometimes determines RNG things like the afore entioned affects, etc... Thumb up nonetheless. Owned this once on xbox360 and now on PC. The PC version is better because the BR thing is not so drastic."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506662724, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497833", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35283170", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198090605743", "num_reviews": 26, "last_played": 1377954582, "num_games_owned": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5334}, "timestamp_updated": 1506662724, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Haven't seen a combat system like this before.  This game really should get another entry in the series.  It came out in 2009, and just love to see what Square could do with it these days.  A must have if you love RPGs, but are bored with the same old same old combat, and progression systems."}]}
