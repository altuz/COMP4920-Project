If you are looking for a nice TD, just go for anotherone, there are so many good TD\u00b4s out there (Defense Grid for example).\n\nGraphics (4/10):\nNot really that impressive. Considering this is a PC version, it has crappy animations, the framerate is just taken over from the android version and overall it could have been much better.\n\nDesign (2/10):\nAs this is a TD, especially the leveldesign. It\u00b4s just.... aweful. They tried to copy what DG did right, a mix between maze and standart. I hope you already know: they failed. The first levels are actually ok, but as they get bigger comes a confusing layout. That doesn\u00b4t change with the \"blockers\" standing on each map (things the enemies will stop at and attack till it\u00b4s gone).\nFor the overall design: The enemies are nicely diversified which doesn\u00b4t count for the towers. If a tower is level 1 or 2, you will not see it.\n\nGameplay (7/20):\nYou can upgrade your towers, so thats a plus. But what else? You always have to place your towers on the exact spot it was supposed to stand in order to block the enemies path. How strategy is that. After the first level, the fun is just gone. It gets repetitiv really quick as you don\u00b4t get any new useful stuff. The real killer are the blockers tho. Having to build towers which you than have to sell later is just stupid.\nYou also don\u00b4t need to adjust any towers to the enemies spawing as they nearly all do the same thing.\n\nControls (4/5):\nWorks overall. Sometimes the camera pans a bit strange but thats ok. Annoying is the zoom tho. You will never use it. You don\u00b4t need to, but it\u00b4s really bad.\n\nInnovation (2/5):\nCopies DG, every tower has already been seen in other games and there are no new enemy types to speak of.\nTho you have a upgrade system of each tower and the blockers are (even tho really bad) new as well.", "timestamp_updated": 1385461759, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1385461759, "votes_down": 12}, {"recommendationid": "10577289", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 41, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542663", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403289713, "steamid": "76561197982404585", "num_games_owned": 683, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Perfect example of why steam needs better quality control. \n\nThis has all the depth of one of those F2P tower defence Iphone apps. \n\nThe best thing this game actually does is defining the standard for 'crappy tower defence'. \n\nAvoid unless youre trapped in an airport for a week and you've already successfully washed all the windows and checked all the seats for pennies.\n\nOptimal Price: <1$", "timestamp_updated": 1403289911, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403289911, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "7765918", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543685", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1409747307, "steamid": "76561197960359282", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Decided to grab this while waiting for Defense Grid 2 and while it looks like Defense Grid it it lacks a huge amount of depth the game had, the game is playable and enjoyable enough that I played all the way through but almost everything is copied from DG.\n\nSet pieces are copy paste including almost all art assets, the upgrade system even down to the colours and the music.\n\nIt's dissapointing that a developer with enough money to put some effort into a PC TD decided to waste it in copying another game.\n\nUnless you have played Defense Grid to death then don't play this, if you're hardcore into TD then wait until it's cheap then grab it.\n\nIf this doesn't feel like a real review it's because it's not,anything I write about the game feels like I'm reviewing DG.", "timestamp_updated": 1385472736, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1385472736, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "7490105", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523447", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1385808881, "steamid": "76561198005299723", "num_games_owned": 11558, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I was hoping Defense Technica was going to rival one of my    top rated TD games Defense Grid: The Awakening, for playability;  unfortnately it   didn't, but it certainly helped me  to scratch the itch I get when I see  a new TD release.

I don't think the other reviewers have played through this game entirely.  While there may be similarities between this game and the Defense Grid games, there are also very significant differences.  Since so many other reviewers are comparing the two games, I will as well.\n\nOne of the biggest differences is that you can add upgrade ability to your towers between levels which carries over.  In Defense Grid there is no overarching upgrade ability.  Every level is brand new with the same vanilla towers.  The upgrades in Defense Technica can significantly change the way a tower behaves.  In Defence Grid, upgrades just increase damage and range.  For example, the basic machine gun tower can go up the machine gun path which will give it longer range and more damage against biological enemies.  Or it can become a mass driver which allows it to penetrate all enemies in a line specialized again mechanical enemies but with a much slower rate of fire.\n\nThere are very distinct catagories of enemies and damage.  One type of damage is optimal for a certain type of enemy but may be very weak against another.  Defense grid has shielded and unshielded.  This game has shielded, unshielded, heavy, light, bio and mechanical.  If you specialize in one type of damage, you will become vulnerable to enemies that are resistant to it.\n\nUnlike in Defense Grid, when enemies make it to your core, they do damage.  They are not stealing cores which float back to your base.  They stay there until your core is destroyed at which point you lose the game.\n\nAlso, the core itself has a couple of finite abilities.  It can do a smart bomb a few times or heal itself using ether.  Once the ether runs out, then you have no more for the rest of the level.\n\nI found the game to be enjoyable.  IMO it is tactically more challenging with the added complexity of upgrades available and the more varying enemies attacking you.", "timestamp_updated": 1454265948, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454265948, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29631645", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501438", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1495754808, "steamid": "76561198167797218", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Buy upgrades, shoot em all and level up.
