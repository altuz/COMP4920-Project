There it is. [b]Shadow Warrior[/b] is clearly one of those rare representatives of classic old school I'd say [u]First Person Slasher[/u] games(not shooters, you have to play to understand why it feels so). It doesn't feel like the original game at all where the gameplay was aimed on shooting.\n\n[*]- Lo Wang, as in the original game - a great fan of scatological humour and he leaves not even a single notable action without another amusing comment. His... Let's call him \"mate\", the demon Hoji, also doesn't try to stay away and look into his pocket for some low words. He jokes around pretty much, but however, prefers to make fun of Lo himself.\n\n[*]- As a demon slayer, you gain experience and improve your skills, finding crystals gives you some new tricks. Among active-aggressive abilities aimed for combat, there are also some passive, defensive abilities.  Performing those special moves is sufficiently simple: you don't have to take three-step chords on the keyboard.\n\n[*]- Your Katana here is the main tool for interaction with demons. It feels almost as good as it feels in [b]\"Dark Messiah of Might & Magic\",[/b] but the process of handling it is much easier. Left click - quick and simple attacks, right click - performs slow and heavy ones. The direction of the attacks is always random, so the process of cutting enemies turns into a simple clicking without thinking until you get some upgrades.\n\n[*]- Firearms - big classic guns with nothing really interesting behind: a pistol, a submachine gun, a shotgun, a crossbow, a flamethrower and, of course, a rocket launcher. Unfortunately, they sound and feel bad so I forced myself to get all achievements based on shooting to achieve as fast as possible.\nYour guns can be upgraded for the money you constantly find in the game. Each gun can have an increased clip and fire power, and also you can open an alternative fire mode. There's not much of a use for any of them until you cap the upgrade limit of each one to feel some real benefit in combat. In any other situation, it's enough to have a double-barrel shotgun.\n\n[*]- Despite the hilarious process of slaying enemies all around, it's better to play not more than a few hours per day, because playthrough stretches for a good couple of tens hours with lack of variability.\nMore and more enemies are descending on you with lack of interesting situations, so the game just says - please, entertain yourself somehow.\n\n[*]- The levels design, despite the nice picture, causes some kind of depression. At first, your eyes are pleased by the bamboo groves and traditional architecture, but the further you progress, the more time you have to spend on giant half-empty squares and in classical endless corridors, where you can easily get lost and die of boredom. The Japanese colours gradually evaporate. Instead of bamboo groves there come warehouses and some trading ports, littered with the tons of twin-boxes\n\n[*]- What is really good is that secrets and Easter eggs are literally on every corner, and it's not hard to find them at all. Most of them you probably will find absolutely randomly. Connoisseurs of the original who used to the branched level design and well-hidden caches will be somewhat disappointed...\n\n[h1][b][u]Pros & Cons:[/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*][b]Pros:[/b]\n[b]+[/b] [i](Katana feels very good);[/i]\n[b]+[/b] [i](Humour that Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes would appreciate);[/i]\n[b]+[/b] [i](Many easter eggs to the original game and some previous projects of devs);[/i]\n[b]+[/b] [i](Different and very useful skills).[/i]\n\n[*][b]Cons:[/b]\n[b]-[/b] [i](More and more monotonous levels throughout game progress);[/i]\n[b]-[/b] [i](Barely interesting custscenes);[/i]\n[b]-[/b] [i](Terrible and basically useless firearms);[/i]\n[b]-[/b] [i](Easy bosses);[/i]\n[b]-[/b] [i](Terrible controller support, extremely uncomfortable to play);[/i]\n[b]-[/b] [i](Demons look absolutely lame).[/i]\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b][u]Result:[/u][/b]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th][b]Aspects:[/b][/th]\n        [th][b]Score:[/b][/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Atmosphere[/td]\n        [td]8.0 - [b]Old school, insanity, blood, demons and rivers of blood - feels good.[/b][/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Graphics[/td]\n        [td]7.0 - [b]True old school mixed up with Japaneese culture that is eyecatching for the first 5-6 hours maybe.[/b][/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Optimization[/td]\n        [td]7.5 - [b]Good, but having some texture bugs + lagging sometimes, even with an overpowered GPU.[/b][/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Sound[/td]\n        [td]8.5 - [b]Very good, fits the atmosph.[/b][/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Animations[/td]\n        [td]8.0 - [b]Funny, silly and adorable, all thanks to Katana performing.[/b][/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]5.5 - [b]Absolutely meh, only the jokes didn't ruin it for me.[/b][/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]8.0 - [b]I'd say it's 10.0 But - 2 for shooting, boring and useless.[/b][/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Replayability[/td]\n        [td]7.5 - [b]2-3 times a year is considered a pretty good replayability.[/b][/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td][b][u]Total[/u][/b][/td]\n        [td][b]7.5[/b] - [b]Definitely worth a shot.[/b][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table][/h1]\n\n[h1][b][u]Afterwords:[/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[i]- [b]Shadow Warrior[/b] is recommended(not strongly though) for those who fell in love with such games as [b]Painkiller[/b], [b]Shadow of the Damned[/b] and [b]Serious Sam[/b] for their crazy atmosphere of pure insanity, stylistics, fast paced moving while slaying hostile NPCs meanwhile listening to some low jokes your protagonist flows up.\n- If you're looking straight for the game to chill and have some fun, that's what definitely will suit your needs.
