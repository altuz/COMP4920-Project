Otherwise it is boring, specially on some where you need to collect so much on your own to bring back to one area.\n\nMost enjoyed when people join you online however that seems minimal as online is always empty. I gotten maybe 1-2 people to join but only within 1 hour of my time-zone and the rest just being empty! So be sure to add people who have the game and want to play (feel free to add me)\n\n\nThere are collectables and weapons and you actually need to find them not only to upgrade your skills/character but also to get the top rank (gold). Points alone will not get you gold which is pretty cool, they mean something.\nHowever this is a pain because if you do find players online they most likely rush the objective and lock you out of an area where a weapon/collectable was which is a pain. You cannot tell them unless you have a mic either and most times they will ignore you. So again make sure you have friends or play on EASY PEASY to find the collectables.\n\n\nI want this game to be more popular, it is a nice beat-em up and online mode when you can find players. So get it but maybe when it is on sale due to the lack of players playing online. However if you need an online buddy, just add and shoot a comment my way when you want to play.", "timestamp_updated": 1506722943, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506673080, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34849509", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495893", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505069601, "steamid": "76561198246544674", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "\u00d3timo jogo para um casual entre amigos, far\u00e1 voc\u00ea passar o t\u00e9dio em quest\u00e3o de minutos.
