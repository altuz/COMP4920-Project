This game, though I do enjoy it, is not worth the current \u00a313.59 (or your regional equivalent) price tag. I would advise that if you are interested in this game wait until it is on sale, it may not be for everyone and I can see a lot of its issues killing the game for some.\n\nTo address some of the common complaints I have seen about this game; the controls are a little strange and quite sensitive but after a little while you can get used to them. I find that it is perfectly playable with mouse and keyboard, though controller support is also available. The map areas are small only in some missions, keep playing and you will discover that is far from the norm and in many missions I never saw the edges of the map. Finally, as I understand multiplayer does work but only if you are playing the beta version of the game, however I doubt you will find anyone to play with at this point.\n\nI will start by saying that this is not a realistic \u2018simulator\u2019 and though I prefer realistic games, I do find \u2018Air Conflicts Vietnam\u2019 enjoyable. It is however, fairly authentic while not being entirely realistic and this is one of its greatest strengths.\n\nIn addition to all the positive and negative points I will make about this game, I would like to mention a few interesting things which may be overlooked. As a nod to their Second World War titles, you can find the wrecks of an F4U and an A6M on certain levels and if collected they will be added to your aircraft inventory, allowing you to fly them in custom battles. To illustrate the inherent unreliability of air-to-air missiles during this period, the game gives you the option to change between five different accuracy settings of 20-100%. Interestingly every plane and helo has its own realistic cockpit which is well modelled (though arguably textured poorly) and you can also look around them using the directional view controls. Lastly, missions require you to use more than one aircraft which allows for variety within each mission and highlights the relationships between different aircraft types of the war.\n\nA positive in my book are that the damage models of aircraft which are (comparatively) reasonably authentic, despite the game\u2019s use of health bars and damage not effecting flying characteristics. This is with the exception of the helos which are figuratively flying tanks due to the design on the missions. The game also includes visual models which reflect damage taken. While flight models are arcady, there is an hair of realism here too, with the handling and performance of aircraft being authentically depicted. The ordnance aircraft carry is true to the era and is portrayed reasonably well with the exception of unrealistic loadouts which are required to complete arcade style missions which heavily feature target rich environments. There is a variety of ordnance modelled, however disappointingly the game lacks the AIM-7 Sparrow leaving you just the AIM-9 Sidewinders and your gun(s) for aerial combat. Just like the real air war in Vietnam, this game heavily features ground attack missions with MiG engagements being few and far between. Though this realistically represents the air war in Vietnam, it may be a thing to keep in mind if you're just looking for a MiG-fest. However there is an instant action game mode where you can just fight AI. The missions are varied and the terrain looks good, with the campaign taking approximately 8-9 hours and spanning the entirety of the war. Missions are plentiful in number and variety here and show a side to the Vietnam War which is not often portrayed.\n\nTo start on the negatives, the AI is not that great. They only serve to be a real threat when they are either in great numbers, or attacking aircraft you have to protect. Though this is not too much of a problem because, as I have mentioned, killing MiGs is not the main portion of this game. In custom battles against the AI you can ramp up their numbers to make it more challenging but even then it is still not that great. When in the gunner view of a UH-1 or CH-47 you can throw grenades to kill tanks with a single hit, another peculiar element which adds to the UFO-like behaviour of transport helo gameplay. You also use an M2 and not the iconic M60 so synonymous with the Vietnam War in these sequences which was a little disappointing. Though the game is loosely based on a true story and highlights many aspects of the U.S. populous\u2019 feelings toward the Vietnam War, it is executed poorly due to bad writing and voice acting. You play the role of a U.S. Navy pilot but this simply serves as an excuse to put you in the war. In reality you fly a multitude of Navy and Air Force aircraft which translates to F-100s and F-105s sitting on the flight deck of the USS Enterprise in the menu screens. Aircraft are dictated by the mission and even when replaying you cannot chose which aircraft you wish to fly. This is not a terrible thing though as you are given the aircraft you need, with the payloads you need to complete the missions. However, when the game decides to switch your aircraft during missions for different tasks, its choice is sometimes\u2026questionable. For example; one mission starts you bombing in an F-4 Phantom, some MiGs roll in and now you are flying an A-4 Skyhawk. The bad AI makes this playable but it struck me as poorly thought out. Finally on a more technical note \u2018Air Conflicts Vietnam\u2019 lacks the ability to change screen resolution and its option menus in general are very sparse.\n\nThough not outright negatives, in this paragraph I will address some to the more goofy development decisions that went into this game. Worth a small mention is that some missions, for whatever reason, start you facing the opposite way to the direction you are meant to be heading. The developers obviously used a lot of assets from their previous Second World War titles and this results in some\u2026odd experiences. There are a few different ships in game but apart from the USS Enterprise, they are all Second World War vintage DDs and subs. The U.S. Army are equipped with Sherman tanks and though the devs took the time to model T-55s, PT-76s, and ZSU-23-4s for the PAVN, even then they also use Second World War Japanese tanks! During one part in the game a PAVN soldier is supposedly talking but he is clearly speaking Japanese and not Vietnamese. Another thing I noticed is that the description for the F4U on the carrier is actually for an F4F, an aircraft not even in the game! When you pass other planes and helos at close range it sounds like you are actually passing a prop aircraft. The cut scene graphics are, for some reason, worse than the in-game ones (not that they are bad) and they often look out of focus. With all of these problems I just found it hilarious that there is a wide array of sea life in the Gulf of Tonkin which is only seen in one mission. Whales, dolphins\u2026it just makes me think; why did they not model an M48 Patton instead?\n\nIn sum, this can be a fun game but is far from perfect and certainly not without its flaws. It feels rushed and unpolished with many elements that I do not doubt will put some off the game completely but if you are able to look past a lot of the bad there is also good here and persistence, I found, brought that out in this game.

The controls are fiddly and strange, nothing at all like the fluidity of Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers (which I think is the high point of the franchise).\n\nBy far the worst thing about the game is that it interrupts gameplay to deliver cutscenes after the completion of each goal, and these interruptions are frequent. Your goal might be to take out three AA emplacements \u2014 which you'll get done within 1-3 minutes since the maps are so small \u2014 and then you'll sit through a 20 or 30 second cutscene with hammy voice acting.

I had written an initial \"not recommended\" review but retracted it when they released a beta patch adding a new flight model and some other changes in order to give it a 2nd chance.  However it must be said that there is  still more wrong than right with this game. \n\nJET FLIGHT: You have two choices of which are flying like a car, or flying with a buggy \"simulation\" mode in which aircraft controls don't function properly.  For some examples: applying right rudder has 0 yaw effect and will roll your plane over toward the left, or how banking can have little or no effect on turning.\n\nHELO FLIGHT: Large improvement over pre-beta.  Helicopter flight actually felt decent and the bindings were an improvement from before.  The main bother here is the dodge mechanic which lets the helo suddenly jerk left or right.  It doesn't look so bad in cockpit view but out of cockpit it looks ridiculous.\n\nWEAPONS: Very auto-aim based, get in the general proximity with the sight and watch the bullets fly from your jet as if they were coming from a turret in the nose.  Missiles can be adjusted to varying degrees of accuracy, generally not an issue.  Bomb view is limited to straight flight when in simulation, no rudder control due to the bug for fine adjustments.  Applying rudder or banking will pull you out of bomber view.  This game would strongly benefit from the option to use a mouse for the door gunner while using a flightstick for the helicopter as well.\n\nAI: Not much to say but if you control any aircraft during mission the AI will no longer function on that aircraft for the remainder of said mission.  (That aircraft will just keep flying straight.)\n\nSTORY: The story really had no draw to it, you hear the narration of some letters from the main pilot and to the main pilot as well as the general briefing for missions but they lack any emotional draw and just didn't engage me as a player.  On another down note to story there is almost no radio chatter during missions to draw you into the story and it creates a very hard separation between the missions and the cuts between them.  What little chatter there is is comparable to the the movie Sharknado and the cuts during missions feel just as dry and out of context as the cuts inbetween missions.\n\nOverall the gameplay in simulation is undesireable due to the current bugs with no sign of developer feedback.  Unfortunately while arcade works better I have serious issues calling games with the \"flying car\" model of flight a flight game in this day and age.  Air Conflicts Vietnam is a game that has or had a lot of potential that just isn't coming through.  Is it redeemable, I'd say yes... however it will take more than I believe they are willing to do at this stage considering they have mentioned work on an expansion.

They build up the complexity of the mission in the briefing, but then you drop one bomb on a location and you're instantly into the next phase. Helo controls are not good at all, the F-4 is too fast to stay in the map, missile targetting is non-existent, and the wingmen do nothing but chase the seven or eight enemy that all gang up on you alone. They don't even fire on them! Door-gunning in the Huey is laughable, using an MG to blast open an armored ZSU-23-4? Rail shooters never looked so boring.\nOn the point of controls, I have to complain heavily on the fact that I can't seem to alter the keyboard assignments at all, yet the landing gear (which you NEVER USE TO LAND) are on the same key as the after-burners?

The second part you are flying a Chinook low to drop seals and must remain undetected.  The helicopter controls are a bit clunky but with some work you can get the hang of them. After spending more time than I care to admit trying to complete this mission, I have given up.  It seems rediculous that this game is ruined by one impossible mission.  One mission that you can't just skip.  I really would have liked to seen what else this game held, but I think the \"Cong\" made this game so only they can win.", "timestamp_updated": 1404960290, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404960290, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "29791403", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500914", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1386373268, "steamid": "76561198018587672", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "As casual as aviation can get.\n\n- Forgetable story\n- Crappy turret mission\n- No sense of flight whatsoever\n- Poor plane selection\n- Boring missions\n\n- Decent soundtrack\n\nWould refund it if I could.", "timestamp_updated": 1486596492, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486596492, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "18463665", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503367", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1412296470, "steamid": "76561198109539898", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The games graphics are nice, gameplay is not.

I give a lot of credit towards the developers with the wide range of assorted aircraft during the 60's/70's. The soundtrack is good or unique in a sense ,yet after a couple missions they get really beaten to death since they wrote original songs for this game with some range of genres too. I'll be honest by saying that the story isn't interesting at all even though I'm not that far into the game. Some other things that bother me with what the developers did was mainly the grid they put into each of the combat airspaces giving you only so much room to fly yet it's not all that bad, but it takes away from \"some\" of the immersion. Graphically this game is beautiful despite all the nay-sayers are saying how this seems dated which on the ground it does but its really gorgeous up in the skies of vietnam while you're chasing screaming Migs. \n\nAnother small thing that bothers me too is during helicopter gameplay your seated in the Co-Pilot seat of lets say the Hueys and Chinooks when in reality they should of had you sitting in the actual pilot seat.\n\nThese are just some of the things that popped at me with my short time of playing this but I'm going to enjoy it nonetheless.\n\nIf you are on the fence about picking this title up my best advice is to wait for it to be on sale instead of paying full price since you don't have too much to loose.", "timestamp_updated": 1389549362, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1389549362, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "22223798", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1459707315, "steamid": "76561198011226273", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A terrible game.
