Far cry 3 - blood dragon is a single player FPS set in the post apocalyptic future of 2007 and is primarily a love letter to 80's action movie tropes. It's presented as if it were an 80's game  and the in game pickups and menus are full of cultural references. It is a far cry game so the usual far cry systems are in play, spreading fire, stealth take-downs, a (cyber)bow and manic first person cross country driving. There is a scene at the very end of the game where Rex is riding an AI enhanced T-rex with some kind of special gun and the T-rex is chatting away all the while (I like shooting my lasers! Do you like riding me? etc) and then quips \"this is funny and sad\" and it hit me that's the game in a nutshell. While I enjoyed the cut-scenes (except for the cringy sex scene) and the characters something is a little off with Rex himself. It's like he's partially brain damaged or has some other kind of mental handicap. It's funny but then I feel bad for laughing. Blood dragon is a very cool and well realized experience with the game not overstaying it's welcome and the map being fairly modest but well designed. \n\nGood\n-the 80's aesthetic is fun and well thought out\n-classic far cry gameplay\n-cyber everything! neon snakes, laser sharks and robotic cassowarys abound! Why is not so apparent but whatever...\n\nBad\n-It feels like the characters in the game are taking advantage of simple rex and his destructive prowess. Probably laughing at him behind his back. It's so weird, and you get reminded of it every time your character talks\n-Ubisoft collectathon, nuff said\n-Uplay. Ubisoft why must you push your universally disliked trashware platform at us? Why do you make good games but bad decisions? \n-Uplay. seriously, Uplay can die in a fire \n-The color palate is pretty garish after a while\n\nAll in all as a stand alone expansion Far cry 3 - blood dragon does a lot of things right. The setting and characters are fun, the map is full of stuff to do, the upgrades are sensible (although far too many optional stealth missions for my taste) and it's over before you know it and before you get bored. 5/5 lots of fun", "timestamp_updated": 1506041035, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506041035, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35457086", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507065475, "steamid": "76561198007428578", "num_games_owned": 1037, "num_reviews": 167, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 452}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "TL:DR Blood Dragon has cheesy lines, training montages, plenty of explosions and giant reptiles that shoot lasers from their eyes. It's a great example of the right way to do a DLC exansion.\n\nFull Version:\nBlood Dragon is a good example of how DLC should be done. Rather than go for a generic DLC for Far Cry 3 they said fuck it and created this over the top, off the wall parody of 80's action and sci fi movies like Escape from New York and Terminator. \n\nIt's clear the devs wanted to just create something thats fun and give the player loads of oppurtunity to blow shit up. From the explosive heavy missions, weapon upgrades such as explosive sniper bullets and burning shotgun shells and of course the Blood Dragons themselves. Who wouldn't love a giant reptile that shoots lasers from its eyes? This DLC provides a lot of fun in the 7-8 hours it takes to play through it. \n\nThe game also looks great with the island its set in full of Tron like buildings and enemies and loads of neon. The soundtrack is great too and really complements the game beautifully. \n\nOverall this is a great standalone DLC and even if you weren't a fan of Far Cry 3 its different and more slimlined action heavy gameplay means this might still be worth playing.", "timestamp_updated": 1507066302, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507066283, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34888049", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505154690, "steamid": "76561198078709147", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "When you have to install it twice just to play it (download through steam then uplay)\nNo thanks.", "timestamp_updated": 1505154830, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505154830, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35074356", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506117152, "steamid": "76561198188666151", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Sounds like it may be a good game.......if I could actualy play it. \"GAME UNAVAILABLE\"\nWTF Uplay?\n Don't waste your time.", "timestamp_updated": 1505865650, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505865364, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35001587", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502190", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505583431, "steamid": "76561197991658654", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Got really stoked on playing this game again.
