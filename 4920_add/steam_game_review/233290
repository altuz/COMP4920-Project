Worth the money! I was just lucky to get it on sale - 75% off.\nI think the story was too short. Obviously if you would like to discover all 100% will be a bit longer but I did most of them as well.\nAbout game? I can say is something worth to play after games like: The last of us, The heavy rain or Beyond: Two Souls. I know all of them are on PS4 but luckily we have something on PC like that.\nI rally enjoyed to play this game. I didn't really want to buy it as I don't really like horror games. But this one has a climate! Not really scary, everything is about to resolve your death! I was amazed about story and the powers you had. Game is very easy and interesting. It keeps you thinking what it is all about. I didn't expect ending like that, I was thinking will be something more about this all staff. Anyway, I did enjoy a game.\nI think my score will be... 8.5 over 10.\nGame is really good.

Lots of sleuthing and clue-finding along the way keep you occupied for the 8 to 10 hours it will take you to finish this game.\n\nRonan has been murdered (gasp! spoiler, but you knew that already) and he has to piece together what has happened and why he has been caught up in this past-meets-present mish-mash of mayhem in creepy ol' Salem, Mass.  The streets are filled with spooky ghostly spectres, and you're constantly tasked with finding the next clue to what happened to you. You also have to solve the case of the Bell Killer, as well, and find some missing persons. As sidequests, you have to help the dearly departed gain some closure and help them move on in the afterlife. You're part medium, part detective, and part ghost... live a little! \n\nIt's worth fighting the slightly wonky controls to get clues to appear, and there's very little combat (except for some frequent quick-time-events later in the game; there is also an .ini hack to prevent those from becoming tedious).\n\nVery good game: the story (except for the ending) is interesting, the atmosphere is loads of creepiness, and there is way more sleuthing than slashing.
