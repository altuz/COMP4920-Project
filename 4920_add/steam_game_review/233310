I have played hundreds of CRPG's over the past 20+ years, on dozens of different consoles and this game really \"did it\" for me. Avadon 2 is no \"Divinity Original Sin\" but I still enjoyed it nearly as much, the game is a blast if not a little rough around the edges like me.\n\n Avadon 2 is a rather large CRPG, is has a deep and intricate storyline which I found pretty original among CRPG's. Avadon 2 has wonderful \"original in style\" character creation, character building systems and the game even has some secrets ??? : ). It has challenging combat which scales greatly depending what difficulty you chose and which takes place using a Grid Based, Turn Based, Action Point combat system. The combat in Avadon 2 feels very similar to the combat in the early Fallout games (1&2)  but the fixed viewpoint is a little more Roguelike in nature. As I eluded to with the secrets comment earlier, exploration in Avadon is fun and there are fights, loot and secrets to be found by the patient and meticulous types of players.\n\nI should warn people who are new to this series, that games like Avadon and Avernum are not for everyone. If you are the type of gamer that expects an RPG to hold your hand the entire time and to essentially function more like an interactive graphic, choose your own advernture novel, this game is going to send you to bed without supper and you will be crying angry tears as you lay awake. I could best describe the tutorial aspects combined with how rapidly the difficulty scales and fluctuates in Avadon as \"raw & brutish\" but the challenge makes the game super fun. All Avadon and Avernum titles are created with the assumption that those who play the games are not only good at reading, but that they enjoy reading.\n\nSo to wrap this review up, I totally recommend buying this game as long as you read my warnings and are still curious. It is worth the full asking price, but you may feel a little better if you got it on sale. The combination of size and detail make this game a decent time sink, so be prepared for some fun, gritty CRPG gameplay and make sure to go into it with and open mind and a sharp eye.", "timestamp_updated": 1505309783, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505309783, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 54, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 65}}
