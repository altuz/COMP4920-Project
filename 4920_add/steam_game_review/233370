Graphics are 3D and quite mediocre, the world, levels, musics and dialogues are really casual and forgettable, the only interesting thing is the plot and the 3 acts staging of it. The game is even not flawless bug wise, as characters and dialogues may sometimes glitch...\n\nPut on all of this the corny and unfashionable taste of the German style (sorry guys! but you are the proud makers of \"games\" like Construction Simulator or Roadside Assistance Simulator...) and you get a very mediocre point and click game, and yet if you play it casually especially with a non gamer partner it can be enjoyable for its Agatha Christie-ish plot...\n\nI do recommend!... on sale ;)", "timestamp_updated": 1499603967, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499603967, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33573903", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496224", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1380050310, "steamid": "76561197989615868", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I knew the ending from the %99 it was soooo guessable.", "timestamp_updated": 1500167701, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500167701, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "34139919", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496116", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1393134203, "steamid": "76561197999066424", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A part of me would like to give this game a second chance but then the memory of the first puzzle comes rushing back to me.
