There's countries in the world where people are thrown off buildings for lesser \"crimes\". \n\n   Now that those unpleasantries are out of the way, I'll review the quality of the actual product on sale here. First up, it's a mobile app which doesn't appear to go full screen, so getting used to the somewhat \"windowed\" presentation is a bit of a pain. It also doesn't \"save\" or \"bookmark\" the last page you were at, meaning you have to remember this for yourself, then use the Contents page to fast-track back to it. Not exactly ideal. \n\n   There's some novel interactive touches, like polls which feed back instant internet-based survey results, and photos you can pan around 360 degrees; a spirit of innovation which is regrettably sullied by the videos which lazily link out to YouTube, meaning you'd better have some extra bandwidth up your sleeve if you wanna get the full experience.\n\n   This said, the content is nice enough, and of evident interest to anyone who either adored the game or plans on making games of their own. Is it worth two bucks? Guess so. Half that price on sale, easy. Though the more penny-pinching among you could probably save yourself the money by just Googling and Youtubing much the same information. For the rest of us who don't mind paying a small price for the quasi-convenience of it all, it's a nice enough package, if quite a ways from \"essential\".\n\nVerdict: 6/10.", "timestamp_updated": 1497449002, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497448727, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 42, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 46}}
