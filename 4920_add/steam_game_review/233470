The game starts out with such potential with the constantly evolving graphics, cheeky pokes at old game design, and old game references. Unfortunately, the entire game I was waiting for something resembling a plot or something interesting to happen beyond \"fullfill this extremely generic questline based on video game references and nothing of entertainment value.\" On top of that, the game mechanics are bland with puzzles that can barely be called as such and multiple different fighting styles that all are terribly thought out. I couldn't bring myself to complete the game because I got so bored trying to find all the stars.\n\nOverall: Good idea; poor execution.
