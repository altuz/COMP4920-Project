Lunnye Devitsy boasts a great deal of atmosphere and many different paths to take... eventually. Until you find all the necessary 'powerups' to properly explore, though, there are relatively few paths you can take, and some of these are dead ends with no escape. This, combined with a labyrinthian world to explore, can make early progress frustrating if you aren't very good at picking out different paths through the overwhelming particle effects and sometimes washed-out graphics. Which I at least, was not, resulting in getting stuck in the same dang place several times. Since there seems to be no ingame restart feature, quitting and restarting can be the only way to get out of some of these traps.\n\nOnce you find the double jump, though, the game is so much less frustrating and exploration so much more engaging that it boggles the mind a bit that it wasn't implemented right out of the gate (right when you drop off of the moon?). Immediately more paths are open to you and those traps are less common. That you can miss this entirely for the first part of the game if you go the wrong way- and the game offers no hints of which direction to head- is a confusing choice. So, head right first, is my advice. Your salvation is in the forest.\n\nThe game does save what collectibles you find along the way, though, which is helpful in decreasing frustration. The controls are simple enough, the alien is a little floaty and can get difficult to land precisely, and nothing aside from dead ends are a threat, so explore and enjoy the music. Even falling (or in my case, purposefully flinging myself) off the world is only a minor incovenience.\n\nNormally I'm inclined to give higher ranking to games with an interesting visual presence; I love my shinies. At first glance, Lunnye Devitsy does seem to have this in spades. The stark, sharp black landscapes and flashes of color are gorgeous, but the particle effects and glow of some of the areas makes things difficult to see at times. It could've been toned down just a bit and would've improved the atmosphere they were going for. The wind and water effects and sounds are very cool, though a little too loud for the rest of the soundtrack.\n\nSo, as a casual exploration platformer, it doesn't offer too much new or different.

The premise is very simple - you are a little alien that drops off the moon and you need to find your way back. The gameplay is 2D platform style, and involves exploring a huge floating mountain trying to find 6 different ways to return to the moon at the top of the map. The game offers very little instruction, tasking you with figuring out everything on your own. None of the tasks are overly difficult, but some require thorough exploration, experimentation and deduction. Overall, the vibe of the game is very laid back and mysterious, which is probably its best aspect. I love that there's a game out there in 2013 that offers no explanations and just wants you to explore and figure stuff out on your own. It reminds me of the good old days, playing the original Zelda and Metroid for the first time. Playing a game with a sense of mystery and no hand-holding is a rarity now, and I guess that's what I like about this one so much. It's probably not for everyone, though. At its core, this is a fairly casual game (though it does get surprisingly difficult at the very end) and it doesn't last too long. Also, I am well aware that some people probably won't appreciate the lack if direction/instruction as much as I do.

The game had nice spare looking style and sound.\n\nThe goal in the game is to return to the moon in a few different ways. The first few puzzles were extremely simple (for one of them you just wait in a post office and the mailman delivers you to the moon), but then a majority of them ended up being exercises in tedium.\n\nLunnye Devitsy is lacking. It has open world that is not interesting and stops being mysterious fairly early on. Sometimes messing up means having to trek back and forth between the boring areas. The controls and character are also a bit finicky and take more maneuvering than I think should be required. There are also puzzles that are all about guess work rather than puzzle solving (a completely blind maze, and then cannons take brute trial and error). And the \"organic\" aspects just got on my nerves:  you can edit a text file to turn post processing on and off, you can enter full screen with \"F\" and you can't pause or change any other options.\n\nThis isn't a terrible game, it's just a game with terrible pacing and some poor choices. Its not even that this game is challenging on a puzzle or platforming level, because it's really not. It is quite simple, and, aside from the mentioned nuisances, the platforming is easy.

Now if you're looking for a story that tells you every single piece of the puzzle, you're not going to find that in this title, but you will have to go looking for them. See, one day, a little Moon Maiden, our heroine of the story, falls off the moon! On a normal day this would seem like a serious misfortune, but our little friend never fears, because throughout the bizarre world below there just so happens to be several helpful ways of getting back home. With helping a geologist find his moon marbles, a scientist to build a rocket and blastoff, a relay station to get its message out, discovering that gravity has some very \"loopy\" consequences, finding a springboard with some astonishing power, or having the postman make a very long-distance delivery, getting home has never been such an adventure! Even more so, because once you've made it home all those ways, you'll discover a magma monster has lost all his pocket change and once you've collected it for him, he'll give you quite a lift. \n\nLunnye Devitsy puts wonder, entertainment, and, of course, that good old feeling of accomplishing something so much bigger than you in the genre of platformers. There's mystery, a few scares, and a good bunch of cursing involved for everyone. It's the journey home that makes Lunnye Devitsy such a fantastic title to add to your Steam Library.

Yeah, this is one of those games (along with Wake) that you kinda are willing to spend money on just because you can. \"Ah, I got like 5 bucks left... Can't really buy anything. I guess I'll just take this...\"\n\nAt first I was intrigued and relaxed. But upon only finding half of the ways to get to the moon, the game because so boring, I had to quit in order to save some sanity. So, I got a better computer and played this on it as one of the first games to test its intensity of RAM (since it lagged like crazy on my laptop). So yes, I gave it a second go. Appearently, it was not my laptop...\n\nThe game was just so SLOW paced that you can't get anywhere in a decent time. The level design along with the slow paced gameplay makes finding all the endings take probably more than several days. That's just not how to design a game. I explored every area and got two powerups, then there was nothing to do, so I stopped. For good. I will never come back to this game because I'm one of those people who want to experience everything for themselves. If you tell me what powerup you get in a game, that will suddenly render the game unplayable for me, because I want everything to be exciting, new, and not spoiled.\n\nI don't like writing down rates for games that are pretty good, but really, this belongs on a flash website. It's one of those flash games that you really shouldn't spend money on. Not because it's short or anything, but just the amount of enjoyment you'll get out of it. Again, it's soooo boooring. I understand it's supposed to be atmospheric, and it was. But after about halfway through the game, you just simply cannot find any ways back to the moon, no more upgrades, and literally nothing to do.\n\nCall me biased because I didn't technically complete the game, but a human being cannot go through so much loss of sanity by playing a game like this. Again, it's \"okay\" but the pace is way too slow, goal way too indirect, and progression even worse so.\n\n\n\nI don't know what else to say for this other than to save your money. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm one of those people that would rather spend on a game I end up disliking due to genre or whatever rather than a game I just end up not enjoying because of its experience.

There are many ways to get to the moon. One way to get to the moon per the game is immediately next to the place you land after falling from the moon. What I mean is you can beat the game (one of the ways) within seconds after you begin to play.Also, the game is buggy. Mostly that it won't play on most computers. It plays very slow, even on really fast machines. Not sure why, considering it's a simple 2D game, although with much post effects. No way to turn off these effects without editing the .ini in the game. I had to turn off post effects and was unable to play full screen without getting lag. The lag is so bad, and at first you'll think that's how slow the game is because you'll wonder why it'd lag on such a simple short game.Things that cheapen the game are seemingly unfinished portions of the game. For instance there's a rocket ship connected to the flying island you land on. You jump at it, and it has no landing area, it's simply a flat 2D no design piece of real estate... you fall through it all the way past the map, and then you fly upwards. Why? This makes no sense... maybe if you landed in the spacecraft and it took off... not sure. Incredibly odd and not in an artistic way.Also, there are puzzles to solve to take you back to the moon, and the presentation of these puzzles aren't the most appealing, the eye is drawn to the puzzles.

By that I mean I will play anything that gives me a wide open world to explore, and doesn't make it too onerous to explore. Platformers usually do exploration the metroidvania route, but there are a few quality indie games that just let you run freely around their world. Lunnye Devitsy happens to be one of those, a relaxed platformer in the vein of Knytt but without the sort of sprawl that really defines those games.\n\nThe only story you're going to get is that you're a tiny alien who fell off his tiny planet and onto a great big mountain. You want to get home, and as it turns out there are six wholly different and pretty entertaining ways to do that. But you'll have to find them and piece together a few puzzles to make them work. Some are as simple as jumping on a springboard, some are as complex as building a rocket, and some defy any sort of logic whatsoever.\n\nYou can run and you can jump, and that's all you need to start unraveling Lunnye Devitsy's secrets. The running takes a little getting used to, since you have to build up momentum before you really get going, but there's plenty of space to practice your sprinting. You also can't die here, which takes any possible edge off the game. Anything that looks lethal most assuredly is not, and falling off the screen just wraps you around to the other side.\n\nIt's not hard to sink a few hours into this one trying to divine its secrets, but without any sort of character progression, collectibles, or story, it's also not hard to get bored quickly. I certainly appreciate it for its stark, otherworldly atmosphere and simple exploration, but not enough to suss out all the endings. Still, I got a bunch of them and thoroughly enjoyed my time working them out across the charming alien landscape. If you're looking for something light to while away a few hours in, you could do far worse.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

You're then forced to use an faq to finish the game, because while some of the challenges are doable if you're lucky enough to find the powerups before falling down a hole you can't escape from, the last few areas are difficult for the sake of being hateful- have a look at the excellent steam community guide for this game (by noibn) if you don't believe me. Then once you finish, there is no acknowledgment that the game is finished- just puts you back to the starting position until you hit alt+f4 a few hours overdue.\n\nIt's unfun, uninteresting, and feels unfinished- the hidden credit in the game for the person who did \"quality assurance\" is strictly ironic.

It's a nice little platform-puzzler, especially for the Lunar pack price.\n\nEnjoyable if: \n\n-You like games with very little guidance--there's no tutorial and there are no hints or clues.\n-You like games with an atmospheric story rather than a written or spoken dialogue (there are only a few symbols, no text, as far as I've played)\n-You like games where you can find your own way\n-You like pixel art.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you prefer games with lots of hints, levels, and a clear game trajectory, this is probably not a game you'll enjoy.\n\nSmall drawbacks: There's no way (that I've discovered) to restart the game if you get stuck in certain areas of the game, other than quitting and restarting the game.  This is only a real problem at the beginning, though, before discovering moves like the double jump.  As progress in the game is saved, this is only a minor annoyance. Also, occasionally the various filters are a bit much.\n\nOverall: 8/10", "timestamp_updated": 1396440835, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1396440835, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 37, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 20, "total_reviews": 57}}
