Yes, the gameplay is... whatever, but this is a piece of art. 2hrs of nice play, quite short, but as a one-man-job it\u2019s kind incredible. I have comparable feelings when playing AW as I have when watching Blade Runner. These are artworks that made history of modern audivisual art and who played them 25 years ago will enjoy fantastic feelings", "timestamp_updated": 1506156090, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506156090, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34781970", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1451668757, "steamid": "76561198025286003", "num_games_owned": 481, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is an art pieace that as art is more timeless then the game play. Will I ever truly get the same feeling of accomplishment my father did 15 years ago going mad beating this game without a guide? No, we have guides online and the game has more save points, wich is fine. It's still a tough game overall, but it's diffculuty seems to be all over the place, but it fits the atmosphere of the game regardless. This game stands alone in so many ways, it's a side scroller, but from there it really can't be pinned down to hard.
