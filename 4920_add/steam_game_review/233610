[i]Distance[/i] requires that the player holds the boost button at all times. The only time the player ever lets go of the boost button is when the car is about to blow up. This only ever occurs in the short moments before reaching the next checkpoint.\nVery little thought goes into using boost, the player rarely has to manage the mechanic in a smart way and it's mandatory to use boost at all times. It also feels boring to drive without boost. Furthermore, you're only ever going to drive around without boost if you've collided and had to restart at the most recent checkpoint, as the game doesn't refill boost completely after a reset. Boost feels mostly meaningless and really only serves to make the player hold down another button.\n\n2. [i]Distance[/i] does a poor job of indicating when certain mechanics are not available for use. There are segments where you might like to fly, only to discover that flying is disabled for that segment. Not being able to fly when you think you are usually leads to crashing the car, which leads to having to reset which gives you a good reason to just restart the entire race. The only time you're not going to restart a race is when you're initially learning the layout of a track.\n\n3. The single player levels do a great job of making you play with all of the various mechanics that the game offers, such as wall riding, driving upside down, jumping over obstacles and so on. However, the developer created levels are mostly completely linear and don't really offer a very exciting racing experience. [i]Distance[/i] does a great job of challenging the player from a mechanical standpoint, but the level design never branches out beyond the linear design of straight-forward on-rails driving. In [i]Distance[/i] the variety in levels comes from rearranging the mechanics that [i]Distance[/i] offers such as flying, jumping, riding walls and so on rather than offering track layouts and design that vary greatly. It's like the levels are a deck of cards that are endlessly shuffled around. But it's still the same deck of cards.\n\n4. Visibility issues place emphasis on memorizing certain track segments. The roads are see through and often end in such a way that you're caught unaware and drive straight off a ledge. The first time you drive off a ledge you reset and push through to plot out the rest of the level. Now that you know the layout you restart the entire race for the gold medal.\n\n[i]Distance[/i] is a pretty game, but also suffers from poor visibility. When you can't see what's coming up ahead you often crash. On the first playthrough of a level you spend your time memorizing the layout. Once that's done you then go back to get the gold medal. I didn't find much challenge in this. Rather I felt like a rat in a maze.\n\n\nThere are some pros to [i]Distance[/i].\nThe controls are highly precise and the game runs well. The game handles well and at no times did the game feel unresponsive or sluggish. The racing elements are well done but end up being restricted by other elements of the game's design.\n[i]Distance[/i] did succeed in entertaining me for about an hour, but ultimately feels like a high end usermade modification that I'd expect to play for free inside another title rather than a standalone title going for the current asking price of US $20.", "timestamp_updated": 1504694668, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504693824, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "35191088", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500040", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506337132, "steamid": "76561198174023730", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 95}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Woah, this game is really pumped up, I like it.\nPretty intense.", "timestamp_updated": 1506287932, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506287932, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35404283", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500040", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507039305, "steamid": "76561198065275459", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 222}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is extremly amazing.

Keyboard controls are sorta mushy until you turn off digital input smoothing and ramp up control sensitivity, menu animations just need to stay turned off for everything ever made at all times THANK YOU, and for whatever reason they changed the key for wing deployment.  While we're at it let's just turn off \"Flight Landing Assist\" because autopilot is for the weak.  After that, you're back in control, and the game becomes super fun.  \n\nThe game is still fun with all of this stuff stuck at default, but it WILL screw you over in tight, technical strings of precise maneuvers.\n\nIt is an indisputable step forward for the franchise.  Everything is more polished.  Everything is smoother.  Meaningful features have been added and implemented thoughtfully.  Meaningless features are nowhere to be found.  This is how sequels are DONE.\n\nSo what if you haven't played Nitronic Rush?  The music and sound design are superb, and it has very good, and fairly challenging track layouts.  The tracks are a good deal denser and more furious than just about any racing game I've played, F-Zero GX notwithstanding.\n\nIt falls squarely into a difficulty I like to call meditative.  Nitronic rush was similar in this regard.  It's not insufferably boring everywhere but the corners like Gran Turismo, and it isn't way up there in the unbridled and unrelenting insanity that F-Zero GX revels in.  It chooses a path where you must always remain focused, but never trespasses into mental fatigue.\n\nThe best advice I can give for you to determine whether or not you like it is for you to play Nitronic Rush all the way through, once, then peruse the hardcore levels a few times.
