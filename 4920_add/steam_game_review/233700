I would recommend anyone who is interested in this to go play Nethack, Binding of Isaac, FTL, and Spelunky.   If you play those games and you like them, welcome to Sword of the Stars. \n\nThere's however a reason I recommend those games before playing this.  The sad truth is each of those is a better game than Sword of the Stars: The Pit.   At the same time, those games will prepare you for what you're going to find in Sword of the Stars. \n\nThis is a true roguelike, there's only two things that really persists through the game, and that's marginally useful.  The first persistance is messages, as you play the game you can hack computers and read messages, decrypting them.  Often times you'll decrypt more and more as you go, so you might need to decrypt one message multiple times to get the full understanding.  \n\nThe second, you'll keep recipes around.  That can be a positive or a negative, but personally I don't think it fully violates \"Roguelikes\" it doesn't make a huge difference if you keep that knowledge in a book next to the computer or in the game. \n\nEVERYTHING ELSE goes away.  Knowledge of items, knowledge of weapons, skills, and more all reset EVERY TIME you die.  There's not even a \"not hardcore mode\" option.  You play this game one way, and while there's four difficulties, none of them remove the rules of roguelikes. \n\nIn fact easy is still pretty difficult after a while, and that's due to my big complaint about Sword of the Stars.  The game really doesn't give you very playable maps.  Now for sure I'm probably playing the levels wrong, or just getting hurt too much, but I feel once the enemies have \"Acid\" and you meet the big slimes, the game just becomes more annoying than difficult.  Yes there's probably ways around these enemies, but they will eat your weapon durability FAST, and before long, you'll be weaponless.  In fact in my two easy playthroughs, I died once because I didn't know diesease could kill you (and I was knocked unconscious) and the other time I was at level 17, and I had no weapons.  I in fact hadn't seen a new weapon in a few levels.  \n\nThere's a thin line between brutally hard (nethack, Demon souls, and pretty much all Roguelikes) and unfairly hard (sword of the stars, Teenage mutant Ninja turtles on the NES, Battletoads.)  And yes, I put Sword of the Stars in that later category.    \n\nWhile that's the biggest problem I have with the game (that often the game feels like it's impossible to win), there's another point which just pissed me off.  When you make a move, you wait for the enemies to move, and often times that means waiting seconds to multiple seconds.   The issue here is that if you walk down a hallway often times you'll know an enemy is nearby just because the game takes a while to process the enemy's move.  Also when you get a nice flow going, the enemy's move tends to take a lot longer than your attacks.   I can't really explain it, but it's VERY frustrating and breaks the immersion.  A shame because I really like this game in a lot of ways, but god that delay on enemy moves is VERY harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, I recommend this game with the caveat that this might be too hard to really be fun, and can be quite annoying, but if you really want a roguelike game, neither of those issues might bother you.  While I gave up, I think I can safely say that with some more time and energy, I might have had a better run.  The real problem is I didn't want to spend another 2-3 hours trying to get down to level 15 or level 20 only to have a few moments of bad luck to ruin a run.  While that's true of many Roguelikes, I just feel this one might just be too brutally hard that it wasn't fun for me any more.   A shame because it is nice to see roguelikes are still strong.  It's just not exactly what I want in a roguelike.", "timestamp_updated": 1504660574, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504660574, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 536, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 87, "total_reviews": 623}}
