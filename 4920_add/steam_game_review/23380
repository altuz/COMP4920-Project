I think it's probably petering off now, but match 3 games were everywhere a few years back and more and more kept popping up. Gyromancer was another trying to cash in on tht craze, following in the limelight of stuff like Puzzle Quest. I remember back when Tetris and Columns were revolutionary. Now the market is oversaturated, and stuff like Gyromancer is just kinda dull. If match 3 kinda games are your heroin, you might want to check Gyromancer out, but otherwise, it's just that sort of game, and doesn't really offer anything great or worth your time, in my opinion."}]}
