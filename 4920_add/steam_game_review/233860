It took some time but I began to build a party. We quickly became thieves with decent combat performance and eventually, we became a town. From a mere group of 5 petty thieves stealing gear and food just to get by, to a small self-sufficient town with farmers, cooks, smiths and other workers, I have risen from the ground up.\n\nI made a squad specifically for combat consisting of 7 people to take on dangerous tasks. \n\nTengu, Lynn (formerly known as Fish), and Streak are the backbone and muscle of the squad. I had recruited the 3 of them at the same time in a bar and since then, they've been inseperable battle sisters. \n\nThen there was Hamut and Garr. One volunteered to come with me, and the other was one of my town's former builders whose combat stats I felt were wasted staying in the outpost. Both had decent thievery skills.\n\nThe sixth is a Shek woman known as Set. She was an escaped slave who attacked us on our way back to the outpost. After convincing her, she now runs around with us as a combat medic.\n\nFInally there was I, Davkes, their squad leader with stats above the rest. \n\nTogether we called ourselves the Vanguard and we thought ourselves invincible. No passing patrol or beast could kill us or knock us out without being annihilated in their futile attempt.\n\nOne day, as the Vanguard returned to the outpost with weapons from an ancient armory, a man dressed in simple clothing came up to me. His name was Thumper and he came looking for us to join our ranks.\n\nI was hesitant at first because he seemed weak and I didn't really have a need for another mouth to feed. Nonetheless, I reluctantly said yes and made him our second medic in the Vanguard. I gave him what spare armor I could and one of our recently looted weapons. Now there was 8 of us.\n\nAt first, he moved and fought slowly due to the heavy armor, and a blunt weapon to fit his best weapon stat. It was almost laughable as he swung that thing over his head in vain effort. As a field medic though, Thumper performed his duty well. He kept the combat squad alive time and time again even in the most perilous and dire treks. \n\nHe spent many nights under the nightsky around the campfire with the others as they healed in the camping beds he had carried along. After countless battles with bandits, guards, slavers, and beasts alike, he was now able to hold his own and keep up with the squad. \n\nSoon, we had explored every ancient building there was to see in the South and Southwest side of the map. Everyone had new gear and our workstations were upgraded as a result. Yet, our outpost was in need of more research resources and so we started exploring further North, away from the safety of our home.\n\nWe began exploring through Hiver territory, Holy Lands, and the Fog to reach locations we had learned from previous ruins. Each time, we returned with many riches of the ancients but it was never enough.\n\nOne day, we went further North than ever before and encountered a sizable group of berserkers. After suffering moderate injuries and fighting them off, we kept going only to be ambushed by a group of cannibals. Now our injuries were beginning to show as Tengu and Set were knocked out during the battle and we needed to find a place to rest.\n\nAlong the way, Thumper had fallen slightly behind everyone else. It was at this moment, while we all looked away, another group of cannibals knocked him out, took him away toward their village and locked him in a bloody cage. We gave chase, but our broken bodies and heavy armor kept us from catching up to the wicked flesh-eating assailants before they got there. Fearful thoughts engulfed our minds. \n\nDespite our injuries, we did not stop. We couldn't. We charged toward their village with weapons in hand, and rage in our hearts. As we approached, one of the savages were beating Thumper in his cage. He screamed and wailed with each whack at him. My emotions were now a mix of anger, disgust, and sorrow. Their village came out to meet us and we fought. Without any mercy, we swiftly wiped out the village, freed Thumper, and patched him up; but something was wrong..\n\nThumper was dying. His blood levels were dropping despite Set's healing. Our poor friend is now bleeding to death and it seems he left the camping beds back at the outpost.. Now we were desperate to find a town but we knew where nothing was in this new land. Every place we went was just a cannibal infested hellhole. \n\nAfter running throughout the night fighting cannibals and bandits looking for a place, we came across an old village of rubble and dirt. We went inside what looked like an old Orkan church. I checked the map to see how far the nearest friendly town was. His blood levels were already too low. He wouldn't make the trip. There was no chance of saving him anymore..\n\nI told Tengu, Lynn, and Streak to guard the door. Garr and Hamut stood behind Set and I. We laid Thumper on the floor of the ruined church, and took off his and our helmets. Our youngest member would die minutes later. \n\nI took back the Edge 3 blunt weapon I gave him originally, and Set took his medical supplies. I put him in the back of the church ruin so the cannibals and bandits won't find him. In respect to him, I left him with his full specialist grade Samurai Armor and his secondary katana as well as one food ration to acknowledge he will forever be one of us. \n\nNow we're back to 7 squad members.. \n\nWe called ourselves the Vanguard.. \n\nand we thought ourselves invincible.. \n\nRIP Thumper \n\n10/10 Would wrench my heart out again.", "timestamp_updated": 1505103809, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505103809, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35029795", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510918", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505752131, "steamid": "76561197996681211", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Kenshi is a very nieche Game that surely is not for everyone. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of classical Sandbox-MMORPG's - even though it is lacking multiplayer it has the deep crafting, the absolute freedom and quite a bit of character customization and developement. It very much is an RPG, it is less of an RTS as the pictures might suggest.\n\nFans of Star Wars Galaxies, such as myself, may find themself reminded of that game when they step into the vast world this Game has to offer.\n\nI first read about this game when it was very early alpha and it was nothing but a squad management game with nothing much to it. Yet still the game managed to keep me interested by its very unique concept and style of genre.\n\nFor an \"early access\" title by an indie dev team it is running fairly stable. It lacks some optimization but if you look into it a little you can fix most FPS issues yourself (by downloading texture optimization-mods or fiddling with the settings for a bit)\n\nIt is highly encouraged to run it as experimental (by opting into the beta experiences) as you will miss out on regular hotfixes if you do not.\n\nAll in all the graphics are nothing to be amazed by, even though I personally think it still manages to deliver beautiful scenes every now and then - a lot of graphics are notable placeholders aswell and will probably be enhanced later on.\n\nThe Game has a lot of bugs, but nothing is really gamebreaking and In 40 Hours playtime I have yet to run into anything that really annoys me.\n\nMods _really_ help customize your game experience. There is tons of potential in mod support, even though the possibilities are still limited - the devs plan to expand upon this (afaik)\n\nIf you are looking for a challenging and interesting new World to explore and dive into in a type of game that you probably have not seen done yet, give Kenshi a try. Its definitely worth the 15\u20ac it costs at the time of this review.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1505671742, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505671742, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34852348", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504578919, "steamid": "76561198050552896", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Worth buying.

Never have I seen such a perfect blend of different genres and gameplay variations, smoothly mixed into this little gem. Because this game is still in development, there is nothing bad that I can say about the game, because the only issues are bugs here and there, but nothing that makes the game unplayable. What I want to do is make a list of what makes this game great and try to hit on as many points as I can. Here goes!\n\n1. Theme - This game is a combination of a few different themes that I think is not only brilliant, but also personally appeals to my interests. The fact that there is a heavy Samurai/Edo Japan undertone, yet set in a Dystopian, seemingly post-apocalyptic world, that's full of its own issues such as slavery, racism, oppression, desperation... The developers made it so that player FEELS what is going on in the universe. \n\n2. Music - The Soundtrack is beautiful. It's got a Sukiyaki (Japanese for spaghetti) Western feel to it. A most excellent mixture of Ol' western music with a twang of Samurai really sets the mood for the desert wasteland.\n\n3. Gameplay Variations - It's like a medley of The Sims, Total War: Shogun 2, Diablo, Empire Earth, Elder Scrolls/Fallout (and probably some other things that I'm forgetting). You can literally play this game any way that you want. Want to start out with a band of followers and build a city? Done. Want to be a lone wandering samurai out to make his way in the world? Done. Free slaves? Fight cannibals? War nations? Become a thief or assassin? Or perhaps a band of nomads or traders? The possibilities are endless. Not to mention that there's a Steam Workshop, with players constantly making mods, as well as the ability to create your own easily with the editor tool.\n\n4. Storyline - You make your own. You do what you want. If you're not careful, your story will be over quickly (Especially when choosing the \"Cannibal Hunters\" beginning!). Right away I was motivated to record a playthrough series for YouTube just because of how much the game allows for creating such interesting plot lines. (My Latest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB9osoqt4cc&t=3s )\n\n5. Aesthetics - The Customization is pretty in depth. I'll admit, the character model graphics are not phenomenal, but for what they lack in that, they make up for in the wide range that you can customize your characters. Most characters that you can recruit into you party you are able to customize their appearance and change their name. Want to base your faction of you gaming clan by naming all of your characters after your buddies' usernames? You can do it. It really has a Sims aspect to it. Not only physical customization, but also the wide range of clothing, armor, weapons... The amount of outfit combinations are seemingly endless. You could make your whole squad look like ninja or samurai or warriors or mercenaries or monks, or a combination of all of those things, plus more!\n\nI would definitely recommend this game. Even the learning curve is not very steep. There is a tutorial option that gives you guidelines early on, but I've found the best way to learn quickly is to watch playthrough videos or read the discussion forums for the game here on Steam. 10/10, even in its current state.", "timestamp_updated": 1506922886, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506922886, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34845741", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505396", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505628356, "steamid": "76561198019683272", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've owned this game for quite a while now (more than a year I believe), and I have to say that I love what this game is doing.

I book it towards Shark, hoping that the guards there will help a little (they didn't). Manage to get inside the bar, though, and a band of mercenaries jumps on them. I begin to loot the spiders, doing my civic duty of ensuring those fuckers don't get up again, and suddenly one pops up through the floor, and rips my face off. I fall over, and it begins eating me at the doorway of the bar as everyone sits and watches. Finally, someone jostles a little bit, getting the spider's attention, and the mercenaries again descend upon it, killing it. At this point, though, I'm in critical condition, and my village is too far away for anyone to make it in time. Still, I persevere, and hope that a good Samaritan will come along and lock me up or enslave me or something.

It feels like it was a long time ago when I bought this game and I have to say it has changed so much and I'm really proud of how far it's come. I remember back when there was nothing but a HUGE desert with bandits all over the place. I used to lure bandits to guards and if a bandit had a bounty I would heal him/her up take all his stuff and turn him into the police for a reward Hehehe.\n\nBack then it was crazy hard to get skills up that you had to turn on block or whatever it was back then to get your defence skill up so when you fought in combat so you didn't die straight away. I don't really think you needed to eat back then either so it was pretty easy, Building was in the game though which was fun. \n\nAnyway the game is pretty much one of the best on the market and I really think you should get it, I would advise watching some videos first if your unsure about what your getting into here as I've had 6 Hour sessions with this game before O_O. Be prepared. \n\nIf you have any questions ask me or a Friendly mod. HaTsUnE_NeKo is one of nicest and informative I've seen.

Not everyone is going to enjoy it and yes it can be a little too sandboxy at times. The long development time also made me question whether or not I would enjoy this game when I first bought it during a sale. However, I must say that I have enjoyed it a lot.\n\nWhat I enjoy:\n- Constant updates and support: In the year or so that I have owned Kenshi, the game has improved quite a bit and runs a lot smoother on my Laptop than before.\n- Modding Tools: Using the FCS takes time to learn but when you get the hang of it, you can do a lot more such as new factions, weapons, etc.\n- Beak Things: Those little pieces of... hate fighting them. I feel like I accomplish something when my squad kills one.\n\nWhat I don't enjoy:\n- Crashing and Bugs: It's Early Access still. Bugs and crashing are to be expected. I'm not going to like it when it happens, but the game has been getting smoother over time with updates.\n- FPS: The game can be very cpu intensive. Not graphic card intense, cpu. Because of all the wandering groups and npcs going about their day, following their ai. Sometimes the FPS can slow to a crawl.\n- Limited Modding Information: I assume the reason for the lack of information out there is because the game changes over time, sometimes breaking mods and changing code. Still, there is a very sporadic and basic amount of information on modding out there (at least reading wise. Not sure about YouTube videos, I know they exist but I'm more of a reader than a listener.)\n\nOverall: Kenshi is a great game that suits MY preferences. I enjoy it a lot and will continue to play, neglecting my other responsibilities like work (actually, I'm late for work right now. Oops.) and school. YOU may not. I can't gurantee that you'll love Kenshi but what I can say is to give it a chance.\n\nThis isn't about being a hero that can slaughter everything in its path. It is a story of survival, accomplishment, and being eaten by Beak Things.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506108472, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506108472, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2171, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 334, "total_reviews": 2505}}
