(And one hell of an anti-cheat code :D )\n+ Controls: Its great considering the amount of things you can do in the game.\n+ Story is fun and good at parts.\n\nCons:\n- Story is shallow at parts.\n\n9.5/10 Its a gem. I loved everything about it. Reminded me what gaming is about when i was a kid (C64 and Amiga era), it is amazingly fun to play and has the same charm of that era.

The game does an adequate job of hitting all the standard RPG platformer tropes that it\u2019s based on \u2013 earning XP to upgrade Daniel\u2019s abilities, mixing ingredients to make potions, learning spells and trading with storekeepers dotted around the castle.
