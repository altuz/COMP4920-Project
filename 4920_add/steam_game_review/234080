Lords of Shadow was the first Castlevania to be released for HD and it doesn\u2019t disappoint. It might be a terrible night for a curse but the scenery along the way is truly gorgeous. Patrick Stewart narrates a tale of whipchains and thorny paths to gothic castles. Castlevania returns in glorious high definition and Kojima adds his special touch making man a miserable pile of secrets indeed.\n\nCheck out the full review here:\n\nhttps://mythoszephon.wordpress.com/2017/09/03/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-ultimate-overview/", "timestamp_updated": 1505333379, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505333379, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35151334", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502656", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506422799, "steamid": "76561198078491936", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 165}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Castlevania: Lords of Shadows is a bitter sweet symphony that could deliver either a satifying or frustrating experience, depending on what you find enjoyable in an action-adventure game. \n\nThe overall design of this game is brilliant (characters, enemies, environments, items, interfaces, music, etc.) making this game a true gem from the gothic art style. Alongside, the story it shows is interesting (even tough the main character motive is rather weak). Just these reasons are enough to actually give this game a try and, if you find these aspects appealing, this game will not disappoint. One thing to mention tough is that the game has a segmented narrative, in which the player will need to use the imagination to connect the dots between segments and follow the stotyline.\n\nHowever, it lacks considerably in its gameplay and  its mechanics. Castlevania: Lords of Shadows offers 3 main gameplays scenarios for the player (exploration, puzzle solving and combat) and it fails to deliver in all of them. \n\nExploration is used to find power-ups and other collectables the game offers. It hinders this process with a system that forces you to contantly re-visit levels over and over again, until  you finally are equiped with the right upgrade. But probably the most dissapointing aspect in this regards is the abuse of invisible walls that make exploration limited and, in some special levels, it punishes the player for exploring, making impossible to backtrace along the level and forcing to start of all over again if you accdentally went to far ahead on a path. This mechanics may encorage re-playability, but it does it in a disappointing, frustating and uncreative way.\n\nPuzzle solving is found all over the game. They are in itself very visually appealing thanks to the beautiful design scenarios, but the depth and complexity if the puzzles (with very few exceptions) are pretty much non-existent. Most of the puzzles are so obvious that they are already solved by the game showing you a cinematic of the surrounding area. The game try to improve this very superficial complexity by throwing you hordes of enemies while trying to activate a swicth or turn a pillar, or by playing unfair against the player, changing the rules of the puzzle if you are doing good in it (I'm looking at you beast chess).  It feels that this puzzle element was added to the game in order to add more content, but what it does is leaving the player with false sense of improvement and annoyance. \n\nThe main mechanics of this game is its combat. It offers a wide variety of combos, secondary weapons and upgrades, all of them combinable with the 2 kinds of magic. This gives a considerably big variety of options for the player to experiment. However, this in practice become pointless thanks to the simplicity of how combat is implemented. The overwhelming majority of the combat in this game follows 2 predefined recipies: 1. If it's an small enemy, pull them to you and the game will trigger an action-secuence in which, you press a button and the enemy is dead or 2. hit them with your basic attack 2-3 times and dodge. The worst is that these patterns apply boss fights as well. At the end, the game has a very elaborated combat system that gives the illusion of depth and strategy, but is useless thanks to the way combat is presented to player.\n\nOverall, Castlevania: Lords of Shadows is a game that is visually astonishing, simple, accesible and offers a facelift to one beloved franchise. However, it has such detrimental flaws in the fundamentals of its video game mechanics, that it may give a rather poor experience to more experienced players.", "timestamp_updated": 1506167161, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506167161, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1136, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 417, "total_reviews": 1553}}
