It isn't a perfect game by any means, but if you're into cars, the Mad Max movies and Aussie accents, you'll definitely be able to recognise what it does well and have an awesome time. It's sort of like Just Cause 2 meets Tomb Raider meets Red Dead Redemption. Definitely worth the price tag whenever it is on special. No multiplayer. \n\n[b]Mad Max - A Forgotten Gem[/b]\nI had Mad Max on my wishlist for a while, I'd always been a fan of the movies, however, knowing what movie games are usually like (rushed, lacking content, little story), I knew I would never pay full price for this game. Eventually it came on sale for a meagre $6 which was a price I couldn't pass up, and boy, was I pleasantly surprised (maybe [i]shocked[/i] is a better word) at the game I received. \n\nThe game opens with a pretty standard sort of cinematic cut scene, nothing unexpected here, max loses his car to some marauders and basically ends up thrown in a ditch. At this point, you take control of Max. You'll notice that, strangely enough... it seems as if the game actually looks graphically better than the cut scene before it... you guide him through to an open area where you overlook the wasteland and at this point, being a bit of a graphics wh*re, I stopped in my tracks and just panned the camera for a few minutes - This is something that you will do often in Mad Max. This game is graphically... absolutely stunning. The wasteland is dusty and desolate with fragments of the old world dispersed throughout. The heat distortion and detail on the cars is truly something to behold and that's before I get to the [i]explosions[/i] which are some of the best I have ever seen in a game. I'd say the beauty in this game is probably what allowed me to play it for such a long time after the main story was over. \n\nYou soon meet your mechanic, Chum, who rather religiously tends to your main car in the game, his [i]'Magnum Opus'[/i]. The Opus is fully customisable and there are a plethora of performance mods and weapons to unlock here using the in-game currency, scrap - which can be conveniently be found just about everywhere. There are other cars in the game however none of them allow Chum to ride along and you will quickly realise that his repair skill and manning of an air-propelled harpoon gun are somewhat invaluable. I was not a fan of this because it really does deter you from using the other cars in the game, of which there are quite a few. I'd also like to mention that fuel conservation is basically not a thing, fuel and water are commodities which you will almost never run short of and I don't feel this is appropriate considering the apparent shortages in the lore and movies. Nevertheless, the car combat is another strong point in this game, it is well thought out and relatively consistent. Very enjoyable despite the somewhat average driving physics. I'm a car guy and the physics didn't put me off but this is by no means a driving sim, far from it.  \n  \nYou will spend the majority of your time clearing out camps of Warboys and establishing stability in the four main regions. The combat on foot is mostly melee oriented, the only guns in this game are your shotgun (which you will not use much) and a handful of snipers (which aren't much of an issue once you figure out that Chum's harpoon gun can pluck them from their nests with ease). The hand to hand combat is very intense and absolutely brutal. It's very satisfying despite its repetitive nature. The enemies unfortunately are not very varied and if you go through the game expecting combat to change you will be disappointed. Eventually you will come to the conclusion that it is easier to just drive around camps spamming (you guessed it) Chum's harpoon gun, which is a one hit kill for all enemies. Later in the game it even gets a grenade attachment which when fully upgraded, one-hits any vehicle you will encounter as well. As a result, combat in this game both on-foot and in-car is as difficult as you want it to be. You could just not use the harpoon and then it would be quite challenging however it is just so fast and easy to use the harpoon that the temptation is real.\n\nI suppose it's time for me to get to the story and characters... this is... not this game's strong point. I can remember maybe... three of the characters in this game? They are all so weak and despite decent Aussie voice acting you will find yourself glossing over most of what they say. You don't really care about any of the characters because they are never developed so when they kill off a few it's a bit like... eh whatever... The story is linear and pretty simple. You help out a settlement, they help you get to the next place, you help them out, they help you get to the next place, some stuff happens, the game ends. Preston Garvey would be proud but it has very little replay ability that's for sure. If this game had multiplayer, it would be very much like Red Dead Redemption. There isn't multiplayer though and I don't really think it would work too well anyway because of the way combat in it is structured. \n\nTo end on a good note, the map is colossal and intelligently designed. You really get a sense of scale when you're driving through it. It is a masterfully created wasteland and because of the vehicular aspect, it is appropriately massive unlike in the Fallout universe. Fragments of the old world, [b]each of them unique[/b] litter it and there is always another location to check out, clear out, and loot. It would be boring driving the considerable distances from place to place if not for the random Warboy encounters and beautiful visuals. Every single camp, big or small is uniquely designed which makes it interesting to investigate the sometimes extremely creative (and sometimes grotesque) designs. There are not a whole lot of different things to do in the world however you'll always be in a different place with a different feel while doing them.   \n\n[b]Summary[/b]\nVisuals - 10/10 - Absurd attention to detail, beautiful explosions and world-building. \nSound - 7/10 - Decent sound, a few bugs, nothing special. \nOptimisation - 8/10 - Runs really well, GTX 660 has no issues with \"Very High\" @1080p. Large 32GB file size.  \nAction - 8/10 - Intense and gritty punch-ups, masterful car combat. Repetitive. \nCharacters - 2/10 - Weak and barely memorable characters.

But it's often wise to take shelter or be in the car much of the time tracking down the rare chest and loot that fly about in said sandstorms with a gorgious harpoon mechanic that really makes the vehicular play work great.
