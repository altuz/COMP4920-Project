It focuses on the actual functioning of a gun. When you pick up a gun, whats the first thing you do? Check and see if its loaded, right? Tap T and R and inspect the chamber. The slide release works, the slide wont lock to the rear unless an empty mag is in the gun, like a real pistol. OR, you can pull the slide back and engage the slide release, like a real pistol. The safety works, pull the hammer back and if you want to release it. hold the hammer and then squeeze the trigger....LIKE A REAL GUN. \n\nI am a gun guy, I like guns. This game is for people like me. \n\nthe ONLY thing that they did not hit in this game is how difficult it can be to load a magazine with your bare hands.", "timestamp_updated": 1505660147, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505660147, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1291, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 189, "total_reviews": 1480}}
