The artstyle is absolutely breathtaking and the voice work is phenomenal. I will say though, that there is one section in the game that runs SUPER slow but then it picks up. Fans of the book will definitely enjoy this, and even if you're unfamiliar with the story, new fans will find this to be a captivating tale. Much like Telltale games, this game is about choosing what to say in certain situations and I was always concerned whether or not I made the right choice. Not to bash Telltale games, but I do think that the storytelling is much deeper in this than any Telltale game I've played. Hopefully people will check this game out because it really is a great game so far.
