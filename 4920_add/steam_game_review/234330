Your instinct will be to drop a small amount of money, which youll spend on the wrong stuff (hero tokens) which will cause you to need to buy more slots (the ONLY thing you should be buying).  Youll get a high level hero, think youve won, then realize it ruins your scaling.\n\nYou need a LOT of hero slots, and those slots are expensive, the rest of the RMT is 100% RNG.  Rather than making an item you can buy to upgrade your heroes, which are seperated by tier, same skills though just higher level cap, they make the hero RNG the same as the skill upgrades.  So youll need many rare hero covers to upgrade that higher level hero and actually have skills, which are more important than good match 3 luck/skill.\n\nThat one star or two star hero with all its skills unlocked and upgrade potential is far better than the uber rare hero you just unlocked basically...this isnt told to you early on...and its why most of the complaints are about the cash shop..they set you up to fail in this manner, which means...pull that wallet out...you get very little for your money as well (dont even get me started on ISO the material needed to level up, which you can only do after upgrading a skill via rolling another hero cover of the same tier which may or may not be the specific skill you need or want to upgrade)...you can see how it gets fustrating.\n\nNot paying money your able to clear the tutorial pve, then youll be stuck doing one daily and not much else to do for a decent amount of time.\n\nThe game floods you with low tier covers, that eventually you sell off...and are sort of worthless beyond early game.\n\nAlliances are either 100% dead or overly competative with high expectations on participation, youll only be able to join with an expensive roster of high teir heroes upgraded fully...which takes ages for free or costs a hell of a lot of money.\n\n\nI drew the line at $20, opened a ton of slots, got a few \"decent\" heroes ill probably never find an upgrade for...but come in handy for pve events where characters are powered up (if you have that specific hero) if you dont its more or less a diceroll if youll get stomped and need to log out for an hour or two, or win and have taken so much damage youll need to log out for an hour or two...damage carries over and heals slowly over time or use a heal pack which drop from pve sometimes or pay up.\n\nIm stuck in a between spot on progression, much like if you dont pay early on...i log in to see if the events are for any heroes i have, if so i play them, if not i realize theres very little i can get done in a day.  WHen you realize most rewards are a token amount of ISO (like 250-500 when you need 30k to level a hero) it gets tedious... When you keep getting the same cover for the same hero who has that same skill already maxed, rather than ANYTHING else..it gets old...far too much RNG here...seperate hero characters from skills and just put in a skill upgrade token so we can make use of all our heroes....it makes rare heros almost worthless since youll never be able to upgrade them.\n\nJust do yourself a favor, dont bother with the game, if you need to....dont pay...see that progression wall? $20 will get you maybe 10 more hours of play until you hit it again, your rewards wont increase much because of it, and dont even think about competing....for a pve event i was ranked #1 for about 8hours (got lucky and i had all essential heros who were boosted) with 20min left on the event i was pretty far ahead, out of content to do for rewards and points donwscale with repetition...i was done but sure i was going to win some decent rewards (well maybe 500 more ISO than had i just participated and not competed and a chance at a rare hero)  i ended up ranking 38th in that 20min...not that i noticed much via reward...but it was like why did i even bother? 500 iso and a standard token for a low tier hero (one star storm or juggernaught it seems is the 99% on their RNG not worth the iso to upgrade for me)\n\nIf you can play a few hours every day, and play EVERY day, eventually youll build up a decent roster, with some luck at least...and were talking over months...otherwise pay up big...and even then its a pretty boring game.\n\n\nOh and the pvp isnt pvp...your playing an AI during it...\n\nAlso the match 3 mixed with their skill system is extremely fustrating, many skills wont work unless they sit on the board for a few turns, and it seems the AI is really...REALLY...lucky on cascades and skills that randomly destroy tiles that always include your big skill that was going to go off next turn...however when the AI does similair it will be on a tile you cannot possibly touch...you you need to choose a character that can accurately destroy rows (hawkeye) which is kinda lame.\n\nIf you plan to play 30 min to an hour a day, dont mind long slow progression, and will play for many months...youll get some fun out of it if youve never played a proper match 3 game...otherwise...get a real match 3 game...ironcast is far more entertianing and way less over the long run.\n\nOh and i want to be very clear on their terrible scaling system.  Basically if you open a token and get a high tier character, the game assumes you have all high skill characters, fully upgraded, even if its just one and you have just one upgraded skill.  The game is VERY dependant on skills to progress you cannot compete on just match 3 damage alone.  Having one lv70 character means your lower tier heros fully upgraded at lv50 wont be able to hang in the events, which is how you progress and earn more tokens and coin rewards for more slots.  Your option is to delete the rare hero or struggle to do anything.  You have to horde tokens for months before you should actually open them, something not explained to new players and the most common cause of game fustration.  Typically you only find this out after spending money, or getting lucky on a reward token....youll realize this when you cant progress in an event for coin and tokens because the enemy level is too high for all but one character...and that one character cant carry without a full skill slot as youll be doing match 3 damage for most of the match.  If you play for free or dont want to spend hundreds of dollars...dont open anything other than a standard low tier token and make sure you have like 20-30 slots which will takes many months of free play or about $100....and why have that many slots if you dont have characters to fill them.  The sheer number of heroes means youll be at RNG's mercy to get duplicates, and not just duplicates of rare heroes but ones with the right skills so you can win matches....its insane....", "timestamp_updated": 1487435001, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487434211, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "29593659", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497043", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1397304086, "steamid": "76561198092354875", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "No saves, RNGs fuck you up and helps DFC.\nNo merit. \nShould not exist.", "timestamp_updated": 1485813179, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485813179, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "30130771", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497433", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504534883, "steamid": "76561198040717148", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I had to give up on this after not even an full hour. and I like Bejewel style games A LOT, but this was just not fun to play, and having no option to turn down the sound ingame during the tutorial sucks.\n\nIf you want to play a bejewel type game, you can get more intersting both gameplay wise and visually. \n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1487897462, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487897462, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "29892094", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498011", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1487063308, "steamid": "76561198099726998", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Ok but you'll get to the second chapter and find it's near imposible to procced without spending $$$", "timestamp_updated": 1486964878, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486964878, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "29726273", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495275", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506912132, "steamid": "76561198107760837", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 84228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 321}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "addicting as hell, but needs new storylines.", "timestamp_updated": 1486320714, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486320714, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "30248723", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494617", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1488308289, "steamid": "76561198117423761", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "It's a highly addictive game that makes you come back for more not because it's incredibly fun but because of all the bells and whistles and little rewards you get from winning.
