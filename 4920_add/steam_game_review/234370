Shattered Haven is a zombie survival game where the player is presented a variety of scenarios to overcome. The story follows Mary and Darrel as they flee from their once safe haven in search for their lost children. Shattered Haven can be played as a single player game or cooperatively. \n\nThe player is put in an 'overworld' where the player must locate various portals that lead to individual challenges. The player must complete all challenges in a given region before proceeding to the next. The overworld provides a loose framework for these individual challenges and drives the overall progression of the game. \n\nArcen, the developers, a small five man shop have developed several games since 2009; much more than the average indie developer in my opinion. Shattered Haven, like many games by Arcen, lacks polish. I have played a number of Arcen's games and they all have Arcen's signature mark of lacking polish.  Shattered Haven is plagued disjointed and often conflicting artstyle, poor sound effects, bad UI design, and minor but persistent bugs. I am beginning to wonder if Arcen actually knows how to bring a game to completion or if they simply get bored of developing it and release it to market before it's truly finished. \n\nThe premise of Shattered Haven is good, and I actually did enjoy many of the challenges it presented me and I was somewhat compelled to keep playing but the game's lack of polish caused it to miss the mark in my book. If Arcen had spent a little more time refining this game it could have been so much better. \n\nShattered Haven does support USB controllers although I noticed there are some bugs. Overall I won't recommend this, although if you enjoy action puzzle games you might enjoy this.\n\nScore: 5.5/10\n", "timestamp_updated": 1387143504, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1387143504, "votes_down": 11}, {"recommendationid": "7838634", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532330", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1385789733, "steamid": "76561198028032565", "num_games_owned": 774, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "I liked AVWW. I wanted to like this game. But AVWW started you off with fire punches and kept the cheesy dialogue to a minimum. SH does neither of those things.\n\nIn this game, you start by playing as some children who use Home Alone traps to fight zombies. Later on, you play as adults who do the same thing. Basically, the adults are as effective as children in this game.\n\nThe dialogue sounds like it was written by a ten year old who doesn't read much. \"(Laughs darkly)\" is actually part of an actual line meant to be taken seriously. The cutscenes aren't much better. \"Kids are funny. It sure is dark. I'm going home\" is basically what I got out of the first poorly voice-acted specimen.\n\nThe story is ridiculously rushed. Wake up, open a gate, zombies speedwalk in, silly adventure begins. At one point, a survivor simply guesses by looking at it that a portal will empty his inventory because they didn't feel like taking the time to let us find that out ourselves. Never mind the fact that he only saw the portal five seconds ago and shouldn't be accepting the fact that it exists yet.\n\nAnd finally, the gameplay itself is boring when it isn't buggy. When you're not just ambling about and clicking the \"next\" button, you're trying to get your AI ally to get out of the canoe so you can advance.\n\nBasically, if the worst of game-maker and rpg-maker got stitched together and stole the cute menu from AVWW, it'd be Shattered Haven.", "timestamp_updated": 1385794838, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1385794838, "votes_down": 11}, {"recommendationid": "1367156", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509953", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1366182000, "steamid": "76561197992204855", "num_games_owned": 4859, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game caught my attention being on weeklong sale.

The goal of each level is either to kill all zombies (called Grays here  which are quite a different breed from your regular zombies) using the environment and what tools, traps and weapons you can forage from it or to escape from maze-like structures filled with switches, secret passages and more.\n\nWhat makes this game really stand out is it's story and musical score, again composed or remastered by the intrepid Pablo Vega. All the overworld areas are bound together by the tale of Darrel and Mary and their quest to recover their four-year-old daughter Lela, whom they raised in the midst of the Gray Apocalypse, along with the boy Pierce, whom they took in after he lost his family in the wilds, while being caught up in the struggle of two eldritch horrors. The game features a branching story arc with multiple distinctive endings along with a \"New Game Plus\" feature to continue your quest and visit those areas you missed before (along with being able to find some treats not available before). The soundtrack might well be one of the best yet produced by Pablo Vega and does an awesome job on creating an engaging atmosphere and setting the scene for the story, which is told through a big number of comic panel based cutscenes, some of which feature brilliant voice acting by Prince Taylor (it is ridiculous how much atmosphere is created alone by his impersonation of Darrel)  and loads of in-engine cutscenes.\n\nThe art of he game has been created by Heavy Cat Studios, this being their second joint venture with Arcen after Valley 2, and does a great job creating a polished but still retro look & feel for the game (think SNES with a higher resolution here). Throw in some really nice weather and particle effects to complete the package and what you get is a fitting presentation.\n\nFinally the game can be controlled using keyboard & mouse or a gamepad controls, both of which are working flawlessly (I recommend using a gamepad, though).", "timestamp_updated": 1363771212, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1363771212, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "3537606", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501740", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1490331128, "steamid": "76561198024378091", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "To understand this game, first imagine a 9.5-rated action puzzler on Armor Games.
