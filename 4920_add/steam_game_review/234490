Anyways this games level design changes with whatever music you put in it, causing some obstacles to move faster or slower depending on what music is playing and when the base drops in the song. Of course like i said that does cause lots of confusion and makes it so you normally die 15~100 times depending on map and if there is a checkpoint system in the map you chose. Luckily deaths are fast and they spare no time throwing you back out there to continue. All in all this game gives you enough fun for its price and its fun to play with friends and share your music with them. I'd give it... 6.75/10 I think. Gives you enough fun for your buck.

We paid 1\u20ac each....and we want it back. A cup of ice cream would have been a lot more fun for the money. \nNow to the real review (I've been even using the Co-Op Mode): The game is fast and dynamic, in the first few seconds it's awesome, but soon the first flaws appear:\n- Why do they have a running animation, when you can spam the slide and are a lot faster? Keep that away, it looks like you're glitching, but if you're not doing it, you know that you should do it or you'll lose.\n- The game and level design is awful. Flash games look better and are for free. And you can't really tell if an obsticle is just there or if it is deadly. Maybe it is the color, but everything is glowing and so I didn't care and got kinda frustrated. And if you play coop and \"kill\" your friend....oh god the animations look so horrible.\n- There's no aim. You have all songs and all levels (or am I wrong? But starting with over 30 levels doesn't seem too unlockable) and therefore I don't know for what I'm playing. Me and my friend were battling and the winner got...nothing. We started the next level, had a bit fun, but it got boring soooo fast. Now you're asking \"but there are achievements which save us!\" Wrong. \"Beat XX in YY seconds.\" that's it. For every level. Yay.\n- The level design isn't fun. In games like VVVVVV or Super Meat Boy (which I have both beaten with a sh*tload of fun) everything was hard, but fair or fun. In RB you run, fly or fall into something and ask \"WHY? WOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN\". My friend isn't a noob either and had the same questions.\n- The music is meh. I'm totally into EDM and it's the most common thing I hear, but in the game I liked about 2 songs (one was the main theme). After using my songs (which took an eternity to load, my friend dealt with the same issue) the levels didn't change that much, so no \"wow\" in this either.\n\nAfter all, this game is so disappointing, even for paying only 1\u20ac.", "timestamp_updated": 1405612341, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405612341, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "8885956", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500451", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1390335521, "steamid": "76561198044924893", "num_games_owned": 1819, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I really, really tried to like this game. The idea of a platformer that you play to your music sounds good on paper, but I feel that Rush Bros. doesn't deliver on it's cool-sounding concept. If a game has the option to play with my music more often than not I will choose to do so. In Rush Bros. however, unless you're playing anything other than electro house you're probably going to have a hard time moving through a level since obstacles will either focus on A) the back beat B) the vocals or C) some other element to the song that isn't made readily apparent to you. This results in either trying the level with a different song or the default music (which works fine, btw) and I feel that's very poor design on the developer's part. Speaking of poor design, some of the levels in this game are just terrible. This game excells when you're going fast and dodging obstacles and there are quite a few levels where you are put in a maze and have to find keys to progress almost in a puzzle-platform kinda way. Being forced to slow down and think your way through a level wouldn't be so bad if the wall jumping didn't feel as sticky as it does, which sucks since in the puzzle levels there are tons of walls for you to stick to for whatever reason.

The game itself isn't for anyone and if you're planning on buying it, wait until its $5 or less as the $10 price tag is too much for this game.\n\nThe game itself is exactly as it claims it is when it states that it's \"a music reactive Platform Racing Game\". The game itself is centered around competing against other players online (or against your own times) while avoiding obstacles that are [b] Somewhat[/b] reactive to the music. But this \"reactive\" element is where part of the problem I have with this game arises. Depending on the song currently playing, certain elements of levels can be virtually impossible to complete. As songs get more and more upbeat obstacles seem more aggressive and unpredictable. Be it those strange \"bass\" obstacles that send you flying away from them, the pulsing buzz saws, or those obnoxious cannon like things, certain songs will make these obstacles about a million times more difficult. I myself would often find myself waiting for the brief moments of peace at the end of one song while another was preparing to start before trying to quickly rush through an obstacle I'd been stuck at for what seems like ages. \n\nNext up, level design. While all the stages themselves are unique and different, there's a few major problems I've noticed in levels that just makes the game itself incredibly frustrating to play sometimes. On some levels you'll get a checkpoint nearly every 20 feet, so a death is meaningless and can cost you only a few seconds, while on other levels I felt like I'd spend a minute at a time avoiding obstacles only to die and be sent right back... And that without mentioning some horrible level layouts where I could miss a jump, fall down for about 15 seconds and land on a platform near the beginning of the level, forcing me to start almost the entire race over again.\n\nMultiplayer itself seems to work well enough, however I haven't been able to play much online. Half the time I can't find a server with anyone to play against, and whenever I can, they'll often leave before we can even pick a level or make it any significant distance into a race. However racing against a friend while chatting over skype can be a blast.\n\nOverall the game itself isn't bad... but I wouldn't by any means call it great or even necessarily good. It's a basic platformer, with controls that can be a little bit slippery, beautiful background images, and a diverse and enjoyable soundtrack. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend the game at full price unless you're really really itching to get your hands on it, I would recommend it if it drops to $5 or below. And at that point you may want to grab a 2-pack so you could send a copy to a friend if you ever wanna play a quick game to pass some time.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1419202060, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419202060, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 87, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 56, "total_reviews": 143}}
