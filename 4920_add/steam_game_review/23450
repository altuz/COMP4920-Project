I like this game. I really do. I am not a city builder game experty but this feels like a generic city builder but it's set in ancient Rome so I decided to give it a go.\n\nIt was fun. I am not a big fan of the circlular building hud but other than that, I have no real problems with this game. The storyline is okay, the graphics are really good even thought this is 9 years old. The combat is okay and it could be better but it is not the main focus of the game, city building is.\n\nIf you want a good city building game then consider buying this. It is pretty good."}]}
