Fans of Red Orchestra 2 will be more than satisfied but even new people to the franchise (like me), will most likely find the gameplay addictive and the experience one of a kind.  \n\nThis game also includes the Red Orchestra 2 multiplayer so you can fight in the Pacific AND the Eastern Front. There are huge 64 player battles in extremely large maps that really makes you feel like you\u2019re part of a war instead of a multiplayer shooter. \n\nRed Orchestra has always been about realism which means limited HUD, quick deaths, a bleed out system, and a morale meter. Red Orchestra 2 players won\u2019t be surprised by these features because they aren't anything new, but I just wanted to mention them for new players. The moral system affects the shakiness of your screen and the amount of colour you can see. If an enemy suppresses you, it will quickly drop. If artillery falls near you, it will drop. If you witness a fellow teammate getting killed, it will drop. There are lots of things that affect it but over time it gradually recovers.\n\nAside from the new maps and new weapons, the best new features are the distinct differences between the American side and Japanese side. The Americans have superior weapons whereas the Japanese have dirty tactics like grenade traps and Banzai rushes. So any Japanese soldier can use his grenades as traps by planting them in the ground. Luckily enough, they aren't triggered by fellow Japanese. The Banzai charge is a really interesting feature. Any soldier can charge forward while quickly diminishing morale of the Americans affecting their aim etc. The more Japanese that group together during the charge, the higher the morale drop for the Americans. While performing a Banzai charge the Japanese are also more resistance to gunfire. The Japanese weapons aren't as good as the Americans, but the effective use of these tactics can really make a difference. \n\nThere are various game styles that have been added such as \u201cAction\u201d which includes a more revealing HUD. So far I\u2019ve only played Objective mode so I can\u2019t tell you much about the game modes, but objective is very fun and really emphasizes teamwork.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to play a game where teamwork is important and although one player can\u2019t do much, a whole squad working together can really make a difference. I enjoy the visceral nature of the game and the realistic sounds used. It really is a definitive WW2 experience that I won\u2019t forget! \n", "timestamp_updated": 1373270419, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "14", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1373270419, "votes_down": 28}, {"recommendationid": "2252964", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 597, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718143", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 0, "steamid": "76561198004655744", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 19, "review": "Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 is essentially what Battlefield wishes it was.

Instead of Soviet Union fighting against the German Nazis, here the game is based in the Pacific War of which you fight with the Japanese Empire or the United States of 'MURICA (I mean America...). Just like Red Orchestra, I suggest you only play this game if you're not deeply affected by war movies or if you don't have war trauma. Like I said in my brief introduction, the game wants to be as realistic as it can be without breaking the pacing. There's a lot of good voice acting here which can transmit pain. For example, I accidentally shot one of my teamates and the player's avatar died. The player respawned, however, the avatar kept crying of the pain and he wouldn't stop. It made me feel bad for the mistake and I couldn't concentrate properly. So as I said, be sure you would be fine with the execution of the theme.\n\nYou'll be fighting in many historical locations which are very well built for the game mechanics implemented in the game. Rising Storm is an assimetrical class-based game of which you have various roles to choose from. Assimetrical multiplayer (for those of you who don't know), is a system of which both teams or more have different attributes and features but the game is still balanced. In this case, the Americans have many classes with a better selection of weapons and the Japanease use guerilla-tactics and have special abilities. It's a bit harder to use the Japanease and you don't have a tutorial segment for them. What's harder to learn is how you should play Rising Storm, it's a lot harder to know how to advance efficiently or to defend as long as you can.\n\nEven though it's a class-based game, what really matters is logistics here. What I'm talking about is moving as many soldiers as you can from point A to B and holding the point....preferably without dying of course.... You have many respawn tickets and as long as you don't burn too much time and don't waste them in an unproductive way, what you should be worried about is pushing with your teammates. You'll die many times though, so don't be suprised, it's a very hard game. You can respawn alongside your squad leader like in Battlefield.\n\nThe game is quite slow if you're doing things right. There's a lot of cover-based shooting because you can actually stick to cover, fire blindshots and tilt out of cover to fight. In all cases, do not go alone and don't run-and-gun. Go with teammates so you can get cover fire. Speaking of the firefights, the guns are very enjoyable to use but are hard to control because of their recoil. The game rewards for long and accurate shots, specially because  you're dealing with old guns which work best in a specific way.\n\nRising Storm as Red Orchestra has a regenerative health that is mixed with consciousnesses and morale. So not only will shooting directly your enemy lower his HP, but also suppresive fire and nearby artillery fire will do the same. When your HP bar is low, you'll have difficulty hearing and you'll only see black and white. However, once  the HP bar is low, you have to shoot them directly. You can also get injured and bleed out, so make sure you stick your head low.\n\nThee graphics are very beautiful but there are no facial animations which make it awkward to look at the soldiers. If you don't have a very good machine, then don't worry, the extensive option menu will help you on that.\n\nIn conclusion, Rising Storm has a high learning curve which probably will put you off if you don't like very hard games, but if you're looking for a challenge, then I recommend it!", "timestamp_updated": 1380481375, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1380481375, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "1738165", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 114, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537100", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 0, "steamid": "76561197997212067", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 68, "review": "TENNO HEIKA\nBANZAI", "timestamp_updated": 1376192850, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1376192850, "votes_down": 56}, {"recommendationid": "4351909", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 73, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519828", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 0, "steamid": "76561198035862992", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Unique game with Killzone(kinda) like cover system :)\nyou can't play like you used to play in COD or Battlefield.
