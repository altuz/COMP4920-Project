There are three playable characters: Ceville (the sniveling deposed ruler), Ambrosious the (hilariously) pompous knight, and Lilly (a cute little girl who has great banter with Ceville).  Sometimes you play multiple characters simultaneously, and there are points where you have to do one thing as one character, switch to another, and complete a task.\n\nNote that there are a few clearly-identifiable timed elements (a clock will tick) where you have to do something within, say, 10 seconds.  There are no failures that require a re-load, and you can save any time.  You can double-click to skip run animations, and you can hold the spacebar to reveal hidden objects.\n\nMost of the puzzles are quite fair and reasonable-- there were a few I had to get help with...which IMO is a good thing.  Many of the puzzles are combining inventory items in a (usually) intuitive way...and using dialog trees to open up new paths.\n\nAnyway, give it a try next time it's on sale!"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1425956204, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513265", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "14816951", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197998273415", "num_reviews": 89, "last_played": 1413031546, "num_games_owned": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 273}, "timestamp_updated": 1468057983, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[table]\n[tr]\n[td][h1]AUDIO[/h1][/td]\n[td]Stock[/td]\n[td][h1]VISUAL[/h1][/td]\n[td]Cheesy[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][h1]DIFFICULTY[/h1][/td]\n[td]Average[/td]\n[td][h1]VIBE[/h1][/td]\n[td]Silly[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][h1]CRAVING[/h1][/td]\n[td]Cheesy[/td]\n[td][h1]ON SALE[/h1][/td]\n[td]Occasional[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]PROS: [/b]Voice-acting is cute, and the cast is likeable.
