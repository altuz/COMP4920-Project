Even too much considering its price, it was overpriced and it is still overpriced, very few content, bad developer, bad publisher.\nAnd they consider this a realistic game? Stop mocking us, it's a simcade game, it's far away to be realistic but it is not an arcade game such as Need for Speed Most Wanted either.\nModding is crap, you're better off with something like RFactor, Race 07, etc.\n\nFanboys won't like this, but this is a fact, this business should just die already.\n\nIf you're looking for a better simcade game then you should get Assetto Corsa, it is not perfect either but it is already better than this.\nHeck, even Forza Motorsport/Horizon are better than this.\n\n\nTo summerize that up, Project Cars 2 is What Project Cars should have been so you're better off without this game, never ever buy this game and wait for a heavily discount for Project Cars 2, they don't deserves that much money since they already have way too much. \n\n\n4.5/10 - for the game itself.\n0/0 - for how dumb this developer is, you can't be much more dumb than that, seriously.\n\nAnd even so, I wouldn't even buy Project Cars 2 if I were you, except if you can get the whole thing in a few years for 5$ or less.\n\nThey're just a bunch of incompetent liars who lies just to get some more money, almost all developers do that these days right? That's why the gaming industry is crap nowadays.\nAnyway, I've read on their website that Project Cars 2 would have above 400 vehicles or something like that, 800? 400? 300? Well, more than 180 for sure, way many more but look at it now, still just a big lie around lies.\nYou should not support greedy and incompetent developers like them, seriously, just stop.\nOtherwise the gaming industry will just become more and more crap, but I guess that the fanboys doesn't care about that.", "timestamp_updated": 1506208307, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506197413, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "35098125", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497470", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505971968, "steamid": "76561198096215997", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If you enjoy racing absolute trash AI, this is the game for you.
