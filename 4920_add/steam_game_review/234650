It seems to simulate the Shadowrun universe fairly well and provides a pretty good cyberpunk/urban fantasy experience.  The story is interesting and has a few twists that I did not expect.  Unlike the multiplayer Shadowrun Chronicles game, this game offers a fully fledged Matrix run experience in a couple spots.  \n\nThe one real issue I have with the game is that, for me, it hangs up during a critical battle near the end of the story.  The bug does not appear to affect everyone, and there is some kind of workaround--which did not work for me.  While looking for troubleshooting info, I noticed people have posted about this thing ever since the game was published, and to this date, that bug has never been entirely eradicated.  I don't know if the devs gave up on it, or they just reached a point at which most people didn't have it, or what.\n\nSo, assuming you don't get the hang-up, the game is pretty awesome and there is a fair amount of workshop modding done for it, including lots of story content.  You could have hours and hours of entertainment doing the mod campaigns, even if you have the bug.\n\nBut...that bug is a real show-stopper, and is part of the published game, so, unfortunately, I'm not recommending this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1505450459, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505450459, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "35192404", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501909", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506236237, "steamid": "76561198088446752", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 271}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Shadowrun Returns is a fun game, with interesting and well-written characters and immersive storytelling and worldbuilding.

It's more a linear RPG game than a TBS game, so if you want to get the XCOM'ish experience with this game - you will probably be disappointed.\n\nThe story at the very beginning is very engaging. You feel like a detective. You talk with people, try to find some clues about what is going on and why the things are happening, but after the mid-game the story becomes like a bad B-Movie. You just know how everything will end even before it happens, but you still have to play the game to finish it. That was a bit disappointing.\n\nThe RPG elements are ok. Just nothing too serious. Usually you will want to stick with 2 specialities and if you do so - it will not matter in which skills you will invest your Karma points. \n\nThe graphics are good, the music was fine, although the lack of variety gets really noticeable after a few hours. Controls could have been better, especially the pathfinding. Sometimes you just can't click on a free tile. \n\nThere are some bugs too. I don't recommend to alt-tab, or you can get a black screen (then you need to reload the last save game or exit the game). Sometimes when you reload the last save - you are not allowed to attack some enemies for 1 turn, that is really a big deal late in the game.\n\nShadowrun Returns is a decent ~13 hour long game. (If you'll skip most of the dialogues - you could finish the game in about ~8h-9h easily.) It's worth it, just don't expect to be blown away.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1507146058, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507146058, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35024027", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500991", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1488030257, "steamid": "76561197992988822", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "\"Shadowrun Returns\" is well done, classic RPG. Harebrain transfered the atmosphere splendidly and served us a bit cliche but excellently served story. There are no mindblowing plot twists and those who are a bit more familiar with noir-type stuff will most likely be a bit ahead with the story - but as sais a momentago, it still will be served in excellent way, being source of joy. While this is not an open world game, presented challanges i many (if not most) can be solved in many ways depending of your choice of character and his \\ her developement. It's quite rare that developers design it in a way that will utilise all of those choice, making them all equally viable and not just prefer one. For example in a part where maincharacter infiltrates location and has to find a way to get rest of his team get in as well, you may a) hack the rear door if you ar good enough at decking b) impersonate member of local group and let them in as \"guests\" if you are good enough in soft skills c) move away heavy object to create alternate route (high Streght required) d) convince \\ blackmail member of local group to let them in (proper etiquette known). And the game gives you such opportunities on nearly every step, so additional points for this. Also, \"Shadowrun Returns\" supports modding so you can enjoy additional stories beyond main 8-10 hour campaign or enhance the main campaign with player-created alterations.
