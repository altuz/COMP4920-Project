Really think this one is more ambiant and has a better overall cast of characters.\n\nManaged to get a decent resolution out of the settings and the game was plenty ambiant. AI for poker was not the best but was servicable. Dialogue was really good and its nice to kick back for a game. The camera angles on the cards and the unlockables added a nice twist to things as well as the random events and banter. Best of all I think this is the strongest roster of characters, claptrap, ash from evildead, and both sam & max with only one guy I dont know. Dealer has an auto-tune voice and is from the portal franchise. Wish there were other minigames and stuff around the bar instead of just poker but this is still great. Reminds me a lot of the little mini-simulation that came bundled in with PCGAMER magazine cd roms. They had their demos bundled in a little walking simulator and it was pretty sweet.", "timestamp_updated": 1505113070, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505018287, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34749711", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1409512783, "steamid": "76561198044917795", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's poker with pop culture characters.

When I have 3 of a kind I lose to someone with a pair because it said I only have a pair and they have the winning pair when I actually had 3 of a kind! WTF is wrong with this game.  I have spent more time wanting to punch each AI in the fucking lips for hearing the same crap some out their mouths for 3 years then I have had fun.  And what's wrose is when you are holding a winning hand and all the AI's DID not beat your hand yet one of them wins THEY GLOAT!
