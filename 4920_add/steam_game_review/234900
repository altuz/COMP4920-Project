Does not fullscreen. Vanilla zelda gameplay. Difficulty spikes especially with traps. Odd save system.\n\nSurprisingly decent zelda clone with limited assets, does not fullscreen correctly and needed xboxpad manually configured. Itemization, puzzle/quests and narrative structures are all barebones. Some of the dialogue had a surprisingly dark and twisted edge to it that did not come across as contrived just... oddly placed. Perhaps on purpose due to a later plot reveal. In any case I am not sticking around to find out.
