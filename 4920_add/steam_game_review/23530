"timestamp_updated": 1501577039, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Oh boy where to start ?\n\nto be perfectly honest this game's a bundle of bad game design, frustration and lazyness that very nearly prevented more EDF games to be released to the west.\n\nfor thoses of you hesitating between EDF:IA and EDF 4.1\nDO NOT get Insect armageddon\n\nIts the single worst EDF game out there and you'll get fed up very quickly of the bullsh*t this is gonna put you through\nso let me explain WHY its a bad game\n\nFirst up: Aesthetics \n\nThis game is part of that era of gaming where game devellopers had either all gone colorblind or were in severe depression.\nWhat you'll get here is a bunch generic space marines just barely hiding the fact they're trying to pull the whole \"gears of war\" non-sense of \"little colors, ugly fridges for character\" angle, wich move like they've got something stuck in their *ss and reload their guns by stroking it and reaching for lube in between each stroke leading to very delayed results (more on that later), save for a single class wich instead of stroking his shaking his gun arm like he's trying to shake the gun loose instead of reloading it, but at the very least it won't look as aggravating as the former, speaking of guns, each class has ONE model for each gun type and doesn't change dependant on the gun so if you're hoping for good-looking weapons, I've some bad news for you....\n\nCharacters aren't the only thing that are lackluster as the game seems to pride itself in the fact all buildings (save for thoses outside the map, more on that later) however the devellopers seem to have very quickly grown shy about that and hid the whole thing behind grey blobs of particle effects wich more often than not last far too long for what they do, not to mention most buildings you'll find here are copy-pasted building wich are crammed together as densely as possible to make extra sure you can't see sh*t when they inevitably get destroyed \n\nas far as ennemies go they all more or less look like rubber toys of some kind wich either move in the most generic fashion possible \n\n\nNow onto gameplay:\n\nWhat you're looking at here, is the laziest attempt at a third person shooter I've seen yet, and GOD KNOWS I'm not picky,\nthe main gameplay loop you'll experience is as follows \n\nChoose class, choose guns (or \"buy\" basic ones with a slow accumulating money thats earned through score)\n\ngo into mission \n\nshoot things till dead\n\ngo to next place \n\nshoot again\n\ngo to next place \n\nshoot again\n\nhold \"use\" on something for a couple of seconds (bear in mind if something touches while holding use, the progress on holding use starts over from scratch)\n\ngo to next place \n\nand so on so forth...\n\nNow that wouldn't be bad if the \"shooting things\" part wasn't as boring as watch grass grow, unfortunately you won't have fun chances are, since you have access to a total of 6 types of weapons, three of wich are useful (as in required to use \"useful\") and 3 are pointless as you'll literally never have a opportunity to use them to full potential.\n\nAssuming you use the \"useful\" weapons you'll still have to deal with a design \"faux pas\" that made me hate Gears of war (wich I'll refer to as GoW for short) with a passion, wich is the active reload system, everytime you reload a gun you get a timing mini-game to reload faster, and unlike GoW, nothing else, again if you like this kind of thing it wouldn't be so bad except for a LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THAT IDEA.\n\n\n1: Unlike GoW, you have no point during you're in \"cover\" or safe, the game more or less plays like Serious sam where most of your time spent is spent going one direction and firing in the opposite, so having to deal with that crap on top ain't exactly helping \n\n2: The way weapons work in this game is that each \"weapon\" has its own reload timer (during wich the reload animation just keeps looping non-stop till its finished) and the way it works with the reloading game is that fast reloading weapons are easier to reload and slow reloading are harder to reload, wich is the most backwards crap I ever saw, if slow weapons had a easier reload it would help them keep up with faster reload weapons and give you an actual reason to use that one gun that takes 5 seconds of stroking instead of that other gun wich takes 2 seconds (wich can be further reduced to 1 second easily) almost anytime because you're almost guaranteed to out damage the slower gun\n\nSpeaking of damage, there is no \"strategy\" in this game, its just a raw damage race to whoever deals more damage as your pathetic mobility won't help you dodge 9 times out of 10, in fact the most likely way you'll die is by damaging yourself with your own gun\n\nSpeaking of health and guns, each class has a \"EXP bar\" wich fills using score from the missions you complete, until you \"level up\" your stats will sit there doing nothing, so if you find a mission too difficult, all you can do is find a mission and spam the hell out of it till you actually level up and gain access to guns wich aren't quite as pathetic, and do I have some bad news for you if you hate grinding.\n\nfirst up the AI squad mates the game gives you will siphon away score by killing mobs, making your accumulation of score even slower on top of them being retards that can make your explosive weapons go off in your face point blank, have them try to shoot \"through\" you and subsequently deal you damage, perhaps even stunning you if the bot attempts using a explosive weapon of his own....on top of that the option to disable them must be UNLOCKED by completing a, thankfully, pathetically short campaign of 15 levels (for comparison EDF 4.1 has a minimum of 89)\n\nsecondly the amount of score asked per level up is far too high to make the game enjoyable as if you ARE grinding to make it less of a chore, peoples say that playing dark souls games is \"like bashing your head against a wall until the wall breaks\" and I say NAY, THIS is bashing your head against a wall INDEED, its slow, painful, frustrating and after you're done you get to see YET ANOTHER wall you need to bash and that one's even bigger...\n\nand the \"difficulty\" levels of the game wich are supposedly what gives it more replayability does litterally nothing but multiply all the stats of the mobs by 3, thats it, no new ennemies, no new attacks, no new weapons, no new vehicles (long story short about thoses, they have more health move slower and do less damage than your character and out of 6 vehicles 4 of them are turrets and arguably the mech is a turret with legs)\n\nat the end of the day, the game feels like a unity asset flip: ugly, lazy and boring as sin"}]}
