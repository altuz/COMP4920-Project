Game crashes every hour or so. Software engineering has gone far beyond such poor development practices, i.e., the PAYING customer is in fact NOT the beta tester. For instance, when the game crashes, the crash notice politely suggests that we send the crash report to the developer. As a customer, that's not our job. It\u2019s the developer's job to fully crash test the build BEFORE they release. Poor corporate practice driven by a need to generate revenue at the customer's expense? \n\nOtherwise, an entertaining game with pretty good graphics.  I recommend this game only with the hope that future products will be more customer-focused. \n\nOH, and the tank icons are crap art. Just a collection of a bad jokes of historical accuracy. The game tank sprites are a mixed bag of fairly well-done representations and some epic failures of portraying the actual historic tank.  \n\nExample: the German PZ VI Tiger I tank, one of the most iconic tanks of all time, which the developers have deemed to sell the game on the BLZKRG 3 cover art itself; and they TOTALLY FAILED to portray this legendary tank realistically in the game itself!?  The Tiger I in the game (and the reinforcement icon) is a funny, crappy, JOKE, of a what a Tiger I should actually look like! WTF?! It\u2019s like they made a few tank models and then just modified those (expeditiously) to fill in as, slightly modified, versions of all the other tanks. I mean, they KNOW what a Tiger I looks like, b/c its on the COVER ART itself, but they didn't have the proper direction in the art department to realize that portraying ACTUAL tanks might be a good thing, instead of just some slap-together-fantasy-low-budget-and-our-low-brow-dumb-bumm-customers-are-too-stupid-to-notice mentality?!\n \nWell, guess what? We noticed. In fact, some of us customers are actually interested in history. In fact, some of us have read a book or two on history and that is why WE BOTHERED TO BUY A \"HISTORICAL\" GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE! Cool if you want to make fantasy. Sell fantasy. There is a market.  And\u2026if you want to sell a \"historical\" game, at least, ffs, make the units, at least a tiny bit accurate, and not looking like a version of an AVF that my 6 yr old could do.
