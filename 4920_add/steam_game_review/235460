The sound track is AMAZING, each boss has a perfect soundtrack that really captivates you.\n\n\n\n     boooohooooooo. Time for the reasons I dont like this game (there pretty dumb though). Raiden pulls some stupid impossible feats (not gonna say the feats for spoiler reasons but they are really cool) as awesome as they may be they just wouldent work.
