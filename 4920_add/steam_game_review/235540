For me, this really was the GOTY for 2015, this seems like a sorely overlooked gem honestly. you see the obvious description of \"L4D with ratmen,\" though how i've always felt inclined to describe it as L4D with gameplay, trying to make a point of how this game really takes a step forward in gameplay depth and replayability in the genre archetype L4D brought forth. \n\nI really never did enjoy L4D very much, and between 1 and 2 probably never hit 80 hours back on xbox, and I think to sell Vermintide as simply a L4D reskin does it terrible injustice. While I won't of course say this is the perfection of the style (looking forward to Vermintide 2 and projects from other developers inspired by Fatshark's ideas), to the best of my awareness, it really is the best that's come yet. Vermintide is a game I can call beautiful.\n\nThere is so much about Vermintide I found myself really satisfied with that I didn't expect as I purchased it. The skill ceilling, weapon variety and playstyle nuance between classes all stand out as areas of excellence acheived by the developers. one of the things that really makes the game great is just how different playing the different weapons and classes is, with different hitboxes, frame data, on-hit behavior, dodge lengths and speeds for all of them, all with great flavor and feel to weilding, an A+ no doubt on weapon design, both in the mundane swords, axes and hammers and creative instruments like the different magical staves and bows.\n\nAnd the end-game difficulty, that's something that really won me over and along with the replayability provided by the detail put into class and weapon design ensures me over 1,000 hours in time, I'm still at sub-150 at the time of this review, but this is pretty much set. \nVermintide has a skill ceilling well beyond that of most PvE games, one high enough to satisfy someone who appreciates the challenge present in Monster Hunter and Souls-likes, even with a more easily surmounted initial learning curve. it's easy to jump in on a low difficulty and work your way through the mechanics, especially with the help of the great community, then once you've developed your skills and familarity there's a host of different ways to notch up the difficulty and restrictions of your run up to where you're grinding your face into true-soloing maps with non-upgraded weapons.\n\nFor any of you out there that have put 1,000 or more hours into Monster Hunter and are familiar with that feeling of just tossing your body infront of an end-game elder dragon for weeks at a time until you *finally* succeed, that's a feeling Vermintide offers to bring you in it's endgame. There is legitimate challenge to be had here and consequently legitimate feelings of accomplishment and self-improvement. For Example I've must have spent probably 10 hours so far trying to run the very first level solo on the second to last difficulty with pretty decent equipment yet to no avail, and I know that when I finally do clear it on my own, it will feel just the same as overcoming a difficult roadbloack in Monster Hunter, and even after that reward there will be many more opportunities to feel it with still more improvement to make and skill to build.\n\nThis has been the first review I've written for steam, I'm sorry it hasn't been very mechanical, technical or formal, frankly I've been one-sided and imbalanced, but I've done the best to convey how I really feel about this game. I highly recommend this game to anybody who thought that L4D may have been a nice idea, but that the game itself was too simple and repetitive, or to anybody who appreciates a challenging and deep PvE experience.

In fact, this is my second favorite loot system, the Borderlands series being my first favorite.  The shrine in the Red Moon Inn allows you to unlock weapon traits and change them.

Vermintide does a ton differently and in an effective manner, mostly the focus on melee combat and items as progression. \n\nI really like the melee combat in this game. Each melee weapon has a set of attacks with an arc and damage type. Sweeping strikes are good for clearing mobs of rats but tend not to do much damage. Precision strikes are murderous if you hit the head and can pierce the armor of Stormvermin, a specialist enemy.\n\nSince each weapon has a different move set, there is a lot of variety even within an individual character class.\n\nThe bad:\nThe game has an unpredictable difficulty curve. Green Items help to beat Normal missions, while Blue are generally required to beat Hard missions. Grinding the gear is also heavily randomized so that throws a wrench in the flow of the game.\nThe game REQUIRES teamwork, full stop. I only recommend this game if you have a group of friends that are into it and will play it with you - there is no single player content, and the AI bots will let you down if you play solo.\nSometimes the rats make no noise and surprise you.

Weapons attack in set combos, and being familiar with your chosen weapon is very rewarding.\n\nThe loot system is significantly smoothed out now, with the access of a bounty board for loot and materials from level 8, and the ability to pray for new gear through the shrine.

I can't reccomend this game enough, personally. You have 5 characters to choose from that all have different roles and a very large arsenal of weapons to choose from. BUT you have to unlock them in game by playing. Playing on a more difficult difficulty gives you a better chance to get better loot with the best of the items (red and orange tier) not even showing up on normal and hard difficulties.\n\nOkay now about the loot system that people seem to have a huge problem with. Assuming you complete the mission there's a screen at the end of the game that consists of 7 dice. each dice has 6 sides and a 2/6 chance to land heads up. If you pick a up a tome of which there are 3 in a mission, you get those 2/6 dice replaced with 4/6 dice. Getting a grimoire which gives a massive down side of everyone in the party losing 1/3 of their maximum health. BUT if you make it to the end of the mission, then you get a guaranteed face up dice. Some people really hate it, but personally I think it feels like good progression.\n\nOf the 5 characters, the Empire soldier, the dwarf, and the viktor saltzpyre are all mostly melee based. But Sienna and the elf are both ranged focused. However, what i like about Vermintide is that while this is while that is typically correct, you aren't forced to play it that way. You can pick up melee focused staffs (staves?) for sienna and melee focused bows for the elf. You can also choose to be more ranged as the dwarf or viktor. If you can use the weapons well, then you can do whatever you want.\n\nAs a side note, try to play online.
