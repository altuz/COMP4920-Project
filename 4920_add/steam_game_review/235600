This is what happened.\n\nOnce upon a time I get home from school and after stressful homework, I decide that I want to enjoy some Tom Clancy's: Splinter Cell Blacklist by Tom Clancy presented and published by Ubisoft. I log onto the game and click the 'online' button and get the message \"cannot connect to blacklist, please try again later,\" or something like that. Basically, online mode doesn't work at all. I spend literally 4 hours researching solutions, I port-forwarded everything correctly, turn off useless network adapters, turned off everything VPN related, pretty much everything you could possibly think of.\n\nI gave up after that and tried more solutions the next day, still no luck. Afterwards it was pointed out to me that my connetion is running through another router and it's stopping me from connecting. Unfortunately, I can't port-forward that one because I did not know the password. I give up. Completely. I play Grand Theft Auto V for 2 days, which is also completely broken at the moment.\n\n2 days later my buddy tells me that he just wants me try it again for the hell of it. I do. Uplay seems to have self uninstalled. I go to the website and download it. It installs and I launch the game. This is when the online decides it's done being gay and works for absolutely no reason. My guess is Uplay was out of date but didn't automatically update because it's a disease. We try to play co-op and we are presented with another error message and I lose my shit. For some odd reason, however, SvM works and we both connect to a lobby together. After playing that we try connecting to a private lobby again and out of nowhere it works.\n\nSo in conclusion, don't buy this game because it's like 4 or 5 years old or something and Uplay is a roadblock of enjoyment, the developers are closely matching the stupidity of EA, and I wasted about a week of my sanity getting a game that I will get bored of in 3 days to work correctly.

It's a much better port than Conviction was ie smoother aiming, and it's just a lot of fun overall. And it's super easy to recover if you futz a headshot (mostly due to the better mouse aiming). I like that the game gives you various options for dealing with situations. Go loud, stalk and kill, or completely evade everyone. When you manage to beat an entire level without using any items and without disturbing anyone and never being seen at all, it feels so satisfying. You really are like a ghost. The most professional of spies. No lightbulbs shot, no cameras disabled, no guards knocked out, not even any smoke grenades tossed. In and out without anyone ever knowing you were even there. Or, if you'd rather just stealth headshot everyone wiht a silenced sniper rifle, you can do that too. Or quietly stalk and kill everyone with melee from behind or above, like a real panther. Or if you get bored of that, load up on loud weapons and hand grenades and intentionally make as much noise as possible.\n\nSo yeah, tl;dr, I love this game. It's even more fun than 6 was, but 6 is still really good. I don't like that they took out the \"enhanced interrogation\" scenes cause those were fun and hilarious.

Yes it's simpler than the older splinter cells and even more \"action-y\" but I'm not going to be all die-hard fan about this stuff. I loved this game. This is one of my favorite games for the sake of the singleplayer and coop alone... but...\n\nMULTIPLAYER: But then you have multiplayer... mmm... mhmmm... MMMM MMM MMMM BOI let me tell you about multiplayer alright? Splinter Cell Blacklist: Spies VS Mercs multiplayer, their main mode, their bread and butter. They straight up eviscerated all the balancing from the first game (When I say first game I mean the Double Agent: Spies vs Mercs mode) and turned it into a fest of feces. I have never been more legitimately tilted at a game in my life. EVER. It's not just the fact that it's painful to play with broken mechanics + max level players meta-ing the FUCK out of you, it hurts 5x more because it USED to be a good gamemode in Double Agent. Now instead of tactical slow-ish paced gameplay with moments of action that are impactful, it's literally (and yes I do actually mean literally) a random spawn, team meta, OP gadget spam, lives last about 15-30 seconds, spy's bend over and ram mercs for 5-10 minutes fest... I mean... I mean just WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE SPIES BE ABLE TO MELEE FROM THE FRONT IN OPEN COMBAT, THAT'S NOT HOW A \"SPY\" IS PLAYED YOU GOD DAMN DUNDERHEADS. \n\nWhen you're a spy trying to sneak around but get seen and have to deal with a highly trained mercenary wearing armor and sporting heavy weaponry right in front of you but it's ok because you just pressed E and lunged at his throat, killing him with an animation lasting about 0.5 seconds so you can either run off to kill his friend who just watched you water the ground with his buddy\u2019s blood or run off to hide for a second and regenerate the health you lost from taking 4 bullets to the chest, after all the more health you have as a spy the longer you can straight up sprint at a merc opening fire on you to tap E and kill him instantly from the front with zero retaliation from said highly trained merc who\u2019s literally expecting you to try and melee him from the front... Oh speaking of melee, did I mention the mercs also get melee kill animations against the spies that look totally badass but you know unlike in the singleplayer where if you try to melee an alert opponent or a heavy soldier (which the mercs are) from the front they push you back and you have to find a way to deal with them that involves actually being a spy, mercs have less melee range than the spies so if both melee from the front the spy wins even though the merc is actively expecting and engaging in melee combat with the spy... also the mercs melee kill animations only work if you, haha get this friends, GET BEHIND THE SPIES. YOU KNOW THE SPIES WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO SNEAK AROUND GET A 360 DEGREE PRESS E TO KILL BUT THE MERCS WHO ARE BASED AROUND OPEN COMBAT CAN ONLY DO A KILL ANIMATION WHEN THEY SNEAK UP ON THE SPIES. \n\nWHEN THEY SNEAK UP\nON THE SPIES\n\nI'm not even going to mention- well I'll mention very briefly the fact that a group of 2 spies working together can out-gun a mercenary because, guess what, spies get main weapons in this game and the only thing saving mercs (because it sure as hell isn't their \"armor\") is the fact that spy main weapons tend to have low accuracy... I mean, you gotta have something preventing the game from being Ghost Recon: Future Soldier vs Call of Duty soldier.\n\nSo tell you what, you wanna have singleplayer and coop fun in one of the best Splinter Cell games ever, buy this game\u2019s deluxe edition and have a party. But listen, if you\u2019re a bit too calm in life, if you never really get upset or mad when you should, if your woman is asking you to be more assertive in the relationship and you just don\u2019t have that fire in you, SPIN UP THE \u2018OL UBISOFT ACCOUNT AND GIVE THE SPIES VS MERCS FUCKING GODFORSAKEN CARNIVAL FROM HELL A TRY BECAUSE IT\u2019LL SURE IGNITE THOSE PASSIONATE FIRES DEEP WITHIN YOU MY FRIEND", "timestamp_updated": 1506747983, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506747331, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34751898", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1431832438, "steamid": "76561198132384745", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "No ubisoft cloud save.
