I also appreciate the game being Steam workshop enabled so I can download mods from the community.  But the engine itself falls flat.  Like its predecessor, the game is poorly optimized.  Achievements don't track, explanations are poor, and the game crashes when I exit it.  Not to mention there's issues when using tracks from YouTube.  There is controller support for both normal and SC, and is adequate, but not preferred.\n\nDownload the demo, first.

This ruins the fun that the game is originally designed for and it has not been patched yet. This is the main reason why people don't recommend this in the first place [spoiler] Though, this may not hold true for all, but when I play the game at offline mode, it crashes \"less often\" than normal. [/spoiler]\n\n- Price: The game is not worth the full price, with all it's flaws and all, it should be worth 75% less that it currently is. \n\n-Achievements: (?) This may not hold true for all, but for my experience, The achievements aren't unlocking (with the exception of a few) I have tried this on multiple rigs but it still won't unlock. This isn't really much of a concern of the game itself, but as a game with achievements, they should be unlocked when you have met the conditions\n\n \n\nI still recommend the game, but it really isn't worth the price.
