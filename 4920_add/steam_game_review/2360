The gameplay relies on puzzle solving in different \"hub\" maps, where you can access 4-6 other via portals in any order. The puzzle solving includes pressing some button, activating some switch, and key hunting. On the way you slaughter a few hundred demons, of course. Other difference is that you can choose from three character classes: the fighter, the cleric and the mage - they all use different weapons, so it adds a great deal of replayability to the game.\nSo if you like a little bit of exploring and \"what the hell this switch opened?\" moments with your regular killing spree, you'll enjoy Hexen."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501197056, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486700", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33843431", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046675266", "num_reviews": 606, "last_played": 1501196947, "num_games_owned": 1393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1501197056, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1]The indirect sequel to Heretic.\n\nMore characters to choose from, more enemies, weapons, potions.\nEverything you'd expect from the next game from the series.\n\nThe music and gameplay are much better on the Nintendo 64 though, I remember this game well from renting it back then all the time.\n\nGreat game, glad to see it on PC!\n\n8/10[/h1]"}]}
