I asked a question in the forum, and this game is 5-6 years old in retail and they answered it. After beating it on easy, i decided to write this review, so here is my pro/con breakdown:\n\nPROS:\n\n~Great ARPG very similiar to diablo 1 and 2\n~You can choose which class you want\n~Lots of quests and dungeons\n~Covenants for who is to rule the town\n~Treasure like in diablo that is colored for rarity\n~Teleports and gates\n~You can recruit random heroes on the map walking around and killing monsters\n\n\nCONS:\n\n~One town in the whole game. This game is basically confined to one town, and you go out to do dungeons and such.\n~The difficulty is quite high in my opinon, even on easy\n~Recruiting is a pain since the quest to recruit someone is usually above your character's level\n~You can only have one person in your party. So it is your main character, and one hero.\n~Graphics are older. Some people may care about this, but it did not bother me\n\nRecommended for fun ARPG stategy. There are different difficulties depending on levels."}]}
