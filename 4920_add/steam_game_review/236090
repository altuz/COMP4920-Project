Categories typically get a base score, followed by pros and cons.\n\n\nGraphics: 8/10\n==========\nMost graphics appear to be hand drawn with some 3D work thrown in here and there. It comes together, for the most part, pretty darn well. There are a few nit picky things that bother me (such as the shadows on some of the drawings, they don't look natural), but on the whole, they look great. +8\n\n\nSound: 9/10\n=========\nA game where I separate sound and music. The sounds effects are great for the most part but not outstanding. +7\n\nVoice acting is pretty damn good. I'm happy to see the work that went into it. +2\n\n\nMusic: 10/10\n=========\nJesus the music in this game is unbelievable. Every track in every world fits great with the given setting and sounds fantastic. The battle music especially is just soooo damn good. 10 out of freaking 10. +10\n\n\nStory: 7/10\n========\nYou are Dust. You have woken up in some random forest and your memory is gone. All that's around you is a talking sword and the guardian of said sword. Lets go get our memory back. +6\n\nFinal battle itself is fantastic. +2\n\nThe antagonist could stand to be bit more evil. -1\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n===========\nOh lawd the gameplay. Yeah, it's a fast paced hack and slash side scroller with great moves, new abilities as you progress, craftable equipment, healing items, and level ups where you can distribute new stat points. There are various quests you can take part in to get new gear and more XP. +7\n\nThe whirlwind attack is bloody fantastic. Combining it with the Thunder you get later in the game is always a joy. +1\n\nDifficulty modes are fun and fair (I played on Tough. It was fairly tough). +1\n\nThroughout my (2nd technically) playthrough, I didn't do a single side quest. I'm extremely happy this game doesn't force the side questing upon you in order to continue the game (whether it be because you're not strong enough, and need to do side questing to get strong enough, or a side questing tutorial). +1\n\nThe jump between stat points with each given level is far too outrageous and exponential. This goes for items as well. Level one you'll get like 10 more attack power, then level 2 will give you 50 more. This is too great of a leap and made areas far too easy only after gaining a couple levels. -1\n\n\nOverall: 8.6/10 (43/50 = 0.86)\n=====================\nContrary to what normally happens, I was extremely bored at the start of this game. My boredom swiftly vanished after a few hours of gameplay where the story began to really kick in. Other players who love the side scrolling genre and want some great fast-paced action gameplay with RPG elements thrown in should give this game a try.

(Just as useful as a Fidget-spinner)\nHis quest is to regain his memory and save the world - Doing so will save multiple lives, but kill just as many. Actually you'll probably kill more monsters, since this is a Hack&Slash game with endless spawns of creatures to slay.\n\n[h1] Positive wagging tail\t[/h1]\nThe story is great, and most of the sidequests blends well in with the main story. \nThe story is a mystery right up till the end, since Dust has amnesia. - However don't put this into the average amnesia hero/heroin story, where you have [spoiler] A troubled past, but the bond you make with friends on your journey changes you to choose the right decision at the end and save the world. There's a twist.\t[/spoiler]\n\nThe combat-system works fluently, with a lot of combos to make. Spam the keyboard and have fun. \nThere's also a big variety of enemies, and enemy abilities for a Hack&Slash game. Play it on the hardest mode where they one-hit kills you.\n\nThe scenery and especially backgounds are beautiful - Sometimes you can see the layers, but it's rare - The graphic is done well with smooth cutscenes & fighting effects. \nHand-drawn, just saying.\n\nThe music is powerful and you really don't get tired of it. I spend 35 hours ingame, and still return to Youtube for the soundtrack.\nDifferent tracks for different areas, which really suits each \"world\", and the battlemusic is as epic as a firebreathing Pink Fairy Armadillo [spoiler] (This animal doesn't breathe fire, but it's still damn cute)\t[/spoiler]\n\nSidequests and eastereggs are in a huge abundance.\nThey blend well in with the story and are so enjoyable that you really need to explore every nook and cranny. Which you still do since you unlock small parts in visited areas as you gain new abilities. \nHowever if you don't like returning to an area 2-3 times to discover 100% you won't like this grind-game.\n\n[h1] Negative Tail Between Legs\t[/h1]\nThe combat might seem repetitive - But that's to be expected, monsters respawn in areas, and you need to revisit most areas 2-3 times.\n\nI beat this game on the normal and hardest difficulty, so it holds some replay-value, but of course it's less enjoyable when you know the story. \nHowever if you're the type to bond with characters and get emotional, this will just be like re-reading a good book over and over again. \n\nSlow start. It takes a little for the story and gameplay to really kick off.
