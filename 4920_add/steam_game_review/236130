There are just so many things that are not ready, not implemented, not documented or explained, that it is simply not an enjoyable experience.\n\nThis review was written with the current \"release\" version of the game as of February 9th, 2014.\n\nSo, the list :\n\n--Build Queue-- \n\nNon existant. You mean you want to build 3 of mother ship 1, 2 of mother ship 2, and 4 of mother ship 4? Not gonna happen unless you manually go back to each planet where ships are building and do that manually. \n\nNot only is there NO build queue, you are locked into 4 ships of each \"class\". 4 scouts, 4 transports (including colonizer), 4 cruisers and 4 motherships. What does that mean? That means you can only have 4 ship designs of each type and if you want to make a new one you have to over-write another one. \n\nThose two aspects of basic functionality being missing or kludgy really reminds of games from 1980. \n\n\n--Combat--\n\nThis is probably the most tedious space combat of any of this genre I have played in a long while. I started playing games on the commodore VIC20/Commodore 64, and I've played quite a few of these over the years. It is just very convoluted and tedious.\n\nWant to turn your ship so your weapons face a target? Good luck! Click on the screen and it may rotate 1/8th of a rotation...PER TURN.... Which may or may not be the direction you wanted. \n\nTargetting in combat is flaky. If an enemy ship occupies the same square as one of yours or very close to it? You can't target that enemy, at all, by anything. Zooming in or out does not help and all you can do is move that ship which now means you have pointed one or more of your weapons away from combat. \n\n--Quests---\n\nIts hard to call these things quests. You get a random message, about something that happened that you may or may not be anywhere near ( it tells you your \"fleet\" flew by XYZ even though you had no ships anywhere near there, ever.), then when you try to step through it, the next \"step\" may or may not exist, work, or even be understandable. \n\n\"No Mr.Pirate, i want the REAL hammer!, Fine, come get it! meet me at XYZ\".  Go to XYZ, nothing. Survey entire system. nothing. Survey each planet. Nothing. Station fleet at XYZ for 3 real time hours, nothing. \n\n--Technologies--\n\nTerraforming - This is probably the most confusing tech in the game. The \"manual\" has exactly one occurrence of the word terraform in it, and it is a sentence that basically says \"Yup, it exists\". What does it do? nothing. Researched to level 10 and those limited habitat planets arent improved. Sure you can now colonize \"toxic\" planets, but it is not at all clear if terraforming made that possible, or other techs. \n\nThere is no information, the description in game says nothing useful, there is no method to initiate it no discernable effect from it, and the manual is utterly silent with respect to it. \n\nWeapons and other systems are normalized to the point of simply being clones of each other with a different name. Yes, there are minor \"effect\" differences, but again, like most systems/things in the game, you have no idea if it is really happening, working, or even implemented.\n\n\n--Ship design--\n\nAside from only having a maximum of 4 ship designs for each type before you have to over-write a previous one, there is no method to modify one design to the next as in a refit. In fact, the only \"refit\" in the game that exsists is that you have to fly a colonizer ship to a planet with a starbase before it can colonize again. lets say you have a cruiser with laser cannons on it and you want to instead have that existing ship re-fit with a newer design that uses plasma cannons. Nope, Can't do it.\n\nThis is a base feature of almost every game in this genre.\n\nThere is absolutely no customization. Ships have 8 \"hardpoints\" for weapons, 2 on each side, 2 front, and 2 at rear. There are no ship layouts as in its appearance, no anything except, put weapon here or not, make it light, regular or heavy. \n\n--Strange stuff, bugs, etc--\n\nAfter playing for 10 hours, the Varaians (the ancient energy race and progenitors of EVERYTHING) are the strongest, largest, and most powerful empire in the galaxy and all of a sudden, without being attacked by ANYONE, they are simply \"defeated\". Poof. They evaporate. No one was attacking them (I am in all of their systems with an alliance with them). They just simply decide to stop existing. \n\nThey had so much military power that the very few times anyone aside from me (with an alliance with them) wandered in, just a couple of their ships utterly wiped out whatever flew by and then bam. Gone.\n\nThis was the third occurrence of this happening to a race, they just decide they don't want to be in the game any longer and poof. \n\nThere are more issues, oddities, and things (most notable documentation) missing, but this is long enough already with enough specific examples.\n\nThis game is simply not ready for prime time yet.  I applaud a new indie developer for trying to break into the market, truly, i realize its a tough thing to do, but even with that said, it can't change the reality of what this game is and is not. \n\nI didnt go into it expecting a multi-million dollar budget production, but I certainly did go into it expecting something with far more playability.", "timestamp_updated": 1391988335, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1391980067, "votes_down": 47}, {"recommendationid": "10867324", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 152, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648973", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403867319, "steamid": "76561198036822050", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I am a big fan of space empire games and was hoping for this to finally break the spell of bad luck I have been having trying to find a game I can really enjoy to play (I think I am about 7-8 games and \u00a3100 down now with no real winner) Sadly this was not the case as I have not enjoyed this game, so much so that this is the first review I have been compelled to write. \n\nAs a point of reference my favourite space empire games so far are Star Wars Supremacy and Imperium Galactica 2.\n\nI find the gameplay here impossibly difficult, there is only one basic strategy of expansion as quickly as possible which proves impossibe against AI oponents who seem to have an endless stream of better equipt and easily replaceable ships and space stations to which there is no defence. Combat usually comes down to numbers/technology and on a game that is not massively graphically interesting this means battles are dull and also very long as they are also turn based. Even when I manage to win a battle I find the opponants have so many more ships that any progress is nerfed pretty quickly.\n\nThe tech tree is fine as you can discover new technologies (although this happenes randomly thorugh a breakthrough system), but it is difficult to see any positive results of better technology and it takes an age to research or build anything. The technologies mostly just improve something you already had rather than giving you a new item/building.\n\nThe turn button will become your best friend in this game. Building a medium ship, say a cruiser, even at a reasonable point in the game with a few planets will take at least 20-30 turns and each turn equaltes to a year. This is a long time for anything to be build and means that unless you have at least 5-10 decent planets building a fleet takes so long to build if an enemy declares war on you suddenly you don't stand a chance.\n\nGraphic are suitable to the task but there is a lack of any real customisation on your ships other than put laser here and cannon here, you also can't really chose what core systems (engines etc) you use as the games just choses whichever you have reasearched furthest (this makes it impossible to create armadas of large, cheap ships). Planets also don't have any 3D models but just a picture of the building which is very behind the times and I expect a game in 2014 to be visually much better than games I played 10 years ago, this is not.\n\nFleets are limited to 10 ships (for some unknown reason) but you can send more than one fleet into a combat zone. I don't see the point of the artificial limit on fleet sizes then as again this just means a lot of clicking to move all your fleets into one area.\n\nThere is also not a lot to build on your planets, most planets are limited to 9 building overall, when you consider there are 5 different types this does not leave much scope for development.\n\nLike most games diplomacy seems to rely on the AI demanding things on a whim for no real reason and refusing any request no matter how reasonable or bennificial to them it may be. Also there is no espionage/spying aspect to the game.\n\nI want to like this game and can forgive some its less developed aspects if I had been rewarded with good, or even adaquate, gameplay. It is good good have a simple game, and in its defence this is a simpl,e game to understand and play, which is easy to get into unlike some 4x4 games which are very complicated.\n\nOn a more positive note this game uses a credit system and most items/ships costs billions of credits. Its nice to see a more realistic game where a planet's output is not 120 credits and its costs 400 credits to build a unit, I do like a more realistic financial scale! Although saying that and back to the negative there is no way to really change you financial settings to improve morale/make more money other than a simple click button for each planet, not a great fine tuning financial system.\n\nSadly though the lack of any real strategy/tactics along with the ridiculous pace at which the AI progresses in its technology and ship building means that I would steer clear of this game presently, if it was reduced to \u00a35 it may be worth a purchase but at \u00a311 I still feel cheated.", "timestamp_updated": 1403869054, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "8", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403869054, "votes_down": 31}, {"recommendationid": "8978306", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 222, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667727", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1421272667, "steamid": "76561198043480965", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Horizon is a nice mid-core 4X space game.\nIs it worth the price?

It hits all the proper 4x elements, it's stable, has a diverse selection of races... but it's just not all that fun. I have yet to ever play a game all the way through. The developer has been great (I've seen frequent meaningful updates), it does everything it's supposed to do, but in the end it makes me long for Star Trek: Birth of the Federation. The two games are very similar but Horizon is just missing that extra something that makes it special. BOTF benefited from the existing Star Trek universe, but it also really captured the feel of the races by using custom UI for each one and having a nice balance of unique traits. If you can find that game, it's great. If the developers have not played it I recommend they do. The universe in Horizon is just too stale as is. Maybe that's it.\n\nAnyway, great game that is well worth supporting, but I can't recommend when there are other better games out there.", "timestamp_updated": 1447719135, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "15", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447719135, "votes_down": 29}, {"recommendationid": "9019867", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 82, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569196", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1391878343, "steamid": "76561198031572647", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Waste of time. I can't really think of anything I like in this game. The techs are boring because they are balanced to the point of repitition. For example, all the engine techs give you the same speed bonus per level. They only have slight variations in power/size but it means you really just stick to researching 1 engine the whole game. You don't seem to ever discover a tech that is truly \"better\" which makes it uninteresting. Seems even more so for guns. For example I start with laser cannons and then suddenly once I reached a certain level of laser cannon I discovered plasma bolt cannon. OK now I can kick some ass right? It has the same exact qualities as the laser cannon! Same size, cost, damage and the same perks, though maybe the perks come at slightly shuffled research levels than laser. Boring!!! \n\nThe game does have a tactical battle feature but it's pretty tedious. You can't automatically have ships flee, the rotation mechanics are busted (doesnt seem to rotate ship direction I want to). Then there is the annoying tendency of the tactical battle view to watch neutral ships wander around space near your colonies. \n\nSomething is really weird with the game economy.

Vidoe/Graphics are quite well done. Some of the alien planet video is just simply wonderfully beautiful. And i can tell the animator of this game really enjoyed their work and made jokes in some of the videos.\n\n2. Music is a little subpar. But for indie game it can still be tolerated. Please improve this if you can for next game.\n\n3. Gaming interface is quite linear and it doesn't feel 3D at all. It's a universe so it should look like one. \nIf you turn off the grid the universe interface just look like a mess but if you leave the grid on it doens't look good at all.\n\n4. Tech is weird for this game too which you don't really get a tech tree. You reach base on % of you send in 6 types and you can focus on 1 specific tech one it become available. IT's just too much of a random chance. You need a Major Breakthough for a tech to show up and you need another Breakthough to start finnal getting advantage of it. \n\n5. Race balance is really bad. This game is a colonization sim so if you can live in poison/metal planet from start you gain huge expansion advantage. Since tech research is based on random breakthough.

It's better than many of the generic half-baked 4X games which are flooding the market as disposal-ware, but there are some very real drawbacks which limit the enjoyability of the game.\n\nFor newcomers to the 4X genre who are looking to sink their teeth into a strategy game with some structure and a relatively low learning curve and don't mind the dated graphics, I'm giving this game a thumbs-up. \n\nFor veterans of the genre, who are well-versed in games like Endless Space, GalCiv II and III, Distant Worlds or the Sword of the Stars franchise, I'm giving this a thumbs-down.\n\nFor starters there are some very unique strengths to this game which are stand-out from the rest.\n\nAlthough almost every 4X game features the same exact tropes (types) of races, Horizon manages to give the in-game civilizations a sense of substance and personality which many other games lack. The in-game universe may not necessarily be as flushed as Endless Space, GalCiv or SotS, but the races present in the game are tweaked just enough from their stereotypes to make themselves unique---and the uniqueness of these races lend themselves to an almost genuine interactive quality. Species traits are certainly more than just window dressing, but the mechanics from one species to the next are mostly identical (unlike, say, GalCiv or ES, but much better than the generic games on the market).\n\nThe research and development process in the game is a refreshingly unique take on R&D systems. Unlike most games, where R&D focuses on one single tech at a time, Horizon has a system similar to the research points and tech levels structure found in Paradox's Hearts of Iron 3---with a measure of blind development to make things even more interesting. The way breakthroughs are often realized isn't through normal R&D channels, however, but by finding artifacts and other neat little details hidden throughout the stars. Exploration directly leads to new technological development, which makes the R&D system a lot more dynamic than most other 4X games out there.\n\nUnfortunately, the R&D results don't feel particularly \"real\" in-game. For the vast majority of them, they are simply stat-modifiers. Advancements in construction technology will make colony-building construction faster, but it won't change the buildings which are available. Advancements in weapons and propulsion will add new weapons and subsystems which can be deployed, but ship-types are fixed from the start. Just as planetary development is strictly linear for each class of building, so too is ship design and deployment.\n\nShips are limited. Significantly. In contrast to some of the generic disposal-ware games on the market, 16 unique ship-models, limited to four variants in four size-classes may seem like a nice spectrum for deployment. When contrasted with the dynamic models presented in Endless Space, or the complete from-scratch construction system for GalCiv II and III, or the custom-function design approach used in Sword of the Stars, ship design feels incredibly flat. Ship design is very strictly limited to a handful of weapon placement positions and placeholders for whatever systems are available for use. All four hull sizes and variants are accessible to the player from the start, no additional R&D required. \n\nIt wouldn't be so bad, but the models for these ships look extremely dated once they engage in combat. The graphics look like they would be perfectly comfortable in the mid 2000s, but even against some of the generic disposal-ware 4X games, they look dated. Similarly, it's a very nice touch that Horizon has animated cut-scenes for first contact moments and other milestones, however, these cut-scenes too look like they are from the mid 2000s as well.\n\nIn summary, Horizon is a very mixed product. Some components feel incredibly well thought-out and they look great. Other components look rough, even dated, and seem to be poorly conceived and weak in implementation. \n\nOrdinarily, I don't care about sales----usually, I'll argue that a game is either worth buying full price, or not worth buying at all---but this is not a product worth paying full-price for.\n\nAnd the conclusion? If you want a straight-forward 4X game with some meat but not the level of complexity which the best-in-class games demand, then Horizon is a good solid choice, as long as you don't mind some of the graphics and other limitations.

Finally the 4X space strategy game that is at least as good but probably much better than master of orion I and II. I can't believe it, especially with the mixed ratings that it got. I could write pages and pages of text about it to show how good it is, but nobody would read it so ill try to keep it short and simple. Here it goes:\n\n- The game is a typical 4X strategy game where you build and colonize new planets to expand your empire. You build ships and conquer worlds! The strategy part can be pretty deep. Long range view of things is needed for you to succeed at the highest level of difficulty.\n- The game looks like it started with the freeorion game package and expanded from there. The galaxy map looks good, the planetary interface is good too, but the ship combat and research interface are a bit underwhelming. They are functional, but not great.\n- Each planet is independent and must be colonized. Systems can have as many as 10 planets or as few as none! You can also automate the planet building and management with governors who will develop it just like you want to. For example: Agricultural governor, Industrial governer, Research governor, etc.\n- On each planet, you have 3 to 4 ship queue(depending if you have a shipyard built or not).  So you can actually build 4 ships at the same time! Each queue is for each ship size which are 'small', 'medium transport/colony', 'cruiser' and 'mothership'.\n- You have default designs and named ships but you can redesign them at your heart content! Space on the ship is your limiting factor (also how much it will cost to build, but hey if you're rich, why not put all the bells and whistle on it!)\n- Starting Technologies with random tek tree every game. If you are very unlucky, too bad for you! Adaptation is the key here. Also, you can't see which tek leads to what so you never know when you are going to get a new tek. You get surprised often! (Like when i got terraforming by increasing my tek level in bioweapon! I was like Da fuck? Yeaaaah!)\n- You can find all kind of nifty things by digging on planets with archeology sites. Especially new tek that you don't have in your tek list. Or greatly improving one or more of your teks.\n- Tek research is slow. It takes awhile to build your colony and the needed research labs that will boost the speed of your research. This means you got to use your tek plenty before you get to something better.\n- Ships can be refitted with better tek components or new ones for that matter. The cost of refitting depends on how much change has been done to the design.\n- Diplomacy is actually pretty good and the ai is not insane. Each race seems to have a distinct personality too, but nothing too mind blowing. Still, it is pretty solid. If they like you, they are not suddenly going to war against you out of nowhere unless you did something bad! (You naughty you!). The interface is functional, but not very good graphically speaking. Still, it works fine so who cares!\n- You have a limited number of war ships that you can have at the same time until you improve your logistic tek and build a shit ton of starbases. This means you have to weight carefully your needs before building a new ship. And scrapping ships is actually a good thing to do when your needs change. The limit of ships is a soft one before you start paying INSANE maintenance on each new ship, so if youre very rich, you can still bust the limit with little problems, but the maintenance cost gets very high very fast so i do not recommend doing this very often or for long.\n- There is ground invasion. I haven't tried it yet but you can bomb and invade with troops. There are many tek you can improve to help you with ground combat: tanks, hovercraft, aircraft, bombers, personnel carriers, rifle slugs, neutrino guns and plenty more! You can become a god at invading planets or defending from invasion too!\n\nNow the cons of this game:\n\n- The graphic are so so. This is not a game with pretty graphic. They are not horrible, but they look like they have been done without any artist or a bad one or they just didn't have the time to pretty them. I'm very glad that they didn't waste their time on graphics honestly because then we would have a shitty game like master of orion 3 with superb graphic and good looking interface (that wasn't functional nor intuitive nor very usable) and a bad game to play. They concentrated on making the game fun to play and plenty challenging too!\n- The sound is appropriate and the music is good. You don't get tired of hearing the same music, it fits the space age theme of the game very well.\n- Going with the graphics, the cutscene are note very good either, but hey you don't care!\n\nI'm giving a 10/10 on this game for the overall awesomeness of it. You like long winded, slow building, deep strategy game? This game is your next lover!\n\nSee ya!\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1420052340, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420052340, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "14796968", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529470", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1488412322, "steamid": "76561198026332265", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I like this game. As far as 4X games go, it has most of the desirable features available in other games of the same genre. The Technology Tree is expansive enough to keep you researching new techs forever it seems.

I thought the ability to custom design your own player race a great feature, but I wish there was a greater selection of possible portraits to select from.

You get to move and target your ships unlike in Endless Space where you play combat cards. However, ground combat is sit back and watch, you get no input on how it unfolds.
