It really is rare that I drop a game after a couple of hours.\nStarpoint Gemini 2 disappoints across the board from the start. Controlling your vessel is so finnicky and nervous and switching between the control modes is disorienting and confusing, especially considering the fact that the third control option \"turret control\" is only available during mouse control but then switches the control mode to keyboard control.\nThe turret control mode is so disorienting and with no aiming help correcting for enemy speed and direction becomes impossible. Also, while fruitlessy attempting to keep track of enemy ships that swirl around you like angry hornets, you have to steer your ship using your keyboard. Now I know some of you will say \"well you need more time getting used to it\". Well, that may be true if it wasn't so damn frustrating and unrewarding that you don't even want to spend more time.\nAnother highly frustrating factor is grinding for loot. There is no easy way to separate valuables from trash and the general value of looted/mined items is so low that the whole endeavor doesn't make sense anyway.\nNext, autopilot will happily crash into anything in your way. Not a desireable feature when travel times can range in minutes (get up to get a drink? Better not risk leaving that gameboy brained autopilot unattended for a second). Travel times are too long in gerneral anyways.\nI feel like I had another couple of things on my mind that I hated but oh well, that seems enough I guess...\n\nWhy can't make anyone a \"Sid Meyer's Pirates\" conversion into space? That would be the best space exploration/survival ever!
