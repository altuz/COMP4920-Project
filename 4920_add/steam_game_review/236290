The player can (and has to) rotate the \"board\" to match the marbles. Three or more of the same color will remove them from the board, which then causes now loosened marbles to bounce off and gravitating back, which allows for quite spectacular and fireworks-like combinations.\n\nThere are numerous special marbles, such as the traditional bombs, and power-ups, like those that remove all marbles of a specific color. The game includes hundreds of levels in the story mode, and it also features a variety of endless/random modes, with the \"lightning\" mode perhaps being the most enjoyable one.\n\nThere are also Steam achievements and local highscores. The only feature I've been missing are Steam leaderboards, but this aside, this is a fairly enjoyable, fast-paced (at least deeper in the story mode and in Lightning) and smoothly running casual game (which can be quite hardcore). The developers have been very responsive to feature requests.\n\nWorth checking out, especially at the very inexpensive super-budget price.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1370882308, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1370882308, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "846608", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501301", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1479980251, "steamid": "76561197980016797", "num_games_owned": 1404, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Cranky Cat: Of Steamwork and Bubble Obscura", "timestamp_updated": 1385406170, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1371583733, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "12420168", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502507", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1461302872, "steamid": "76561197967608630", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I JUST GET SO CRAZY WHEN PLAYING WITH KITTY CATS!", "timestamp_updated": 1412840636, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412840636, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "19308771", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497970", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1391897835, "steamid": "76561197995156549", "num_games_owned": 1295, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "This is one of the greatest games in the universe.
