I've played it for untold hours. While I'm sure there are far more-involved Dark Souls enthusiasts out there than myself, I believe I was big enough into Dark Souls to be a judge of DS2's state as a sequel.\n\nThere's a reason DS1 spawned an array of clones. Everything about it was unique, interesting, and mostly-well executed. Dark Souls 2 is an officially-branded clone of its predecessor. It's not a sequel, it's not even a spiritual successor. It's every bit as much of a pale, badly hewn-together clone as the abysmal Lords of the Fallen and other such games.\n\nIt's like From realized they had lightning in a bottle, and they weren't quite sure just WHAT it was exactly that people liked about the first game. Like they made a great game by accident, a-million-monkeys-in-a-room-typing-on-typewriters-style, and they were utterly stumped as to what made it work.\n\nSo, Dark Souls 1 was widely considered to be *hard,* so....hard it is, then. Dark Souls 2 goes to great lengths to tell you about just how hard it is - every single hammy, cringy word delivered by its myriad cookie-cutter NPCs is specifically written to tell you all about it. Despair, despair, souls, souls, *souls,* despair, there is no hope. From the onset, it's immediately evident that this is a game that is trying entirely too hard to be hard.\n\nSo what's actually wrong with it? Especially in comparison to the first game? Oh, there's lots.\n\nThe animations are laughably bad. This is very hard to square, because DS1 was essentially the pinnacle of how third-person animations should be. Characters had weight in their step. You could *feel* your character's feet on the ground as you moved. If you wore thick armor, there was a definite *feel* of being heavy, weighty, and protected. In Dark Souls 2, characters are on ice skates, all the freaking time. Running and walking animations are just plain bad - ESPECIALLY if you make the mistake of playing as a female character. Speaking of which, did I mention that the characters are horribly out of proportion and look like stretched clay figurines? Anyway, yeah, coming from the fantastic animations of DS1, the terrible animations of this game look straight-up criminal. I cannot overstate just how much this sabotages the underlying *feel* of gameplay.\n\nVisual design? Very pedestrian, especially when coming off of DS1's grim, yet memorable backdrops. Everything here looks like a retread of that game at best, and a completely forgettible mess of same-color hodge-podge at worst.\n\nGameplay? Surprisingly cludgy and unresponsive. I'm not really sure how they managed to screw this up, because I feel as though to do so would have required some amount of effort. I mean, it's not like they had to completely scrap all their work on the last game, right? Who knows, maybe they did - that would explain why they didn't merely keep the last game's far superior animations instead of making terrible new ones. But yes, the combat is stiff, clunky, and horribly imprecise compared to the original.\n\nIt could have been done on purpose, honestly. It seems to have been built around gimping your character as much as possible. You HAVE to be using the target lock on mechanic if you want to actually hit anything. Otherwise, who the hell knows where your strikes are going to go. Parrying is strange - something has been altered in the mechanic to make it way less reliable than before. I'm not strictly against change, but there's definitely a lack of precision in the input and response compared to before. Character movement has a bizarre deadzone that makes precise steps strangely hard to trigger without dead-running in a direction, and dodge rolls feel consistently wrong. Attacks are stiff, have way too much wind up, and rarely, if ever, exhibit any kind of \"flow.\" Hitting enemies is completely without satisfaction. And I know it's a nitpick, but even the SOUND EFFECTS of a hit are lacking, which only makes it worse. They're cartoony and overdone.\n\nAs for the enemies, oh boy. I don't even know where to begin. The entire game's schick is throwing you in a cramped room with enemies packing oversized swords. They bum rush you, and throw off endless 'tard-swings that are as embarrassing to watch as they are frustrating to contend with. Dark Souls 1 was about timing. Dark Souls 2 is about tanking 'tard swings until you get an opening to land a clumsy hit-string of your own. It's boring, it's rote, and it sucks tremendously. Words cannot properly describe how laughably the enemy animates when pulling off these physics-defying sword-flailing freakouts. It's just pathetic.\n\nThis game is often called the black sheep of the franchise. Some claim Dark Souls 3 is indeed better. I can't say. All I know is, this game has ruined any confidence I had left in From Software, and that's truly a hard thing to come to terms with. They've made some of my favorite games. But this game.
