This game is trash. Movement is way too slow, Grapics options are nonexistent, Enemy AI has near perfect aim but are infact very stupid, and the game is made extremely difficult, with you dying in a single hit. But even then, i have had enemies walk near me, but i had no idea, so the sound design in this game is nonexistant or broken. Overall this game is boring, go pick up R6.", "timestamp_updated": 1506658414, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506658414, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 650, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1206, "total_reviews": 1856}}
