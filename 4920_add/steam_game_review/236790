Unfortunately it has a quirky issue with sound (there is none unless you make a change in your PC audio device settings) \nThe steam achievements are not synced with the game. I read that it has to do with the removal of their DRM or some related update to that nature. They unlock in game, but do not unlock on steam. 134 achievements are now impossible to get, it seems.\n\nThe game itself is very simple, and easy. The physics are a bit wonky though. There are times where it feels like the ground is pushing the tractor around instead of the other way around. \n\nThe sound design is alright but they decided to sprinkle free range chickens that roam all over your farm, and those little bastards are loud and annoying.\n\nIt doesn't look good, graphically. In motion, everything has a weird look to it and your own player model is just a generic bald male with no detail or personality to speak of. The grass effects are nice, and it does look good when you tear into the grass with your tractor tires, or start plowing a field. I turned off all the blur effects and i'm running the game on a gtx titan x 12gb and it just looks \"ok\" at its best.  \n\nI will be looking elsewhere for a good farming simulator type game.\n\nThe final caveat is that the game freezes/crashes constantly. This also corrupts your save file. \n\nI made it through the tuturial and it crashed at least 3-4 times in a matter of 20 minutes. I assume its a tutorial issue but its still really bad. This is the only title i decided to try playing that was developed by \"Actalogic\" and looking at their catalogue, this will also be the last. Seems everything they make is terrible. \n\nI'll be looking for another game like this, but with better execution and fully functioning steam achievements.", "timestamp_updated": 1499136448, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499136448, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 153, "total_reviews": 192}}
