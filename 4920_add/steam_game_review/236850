There are critical parts of the game that are treated as DLC, such as the ability to develop your provinces. That ability is critical in getting institutions, especially in countries far outside of Europe, and it is locked in a DLC. That isn't the only critical feature behind a paywall by a longshot.\n\nParadox treats DLC as an opportunity to charge you for the whole game again, because if they make it unplayable, difficult, or annoying to play without the DLC they seem to hope you'll pony up another $40, $60, $80 dollars to keep it playable. I bought this game for $40 dollars and payed far more than that in DLC. This is the hidden fee style of gaming. Paradox holds your game hostage for more money by placing important mechanics behind a paywall.\n\nYou'd think you could get the DLC for cheaper on a steam sale, but they charge you close to full price for the recent content so if you've bought the DLC previously you get screwed for having bought it when it came out. And you are still going to be paying more for DLC than the $40 game itself even during a sale. And that's just the DLC affecting game mechanics, not including DLC for cosmetics. During a sale, with the cosmetics, I'm looking at $150 for all the DLC. Also, there will be more major mechanics changes that will be locked behind a paywall again, don't make the mistake of thinking that because it's been out for years this is all you'll ever pay for DLC.\n\nI have about 1000 hours in this game, and I will never be buying from Paradox again. I recommend that unless you have tons of spare cash and money is no object to you, you steer clear of Paradox as well. You could buy dozens of games of equal or better quality for the money Paradox charges, and you won't always be able to play that one game from paradox because they will lock mechanics behind a pay wall.

Actual playtime. This is the game I can't leave lying around. If I have nothing else that I can think of doing, I start another game of EU4. If I have other things to consider doing, sometimes I still start another round of EU4. Whilst in setup quite similar to the Total War games, this game beats them for me by a mile because I *don't* have to do each battle manually for good results. I've played various Total War games as well and while it's awesome being able to outmaneuver the AI it also gets boring having to do that same trick over and over again. This game does not bother with the battle micromanagement and some will consider that a bonus, some a malus.\n\nComparison aside for those unfamiliar with either the Europa Universalis or Total War series: you play a country on the map of (at the start of the gameplay anyway) Europe, starting in 1444 and ending in 1821. So, your time is limited, and your goal is to generate as a high a score as possible by turning your country into an economic, diplomatic and military powerhouse. Enter the main problem: this is not immediately obvious. In fact, I don't even recall exactly when I finally realized the game had a scoring system. I played it the way I imagine everyone plays who sees a strategy game like this: What are we going to do tonight? The same thing we do every night Pinky... trying to take over the world.\n\nAnd here's the immediate issue with the otherwise good DLC additions: much of the DLCs and patches that came with them, seem focused on making it more difficult for you to take over the world, but provide other methods by which you can increase the in-game scoring system. And I am not ashamed to say it was at this point that I actually realized that the game had this scoring system at all.\n\nI will touch on the eternal DLC release that Paradox obviously employs to make money in a simple statement. Yes, they aim to make money by providing ever more DLC to improve the gameplay and add more functionality, most of which is quite enjoyable. However they also provide the simple ability to play earlier release versions which work just fine, don't bother with the new changes/additions, and leave you entirely able to play an awesomely entertaining game without buying all the DLC. I never felt like the game's DLC provided functions that it absolutely needed in the first place to be fun. It was always a fun game for me.\n\nSo, what's the game actually about? Well you pick a country on the map that existed in historic 1444 (or create your own if you have the DLC for it), that country has certain national bonuses that match its history, and you play through the next 400 or so years. The game follows historical patterns, in that some historical events have chances of happening, countries will generally behave as they did historically towards allies/enemies, the historical powerhouses tend to be just that... and in the middle there's you. The player. The wild card. The one who has the greatest impact on how the game will NOT follow the course of history.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that I never fully appreciated the brilliance of this game until I started playing in Ironman mode. Ironman mode gives you ONE save file. You declare a war, it saves. You negotiate a peace, it saves. A month passes, it saves. You quit the game, it saves. And every time it overwrites the same file, so no backsies (unless you alt+F4 the game, a trick known as \"Save scumming\"). Ironman mode teaches you that your actions have consequences, and it means your playthrough can get ruined.... but that also means it's ever so much more exciting. When you don't get savepoints, when you don't get to undo things, everything you do in your playthrough just matters so much more.\n\nThe basics of the gameplay is simple. You are a country (or part of one), you have an income based upon the taxes, production value and trade value your provinces generate. With this money you can field an army, improve the wealth (and thus income) of your provinces, hire advisors that help you generate monarch points (a \"currency\" required to improve your nation, develop technological advancements and national ideas that provide tangible bonuses), bribe allies (or enemies!) and as a result of all that expand the territory of your fledgeling empire... but beware, because expanding will anger your neighbours, their allies, their friends and their cat.\n\nAt the end, Europa Universalis IV is a game that is easy to start with but hard to master. Beyond the mechanics of running your nation there's the historical mechanics, mechanics of how AI typically behaves as each country values different things/territories, a trade system that's impossible to wrap your head around in actual playthrough there is a host of other details that I am forgetting, some of which I realized far too late and left me with a sense of \"Ooooh, is THAT how that works!\" even after my first few hundred hours. And that is disregarding the additions the DLC parts will bring.\n\nThe only downside worth noting is that you may not want to install the latest version if you don't own the DLC to make use of it. The game has the annoying tendency to introduce new features in the latest patch that you can't make use of unless you have the DLC but will affect your game as the AI can make use of the mechanics. It's a bit of a hamfisted way of encouraging people to pay, but the game lets you install earlier versions easily enough and I would recommand doing that if you do not like some of the newer systems. I will say it again, DLC brought some improvements and made some things harder but the base game is worth it either way.", "timestamp_updated": 1505348363, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505348363, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35454845", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504810", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507181511, "steamid": "76561198066937954", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3539}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "So I have messed around with the game for a bit.
