We finally get to see the origins of Rosa's powers, and tie up some remaining loose ends from prior chapters regarding her aunt's demise. The concept and writing for Epiphany remain solid, but as in previous installments, suffer from somewhat clunky controls and gameplay. There were a few times where I was only able to advance the story by visiting every location or clicking each item in a room because I had not found a poorly placed clue that would trigger an advancement; aside from this, controls in Epiphany stand head and shoulders above some of the earlier games (which I've also reviewed).\n\nAside from a bizarre ending twist that really didn't stick the landing, I enjoyed Epiphany. If you've played through the rest of the Blackwell games, definitely play Epiphany; it's easily the best of the series.

However, the games don't suffer from one flaw that exists in many quests, and that is excessive use of items. In some quest games you usually stack up a lot of items and end up trying every combination of item and something clickable on the screen until you find that absurd combination that makes you progress. The Blackwell series doesn't have that flaw as items aren't the main part of the game. Also, when places become irrelevant you can't access them anymore, which also prevents having to go back and try to find something useful in every place that you've been through at the endgame.\n\nThe progression in the game is made by combining the abilities of Rosa (or Lauren in Blackwell Unbound) and Joey, which complete each other. Joey can enter locked rooms but cannot interact with anything, and Rosa can do the opposite. Only by combining their abilities you will make progress. There's also a built in search engine inside a game in which you have to use in order to progress, which makes you feel that you're doing detective work and not just trying to figure out how to use your inventory.\n\nThe plot becomes \"bigger\" in each episode and ends with a grand finale in Blackwell Epiphany, so you don't feel like you're doing that same thing in each game.\n\nI really enjoyed the series and I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_updated": 1500017115, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500017115, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33393039", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501431", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499571450, "steamid": "76561198072006918", "num_games_owned": 846, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Blackwell series's grand finale.
