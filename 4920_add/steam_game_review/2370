You'll like this one, too. It's more of the same, but a hell of a lot harder. I mean, the base game was quite difficult, but in this they really carried away with the cheap death-traps and ambushes. And now all kinds of monsters can respawn in the map, so you'd better hurry, or you'll face another dozen Slaughtaurs or Serpents. Throw in a few boss-type monsters for good measure. So it's quite challenging, but worth playing in my opinion.\nIf you did not like the base game, this won't convince you to change your mind."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504448658, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497375", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34713043", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197985103810", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1504448365, "num_games_owned": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1504448658, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Let's start from the fact that it's not playable without ports. There is also no music, so you have to download that as well. I played through the expansion with doomsday, which explains why I have no hours in to this game on steam. \n\nBiggest problem is that it does not really bring anything good/new to the table after you have finished Hexen. Even Hexen was a bit too long and kinda boring towards the end. At least the last boss was a bit interesting. Well this expansion is all about the worst parts of Hexen and having more of them. Lots and lots of more of them.\n\nWhat you will get:\nMore maps that have really wonky and somewhat claustrophopic design, which makes the game worse.\nOne of the things I have always disliked is respawning enemies if they don't have clear purpose. Well in this game, unlike in the original hexen, everything can respawn. So it kills the joy of killing them all, because it's more or less pointless. Which feels sad. I like exploring the map freely when it's full silence.\nThere is also no point trying to reveal all of the map, since you have so much stuff anyway. I ended up not using any of the items except flasks and flechettes. The game gives you too much items even on the hardest difficulty. The fact that there is so many items and they don't actually do anything useful/fun, kills the fun of exploration.\nYou will never have problems with mana either. I always had loads of unpicked mana on every level even though I killed everything on every map. I even used mana to kill all the ettins and respawning monsters as well.\nAnd the worst of all there is no bosses between hubs and the last \"bossfight\" is a joke.\n\nCons:\n-no new enemies\n-no new weapons\n-no new class\n-no new items\n-no new bosses\n-annoying puzzles\n-no new keys\n-no new puzzles\n-some game breaking bugs that will kill your save, if you don't know exactly what to do. Google sump moving columns bug. Or that one of the masks in that map can just disappear meaning that you can't progress in the game anymore.\n-more annoying enemies (centaurs and slaughtars)\n-really easy even on the hardest difficulty because of endless items and mana\n-no new concepts\n-nothing new actually\n-there is no ending either\n\nPros:\n-There isn't any.\n\nSo the only reason to recommend this game is if you are a completionist like me. This could have been easily a very good game. For some reason they just didn't improve anything from hexen and made everything good about Hexen worse."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501197554, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475825", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33843545", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198046675266", "num_reviews": 606, "last_played": 1501197475, "num_games_owned": 1393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1501197554, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1]The expansion game of HeXen: Beyond Heretic.\n\nSame game, with an extra level.
