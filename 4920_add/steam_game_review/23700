Either way, the game has a fair amount of depth to it.  You build armies, level-up heroes, choose spells and artifacts to equip, and battle across the land all through match-3 style puzzles where you play against the computer AI.\n\nThe match-3 puzzles play a little differently from the standard \"move one color tile to create a row of 3 or more\" style found in most match-3 titles.  In this game you slide a whole row or column of tiles over by one, and you can match 3 or more in any combination as long as the sides touch eachother (kitty-corner doesn't count).  There is a fair amount of strategy involved as you try and match certain colors to power up spells and activate attacks, all while trying to prevent the computer from being able to do so on its turn.\n\nThis game can appeal to both the casual gamer as a more strategicly involved game with lots of depth and choices to make, as well as to the strategic gamer as a lighter take on kingdom conquest without lacking in plenty to plan and do."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502324547, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503893", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34135884", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198004536607", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1502323964, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4486}, "timestamp_updated": 1502324547, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I'm a shameless March-3 puzzle addict, so this was like crack to me.
