In the SNES/Genesis era, it was the game with a blood code (Genesis only) when Street fighter was relatively tame.  It had Fatalities.  \n\nWell Mortal Kombat (really Mortal Kombat 9) has continued that march of progress.  While it's not it's ultimate form (Seriously, Mortal Kombat X takes everything 9 did and makes it almost disgusting... ok actually disgusting.)   Mortal Kombat 9 has a special charm in it's self. \n\nThe main game play (besides online, which I only dip my toe into because... I really don't have the time to dedicate myself to all the fighting games I play) seems like it's a story mode.  Which is 16 chapters each four fights each.  And while the story is decent, it's never that deep.  Basically unless you REALLY know the lore, (and as such you wouldn't need to read a review) the story is... acceptable but there's a lot of mysticism that's their for super fans of the series.   It's good enough to play through though.  But there is a REALLY painful fight just over half way through the story mode to watch out for (Liu Kang vs Shao Khan). \n\nHowever there's another mode.  Challenge Tower which contains 300 levels, and I have to say that's the real killer experience.   This is similar to star mode in Injustice.  The player fights through 300 different matches with different rules and a lot of variety.  You'll play as every character (or almost all of them) and each gets used for about 10 levels.  But the variety in these levels are some of the best in the game.  There are matches where the player is headless, or armless, or throws arms at the opponent, or only is limited to one move.  The fact is there's at least 100 matches that don't feel like a normal match, and I absolutely love this mode. \n\nThere's also Arcade modes, which each character has an individual ending as well. \n\nAnd there's more, there's now a tag mode in some matches, that can be applied to arcade mode as well, there's a number of Tests you can take (unlocked from progressing through challenge tower) and of course Online.\n\nOverall there's a LOT to do in this game, the fighting is the typical Mortal Kombat fair (Super moves, combos, throws, and blocking) but honestly the wealth of content really shines, and it works great for hard core fans of the series (the guys who will go online after taking down the expert mode difficulty) and the novices of the series.  \n\nJust realize, this is a game that revels in the blood and violence.  It's incredible just how brutal they keep making the game and upping the ante, and Mortal Kombat 9 is a perfect blend of the old and the ultra violent.    In fact they added a new attack in this game called the x-ray.  All I can say about them are they are somehow almost as brutal as the classic fatalities.  Damn!\n\nPersonally I love this game, so I recommend it just due to it's absolutely beautiful visuals and true visceral impacts.   It's not a game for the squeamish, and it's just so brutally violent.  But it's also just beautifully brutal, if you can handle it, it's a fantastic game.", "timestamp_updated": 1505101408, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505101408, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35362613", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506828153, "steamid": "76561198300454680", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 313}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "if you dont play this game i will cut you", "timestamp_updated": 1506829574, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506829574, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34749630", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500371", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1447900801, "steamid": "76561198044917795", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 4585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Great game, arguably better than MKX.
