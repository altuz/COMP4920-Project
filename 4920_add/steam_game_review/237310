I tried unsinstalling steam to reinstall it to see if that would fix it, the files for Gameguard refused to delete and I had to go through a long process of changing ownership of files, digging up files to delete them, removing seemingly random Regestries and then finally booting into safe mode to finally remove Gameguard and be able to use steam again. \n\nSo yes, this game is good, but sadly it installs an anti cheat system that can basically act like a virus and is a massive headache to remove, so i'd recommend avoiding it.", "timestamp_updated": 1488301329, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "7", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486231754, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "30238873", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510550", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1488072468, "steamid": "76561198130930664", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Elsword is funky.

You want to stay in the challanging stages of the game well better toss in your CC and pay out the backside. cause frankly speaking, Gear drops sure easy enough to come by. Upgrading materials once again easy enough to come by. The rub is all that means lil to nothing cause if you dont have the \"pay to get\" costumes, pets etc. Well congratz your now reaching the rage part of the game cause your characters will all die in a matter of seconds. Want to buy those items from the player shops, well congratz your now gonna have to grind out all your stamina and days away on cash. Btw you wont be earning much each day maybe a few hundred thousand if you get lucky. \"Hint\" 1 constume item \"when theres 6 peaces basic\" costs 340million - 600million. have fun grinding your life away. Want more inv space skills to use or just simply put the ability to do much of anything outside of die 10 times a day and then log out cause well sry thats all your allowed to do before your considered useless.
