Your internet goes out and you want to record something to give you something to do? too bad.\n\nThe best method for recording video using this program for me is mjpeg or motion jpeg. Works well even on lower end gaming rigs but it comes with a caveat if you use adobe premiere or adobe premiere elements (i use elements 13). You will need to buy a codec called Morgan M-Jpeg Codec 64 bit in my case. \n\nThe support was decent, my mac pro pc was having problems because of its xenon processors and they made a special beta just for me! Now on my nice i5 1050ti gtx gaming rig there is almost no need. Using OBS I can capture 1080p 60fps using quicksync (onboard graphics processor IN the cpu) If your using a graphics card that onboard isnt used so it can be used to encode video making the cpu and graphics card not take any hit.\n\nShadowplay with nvidia cards is also a very tiny hit since these cards come with hardware built specifically for this. This can also be accessed in OBS called Nvidia NVENC came out with the geforce 600 series in 2012. \n\nSo the question you have to ask is do you have a sandy bridge intel quicksync (or amd equivalent if there is one)  or do you have an nvidia graphics card with shadowplay (or an amd equivalent)?\n\nIf you dont have either, Such as an older AMD chip with an older AMD graphics card and OBS isnt working for you.. this \"could\" be an option. But the online DRM makes it impossible to recommend. Online DRM should never exist and I will never recommend a program using it. \n\nAt 40$, its too much, I got the program for 25$ or so and still feel its too much. I say use MSI afterburner or OBS which are both free. Online DRM plus so many better alternatives makes this hard to recommend. \n\nAt the time of this writing I cannot remember if you can record to a file that has both mic and game audio seperate but I think recording to .ts like obs and using ffmpeg to split out the audio and encode it is the only option.", "timestamp_updated": 1496627986, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496627858, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "32913293", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507072116, "steamid": "76561198152150460", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 25329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1551}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very Fickle Recording software.\n\nConsidering all the options I tried that were available. This one was the best. There's obviously plenty out there that are better. But your choices in recording software range in price. You either pay out enough money that what you have is a statement. Or you settle for the free option that limits you. PlayClaw 5 is the middle ground. \n\nThis program does it job and it does it well. When it wants to. It's really a matter of what you're trying to record. What's great about this is that you don't have to do much in convuluted setups to get a recording going. And I like that. The GUI is rather simple and doesn't require you to ask people online for hours on end for an answer to a problem.  Startup PlayClaw 5, Boot up your game, and it's ready to record. Just press a simple Hotkey to start recording and go. \n\nIt isn't a space hog either. A lot of people will bring up that it sucks that you have to have Steam open, along with this and your game open all at once. But at least this program isn't a total space hog. I can have things open in the background like Google Chrome, Skype, Discord, whatever, and not have issues. Does suck when PlayClaw 5 picks up the beeps from messenger programs though.\n\nIssues\n\nThat's for games that PlayClaw 5 agrees with however. It agrees with most games...(Keyword: most).  Other games is where PlayClaw 5 starts to act like a diva. Depending on the game, the program will either crash, record nothing at all, stop itself from recording, or continue recording despite that you hit the hotkey to stop it. Other times I record a different screen, I'll see one of my overlays appear in the recording as a messed up pixel (Usually the FPS counter). Worst case is when I get slideshow recordings, That's where it'll record maybe a few frames then freeze, then maybe, MAYBE move to another frame. It really doesn't like dealing with certain games or programs. \n\nGive a few examples.\nBluestacks Emulator - You'll record nothing but a screen that says Bluestacks. \nAlphadia Genesis - I have the FPS counter mess up. Then got where the video froze and gave me slideshow gameplay.\nDragon: A Game about a Dragon - Random Black Screens\nLeague of Legends - Play Claw recorded the startup screen. But not the gameplay\n\nThose are just a few examples. Some can be worked around. You can change the recording setting to not hunt for the window that has the game but just record the Desktop or Everything. Others I can't work around it and have to pray that a rerecording will fix the problem. Or just find a different recording software altogether. Not fun.\n\nAnother issue that pops up and that's if you're recording a high end game for a very long time. You get no warning about your Hard Drive being full. Once it reaches it's peak that's it. PlayClaw5 will forcibly stop then. But you won't get any warnings except from maybe your PC itself that you're out of hard drive space. \n\n\nCustomer Service\n\nCustomer Service is nice but not always helpful. They at least respond to your problems. I blame the program itself however. Cause when I ask for help from them they always tell me to send the crash dump file.  A lot of problems however aren't recorded by the crash dump file. So it leaves me in an SOL situation. Thankfully I haven't had any future problems in the recent few months but it's still a haunting memory that this could happen again. \n\nSteaming\n\nI only tried this out maybe once or twice. I don't really like it. I mean it's better than some alternatives out there that make you pay for a monthly service or just leave you hanging out to dry to solve problems. But PlayClaw 5 for streaming is meh. When I first tried it. It was trying to stream content to my viewers at 10,000kbs and I didn't know it. That's very problematic. So I had to cut that down.  I haven't really tried it again. Never found a reason to. I don't like livestreaming in the first place. \n\nOverall\n\nPlayClaw 5 for the price I got it for. Which was like 30 bucks due to a sale. Is worth it. It does it job right when it wants to. Doesn't interfere with my gameplaying too much. And that's generally what I like. Something can do its job and do it right. Even though it does get angry with me and fight me at times. It at least does better than many other screen recording software I tried out.", "timestamp_updated": 1498628346, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498628346, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "31763002", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499100", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1463003051, "steamid": "76561198115020059", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Just use OBS.", "timestamp_updated": 1494827193, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494827193, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "32023924", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1495991434, "steamid": "76561198310034230", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I don't know what happen while record the frame rate of the video drop to 10fps from 60fps", "timestamp_updated": 1495989480, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495989480, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 96, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 66, "total_reviews": 162}}
