Kinda wish it had features like increased movement when no enemies in sight or better build speeds etc, and co-ordinating an offence was tiresome sometimes carefully protecting the slow units.\nAlso, the game can seem to generate difficulty mainly by making you outnumbered rather than with advanced tactics, or it'll just drop units unexpectedly on a flank you thought was safe without chance to discover the danger.\n\nOK, all that sounds like I don't like the game.  I do, and it's a fun if slow paced stratagy with a good range of units and tactical options to consider.  But if the features I mentioned above would make you rage quit, then it's not for you.", "timestamp_updated": 1501352225, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501352225, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 40, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 36, "total_reviews": 76}}
