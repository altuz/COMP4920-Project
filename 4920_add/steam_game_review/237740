Every other level is just the same thing (some slight alterations sometimes) with a different skin. Boss battles are boring and all 8 levels' bosses can be defeated by just smashing fire button. The final boss is a slightly different case. This time you are faced with something that actually feels like a boss. The fight is difficult, but it is much less complicated than it feels. On the other hand, one good thing about the game is the movement. It feels raw and good, had no problems with landing precise jumps etc.\nSo, to sum it up:\nIf you are looking for a fun hard game: don't buy this one, go with Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV (though it's not the hardest game in the universe).\nBut if you are looking for hard game based on cheap repetetive traps and enemies - go with this one.", "timestamp_updated": 1504825676, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504825676, "votes_down": 10}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1381, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 158, "total_reviews": 1539}}
