Graphics are sharp and bright colored and the interface is, for a lack of a better word in my limited vocabulary, classy. Sound effects are great and contribute to generate a really immersive experience.\n\nAnd the game's soundtrack it's glorious, making the game unique and memorable. The coin-up theme it's another plus, even more if you used to play arcade machines with the level of addictiveness and replayability that this game has.
