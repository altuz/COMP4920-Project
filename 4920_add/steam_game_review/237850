I thoroughly enjoyed it nd will  aim to play the previous games (out of their intended order but oh well). \n\nThe characters were great and I enjoyed the story pacing. I struggled at points due to there being no fast travel, but that's just because I'm not good with directions (even in game). The puzzles were good, and I enjoyed taking the time to complete what I needed to do without a time limit looming over me, as I'm not so confident with time constraints.\n\nI completed the game within three days of consistant play, as I just could't wait to start plying again. The chapters are long, which for me is great as I get so engrosed and compelled. \nThe intricacy of the story is what makes me love this game, the charaters are unique and Istill feel there's room for more storylines even after the game is fiished.", "timestamp_updated": 1504799759, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504799759, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34840438", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517831", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504928373, "steamid": "76561197971163638", "num_games_owned": 519, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[SPOILER HEAVY RANT]\n\nAs most people that have played this game, i come here as an old fan of the TLJ saga.\nWhile i don't own the other two entries on steam, i still own the original copies.\n\nDespite sitting in my backlog for an uncomfortably long time, i was still very excited to revisit the world of Stark and Arcadia. It was a well crafted world most of us had enjoyed years ago and i went in expecting the same old game i was so fond of.\n\nThat was a mistake apparently.\n\nIt's hard to dislike the game as it starts out great and agreed, it does start out incredibly fast paced but personally i found that to be fine. Most of the characters were established in previous entries. Fine for returning fans wanting direct continuation, probably immensely confusing for new players. My issues started halfway nearing the end. It becomes very clear that their choice of adopting this \"telltale-choice-related\" gameplay put serious strain on the writers. The game starts biting off more than it can chew with very disappointing consequences as a result. There's a ton in this game that simply goes nowhere.\n\n- \"Be careful, Dad. That's not Reza.\" \nI remembered that line and it made me distrust him for obvious reasons. Even going so far as thinking the only reason they were together was because she was stuck in a simulation and was programmed to be in a relationship with him. (oh.) However, instead of uncovering this and having a plot twist where he could potentially be a Stark antagonist or have the option to save him? Nah, the character disappears halfway in the game only to show up in the epilogue like literally nothing has happened. Yes, he was a brainwashed sleeper agent but this was a plot point.. why? A red herring i suppose?\n\n- \"Zoe found the stickiest of the icky in her last couple of chapters and i found myself more weirded out than she was.\"\nGoing back to my impression of the writers being overwhelmed and having to.. actually finish the story in this final chapter, i felt this was glossed over so quickly. I get that she already went through a lot of weirdness so not a lot would phase her but learning you're a test-tube baby and getting double the confirmation on how much of a double whammy twat your mom actually is to only go \"oh, okay\"..? The complete lack of emotion near the end (of a ton of characters, not just Zoe) just reaffirms they were rushing through things to get it over with. \n\n- \"Benrime\"\nMultiple mentions of her throughout the game, would've been a small nostalgia nod to returning players. Jakai's sacrifice/betrayal was met with zero payoff, not even a small nod if she's okay in the epilogue for it. I'm simply going to assume she's okay.\n\n- \"Kian & Alayna\"\nRagnar says he always intended for Kian to be gay, i seriously find that hard to believe when he's made various comments about how hot the magical women look in Marcuria and the sexual tension between him and April in previous entries. Ultimately, even with Alayna shoehorned in as a physical gaydar, i don't give a shit about his sexual preference but i do have issues with how poorly it is delivered and how it contradicts established lore. I wonder what compelled them to even add this, i get that you get some brownie-points with the LGBT community for this but really, what did it even add to the narrative? Why didn't blind bob shout he was straight awkwardly? At least we get a boatride with what is probably the single worst delivery of the line \"I AM GAY\" ever. Couldn't we have skipped the boatride and seen some people getting rescued, Benrime perhaps?\nHis sexual preference wasn't the only odd design choice for him. Early on in the game when arriving at the pub, he mentions he doesn't drink at all. later? he remarks that the beer is okay. Even later? He's comparing wines to the ones he's had back home. Which is it?\n\n- \"Saga/Lady Alvane/Deus Ex Machina\"\nIt was great to see the tie-in for this character, i could even argue her character as a standalone was actually pretty decent but her implementation into the story is horrendous. Little to no backstory. All we get is this shifter is \"special\" and her dad is extremely overprotective. Whatever plot point the game was trying to tie up or hurdle it was trying to overcome nearing the end, she was the answer. Why? \"muh prophecy.\" I'll allude to it again, it came across like the writers needed to tie things up quick and what better way to do it than introducing a character that is (out of nowhere) near omniscient? \nquoted verbatim \"i feel like i'm playing life on cheat mode.\"\nAnother big shame regarding her character is how they gloss over what would've been vastly more interesting stories than the one they gave us regarding her. (Her learning about the prophecies. The war and her helping Kian become the bloodless king. All off-screen.) \n\"I became amazing off-screen. Now go pick up my drawings.\" I understand that in an ideal world, we would have gotten all of this in an extra game. My issue just lies purely with the poor implementation of it all. Beyond lazy and why i can not recommend this game.\n\nThere's plenty more characters that are extremely underdeveloped for a story heavy game given the lackluster epilogue.\nOnor Hileriss (more like Hitleriss) getting nearly double the screentime as opposed to Hanna and Hope, Zoe's sisters and oncemore the lack of anything interesting regarding Saga and her offscreen action. At least we hear about Sully.\n\nI am fully aware i should be thanking the stars for even have gotten this game and in a weird way i am. Despite my rant and frustration with it i am grateful. I did enjoy playing but my god, the last chapter sours the entire experience.\nSuch a shame because it frustrates me that i dislike the writing so much.", "timestamp_updated": 1504972452, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504972189, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "35338702", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509585", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503799170, "steamid": "76561198065023947", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I loved the story!\n\n9/10", "timestamp_updated": 1506780247, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506780247, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34948862", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504362", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502998316, "steamid": "76561198218228728", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is... perfection.

Driven by a strong female protagonist, no less strong gay male protagonist, so many POC characters and such diversity... This is heart warming and it feels so realistic. I love the clash of cultures and the politics mention in the game, absolutely love how Red Thread Games went about it.

All in all, a satisfying ending to a fantastic trilogy of games.  The recent \"Final Cut\" update also brings the graphics up to 2017 standards, which makes the game look, sound and play amazing, top to bottom.\n\n[b]What's The Best Part?[/b]\nThe story, as always, is my favourite part.  Also, all the flaws from the second game have been cleaned up and polished to make a truly magnificent final installment.  The control scheme is actually not that different from Dreamfall, but the few changes made make all the difference.  Unnecessary combat mechanics have been dropped in favour of QTE-style timed puzzles (which is how Adventure games are [i]supposed[/i] to do combat, if they need to do so at all.)\n\nThe addition of a \"choices matter\" style of decision making, common to modern Adventure games, is also welcome and well done.  I particularly liked how they highlight which decisions will actually cause significant changes (without telling you what those changes are) at the end of each \"book.\"\n\nAlso, I really like the \"story recap\" menu option.  Well done and not too long.  Not nearly enough to justify skipping the first two games, of course, but a good refresher if it's been a year or six since you played the older games.\n\n[b]What's The Worst Part?[/b]\nThe plot does get a little bit... convoluted... near the end.  Feels like they were rushing things a bit to wrap up all the loose ends from the first two games.  I'm still pleased with the ending, mind you, it just got a bit twisty, that's all.  Also, remember Lord of the Rings with all the \"epilogues\"?  Same sort of thing going on here.\n\n[b]Will I Like It?[/b]\nIf you enjoyed the previous games in the series, absolutely!\n\n[b]Should I Buy It?[/b]\nObviously, I think so.  But use your enjoyment of the first two games as a guide.  As fantastic as this game is on its own, I doubt it would \"make up for\" the other two, if you didn't enjoy them.\n\nThis has been a 5TYSK review.

I would say play the other games first and then if you really want to get into this game get it very cheap. [/b]\n\nPros:\n-Another great update in Graphics\n-The main story from all the games is actually finished in this game\n-A lot of questions answered for fans of the series\n-Later chapters (Chapter 4-5) are pretty good, and kinda worth getting past the earlier slower chapters to get too\n-Music is good\n-Love the update in controls from the last Dreamfall game\n-Puzzles don\u2019t seem to handhold\n-The addition of story changing choices is a welcome change (Reminds me of Life is Strange, and I loved that game)\n\nCons:\n-Story doesn't flow like that last 2 games did\n-A lot of boring backtracking in huge empty spaces (Like the cities) the slow as hell run speed doesn't help either\n-Not enough puzzles\n-Most of the characters aren't memorable\n-First couple of chapters are too slow, and for me kinda boring\n-some story set pieces made just for this game make no sense or just don't fit right and feel forced (these story set pieces mostly do not deal with the past games story setups)\n\nI also among so many others in the review section love this series, and I actually have played the past games again very recently (Literally one after another just to get to this game, and I have written reviews for them also \u2013 Shameless plug). I was hyped at the idea of learning more about Stark and Arcadia, I really do love this created world and its characters, but I would be lying if I said it was the best game in the trilogy; in fact to me it\u2019s the worst.\n\nNow, its not a broken game and it definitely looks amazing but that's just the shell underneath this game it lacks the same soul of the past games, and its 90% mainly the fault of the writing. Past games kept it simple and the story flowed along. Honestly I gave Dreamfall:TLJ a negative point for that because the story flowed so smooth and fast that right when everything (The story) is heavily stacked up and you're completely invested, it ends.  \n\nI feel so salty about the presentation of this game that I want to give this game a thumbs down but honestly I would be lying to myself if I didn't admit that as a fan of the series they didn't tie up mostly all of the major story lines from the older games and answer most of my questions, although the way this game gave me those things to me felt like it plopped some goop on a plate and told me to enjoy.\n\nI know people are saying we should be grateful for whatever we get but sorry no, I\u2019m not that type of person. I can appreciate something while also noticing its faults. I can also find entertainment in something I overall didn't enjoy (example a party's music might be terrible but as long as the drinks are good, what would I care about the music lol or going to a terrible movie and walking out thinking at least the action was great). This game is a product that I paid for no matter what way it came about to being and deserves a consumers glance and review. \n\nAnyway this game has so many low moments for me in the early chapters that I could write a lengthy essay but I think it redeems its self for me in the later chapters primarily chapters 4-5 like the ending parts of the saga story line, or that scene where that you get the achievement \u201cThe Longest Journey Home\u201d. Man that actually brought a tear to my eye, and I was beginning to think this game couldn't possibly make me feel like that, but the feels definitely were strong. \n\nLike I said I could right an essay on this game but since id rather not hit the character limit on this review I'll just simply end this with an analogy, This game is like a \"Sloppy Joe Sandwich\"-The other games was you buying the ingredients and cooking them. Now this game is you putting it all together. It looks great, Its Meaty, seasoned, and with a hearty filling bun holding it together. By the time you pick it up and bite in half the meat fell back on the plate and the ground...Cursing the sky, your left wondering why the gods of old hate you. After coming back from cleaning the food on the ground you discover the bun is soggy as hell now. Now you can finish your messy meal with a happy go-lucky smile on your face or wallow in self deprecation shoveling it down your gullet like some sewer rat (This was the route i took). You could also shove this slop in the trash and treat yourself to a premium 5 star deliciousness (an actual good game) for dealing with the stress of this game...If i could give this game a \"Meh\" i would but it doesn't deserve a thumbs down. If they ever create another game in this game universe I wont be picking it up.
