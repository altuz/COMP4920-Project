Think of it like this, you crashland on Planet Maria, and you ruthlessly murder the inhabitants so you can make your own colonies in their place...uh...wait a second...that seems familiar...\n\nOh yeah, you can also make colonies, which are essentially slaves that do your bidding. First you make an assembly core, then you make a dwelling bed, and then you go around to friendly human colonies and ask people if they want to slave awa-err I mean \"live\" at your colony. Fortunately for you (unfortunately for the colonists) they cannot say no. Something about the phrase \"I've made a colony, would you like to live there?\" seems to activate the hidden microchip implanted by the goverment, which forces the colonist to say \"We're gonna have fun!\" or \"Oh joy!\" or some other passive-aggressive \"help me I cannot say no\" phrase.\n\nThe creation system (access hotkey is J in-game) is a bit confusing at first, so let me give you some tips:\n1.
