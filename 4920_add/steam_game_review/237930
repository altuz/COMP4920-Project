I was also hella confused about Turn() and functions, but I kind of like the way they did that because it made me more curious on figuring out how to use them. Also, those beach rooms where you can practice are a GOD-SEND, and the only reason I didn't die hundreds of times was because of the practice that they gave me. \n\nI also LOVE how each function includes profiles of different people that you can unlock by using a function in its three different modes; this is so important to me, because usually I'm so basic and only stick to a same routine. However, this really pushed me to try different combos to unlock more info, because this b*tch is curious as hell. Also, the fact that you would lose functions in battle, versus dying and having to restart, when your health bar got depleted was really cool and challenging, making the game even more enjoyable. \n\nThe ending was very bittersweet, but holy hell, that was one heavy ending, I definitely wasn't expecting all of the feels. I CRAVE for more information about the characters, but maybe that's just because I fall in love with fictional characters too easily. I'm playing the game a second time now, to complete every profile and to really take the time to appreciate the game.
