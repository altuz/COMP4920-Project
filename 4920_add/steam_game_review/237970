Main menu is almost useless & buggy. It just jams into black screen. This has something to do with the area where game autosaves.\n\nEDIT: so main menu stays black but you can blindly click the \"continue\" and carry on the game. \nI happily played to chapter 4 and today misclicked \"start new game\".\nSo autosave is now back in chapter 1.\n\nI'm done. I'm so done. Damn this game and damn the autosaves to lowest hell.\n\nThis IS a decent game but now I just want to give it superdislike.", "timestamp_updated": 1500824345, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494102791, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 23}}
