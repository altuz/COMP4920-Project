You play as a mechanically-augmented ex SWAT soldier, who is currently the head of security at Sariff Industries. In a world where corporations rule society and human augmentations are new,controversial and deadly, you are to find kidnapped augmentation scientist with an arsenal of lethal weapons and non-lethal weapons which allow you to have some variance in combat situations or the complete avoidance of such situations.\n\n\t\t\t\tGameplay - 8/10\nThere are 2 modes of vision, you have TP mode for ducking,rolling and peeking, and FP mode for shooting and exploration the way these for viewpoints interact is quite impressive, initially I saw it as a pain but once you get into the swing of checking your surroundings with extra vision from TP mode and then looking down your sights for some quick-scope in FP mode, the dynamic between he two is quite fluid and natural after a bit of gameplay. \n\nLevels are set up with enemies however you do not have to kill or even interact with them.Their are enemies who have patrol paths and cameras that raise alarms.Objectives are different depending on your task but levels are generally go from point A to point B.The game works on stamina for running and energy for takedowns and augmentations.Energy is limited, once you use a bar it can only return through replenishment or traversing through areas however you always have at least one bar available which regenerates.\n\nFor stealth mechanics there are plenty of vents and hidden pathways dispersed throughout buildings and the world that allow you to sneak through your environments undetected with tranquilizer darts and silent takedowns which the game rewards you more for taking the sneaky method.Of course you could go full frontal approach however this triggers alarms which can leave you in an unfavorable position.You also gain hacking (through augmentations) which works as a little minigame where you have to control nodes and take over the system hacking lets you open doors,gun safes unlock security systems or even hack defensive systems such as turrets or robots to the point where they can barrage  your enemies with gattling guns.\n\nWhether you kill or knockout your enemies effects your ending to a extremely\ny minor degree so its really personal preference on your course of action.On the topic of role play, you can interact with people through intimidation or persuasion to get what you want.Again there is an augmentation to make the process easy but the whole social system isn't really crucial and doesn't reward you as much as it should, as well as the limited times it comes up.\n\nThe world is open to a degree, you are restricted to cities and the buildings inside of them. You can purchase ammo,new weapons, or skill points for your augmentations called \"praxis points\".\"Praxis points\" are used to obtain new augmentations through skill trees which range from human limbs/organs (eyes,arms,back etc.) there are some pretty cool upgrades such as rocket launcher arms,double takedown and my personal favorite invisibility, however a lot are redundant and situational (node fortification).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStory/Music 7/10\nI found the main story quite intriguing. With an interesting world you play in where different human morale's and ideals conflict with one another between human augmentation and how far is too far on the pursuit of human development. I found myself comparing this fictional world based on an idea of our future and the world we live in now, all augmentations seem probable and some are even already made (to a lesser extent). The music is techno and mostly synthetic which really plays into the cyber-punk atmosphere the game promotes, a range of songs for action scenes and exploration and even songs that are somewhat cultural based on the area.(Chinese lyrics for songs in China)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGraphics 8/10\nThe style of this game leans towards a more stylized art rather than realistic, with dark and gloomy cities where its never daytime character models are detailed nonetheless and particle effects are subpar with simple gun flashes and recoil sparks. However due to the art style nothing seems outdated and all elements work well together with the story and atmosphere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConclusion 23/30\nOverall Deus Ex: Human Revolution is quite an astonishing game with high level gameplay, interesting story,world-building and  character development with decent graphics.If you want a shooter with mixed TPS and FPS elements where \nyou can kill,run,hide or knockout. The roleplay elements are lacking in interactions but decent in skill progression and skill trees. The directors cut edition gives you some insight on the development of the game and a mode where the game developers talk about the game as you play it. Definitely worth the money even when it full-priced as it took me around 30 hours of complete the main story.", "timestamp_updated": 1506327528, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506153643, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35197182", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509986", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1472149874, "steamid": "76561198120666777", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 16617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is one of my all time favorite games.

I'd place this closer to a COD with fantasy/robotic gameplay than the other way around.

Even though I played it like any average joe would (so no ghosting, some stealth, mostly lethal gunplay), I still felt like I was doing things MY way and not the way the devs intended. I'd say the best parts of the game are (1) the way character progression is handled (2) the amazing soundtrack (specifically the battle themes) and (3) the atmosphere that the environments and characters convey. \n\nThe only negative I'd mention is that the story is both very simple and very complicated. The title pretty much tells you what the game is mainly about, and the story here is the typical sci-fi story that goes through all the motions you'd expect. However, you'll come across some crazy stuff that I could only describe as... Anime. Not necessarily a bad thing I suppose, but it's not really a vision of how our future looks and more a attempt to mimic something like Ghost in the Shell or Akira. I think anyone who reaches the end of the game will kind of see what I mean.\n\nAnyway, totally recommended for any fan of the more 'cerebral' first person shooter/RPG hybrids, or just science fiction fans. You'll get something out of this one for sure, just give it about two hours to really show you what it's all about (the first two hours can feel a bit wonky as you are still underpowered and without lots of options).

So far, I spent almost 60 hours on playing through it, and there's still so much stuff I haven't seen.\n\nLet's start with the bad things though. First of all, some of the animations (especially during interactive dialogues) look very messy and not life-like at all. Also, the stark contrast between cinematically rendered cutscenes and those that are rendered in-game is very, very strong - I'd almost wish the cutscenes had a lower quality so they'd match the game.\n\nThe developer's commentary is a very neat feature that suffers from two big weaknesses. One, you can't pause it. Two, the commentary nodes are invisible, meaning you basically have to comb through every square centimetre of the map to find them.\n\nThat's all of the bad stuff, so here's all the cool things.\n\nIt's long. As in, it took me 25-30 hours to play through the campaign the first time (medium difficulty), and I skipped most dialogues and cutscenes, so I imagine if played properly, it'll take 35+ hours at the very least. I guess if you're not one for story, you can still play it purely for the gameplay, but there's only so many new skills to be introduced until you get the routine of sneak-hack-snipe (or run-gun-blowshitup, if you want to) down, so without caring about the story, the game's not gonna make much sense.\n\nIt's consequent. As in, choices have consequences. For example, if you save somebody's life it's gonna pay off later on AND VICE VERSA so if you fuck up, and, say, cost somebody their job, they might get angry at you. Throughout the story, there's a bunch of decisions to be made that will have consequences later on.\n\nIt's challenging. At first, you'll just face some gun-wielding lunatics, but later on, pistols pointed at your cyborg face are going to be the least of your worries. You'll have to hack and sneak, snipe & overpower, shoot, blow up and whatnot, and don't forget the fall damage. Some of the hacking stuff is insanely hard unless you're augmented from head to toe.\n\nYou can explore lots of areas (and some not). You can either just follow the markers on the minimap, be a good boy and do what you're told, or you can run around and poke your metal nose into other people's business. Pretty much every map has areas that can be explored but aren't mandatory. Some levels still feel very linear though, despite ample opportunities to stray from the given path (you can also occasionally complete objectives in more than one way). Also, you might accidentally open an apartment you wouldn't enter otherwise until much later, but the apartments that would be game-breaking are locked and you can't really fuck up any quests by stumbling upon them before due time - only accidentally make them much easier.\n\nYou can do pretty much anything. Three or four locations disable your weapons, but apart from that, you can do whatever the fuck you want. Be a good citizen and just follow your boss' orders? Boring, but be my guest! Shoot up the entire police department and start a little civil war in the streets of Detroit? Now we're talking business. You might be forced to wipe out the entire DPD to avoid being shot, but the point is, you can do it.\n\nOh yeah, talking about bad things - it's probably not actually a bad thing but wow some of them guns take up lots of inventory space. So in other words, you can't pull a Gordon Freeman and carry half the world's armory in your back pocket. Choose wisely.\n\nOh, and the world is a-fucking-live. I'm pretty sure I missed some, but I did about a dozen-or-so sidequests during the story. Piece o' advice here: don't shoot your resident arms dealer, or where are you gonna buy weapons?\n\nYeah, so if you wanna go stealthy and want a nice story, this one's for you. If you wanna go tank, you can still have fun (I played like a bulldozer at times and I had fun), but beware, the minigun takes a hell of a lot of inventory slots.\n\nNo prior knowledge of the Deus Ex universe is required (I didn't know anything when I started this). There are hidden achievements and I'm dead set on finding them all, so have fun while I go off to play this for the third time.
