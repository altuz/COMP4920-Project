It makes many improvements as well as refines old ones. The shooting is still great and there are more weapons as well. They give you a map which is VERY helpful.  And you also get to go back to earlier levels at any time(you could restock or look for things you missed). You also have to think a bit more with your shots as well since scientists are scattered on every floor and can help you with info and even give you items, but you can shoot them. There are problems though. All the weapons use the same ammo, so some become worthless when you get other ones. The map is better than nothing but while it shows locked doors it doesn't show doors that open on one side only. And this led to me back tracking for nothing at times. It also doesn't show you where your facing in a room, but you can open the map a couple of times to get the idea. While having some npc's are a nice touch you can't tell which are good or bad(as some are enemies) and on higher difficulty levels you can get killed quick so it can make sparing a scientist very risky. Overall while not as remembered as wolfenstein 3d, it's a solid shooter that has aged better. \n\n7/10\n\nBlake Stone: Planet Strike\n\nThe sequel to blake stone:alien gold takes what the first one did and improves it in almost everyway. There are more enemy types, more weapons,etc. The graphics while not leaps better, have a few new details and animation. The pacing is also much better. There are less keycards (three instead of five) and more of a focus on level design. The map is on your screen at all times which means you won't have to keep pulling up the map like in the first one. But it's more zoomed in so you may get lost a bit more, however I will take this over the last games setup. There are less levels(1/4th from the first one) but this is a case of quality over quanity as I can see going back to this one more. Not everything is better however, all the weapons still use the same ammo, leading to some weapons just filling up space. I also felt less satisfied with the ending than the first one. But overall, this was great and i'm glad I played it.\n\n9/10\n\nRise Of The Triad\n\nROTT was orignally going to be the sequal to wolfenstein 3d and you can tell in many ways the game looks and plays(such as the \"triad\" being nazis and the levels looking limited since it uses the same engine). The action is quite intense and has plenty of weapons. This game is also very gory to almost mortal kombat-style over the top violence and it's done well. You also get choices in your character which can change your speed,defense,and attack, giving the game some variation. The map is the best in the pack and shows a lot of detail. But the map may not always help, as the levels are very large and that can make you lose track of where you are and it doesn't help that it uses the same level designs throughout making it hard know where you been or not. You are also limited to how many weapons you can take, Only one bullet based (which you can't swap out) and a powerful weapon(rockets or firewalls etc.). The game is made for this design choice but it can lead to fighting enemys that are resisting your bullets. Over all this is my favorite in the pack despite my complaints. It's fun, fast, over the top, and doesn't take itself seriously.\n\n9/10\n\nExtreme Rise Of The Triad\n\nThe expansion to ROTT. There are no new weapons or enemies to my knowlege, it's all brand \nnew levels and I must admit I didn't like this one much. Not to say there is no value here, this is far more difficult than ROTT and some may enjoy it. I found it, straining the gameplay and my patience way too much. I was getting lost very frequently and enemy placement and limited weapons made it difficult to enjoy. However I do think many fans will find something to like here. And it still has the gameplay that I enjoyed in the first one.\n\n6/10\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the game pack with all it's up's and downs. I fully recommend this to anyone who wants some classic shooters, I know I had a blast.", "timestamp_updated": 1500069316, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500069013, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34652003", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506084", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504242968, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_games_owned": 4956, "num_reviews": 1973, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Tags: 1PS - First Person Shooter\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: All in one launcher for 3 other games sold individually on Steam. Unfortunately the launcher somehow breaks xbox360 pad support for both blake stone games. It also does not work in ROTT but thats the same in standalone. Recommend you get the standalones instead even if it increases library clutter. Increased playability matters.
