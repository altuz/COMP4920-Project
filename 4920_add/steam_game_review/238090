It's the closest there is to a \"Metal Gear in World War II\" style, and the sniping can be very satisfying. The missions aren't open-ended per se, but the player has a choice whether to use stealth or shoot their way through. I thought it was a bit difficult though; most my attempts at stealth failed miserably and I kept having to resort to shooting every single bad guy I found.\n\nIt is short, and there isn't a ton of story (anyone who was weary of the cinematic scenes in MGS will be happy), but I beat the game today and thought it was top-notch. I would have liked to see the final \"enemy\" actually moving around and fighting though. Destroying a super-tank in a hangar isn't the same as avoiding it in the open desert, climbing onto it while it's moving, and so forth.\n\nI have also been a little spoiled by other games- the lack of a \"dive\" button threw me off, and I missed the opportunity to interrogate prisoners instead of killing them all. Also, the lack of development in the hand-to-hand features was unfortunate. If they know you're there, you'll lose every time. If it's a sneak attack, the player wins every time.\n\nWould recommend, and will be playing the others shortly.", "timestamp_updated": 1505849634, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505849634, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35107126", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502050", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506006646, "steamid": "76561198052007403", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Bug elite 3\n- Enemies duplicate exactly in the same position\n- Empty area become full of soldiers instantly\n- Sometimes you kill an enemy and after he falls on the ground, there is another one in the same place\n- Rarely, but it happens, enemies AI does not work, you can walk in front of him and nothing will happen, or worse, he sees you through the wall (happened 2 times)", "timestamp_updated": 1506007603, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506007603, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35248882", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506285682, "steamid": "76561198390094707", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 95}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Its a fun stealthy game and sniper simulator.

Originally released in 2014, it still holds up as an enjoyable game by today\u2019s standards.\n\nAs you would imagine by the game\u2019s title, your primary weapon is a sniper rifle, but you can also carry a pistol, and an SMG. There are three or four types of each weapon to choose from, but honestly the starting sniper rifle and silenced pistol felt so good to use that I just stuck with them. You can also equip various types of grenades and mines which are useful for destroying tanks. \n\nThere\u2019s a strong focus on stealth, you can crawl along the ground to stay out of sight, perform instant melee kills with a knife, and use loud noises such as the engines of planes flying overhead to mask your rifle fire. Levels are designed to give you multiple paths to reach your objectives, allowing you to avoid or flank some enemies. Its the forgiving style of stealth that I personally enjoy - if you make a mistake and get detected, there\u2019s no instant mission fail, you can go loud and fight your way out of the mess.\n\nMy only real problem with the game is that the AI is a bit too videogamey. After being detected, if you find a place to hide quietly for a minute or two, enemy soldiers will just give up their search and go back to their normal patrol routes. I think it would make more sense if they kept searching until they found you \u2013 especially if they\u2019ve seen you kill their friends.\n\nI finished the campaign in just under 8 hours, which felt a bit short, but on the other hand the fact that I wanted more, clearly meant that I was enjoying the game. I didn\u2019t encounter any bugs or crashes. Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.\n\nIf, like me, you previously overlooked Sniper Elite 3, and you\u2019re in the mood to shoot some Nazis, you might want to consider picking this up on the next sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1504994379, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504994379, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35191345", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494898212, "steamid": "76561198046400253", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "you can SHOOT MEN", "timestamp_updated": 1506288878, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506288878, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34834530", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500412", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504966818, "steamid": "76561198129994865", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "There is an achievement for owning the first 3 games.", "timestamp_updated": 1504954491, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504954491, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35425955", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502556469, "steamid": "76561198152976267", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "pretty lit for 17 minutes.", "timestamp_updated": 1506969761, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506969761, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2573, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 11, "total_negative": 893, "total_reviews": 3466}}
