Pay attention to tutorial messages found on walls. Build for both psi and regular guns or you will be out of ammo.\n\n[b]Before reading this review, it's important to know that I am younger than this game. I first played it more than 15 years after its original release. If you are worried about the game being too dated, don't.[/b]\n\nDo you want to play the game that inspired many recent AAA titles, such as Bioshock 1 & 2, Deus Ex, and Prey, but is better than all of them? System Shock 2 is your game. \n\nAlmost everything about this game really shines in my opinion, so I won't waste time describing how the level design is great or how well the game rewards exploration. [b]All I have done is compiled a bunch of useful information for someone who is looking to buy this game and play it for the first time.[/b]\n\n[h1]Here's a list of what aged well, and what didn't. Note that I have used no mods or tools, just in-game settings[/h1]\n\n[b]Things that aged well-----[/b]\n\n+Graphics are still serviceable. While definitely not up to today's standards, they are immersive, and you get used to them fast\n+1920x1080 (16:9) support. No idea if it supports anything higher\n+Fully rebindable keys, which is good, because the game has TERRIBLE default bindings\n+Full mouse support. This seems silly to point out but I've played 20 yr old games with no mouselook\n+You can change the settings to make it control just like FPS games that come out today\n+Great positional audio (Play this game with headphones, it's really helpful)\n+Really good voice acting\n+Atmosphere is still pretty tense and dark\n\n[b]Things that did not age well-----[/b]\n\n-Gunplay is meh (I was debating putting this one in the \"aged well\" category. All the bullets that seem like the should connect, do connect. My main issue is using corners as cover is sort of unreliable due to very slow walk speed in any direction but forward)\n-Animations are pretty good, you can tell they are old. Better than some games of similar age (Thief 2)\n-Hitboxes on small monkey enemies are really annoying, and they are super hard to hit with the wrench\n-Too few autosaves (fortunately, you can save/load the game whenever you want)\n\n[h1]The game does a pretty poor job communicating a lot of the more obscure but useful stuff in the game. Here's a list of things you should be aware of before playing:[/h1]\n\n-A lot of VERY useful info about game mechanics is on display boards throughout the early stages of the game. They are almost always placed right next to the thing they are referring to. Make sure to inspect (right click) all of these and read everything they have to say. Make sure to savor and cherish these moments. Don't just skim over the tutorial messages or ignore them because you don't [i]need[/i] it. The game is constantly testing you, and if you miss out on too many mechanincs, you're going to have a hard time.\n\n-Important, mission-crucial information is on audio logs found as loot throughout the game. Make sure to listen to all of them. If you don't think you have the patience to do this and the previous thing on this list, this isn't the game for you, and not just because of that.\n\n-Try not to use internet guides in this game. When the game came out, there was no internet, and is best played [i]pretty[/i] blind. If playing it completely blind was a good idea, this entire section wouldn't exist. That being said, if you really get lost, and have already gone over your audio logs and notes (which are basically mission objectives), and you feel like you have explored everywhere, looking things up is fine. Just try not to get too wrapped up in it.\n\n-The tutorial about the map glosses over a really useful feature that I wish i'd discovered sooner. You can press \"M\" to open the map, and there is a minimap button you can press. I recommend always having this on, but don't fall into the trap of having your eyes glued to the minimap. Lots of loot, environmental signs (like an arrow on the ground that says \"medical\"), security cameras, etc. are present throughout the entire game, and you don't want to miss them.\n\n-Another thing the map tutorial glosses over is that you can click on points of interest, such as shops and upgrade stations, then type something and it will appear on your map. You can also press \"N\" to create one of these points of interest at your current location. This is incredibly useful for marking keypads you don't know the code to, storerooms for supplies that you don't want to carry around due to inventory constraints, etc.\n\n[h1]VERY IMPORTANT!!!! Build Advice[/h1]\nIt's very possible that you could get 75% through the game and be stuck because your build wasn't good. The most important skills in the game are Hack and Maintainence. Make sure to level them both a few times. Beyond that, the best build is one that can make use of everything you pick up. If you only spec into Psi, and can't use any guns, you will always have too few psi hypos and too many bullets. You will end up having to use the wrench, and no one wants to try to wrestle with the sh*tty monkey hitboxes.\n\nHoly sh*t, I didn't expect this review to be so long.

Although I had fun with it, it's certainly a game that has aged poorly.  A combination of advances in technology and design, plus many of its ideas being copied by other games, weaken the appeal.  That doesn't make this a bad game, rather one that's not for everyone.\n\nThe most obvious sign of age is the graphics.  I usually say that gameplay is more important, but [b]SS2[/b] is from the age of 3D where people look really weird.  While that kind of works for the corrupted monstrosities, the ordinary characters seen in flashbacks suffer the same problem, and this hinders immersion.  This is something you have to be able to accept to properly experience the game.\n\nA more serious obstacle is the interface.  It's a bad sign when any decent walkthrough will start by telling you to open the options menu and rebind movement controls to something less ridiculous.  You need to remember a lot of keyboard shortcuts to avoid having to use the clunky inventory screen in the middle of combat, without pausing.  Part of the problem is that the game gives you a lot of options, with different healing items, weapons, ammunition, stat boosts and so on.  Those who feel modern games are too simple might appreciate the depth, but I still think there's room to streamline things.\n\nOne gameplay weakness that can't be attributed to its age is the balance.  [b]SS2[/b] is an action RPG, where you can't hit enemies with a stick without the right skills.  Unfortunately, the different options are unbalanced; for example, [i]Standard Weapons[/i] are vastly superior to the alternative weapon types.  On Normal difficulty, you just about have enough cyber modules to correct a mistake, but it's the sort of game where reading a guide on character builds is highly recommended.\n\nDespite the above three paragraphs, I do still recommend [b]SS2[/b].  I've hinted already that the gameplay, while fiddly, offers depth and realism.  There's a curious mix of action and strategy in the need to plan ahead to your next encounter, which you don't find very often.  Not only must you make sure you have the right items, you must ensure they are all either bound to suitable shortcuts or easily arranged in your inventory.  The ability to anticipate the nature of threats also helps.\n\nThe exploration of the [i]Von Braun[/i] is also well done, albeit according to a now-familiar pattern.  The unlocking of different areas gradually is a classic example of gameplay serving the narrative.  The need to access the next area keeps a clear goal at all times, allows a sensible difficulty curve, generally makes sense in-game and also slowly reveals the backstory explaining what has happened.  This has been done in countless games since 1998, but it's still done well here.\n\nThe story in general holds up okay.  There are some flaws, such as weak voice acting and \"twists\" that can be seen a mile off.  But I found the contrast between organic and machine that runs through [b]SS2[/b] well-done, with some really unsettling imagery and implementation.\n\nThere's a steep entry price for [b]System Shock 2[/b], in the sense of the issues you must overlook to fully appreciate it.  Not everyone will be able to willing to do that.  But if you think you might, I'd certainly encourage checking this out.\n\n(Edited to fix formatting error.)", "timestamp_updated": 1506587110, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505394221, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35237505", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1459311733, "steamid": "76561198076311823", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "System Shock 2 has a unique Sci-fi RPG layout, but it is also kind of horror. \n\nSystem Shock 2 was made before there was too much of a quota for exactly what a game needed to be, so it is fun discovering what is different. I was 4 when this game came out, and played it for the first time maybe 3 years ago. The game aged very well. The rpg aspect of System Shock 2 is different from a lot of rpg's today in that it is very hard to get to max level in anything. You level up skills from 1-5 and they get exponentially more expensive to level up. Therefore, you could get level 5 heavy machine guns, but at that point you are sacrificing leveling up so many other things once or twice. The skill system is very fresh. In fantasy rpgs everyone knows that fighters use strength and constitution while wizards use intelligence. But skills here range from physical traits to handling machinery to using psy magic. \n\nOverall a well fleshed out and interesting environment backed up by adaptable gameplay options.

The game is creepy, exciting and atmospheric, with gameplay systems as deep as the Mariana trench. There is so much to do and so many ways of ding it, that I feel as though I could go back and play it a second time and have a radically different experience, and unlike most RPGs, it's short enough (at about 12-20 hours) that I could actually go and do just that (because lets be real, who's going to go and play a 100-hour RPG monster through a second time, just to see what's different?).\nThe game absolutely stands the test of time.

Just like Final Fantasy VII.\n\nThe game doesnt do anything later games havent done, so if you're new to the game and wonder what all the fuss is about: Dont waste your money on this and play Bioshock and Doom 3 instead. \n\nYou'll get the same gameplay experience, but those are superior in all regard.\n\n\nPS: And if you downvote this review, please explain why in the comments section :)", "timestamp_updated": 1504626498, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "6", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504626112, "votes_down": 32}, {"recommendationid": "35363926", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447640", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503879302, "steamid": "76561197990615393", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Not what I was expecting.
