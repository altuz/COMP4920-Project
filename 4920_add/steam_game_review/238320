And for the most part it is, although I did notice a few flaws. Here's what I got out of this playthrough:\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+Outlast has some great atmosphere, which is held up by the fantastic sound design, unique characters, and disorienting location. Somewhat similar to Silent Hill, you'll be in a large area full doors, but nearly all of them are locked, which creates a combination of agoraphobia and claustrophobia.\n+The graphics are also decent. Of course, when you can barely see anything because it's so dark, it's hard to mess up graphics. But not much will beat turning on the infrared camera and seeing eyes glowing in the dark for the first time.\n+The controls are pretty smooth; running from enemies, jumping over obstacles, and looking over your shoulder all feel very natural. It's easy to get immersed with the level of control given to you. It's kind of like a very simplified version of Mirror's Edge.\n+And I personally love when you can collect notes to learn about the backstory in a horror game, which Outlast definitely provides, so that's a pretty big plus in my book.\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n-The enemy AI is both predictable and easy to manipulate. Once you realize that a stalker will check all hiding spots [i]except[/i] the one you're currently in (unless you're an idiot who decided to hide while he's looking at you), hiding changes from you being scared of being found to you being annoyed that he hasn't left the room yet.\n-Some of the jumpscares are kind of weak. I don't mind jumpscares, but in a video game I don't think they're effective when they're part of a cutscene. Basically, instead of thinking \"oh no, I need to run,\" you think \"oh no, I need to watch something happen.\" Don't get me wrong, there are some jumpscares that aren't a part of a cutscene, but there aren't many.\n-But here's probably my biggest complaint: no combat. Now, I'm not some nutcase who picks up a game of Tetris and yells \"WHERE IS THE COMBAT,\" but in a horror game I feel some level of combat is necessary to keep the player scared.\nHere's my [strike]rant[/strike] theory on it: I think fear is strongest in the middle of a fight-or-flight moment. The harder it is to choose between the two, the more stressful and scary the situation is. Without any fighting, there's no real fight-or-flight moment, because the default choice is always to run away. Because of this, it's probably not much scarier to play the game than it is to watch someone else play.\n\nBut don't take these complaints too harshly; the game is still very well put together, and worth a playthrough. I'd give it about a 7.5/10.", "timestamp_updated": 1506998307, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506996887, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35112872", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507345", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1451899285, "steamid": "76561198167016980", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Free on Humble Bundle xD", "timestamp_updated": 1506024370, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1506024370, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35198649", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506649335, "steamid": "76561198296567586", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 122}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "My hands were shaking...omg...arhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... help help holy shieeet", "timestamp_updated": 1506327807, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506327807, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35101541", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506984", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505989648, "steamid": "76561198337837725", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Want to experience being tortured in first-person view?\nOutlast is the game you've been looking for!", "timestamp_updated": 1505989932, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505989932, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34897008", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501234", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499601869, "steamid": "76561198271204027", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Scary AF and u cant use weapon wew 4.8 out of 5", "timestamp_updated": 1505204453, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505204453, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34907865", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507055935, "steamid": "76561198091746106", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "As the first horror game i ever played i enjoyed it to the fullest!\nThis game is scary as hell but for some reason i ilways wanted to continue playing.\nonly one problem, some other horror games seem dull or not scary after you finished this.", "timestamp_updated": 1505247302, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505247302, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35097341", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506069718, "steamid": "76561197979033096", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 64}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If you want a good horror game that will give you a good scare without feeling too difficult(and I mean Dark Souls hard) this game should be at the top of your list.
