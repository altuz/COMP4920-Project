Yeah, except we already can, with Magicka 1.\nYou see, as a stand-alone game it can be considered fine. Yes, with a number of flaws (later on that one), but fine. As a successor to the original Magicka? No, just no.\n\nFirst of all, it is VERY buggy. Graphics settings changing by themselves, effects not being displayed, getting damage and/or heal out of nowere (for example, i contantly got damaged while under the Haste effect), weapons not working, terrible sync problems in coop... The list can go on and on. Original Magicka also had bugs, but not as much.\n\nThe level disign is bad. Most of the time you will have to fight in very tight spaces, so dodging enemies and strategically choosing spells is not an option - you'll just have to spam with beams and mines. Oh, and usually you cannot go back. Didn't know i'm playing Super Mario.\n\nThe number of magicks is way less than in the original, and the number of usefull ones is even smaller. Also, most of the damaging ones are less effective than just spamming with raw elements\n\nDialogs in the original were short and mostly funny. Here, the dialogs are overly long, and even when they manage to pull of a good joke - they usually spoil it by drowning it in useless blabbery.\n\nThere are pretty much no new ideas here, so it looks more like an additional campaign for the first game.\n\nStaffs and melee weapons are mostly useless - and there are very few of those anyway. Different robes don't actually feel different.\n\nFinally, the end boss fight is tied with game's phisics. The problem is - phisics here are really bad.\n\n\n\nTL;DR It's pretty much Magicka one, but with everythig done worse than in the original.", "timestamp_updated": 1506878380, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506796478, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35392982", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506854076, "steamid": "76561198141241013", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 398}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Where do I start,this game is much MUCH worse than it's predecessor,I am hurt that I writing a bad review about something that's related to magicka just because of how I love it and the wizard wars was just amazing for me,too bad it got closed down. I pre-ordered this game with such hopes,but they got rekt. the whole campaign I had one thought in my head \"maybe,it gets better\",but HELL no.\n \nPros\n-Game looks flipping awesome\n- ... \nCons\n-Phyiscs feel very unreal,they are just non-existant in some situations.\n-Mostly you can get away with spamming raw elemnts like Death,Fire,and Water - Lightning combo.\n-The quickcast system is just a mystery for me,I don't even know why it's there.\n-You can revive your familiars meaning infinite ressurection (Killing the sense of death,in solo)\n-Where are the spells? i only saw 6 in the entire game (magicks)\n-It's would've been better if they used the budget to atleast try to revive Wizard wars\n-The games sense of difficulty is just giving more element variaty to enemies and bosses for example the final boss gets Cold and Lightning along with the fire\n-The story is the same. Try to kill the dude,fail,get a cool spell,kill the dude.\n-This list can be even longer i am just tired now.\n-Haven't seen a sausage,A SAUSAGE!!!!! the entire the game.\n-The game reuses the same art over and over and over and over and over...\n   13/100.
