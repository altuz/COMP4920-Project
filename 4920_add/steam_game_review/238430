Otherwise it isn't very populated. \n\nIt's more disapointing seeing a good game with a lot of potential not being utilized, but at least the game was finished as promised. \n\nRecommending this game because it is a good game....just be mindful that it is abandonded and there are not many players. \n\nThe devs are creating a new game called Project Ageless, we'll see how that game goes.", "timestamp_updated": 1504834734, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504834734, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35309753", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509148", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1414038579, "steamid": "76561197975774610", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game had so much potential.
