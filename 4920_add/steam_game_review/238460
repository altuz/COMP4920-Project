It's hard to draw comparisons because of how different it was. It's weird. And you know what? I fucking love it. It was surprisingly difficult at parts (especially if you're a completionist) and might make you want to kill yourself as you cry tears of anger and potentially break vital parts of your computer. Is that a bad thing? No. Sure, some could argue that incredibly difficult platformers are a tad overdone, but none of them hold the charm or crude humor that this title throws at you as much as it possibly can. I loved every moment of it. Online multiplayer is a bit lackluster unless you're playing through the campaign, however. And on the note of bad sides, the game might start to feel monotonous eventually, so you'll have to put it down at certain intervals. One last thing- in certain levels you will find questionable enemy placement, but its nothing seriously major, especially if you're not playing on the hardest difficulty. \nI got this game on sale, and if I had to, I would've payed the full price.
