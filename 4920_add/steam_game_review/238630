I was looking forward to a good beat-em-up because I grew up playing Streets of Rage and Golden Axe, but this felt like a crappy flash games I played on Newgrounds back in 2002. The player doesn't even stop walking when you attack, so it feels like you're ice skating. Is it really so hard to program stuff that was easily done over 20 years ago? It makes no sense that you can just run through enemies and punch them without stopping or even slowing down. Also the \"jump kick\" is really an aerial slam as there's no angular momentum, you just crash back down to the ground a few inches from where you start. Totally useless, I wouldn't play this again even if it were free. You give this genre of games a bad name, shame on you", "timestamp_updated": 1502507559, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502507559, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34199707", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492203", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504656271, "steamid": "76561198171246133", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Make an online multiplayer and this game could be 10x better.", "timestamp_updated": 1502571310, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502571310, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "34154680", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.416530", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502397787, "steamid": "76561198064470995", "num_games_owned": 903, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 18, "review": "So you put a roller derby girl as a playable character and her special attack is a kiss that makes the enemy fight for you.
