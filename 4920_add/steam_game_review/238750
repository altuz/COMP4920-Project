The Ironfists are gone, The Kreegans are gone, The Ancients are gone, (and this already happened but...) the planet Enroth is gone. I don't mean that these things are destroyed (Except Enroth...) None of them ever happened, all that rich lore from games 1-9? all that stuff from Heroes 1-4? Never. Happened.\n     So, to bring an end to my long rant, don't buy this, the older games might not have the best graphics, but they have the heart, soul, and fun this game never will have.\n     The only positive thing I can say for this is that I got Might and Magic 6 with it, but even then, I should have bought it from GoG for (about) $5 less.\n\nEdit(s): Fixed typos", "timestamp_updated": 1507049946, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505783180, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34975763", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501653", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1470002316, "steamid": "76561198020185016", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "overpriced tablet game marked like top game, full of bugs, worse performance of unity engine, no modifications because unity 1600 dolars program price, one month after expansion release game fully abandoned and team disbanded", "timestamp_updated": 1505492170, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505492170, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34893707", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503373", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507072252, "steamid": "76561197969862761", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1856}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is broken.
