That's an old reference most may not know, but bascially it's a texted based adventure where you try to manage a society. Each choice has consequences. It's a really awesome game and you can still pick it up on gog.com. \n\nSo I see this game and think it's King of Dragon Pass with a little more board game play and possibly less text. I was wrong. This game does have progression. It does have a story. But damned if I know what it going on! I'm not sure why I'm switching boards or why I have tokens or how things are happening. There is no flow to this game. It goes from one board to another and back then switches things up. You're never told why things are happening. Some things that I felt should be planned are random. Some things are planned that should have been random. It jarrs the player back and forth through story and board games and slot machines without any message as to it's scope or reasoning.\n\nI spent the first 10 minutes of the game making a baby and training that baby to be someone better than me. Then the game went in another direction and totally forgot all about the offspring I had spent so much time creating...\n\nDiscovery in a game is important. It helps a player learn and keeps them engaged. Too much tutorial or just plain text dumps at the beginning of a game always gets a down vote from me. This game did the exact opposite but in a bad way. It's almost like the developer's thought you'd have some grasp of the game already. What I'm trying to say is it's like playing a First Person Game. There doesn't need to be a tutorial to tell you WASD is for moving, mouse is for looking. We've played enough First Person Games we don't need our hand held in that reguard. BUT let's say the first time you played Skyrim they didn't tell you how to pick a lock. That would leave you confused and slightly frustrated. What if they didn't tell you how to equip spells? What if they didn't tell you how to sneak? WHAT IF they did not tell you who you were or why you were even playing the game??? Say the game just dropped you outside the starter city, in the wilds, with no story or tutorials and just let you play? That is what this game proudly attempts to do. The difference is this is not a First Person Game, it's a board game, and I don't know anyone who just picks up a board game and begins playing without consulting a few rules to begin with.\n\nThere is enough intrigue to keep you playing for a while, but not enough to fully enjoy the game. In the hour I played, I never felt as though I knew what was going on. Also at $20 the game is a rip off. Maybe the developer's felt they put a lot of effort in the game and it's worth it, but the reviews state otherwise. \n\nI do want to like the game. Maybe if I understood why the turns kept flipping around or what my purpose in the game even was I may have played longer. But as it stands this game is a tangled mess that only the truely entrepid or bored gamers will ever fully come to enjoy. If you're someone who needs no motivation this is probably the game for you, but at $20 it's still not worth your time.", "timestamp_updated": 1503069478, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503069204, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33815824", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496367", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501098579, "steamid": "76561198025196500", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Money and time are too valuable.", "timestamp_updated": 1501096701, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501096674, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "33342019", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495508", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1399312887, "steamid": "76561198007397796", "num_games_owned": 727, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is dead! i liked it once, but it's not finished. the devs bandoned it.\nDon't waste ur time and money!", "timestamp_updated": 1499432308, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499432308, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 134, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 91, "total_reviews": 225}}
