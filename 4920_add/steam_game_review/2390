I recommend using zDoom to make it look better and rebind the keys to fit the modern standards (wsad+mouse look). However, it is fully playable without it! For example, I played the first episode through without zDoom, using the legacy configs and unenhanced graphics - works as it did back in the days!\n\nA few zDoom tips:\n[olist]\n[*]to launch through Steam using zDoom: put zDoom files in game file folder and rename zDoom to be dosbox.exe\n[*]no jump or crouch in this game - using them break levels\n[*]toggle death camera on, there are different death animations that are not visible otherwise! :P\n[/olist]"}]}
