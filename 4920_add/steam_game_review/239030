The gameplay is actually enjoyable and suitably challenging with the ever-evolving ruleset. There is at least replay value for a second run-through of the campaign of about 6 hours.\n\nThe world is simple, yet immersive. It's easy to find yourself attached to a son you never even get to see. The ingame geopolitics have a surprising amount of coherence and depth, given that you just get snippets of history from newspaper headlines and conversations. Most entrants you process are just numbers, but a not insignificant amount comes with unique personalities.\n\nThe moral implications of your in-game job are most interesting. By the end of the game you get to push around absurd stacks of paper to fit the whims of a kafkaesque immigration ruleset. And yet each individual rule somewhat makes perfect sense. These are dire times, there are frequent terrorist attacks, there are subversive elements from within, there is rampant drug and weapon smuggling. It's actually completely sensible for a government to crack down in this situation. And yet there are individual tales of hardship, hope and love as people yearn to escape, find a better life or be reunited with their loved ones. There are no easy answers and the game does not dumb down this dilemma.\n\nAnd then you find yourself thinking, \"I could deny the entrant, stamp a reason and hand them back their 4 documents one-by-one - or I could just press the 'detain' button and have all my problems go away with a single click\". In that moment you realize the banality of evil and how it is in each and every one of us and the game turns from a great experience to a brilliant masterpiece.", "timestamp_updated": 1505426299, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505426299, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34842559", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510567", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503770048, "steamid": "76561198068049842", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "In this game, you're a border officer who checks legal document for everyone who tries to cross the border.

Set up your own S.O.P, memorized the names of fictional country, stamps pattern, signs and etc. \n\nThe game will also tests your moral compass, Example: Should you let this person in because his country don't have good doctor but he don't have the required documentation to enter the border?

The whole 1984 (bit on the nose) tack is a bit played out, but the events that occur during each day of public service are what makes the game worth playing. The player is offered many chances to determine what determines their morality: the welfare of a complete stranger or the safety of the family they've left at home.\n\nFinally: It's just a super intuitive game.
