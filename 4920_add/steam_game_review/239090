Katana slashes, if timed correctly, can also reflect bullets. Yet, there are tons of other subtleties, nuances and the element of mind games that differentiate the skill levels of players.\n\nThere is also a ton of game modes and maps that keep the core gameplay fun and engaging: each map brings new twists to the old formula.\n\nThis game is also insanely stylish and polished - every slash, jump and bullet is satisfying and exciting. \n\nOverall, strongly recommended for a great time with friends.", "timestamp_updated": 1498186986, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498186986, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 208, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 13, "total_reviews": 221}}
