Since I already finished it on the NES*\n\n\n\nOkay, is this the worst Final Fantasy? Kinda... For me, the worst was the first Final Fantasy game. \n\nBut here's what I can say about the game that's good. The job system is fun. They did it better on 5 and X2. But gonna givei it a pass cause it was the first move they did with the job system. \n\nThe 3D thing is an overkill, and really ugly. Story and characters takes a backseat. \n\nBuy the game if its on sale.\n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1504969639, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504969639, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 397, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 118, "total_reviews": 515}}
