I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW ONCE I GET INTO THE FOLLOWING. ALSO, I HAVE YET TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN WITHIN DYING LIGHT. Ok now onto the review for what I think so far :)\n\n\"Oh man this is just another shit zombie game.\" WRONG. It sure is a zombie game, but the added features of parkour and freerunning, combined with the large open world, and a fresh feel the often over-saturated zombie genre.\n\nPROS:\n- Gameplay is amazing. Parkour and freerunning are both very smooth, and there are very few issues with the movement. The one only area that doesn't do great in this regard is getting up cliffs or rocky areas, but considering that Dying Light takes place in an urban environment, you aren't gonna be climbing up that many cliffs tbh.\n- Weapon Upgrading feels really rewarding, where you find what you need to upgrade a weapon in the world, and then can add a variety of upgrades to (melee) weapons such as fire, electricity, bleeding, and toxicity. It feels pretty damn cool to get a high end weapon and add flame to it, so when you hit a zombie it will burst into flames. Guns in this game are relatively easy to come across once you get to a high enough survivor level, however it's rare enough that it's still special.\n- The upgrade trees give really awesome upgrades to your character and general survivability without feeling too overpowered for a good amount of the game. Obviously when you max out all your levels, then you are kind of an unstoppable beast, but at least it's not a situation where you get a level and go from really weak to tremendously overpowered. For Agility, you gain points by (as you may have guessed) running around the map, jumping and leaping from rooftop to rooftop. For Power, you can gain these points from killing zombies and generally doing damage. The best part is that you can get points towards this through molotovs, or other zombie-killing devices other than your own weapons. This is a plus because sometimes you are focusing so much on quests and running around to the point that your agility level is off the charts, while your power level is like, level 5. The Survival level is upgraded by completing quests, capturing airdrops, and saving survivors. One thing to keep in mind, is if you plan to play with friends, I would HIGHLY reccomend having one save file for yourself and another for you to play ewith your friends. I ran into a situation where I was playing by myself and then bringing my friend into that game when he was available. This meant that he only got survivor rank credit from the quests that we did together, and so I was a way higher rank than him. Then there's the legendary rank, which is unlocked after unlocking all the upgrades in every other skill tree. It turns you into a zombie killing tank, by increasing max health, stamina, as well as specific weapon damage. Overall, the upgrades are challenging enough and also provide you with enough reason to try to level up a certain skill.\n- The world of Dying Light is really damn cool. It seems authentic and realistic, and does not seem forced at all. It makes it really interesting for parkour, as well as when you are running away from a viral or a volatile.\n- The Volatiles in this game are actually terrifying, and also new and original which is great to see in the zombie genre. They are super-human zombies (rather ironic choice of words but you ge the idea) and they only come out at night. This makes any situation where you are stuck outside after the sun's gone down really damn intense. Dying Light does a great job making you goddamn terrified of the dark. The other zombies and special infected are pretty generic, but still, what those are lacking for, I feel like the volatiles make up for that one hundred percent. There are new infected added into Dying Light The Following from what I have seen, but in the base game, the infected that you encounter in the daytime are pretty damn generic.\n- The Hud is really clean and easy to understand, no problems whatsoever.\n- The graphics in this game are beautiful, with lens flare and all other sorts of cinematic effects, you feel like you are playing a movie sometimes. Absolutely gorgeous game!\n\nCONS:\n- As mentioned before, the average infected you will meet will be more of the same. The volatiles I personally believe help change the entirety of the game, but still overall the zombies are pretty underwhelming and quickly become an inconvienence rather than something scary within the game.\n- The story leaves lots to be desired. There is a lot of stereotypes and a shit ton of cliches, and is very predictable. \n- The characters are pretty bland. Many you meet you will frankly not care about. The game lacks in character backstory, which makes you quite apathetic towards a lot of people. That being said, there is one guy (whos name escapes me) that just hangs out beside the elevator in the tower when you ride it up and is like, the nicest dude from the get go. I love that man. \n\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a beautiful game with great mechanics player upgrades that you can sink hours into without realizing, Dying Light is the game for you. However, if you are looking for a very story-rich game, then this will fall short. I personally have had a blast with this game, and playing with friends makes the game just that much better. I would highly reccomend. \n\nThanks for reading my review! It is the first review I have done, but who knows, I may do more.

Keep noise to a minimum, and try not to get surrounded...\nBut it's a whole different game at night.\nWhen the sun falls, so too will you if you do not seek shelter. In the night there is a breed of infected that move faster, navigate and parkour better, and will rip you limb from limb before you can scream for help. Your only hope is to avoid conflict entirely and reach shelter in bases, or under UV lamps that burn the infected (which is why you will not see them in the day). Be cautious, however, for dark areas may still have them about...\nStill, consider yourself brave enough? You'll be rewarded with double XP progress, so long as you LIVE through the night.\n\nNoteworthy things\n-Your weapons degrade, and you will need to choose your battles, not all fights can be won, don't be afraid to run.\n-You have LIMITED stamina at first, but when you progress far enough, you will gain unlimited stamina. (This feature makes it VERY dangerous to be out at night)\n-You can be the infected, but only if the players have that option enabled. (Keep it enabled, more challenge and more fun!)\n-There is not a lot of gun variety\n-Parkour stays fresh and fun, with combat abilities that tie into it. (And a grappling hook later on!)\n\nPros\n-This game, while not requiring coop, is much more fun and easier with a friend, more so with the DLC.\n-Graphics aren't half bad for the time it was made\n-Plenty of playstyles for plenty of people\n\nCons\n-Lack of guns for the gun-nuts. No AUG, not AK47...\n-Not uncommon for mis-navigation (when you want your character to jump up, but he fucking jumps backward off the building like some dumbass Assassin)\n-Weapon degradation (except guns); personally I like it, but your weapons will need to be repaired and have a limit for how many times they can be repaired.
