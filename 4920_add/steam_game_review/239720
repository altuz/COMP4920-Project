Young gamers or inexperienced gamers will probably have difficulty in a lot of spots. It offers a lot of special abilities for Pac-Man that are very clever and neat to use. The fights are actually more intense than what you'd expect to see in a typicall 3D Platformer. You fight quite a bit of ghosts all at once at various points, and it sort of uses a combo system to pull it off, which is really neat. It has several mini-games to unlock and play, which bring back the greatness of the 80's arcades. The Steam controller is a great controller for this game, which seems to work rather perfectly. The controls are very good with it. The levels are large and beautiful, and while they are generally linear, you do have to break off the main path and do some exploring to find everything, which is something I always enjoy doing. The main thing I don't like about this game is that if you want to get all achievements, you have to play every single stage twice, and there is nothing new in each stage when you play it for a second time, so that part seems redundant for no good reason. It was fun to earn all of the achievements, anyway, in about 15 hours of gameplay.", "timestamp_updated": 1505332871, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505332871, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 52, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 14, "total_reviews": 66}}
