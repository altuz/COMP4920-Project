I'll start with the cons. My major \"complaint\" is how hard it was for me to get used to the mechanics, three dash-jumps from start + slowmo was a lot to get used to, and if you're like me and decide to start the game on hard you're probably not gonna have a great time on the first level... And that first level is 1/7 of the game, which takes me to the next point: the game is really short, like, 40 minutes short, it ends when you're finally getting the hang of the controls.  \nNow, the reason I find hard to review this is cause those cons are also pros. The game is short, but no two parts are the same and every section in every level is filled up with new content and mechanics. The controls feel weird at first but HOLY SHIT it's awesome to use the slow-mo to dodge two bullets, change weapon in mid air to hit that third one with the katana, make a few wall jumps get height and dash above those enemies, change to rocket launcher again without even touching the ground once and... You get it, it's fun. \nTo me, what makes the game is its replayability, and I'm sad cause I know not many people are into that. Each level has 4 difficulties with actual variations in them (different boss patterns, enemy placement, etc), and if you think finishing a level is fun, try finishing a level on v. hard without dying. It feels so rewarding when you know the layout and just how to use your abilities properly.  \nThis review is already a mess and I haven't mentioned most of the stuff, so: graphics look cool, music is fine, story is almost non existent (still charming and the two dialogues are... good, I guess?) and everything feels made up with so much love. When you die, for example, Wryn says different stuff in different stages, that alone shows you how much attention they put into this little game.  \nCurrently I have just a few hours, but I *WILL* finish everything on v. hard.\nTL;DR: the game gets its awesomeness from replaying and learning the stages, so if that's not your thing, it's probably just gonna have twenty minutes of gameplay.", "timestamp_updated": 1499221882, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498636482, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32703015", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498435862, "steamid": "76561198098369932", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Pretty cool little indie game.
