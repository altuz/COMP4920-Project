The game is a bit short and a little lacking in content - you can find a lot of content in the workshop but it is not possible to play in larger office with more extras.\n\n+ overall gameplay\n+ a lot of economic dependencies\n+ realistic model of game creation and selling process\n+ many factors affect game evaluation\n+ extensive training system\n+ lots of actions available\n+ nice music and sound effects\n\n- a little short game play\n- not many stages of office development\n\nI will not judge if this is on plus or minus, but it is very hard to lose in this game.\n\nOverall: 8/10",
