Unfortunately, it also captures the tedium of a managing the established settlement that those survivors eventually evolve into. \n\nThis game is a zombie survivor base-building game. It's got all the features. Resource management, job assignments, base building, structural upgrades and repairs. It's got character levelling and growth options, personal needs and beliefs, both base moral and individual moods, as well as scripted but belivable character interactions. There's even some reasonably sophisticated politics that reacts to situations. Random events, situations with multiple options. Base defense, exploration, scavanging, fighting zombies as well as various human groups (each with their own unique equipment and personality). Plenty of features, the majority of them done quite well. \n\nThat said, there are many aspects of the game that are just frustrating. Base management is a pain. You control a character and he/she can only control aspects of the base from certain locations. So there's alot of running back and forth between rooms to tweak the aspects of the base. Alot of scanning the halls, looking for the one character so you can deliver your quest item. You can't access character screens unless they're in your party and outside the base, and you can only access inventory screens from a single place in the base. Items can get lost in players inventories, forcing you to regularly go through characters inventories one at a time, to see if they're carrying anything important. \n\nThe missons suffers from a major problem, in that it has realtime sneak/explore/loot mode and a turn-based fighting mode, and transitions are handled very poorly. The instigator of combat gets initiative, which makes it a huge tactical advantage to be able to control position, timing and agro as combat starts. Unfortunately, the transition to and from turn-base isn't handled well, so most of the challenge is learning to navigate the transitions. \n\nAn example I struggled with many times at first: you'll be sneaking up behind a zombie, then you trigger turn based combat and move your first character a a little closer... but you didn't get close enough for him to see you. There's no agroed zombies, so combat automatically ends. The game returns to realtime and immediately the team regroups with the first member, alerting the zombie to their presence as they do so. Now combat restarts with your whole team in different positions, and since the zombie \"started combat\" he gets initiative like you're being ambushed. Now he turns and takes a big bite out of that first survivor, possibly infecting him, and now you may have to spend the rest of the game (maybe 40 hours?) making sure he's got a steady supply of medicine so he doesn't turn. \n\nA different kind of frustrating... the combat is slow. On a big map, you might sneak up and attack one zombie, but the combat system has to process the 50 other zombies all over the map (who are just standing around cuz they're across the map and haven't agroed yet). It's like we're playing a 1998 strategy game... the PC's turns tend to be five times as long as yours when nothing is happening. And if there are enemy survivors are fighting zombies somewhere across the map... then you have to wait for all the animations even though you can't see them. Tactically it's a win, but it takes soooooo long. \n\nCamera angles are bad too. You can spin the camera but not adjust the angle, and walls are high and ceilings don't always disappear when you want them to. I had one battle where we fought under a gas-station canopy where the canopy wouldn't disappear, so I just had to keep spinning the cameara, trying to get a glimpse of what was happening underneath. Thin halls and cramped rooms are difficult as well. \n\nLast gripe: Late in the game, zombies become trival enemies, but their bites can infect survivors, which is an incurable catastrophy. But if you've gotten to this point, you know how to be careful. It's not hard, it's just slow and tedious. Going through a suburb, stealth killing one zombie at a time for routine scavenging operations is mind-numbingly boring, but such a big part of the game. \n\nAnyway, all that said, pretty much everything I haven't complained about is very good. Challenging combat is fun. You need to pick your battles, as different groups have different tiers of equipment. I'll never forget the first time my squad bumped into a pair of Coyote gangsters. It's still terrifying bumping into military defectors squads with my zombie-equipped scavanging team. Monitoring your food and medicine levels is always a little tense, and it's a rush of relief when you find that rare stash of supplies. You love dumpsters, hoping for rotten fruit and scrap wood. Finding a AK47 is not nearly as satisfying as a 10lbs bag of beans (Or that time I found the twinky factory and carried back 120lbs of twinkies and raw sugar. Not sure if they'd worship me or crucify me).\n\nI'm much more patient than most gamers, but this one was too much for me. If you want to finish this game, it will take an extremely patient person (or at least someone who is committed to finishing it, regardless of whether they enjoy it). On the other hand, some people probably play the start, but set it down when it becomes a sea of routine scavanging. If you think you're one of those two types of people, maybe this game is for you, but it was just too slow for me.", "timestamp_updated": 1506591050, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506591050, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34960524", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509986", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1453685132, "steamid": "76561198042191642", "num_games_owned": 1072, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Dead State takes on a game setting that has been done before: A zombie apocalypse has occurred, and you're tasked with surviving by scrounging up whatever materials and rescuing and recruiting any survivors you can find. While it is a tried-and-sometimes-true genre, I feel like Dead State does manage to make it interesting, at least. The beginning is possibly it's strongest point, when you're tasked with fortifying a high-school that ends up becoming your base of operations. \n\nWith a handful of other survivors, each with their own personalities, quirks, strengths and weaknesses in different aspects of contribution, you're supposed to somehow ration supplies, assign objectives, get crew assigned to different items, and find a way to go out a scavenge without becoming a citizen of the new apocalypse. It honestly becomes an interesting take on group management in a strenuous situation, and the experience is punctuated with semi-schedules events that take place throughout the game depending on the survivors present and the situation you're in, even sometimes requiring you to make difficult decision that impact the game in a drastic way.\n\nThe other portion of the game pertains to the scavenging, and makes up a sizable portion of the game and is arguably the most frequent portion you'll work with outside of the former. Scavenging sees you moving about on a large map and trying to uncover locations of interest, while also trying to manage inventory and supplies during the journey. Once you uncover a location, you're usually able to enter the area's local map and move about, most often encountering zombies, looters, hostile survivors and friendly units that you can potentially recruit and bring about to your cause. Usually, the latter are the more interesting of these, as they often come with encounters unique to them and often showcase the developer's talents in context clues and storytelling.\n\nCombat takes place in a grid-based movement system where all units take turns and have various actions based on their equipment, and on an AP system which limits the amount of actions a single character can perform in a round. It's nothing too drastically new, so I won't go terribly into detail. It has had some known bugs, however, such as looters being killed by zombies, and taking a rather large number of rounds to turn, before you can kill the now zombified-looter and end combat.\n\nPROS:\n-Excellent marriage of Group Management and Zombie genres, with some exploration and turn-based grid-aligned combat, to boot.\n-While the game largely follows a set path in terms of major events, it does offer quite a large number of optional, semi-random events that can drastically impact the way the game progresses. Not necessarily to the point of providing several greatly different endings, but it can definitely change the game in a good way.\n-A truly great instance of developers with a penchant for character writing. Not every character drips with rainbows of uniqueness, but the situations are interesting and presented in ways that seem believable, which lends a great amount of atmosphere and interest to the cast, where they'd normally suffer from having too many on board.\n-Context is done masterfully in this game, as most times you can explore a location and see a story unfolding in front of you without a single written word or moving picture. This is usually most impressive when you're rescuing survivors, as you can often piece together terrible, tragic, or even sometimes horrifying stories simply by looking around the area first.\n\nCONS:\n-Unfortunately, as time goes on, the strong start does fade somewhat, and the game can sometimes seem more like menial tasking when you're waiting for the next day to arrive, and the end can seem like it is taking forever to arrive.\n-A somewhat weak ending, although there are some slight variations depending on your decisions or the events you took part in.\n-Some events are almost down-right secrets, as they can be almost entirely too easy to miss without knowledge beforehand.\n\nEven so, I'd recommend trying Dead State, at the very least. It's an underrated gem that really does deserve more coverage than it gets, and if you're into these genres, you really can't go wrong.", "timestamp_updated": 1505434838, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505434838, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34903174", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497769", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504549322, "steamid": "76561198056142927", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I enjoyed a few aspects of this game. The morale system and assigning people to work on your base is a neat addition. But the combat, oh the combat.
