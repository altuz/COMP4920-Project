I enjoy playing it, but sometimes it freezes for no reason. I have almost 20 DLC's and I find them very fun to mess around with in the Scenario/World Builder.\n\nPRO's:\n1.) Very realistic\n2.) Giant range of DLC's, for people with different tastes. (eg: Steam, Diesel, (Or For Me, Electric)\n3.) Very smooth when it does work.\n4.) Although some may say this is a CON, I think it is a PRO, that this game is a time consumer!!!!! :) (Look at my total hours gameplay for the game!!)\n\nCON's:\n1.) Sometimes freezes on OS's that so far exceed the games minimum reccomended requierments. (MRR)\n\n2) The DLC's, (IN MY OPINION) are majorly OVER priced. (Don't get me wrong, it does take a while to 3D model all the trains and build all the routes and stuff, but we could do that ourselfs and I just think if they lowered the prices more people would buy DLC, meaning they would have EVEN more money.)\n\n3.) No ability for 'Custom Content' (Station signs, trains (& Liverys) etc....)\n\n4.) No ability for Multi-Player and walking around. If they added walking around like TSW/WOS3, and Multi-Player it would be more fun!!\n\nOVERALL I rate this game: 9.2 / 10 :D"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505742420, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499735", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35045573", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198040683423", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506973887, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 758, "playtime_forever": 9356}, "timestamp_updated": 1505742420, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good simulation, plenty of routes, and Doc.
