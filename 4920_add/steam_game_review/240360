This game should only be bought to complement the first Dragon's Lair with after you finished the first game.  DL2 is honestly more frustrating thanks to needing to find all of the hidden treasures to access the last level and checkpoints being spaced out by entire levels.  It is a harsh experience for those learning how to get through each part without hints on, and the repeated dialogue you hear may drive you insane.  It doesn't really improve from it's predecessor in any particular way and is more or less the same way of playing except harder.  Despite flashes that do give you a general hint on what you should do, there will still be a good handful of times where you are conflicted between two directions it could be, guess wrong, then have to replay the whole level again.  It is in my opinion a little worse overall compared to the first game. Only get this if you must have part two of Dragon's Lair after completing the first game and don't mind an additional challenge.", "timestamp_updated": 1494802177, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494802100, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 18}}
