Aside from the extreme RNG dependency, this game doesn't offer that much. Boring activate-this-object side quests, with little to no thinking required or a minimally decent story made most of this game feel empty and boring. Obvious character progression.\n\nPros:\n- Individually interesting settlements\n- Big party that allows for one or two interesting combat encounters\n- Many companions available in the game\n- Difficulty levels (mostly affects combat)\n\nCons:\n- Awful and unjustified performance (this game runs at 30 fps dropping down to 5 fps on the same computer I play The Witcher 3 at 30 fps 1% lows)\n- Never delivered on their mod-support promise (and probably never will)\n- Mindless boring quests that rarely require thinking or planning\n- Obvious and shallow character progression\n- Full of bugs, crashes, glitches\n- Gets stuck on loading screens (seems to be their \"top priority bug\" since 2014, according to dev's posts on forums)\n- Wildly incompatible character portraits that ruin the little immersion you can force yourself into as soon as you see an indian with a geisha portrait (really, why even bother including those?)\n\n\nIn the end, this definitely didn't live up to its hype. It's a mediocre tactical RPG with a generic storyline, bland combat and a really shallow character system.\nThis definitely doesn't even remind me of old Fallout games.\n\nNot worth half its price.", "timestamp_updated": 1504769083, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504756902, "votes_down": 29}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2254, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 507, "total_reviews": 2761}}
