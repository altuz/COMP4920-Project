I'm really not sure if I should recommend this or not because for all intents and purposes it's not a 'bad' game when taken on its own. It's just so truncated and basic that after the previous entries it feels like a let-down. Now I don't usually take a dig at consoles and console gamers seeing as I'm one myself, but this is a very good example of a series 'dumbing down' for a wider console audience. \n\nSo what's the problem? The problem is that the game, or rather the puzzles within are far too basic and self-explanatory. Whereas previous entries in the series would have you jotting down notes, figuring out patterns and trying to read between the lines this game for the most part doesn't really get any deeper than remembering some symbols in order to figure out a maze. Most of the puzzles can be solved without much thought and the way the game indicates that you've examined everything in an area removes most of the challenge that the previous games had. I could go on but most of the time I felt more like I was playing an interactive movie with some occasionally tricky puzzles. However most of the time you go to a place, talk to someone and check everything you need to check, and then get told to go on and do some other task, look for more clues and then make a deduction. Occasionally you have some action segment or will get to control another character but nothing that's mentally taxing. In short, it's a very liniear experience.\n\nIt's not all bad though; the presentation is top notch for the most part and the interface is very clear. You can customise the way Holmes dresses though this is only relevant twice in the game as I recall. Voice acting is good and you are given a wide array of mysteries to solve. Two new features that are pretty interesting are the abilities to 'read' a character by looking over their appearance; a nice little feature that helps you gain clues and dialogue options as well as being very 'Holmesan'. As well as the deductions for each case being open-ended, you have multiple conclusions to each case but unfortunately due to the very prosaic nature of the puzzles and clue finding it's pretty obvious which is the right choice for the most part.\n\nOverall, as I said at the start, it's not a bad game per say, just rather dull and straightforward. It's a shame really, because the last game, 'The Testament of Sherlock Holmes' was a good blend of tricky puzzles and some more action-focused sequences. Why they didn't carry on with that is the real mystery.\n\nReccomended if you want a basic, easygoing experience, not so reccomended if you wanted something more challenging. Either way get it on sale if you have to but it's certainly skippable.", "timestamp_updated": 1506305807, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506015919, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34892123", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505259413, "steamid": "76561198057106086", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I think its a great game, i've always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes.

While the plot is good and thick and the story is somewhat engaging, the execution seems haphazard to the point of negligence.\n\nThings I enjoyed:\n\nGood story,\nUnlikely suspects.\nOddly high resolution textures.\n\n\nThings that I did not enjoy:\n\nBad collision: you run into npcs and run into an invisible wall around 1 metre from contact\n\nCamera angles: A scene will load with a voiceover explaining the scene, except you can't actually see it because without moving the controllers the scene is completely blocked by the character throughout the dialogue from the very start.\n\nCustomisation is offered, and you can see what it will look like, but you can't choose it unless you 'unlock it'. Maybe don't tempt people with options they don't actually have.\n\nTexture resolution: clothes will be a pixellated mess compared to hair or face textures. I know textures must be optimised, but at least match them with each other in quality so we don't notice how bad one or the other is.\n\nNPC dialogue: Usually an NPC at the very least cycles between AT LEAST two phrases. In this game they all just say \"Mr Holmes?\" in the same voice and tone. It sounds like a placeholder voice made it into the actual game because someone forgot to add voices to the passive NPCs.\n\nPlacment of clutter: Things in this game either have immense attention to detail, or they don't. Sometimes an environment looks almost natural and beautiful, and in the next moment you're exposed to a mish mash of badly placed objects that do not make sense.
