They\u2019ve rebalanced a chunk of the card game and designed it in a way that more deck types can be viable. I also feel that they improved the flow of the story mode; In the original, it got pretty easy to hit a wall at points and you\u2019d have to grind away, but here I got the impression that they offer multiple paths if you got stuck at one opponent. They\u2019ve also finally added online play, which I haven\u2019t tried yet but planning to once I get enough of the cards I\u2019d like to use.\n\nIf there\u2019s one minor gripe I have with the game it\u2019s that I think coming across booster pack/cards is a lot more uncommon than I\u2019d expect. Most of the prizes are coins to use to trade for packs, but other than that card prizes don\u2019t happen often. Which means it\u2019ll be a while at the beginning before you\u2019re really able to make a solid new deck, but at least what they give you at the start is serviceable.\n\nOverall, if you really enjoy CCG games, especially the adventure-based ones of the Pokemon TCG GB or Monster Rancher Battle Card series, this is absolutely worth a pickup.", "timestamp_updated": 1504574766, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504574766, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34753208", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499623", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504966185, "steamid": "76561198023705570", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The original Card City Nights is one of my favourite digital card games, reminiscent of the gameboy pokemon card game.

It retains the quality graphics, music, humor, and vibe of the original.  Just the same, if you're a fan of Ludosity's games, you'll still appreciate all of the references, subtle and otherwise.  The gameplay is updated with a similar, yet different playstyle.  Instead of playing on your own board, you share a large board with your opponent.  You can block each-others' cards, and cards will stay on the playfield until they tick down and resolve.  This allows for a greater versatility on card designs.\n\nThere are some of the same balance choices from the original.  Do you want more power at the cost of arrows?  In addition though, cards can have effects while they hang around and tick down to 0, cards can change the color of your opponent's cards, and all sorts of other interesting stuff.  This allows for many more effective deck designs than in the original.\n\nThere is online play, but despite Ludosity's top notch quality, their games don't have as many purchases as they should, and so few people play the online mode, this is really sad as I believe there is a lot of fun to be had facing other people.  Still, don't let this deter you.  The single player mode is complete, and tons of fun.  It is well worth the $10 USD on its own.

When CCN2 popped up as releasing on my news feed, grabbing it was a no brainer.\n\nCard City Nights 2 is a deck building/puzzle game based around activating cards by placing them in a chain. Each card has different arrows that can be connected and most cards have an effect such as damaging or healing. More gimmicky cards exist and there\u2019s enough variation on the cards to keep most of them interesting, though unfortunately a handful of cards do get power creeped out pretty easily. \n\nFans of the first game are probably thinking that this sounds a lot like the first game. This game is not like the first game. I am going to quickly point out a few key differences:\n\n*The entire game takes place on one board. You must now pay much closer attention to your enemy\u2019s cards, as blocking is a very real strategy and, in fact, is one that the AI will start to utilize against you once you hit mid-game. In addition, more cards have effects on the opposing player to reinforce this change.\n\n*Cards now have a countdown once activated, rather than activating immediately upon a completed chain. Activated cards in their countdown phase can trigger new cards matched with them. This pulls two new factors into play. First of all, you now have to have the foresight to have a card ticking down before you strictly need it, but not so soon that it triggers and does nothing. Second, this means that in many decks you will have to keep up a pace so that you constantly have cards activating other cards. This makes having a good flow of arrows in your deck a little bit more important than in the first game. This also makes a lot of the healing cards lackluster. In my experience there were two to three healing cards that will likely see much use, the others you will probably ditch.\n\n*There is much more variety in the way of gimmick cards, now. In the first game most of the gimmick cards were pretty basic. They get more complicated and niche here, there\u2019s a lot of options for decks. While I personally am not entirely sold on the validity of some possible gimmicks, they're cool enough to have fun with.\n\nOverall I found the actual cardplay of the original to be more my style, but all the same I am glad they tried out something new. It keeps things fresh and all in all it is still a very enjoyable core gameplay, even if it takes a little getting used to. I enjoyed the new gameplay, I just found myself preferring the old.\n\nThe games presentation is great, there are quite a few charming characters (though a lot are really similar to their ccn1 personas, who are in turn inspired by their counterparts in other Ludosity games. It\u2019s to be expected and doesn\u2019t get in the way at all. I don\u2019t have the greatest knowledge of Ludosity\u2019s catalogue but I\u2019d assume it is pretty cool to see the reimagined characters if you are a big fan of their games) a great soundtrack, and some really nice art. CCN1 had charming art, CCN2 takes that style and polishes the heck out of it while staying true to the series\u2019 aesthetics. The game looks and sounds awesome. The game also encourages you to actively look at the art, as clicking various background objects will sometimes reward you with card sleeves, money, and rare cards. Finally, my childhood humongous entertainment adventure days have paid off!\n\nThe game is a lot of fun and I enjoyed my time with it. There were some downsides, though.\n\nThe game balance is a little wonky. Like the first game, the computer player grows smarter and more adaptive as you progress through the game at a pretty smooth rate. Not all decks are created equal, however. Since every enemy has a unique deck set, Around mid-game you\u2019ll encounter extremely hard opponents followed by a chain of extremely easy ones. On one hand this does encourage you to build a new deck designed to be good against the deck you are having trouble with, which is awesome and is fair enough for near the end of the game. However when you encounter the first opponent that spikes difficulty, you probably won\u2019t have the cards needed to be that flexible. This results in an indefinite period of grinding (because what cards you get are random. You could pull what you need in 10 tokens, or, while unlikely, it could take you 200 tokens). It\u2019s not the biggest deal, but it does have potential to interrupt the game flow quite a lot and a more consistant curve would be preferable.\n\nThe hacking mechanic is cool, but since it requires coins AND a copy of the card you\u2019re hacking AND you are not able to tell what the cards hacked effects will be until you have performed at least one hack on that card type, It is not very efficient to use until the end-game. I feel like the coin cost at the least could be done without. It\u2019s not much, but if it were to be even a little more assessable earlier on in the game I would have had more time to explore the gimmicks and hacked cards before at the end-game.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my time with CCN2 and will probably attempt a challenge run (You unlock characters that, when picked, enforce additional rules on your playthrough). If you were a fan of the first game, then definitely pick it up. If you are new to the series, then I would recommend you start with the first game instead unless you anticipate playing a lot of multiplayer.", "timestamp_updated": 1505180793, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505180671, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34772762", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501891", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505015582, "steamid": "76561198369062683", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very good game, first one is still better.", "timestamp_updated": 1504692742, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504692742, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 26, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 7, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 29}}
