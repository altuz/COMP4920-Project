It was a fun zombie beat em up, and a so / so story that kept the game moving at a decent pace.  Some radiant quests to grind and get items from, but mostly get repetative and annoying.  If you play on Steam, use a controller to make your life easier.  \n\nThe base building aspect was more of a UI menu selecting upgrades, and X amount of supplies on hand and Y time later, the upgrades were visible in your fort.  It was mostly a moot point, as you move from base to base with the progression of the story faster than waiting around to build up that fort.  Anyways, I played through the game, which says something, considering most games like this get boring after 10 minutes.  There is about 20 hours of game play.  You can probably finish in a couple if you power through it.  Story and character interaction was alright, but not immersive.  The game is more about beating up those zombies and powering through the short story.  There were a few memorable missions, like the zombie siege at the farm house.  Total experience back in the day?  7/10.\n\nSo why no recommendation?  Well, the devs promised us localized co-op, and we never got it.  The game would have been amazing if I could play co-op with friends.  \n\nThis title is also the original standard edition.  After support ended, and computers got new hardware and operating systems, the game didn't run well anymore, if at all.  To add insult to injury, the developer re-released this game and the DLC as a \"special edition\".  The bugs were fixed, the textures were up-ressed, all of the penises that were embedded in the original textures by the disgruntled contract artist the developer screwed over were erased, and a $29.99 price tag was slapped on it showing just how much the developer cares about its customers.  Those that bought the game on steam, myself included, were not happy that they had to buy the game on steam a second time in order to have a working game, that is no different than the one previously bought, just up-ressed no penis textures and bug fixes...\n\nNow State of Decay 2 is coming out on XBOX, and I hope this review finds more readers and suades them not to trust in a bad company.  The business tactics and treatment of contractors this developer used should be shunned from the industry, not buy the man a Porsche for screwing over all of his friends.", "timestamp_updated": 1504673614, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504673614, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34822272", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505464", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504901548, "steamid": "76561197985084382", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Got the game Years ago and it wasn't good.

They literally said they were working on it during development and even months after they released it. They basically missed the deadline and put the entire idea of multiplayer into a new game (state of decay 2), which actually makes this game a giant test BETA for their engine.\n\nI played a lot of this game, I got about 70% through the main story and a few levels in breakdown. (also will be reviewing breakdown on the DLC store page) \n\nThe voice acting is abysmal, most characters share the same voice actor and his/her 5 lines.\nThe shadows and graphics leave much to be desired but still manage to horde RAM.\nThe whole game feels clunky\nThe cars do not drive, they slide.\nThe NPCS run straight to their deaths.\nThere is no story.\n\nBut again the main problem is undead labs lied to everyone because they highlighted the entire game to be multiplayer and even had multiplayer advertised on the steam store for a time! I can't believe they got away with it!\n\nNow you can go and buy the Year one Survival edition which is them attempting to fix a lot of problems, but  to be honest I feel cheated that I didn't receive it for free since I supposedly bought a finished product. \n", "timestamp_updated": 1507019960, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507019960, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34749294", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485577", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1442152374, "steamid": "76561198016470578", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Really....i already bought the game a**holes", "timestamp_updated": 1504583925, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504583925, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35085988", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1439784348, "steamid": "76561197972370472", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I played this when it came out years ago (before the YOSE release). Not surprised by all the hate and bad reviews because many people are infuriated with having to \"rebuy\" the game, or pay for a \"patch\". It doesn't bother me much, however, because even though I didn't buy the new copy, I realize that the YOSE is a bit more than a patch. It's a remastered version with the DLC included and released two years after the original. It's also, what,  $30, half the price of your typical full priced game which I feel the quality of this game deserves.\n\nSure this version had some bugs, many games do, but it didn't really interfere with the gameplay. At least not that I remember. What I do remember is I really enjoyed this game during the time I played it. Like wanting to play it when I first wake up and wanting to call into work type of enjoyment, which is sort of rare for me. So how could I not give this a thumbs up, regardless of the arguably shady and money grab direction the developers or publisher has made? I don't know all the details on why that was their decision so I'm not getting into it. I imagine maybe they'd like to get paid for the work they put into remastering the game for DX11, who knows.\n\nOverall, thumbs up.
