It is an arcade racer, but a very good one at that. You can expect taking corners at 200 km/h. Drifting with lambo's and jumping for hundreds of meters. Each car handles slightly different depending on it's type, not much though so if you are looking for a sim kind of racer, this will probably not appeal to you. However if you love cool cars and go insanely fast on the regular roads this is your game.\n\n-You start with the story. The story is good, not too short, not too long. You can skip it but that would be stupid. During the story you get a feel of all the different types of cars and you unlock people for your HQ later. Each person will give you a selection of \"abilities\" that you can upgrade. This goes from a discount in the shops to gaining more xp to car upgrades like a visual race line and faster top speed, accelleration etc. Needless to say, you really want this. So you start with the story which is often very challenging and it gives you a good view of what the game has to offer.\n\n- Cars: There are around 100 different cars & bikes. Expect most of the cool cars you know to be there. But.... that's only the standard versions you can buy. For each standard car, you can install upgrades and modify it to a different type. The types are Standard-street-terrain-sport-raid-circuit. \u00a8This gives you an idea of the race types you can expect. On top of those you can also unlock extreme upgrades and make your car a drifter-dragster-monstertruck. Each \"class\" is very different and not all classes are available for every standard car. However, let's take one of my favorites, the Mustang, you buy 1 standard mustang, and you can then multiply your vehicle to a drift mustang, monster truck mustang, street race mustang at the same time. So now you bought 1 car, but you have 4 different ones, which you can (and must) upgrade each one seperately. \n\n-Bikes: yes, there are motorbikes too, and everything that applies for the cars, applies for the bikes. same classes, same upgrades. it's often easyier to do certain missions with a bike instead of a car, so make sure you have some.\n\n-Police vehicles. Since the last update of the game there is another game mode introduced. It's basically racers vs cops. Think of Need for Speed (Most wanted, rivals, hot pursuit...), but much much better. While you are just cruising the streets, depending on your car (cop or regular) you will be invited to a pursuit. If you accept, you either help another racer or you try to bust another racer. You do need to buy and level your police cars first though. at least if you ever want to have a chance of busting other players.\n\n-Online: This game is online only. You can play perfectly well solo though. The only thing where you actually need to play with others is PvP. the rest is simply random encounters with no impact unless you want it. You get to choose how you play this game, but honestly it's the most fun with some friends online. Either way, the entire game is online so make sure you have a stable internet connection. \n\n-Tuning: The most addictive part of this game is ofcourse to upgrade your favorite cars and tune them. Now, let me dissapoint you first if you expect Need For Speed underground content. It's not like that. This is RNG. Is it a grind? Yes it can be, but you get to choose how and where you grind. Which means it doesn't have to be lengthy and boring. For each race (and that is a wide word in this game, but we'll get to that later) you do, you get 3 rewards: credits, xp and a car part. Each car has 11 parts, and each part has a level. Like gear in other MMO's. However on top of that, each part has a random affix. One of four: accelleration, top speed, grip and brakes. So basically you are looking for the top level parts, with your desired affixes. For example, a dragster has no use for the brake affixes. But, according to your playstyle it's possible you desire an overwhelming fast car to have more grip for example, so you look for those parts. The cool thing about this game is no inventory, you can keep ALL parts you ever collected, and should you one day want to change loadout of your car, you can. The downside though is RNG, it may take you a while to get all the perfect parts. On the other hand, remember it's arcade, you'll win without the \"perfect\" set too ;)\n\n-Visuals: This game is graphically still top tier. The cars are stunning, and the open world just the same. You can modify the look of your car very well. You need to earn the visuals first though, or you can buy them with credits or real money.To be honest I have the coolest looking cars from all the racing games I ever played. Needless to say, I'm impressed here. Again, it's not Need for Speed grand, compared to those games the options are rather limited, but I feel there is plenty to change your looks. If we move towards the graphics of the world, this game is unmatched. We're talking a huge open world with weather cycles and day and night cycles which affect the traffic on the roads. Rain, snow, mud, you name it.\n\n[h1] Content [/h1]\n\n\nOnce you finish the story, or during the story you are confronted with all the content this game has. And there is lots of content.\n\n-The Summit. Once a month there is the summit, but before you can enter there are weekly mini summits in which you must compete. In order to enter those you need to have a rank 3 in stunt races. This is easy, you get a quest to complete (like make a wheelie of 150m or drive 1km on the wrong side of the road) and only then you can enter the mini summits. A summit is a collection of challenges, where you get good rewards. All prestations are stored and measured against other players. So you are playing against other players prestations, but solo. Your rewards depend on how well you do. This is probably the fastest way to earn upgrades for your car, and you can basically do this 24/24, 7-7. You compete in events like monster trucks, drag race, drift race, time trials, jump challenge etc. As you can see, it is very wise to have a own car for each class/event. So you really want a monster truck, a drifter, a dragster, a street car, a circuit racer etc. If you do not have one of the classes needed in the summit, one will be provided to you, but it will be a barebone piece of crap. If however you own one of the desired classes, the rewards will go straight to your car. Some summits have additional requirements, like a US muscle car, or japanese car etc. This encourages you to buy and upgrade new cars ;)\n\n-PvP: pvp is pretty well done, unless you expect to choose standard races. Pvp in The Crew is very diverse. Each contestant chooses race type (like capture the flag, crown, regular race etc), then after that type of car and it all ends up in the RNG machine. One racetype/racecar will be chosen by RNG, and after each round it is the same. It's a very fair system imo, and it again stresses the importance of having at least one car of each type that is maxed in any aspect. If you have that covered, PvP is very fun here.\n\n-Faction races. You get to choose your faction, and race for them. These are actual races with a specific car class requirement. Ideal if you love a specific race style like all terrain or circuit. \n\n-Challenges: All around the world there are challenges you can pick up. You can pick them up during other missions too, or when you are travelling from one place to another to maximize rewards for minimum effort. You do that in a multitude of styles: slalom, speed, collect (the hardest imo), jump, follow the raceline, precision. Depending on how well you did, you'll get a piece of gear for your car. This is the go to when your car is too low level for anything else. It only takes like a minute or two to complete and you can rince and repeat.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506683908, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506683908, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34826635", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506935", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507128317, "steamid": "76561198140237271", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 343}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The Crew is a fine game, and thats it, it's an above average game.\nThe car list is fine, the handling is fine, missions are fine and the ubisoft servers are suprisingly stable.\n\nThe biggest shinning point is that the map is huge, and thats not an understatement.\nYou can spend good ol' 30 minutes just traveling from NY to LA.\nAs i mentioned above, the car list is fine to say the least, there are only around 80 cars and with grinding being easy and getting free cars from the Delivery crates missions, you'll find yourself owning most of the cars in weeks.\n\"Then customization must be good?\" you may ask yourself and yet again its only fine.\nYou can defenitly make aesthetic looking cars when they are in the perf, street and dirt specs.\nbut then when you get the raid and circit specs the customization suddenly dips, which is a huge shame.\n\nBut here is the worst part, The Crew is online only meaning that Ubisoft can pull the switch any moment they want.\nAnd now that the sequel is coming too...\n\nBefore i end this review i want to talk about 2 things.\nThe AI and how unstable the game gets at times.\n\nFirst the racing AI,\nIts just bad and very amusing to watch.\nFor some reason when the AI is moving really fast it loses control over the car leading them to over take you and then immediately crash into the closes railguard.\nBut beyond that if your car's level is higher than what the mission suggests. Its gonna be like a walk in the park.\nBut the traffic AI has to be the biggest pain in the ass. It does nothing but get in the way of the fast paced racing, ESPECIALLY when the server takes a dump and just shits all over the road with traffic cars.\n\nThis game is really unstable sometimes, and thing is.\nMy pc meets and even exceeds the recommeded specs.\nAnd still the game manages to shit itself when it comes to fps, randomly crashing for no reason.\nSometimes even bugging itself out when completing a race by not showing the results menu and bricking my hole system.\n\nBut all in all, its a fine game. Defenitly an enjoyable experince.\nId rate it 5/10\nbut seeing how the sequel is coming along.
