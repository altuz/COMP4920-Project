Beware, difficulty is up there! What made me sad is combat/dialog ratio - you will fight all the times, with enemies respawning in limited numbers upon leaving area. What is really different is mana/stanima/health/durability management - only stamina replenishes continuously(sloooowly), you must use potions or skills (costing mana/stamina :) ) Be prepared to do a lot of walking for restock at town. \n\nIs it worth a buy? If you are a oldschool RPG fan, you love challenging and intriguing game, you will definitelly forgive few kinks. It was refreshing to play, kept me interested in main story, but also side quests. \n\nMusic is superb and underlines the whole dark atmosphere. Upon entering church in the first city I literally stopped and listened with goosebumps all around.\n\nIf you decide to try this, be patient, game will be brutal at first, but you will grow to be a pretty badass protagonist.\n\nHave fun!", "timestamp_updated": 1505849017, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505849017, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 125, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 62, "total_reviews": 187}}
