It sounded the same as having him send me a WAV directly through skype or email (which usually takes him FOREVER to upload). I'm currently taking a class on recording consoles and we do a ton of mixing on an Audient ASP8024. (FYI I am attending Full Sail University for Show Production)\n\nLastly this program IS great for beginners and I would have to say that if your really looking to go into the Recording field this is a great first step toward an actual DAW.

You need to divide this review into 2 segments.  The DAW itself, and the Multiplayer aspect of it.  \n\n2.  The DAW itself I would not recommend.  I know of other DAWs that are better.  However, I've been able to find that when I use Logic Pro X, I can export easily from there and import onto this DAW.  So like 50/50 there.\n\n3. It only allows VSTs and I think 32 bit only.  I will say though you will find that a lot of your plugins might offer support for that and be able to be integrated within it.  For example, all my UAD plugins, T-racks and Amplitube 3 work just fine.\n\n4.  What I like about it is the online community.  It's a free DAW, and 99 dollars at the most?  That's not bad for a multiplayer DAW especially if you have a real good back up DAW for making your things and exporting Tracks to that for other people to have a chance to criticize, or add on to, mix or master.   For me, it's worth it.  Now I've only had this for a few days, but if I continue to like it, I'll be dropping 99 bucks on the thing.\n\n\nSome issues.\n\nIt's all cloud, so they want to try to trap you with a subscription plan.  I understand why, technically speaking most cloud services charge period.  However, I would suggest you keep most of your projects saved on your desktop and not open so you don't hit that limit.    Also finish your projects and export them out to a different DAW as well... or just save on your computer in the mean time if you have the free version and you can't switch the file type until you pay.  \n\nThe community is relatively small, but I hope it either A. grows, or B. Some other company buys out Ohm Studio and creates this online community as well.  It's something that's really special and worth looking at.\n\nFinal Vote:\n\nI wouldn't recommend it as my main DAW, but rather a Online Collaboration type application.  If you have 2 DAWs and the ability to make music on one and export it to this, you are golden. If you can get the hang of your plugins and have them work well with this DAW, you might actually end up being fine for doing even more than that. \n\nKeep in mind this is about 3 days into having this DAW and I already spent nearly a work day on it.", "timestamp_updated": 1431898711, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431898711, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "29474603", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1491791820, "steamid": "76561198189479523", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Ohm Studio is great!!\nand I have a little advice on when installing plugins so you don't get confused:\nWhen installing plugins go to this following directory (to place .dll files)\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\OhmStudio\\VST\n\nThis took too long to figure out xD\n(Ohm is great!)", "timestamp_updated": 1485311618, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485311618, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 9}}
