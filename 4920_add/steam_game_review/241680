It's main features for me are tray mirroring and mouse locking. Unfortunately, the tool is still in production, many is to be changed, and there are some errors/crashes if you treat that tool without care. \nActual multiple monitors has main features you can live without or replicate with freeware. But they're combined in one big app. There are really few things that could be dome better. UI is a mess, it's really hard to find what you're looking for. Some options are not obvious. The nice thing about it, is that you have a nice way of testing it for free for 30 days at their official website *BEFORE BYING*. Try it, and then try other tools, and keep in mind that sometimes freeware programms that are meant to provide single functions like \"always on top\" and \"lock mouse on monitor\" are better than all in one. But if you want to get all at once - grab this one, or go for \"window manager\" app, but I repeat, THIS might cause your system to run slower.\n\nBUT the worst thing about this software - it makes your computer games LAG LIKE HELL when you move your mouse.", "timestamp_updated": 1419003330, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "11", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1418963086, "votes_down": 28}, {"recommendationid": "18522901", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511545", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1451236939, "steamid": "76561198152061530", "num_games_owned": 759, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "[b]DISCLAIMER: RIGHT NOW (18/10/15) THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH WIN 10\n[/b] \nTHIS MAY HAVE BEEN FIXED WITH RECENT UPDATES, PLEASE CHECK FOR YOURSELF.[b]\n\nNOTE: The other highly rated review is over a year old meaning that some of the negatives of this software have been fixed.

It combines a lot of useful features such as allowing you to do stuff on your second monitor when you\u2019re in a game in your first monitor without it minimizing and having hotkeys which allow you to arrange your windows.\n\nThe UI isn't all that great but it has some features which it's competitor Display Fusion doesn\u2019t have such as the option to have new windows open in the display which your cursor is in (which I really miss)\n \nIt\u2019s a really good application and if you have 2 or more monitors you should give it a try.\nIt also works with start button mods for Win 8, such as Start8.\n\nI no longer use AMM as it doesn\u2019t work with WIN 10 but if it did then I wouldn't have switched to Display Fusion.\n\nFeel free to message me on Steam if you have any questions about this program\n\nIf you are looking for a multiple monitor program for Windows 10 then I recommend Display Fusion, you can find it on Steam.", "timestamp_updated": 1451237701, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445079080, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2}}
