There's hardly any loot in this game, so the title is a little misleading.  What are we collecting exactly?  I feel like the currencies in the game are very temporary and fleeting.  Loot amounts to health vials and speed boosts.\n\nThe couch coop is currently broken in a few ways.  First, only player one can interact with the main menu and some other menu elements.  Second, even though I was controller #1, it assigned me to player #2, and my player assignment was switched after the first level, effectively confusing us for a grand total of 20 seconds, so my friend and I were clever and swapped controllers until we beat the current level.  The upgrades were lackluster because nothing is actually worked toward.  The only redeeming aspect of the game is it's easy to get into.  You'll effectively figure the entire game out in less than 5 minutes.  There are some aspects of the game's battle system which will take some experimentation, like character abilities and boss battle mechanics, but as long as you can back away from enemies after hitting them 1-2 times, you'll mostly be fine.  There are difficulty modes, mind you, and I only tried easy and normal modes before deciding I was bored of the game's character upgrade/customization system.", "timestamp_updated": 1497652608, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497652279, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "32544573", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506230716, "steamid": "76561197970739339", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 338, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 96}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "IMPORTANT: This game requires a reasonably good and consistent connection to play online coop. It caused a friend of mine serious desyncronization issues.\n\nSo an ex-gang member, a raver, an ex-security officer and a engineer walk into a dark alley...\n\nKill to Collect is a top-down hack-n-slash roguelike with a bright neon-cyberpunk aesthetic similar to Neon Chrome, and surprisingly fair difficulty for the genre. You can tell when a rogue game wants you dead and KtC is not one of those, at least from what I've seen thus far. The player takes the role of one of four deadly hunters, the only law in the scummy and villainous lower levels of Geocenter Alpha, the last city on Earth. Each has a different weapon, secondary power attack, ultimate, and movement ability. Combat is largely melee-based, and since you are always outnumbered, conservation of health, the number one concern in these sorts of games, is a question of learning how to time your attacks and dodges with the predictable attack patterns of the enemies. Each character's secondary attack inflicts some form of crowd control, which you will need to use often. Ultimate attacks must be charged first by dealing damage and are best used against a crowd of enemies, as in most games.\n\nKate Katana uses a sword, and can knock down enemies in a small cone or all around her using her ultimate, or by using her dodge roll. Ivan Ironfist has large cybernetic fists that can inflict rapid, but less damaging attacks then the other charcters- only half a pip per punch. He can knock back enemeis and cause a vulnerability effect that makes them take more damage from subsequent punches. He has lower health but can instantly teleport around, including behind enemies. His ultimate damages everything near him constantly for the duration. Riot Ray uses a shotgun, which technically gives him the most reach of any character- but its so short ranged that it's essentially a melee weapon anyway. However, it deals more damage based on Ray's distance to an enemy, and at point blank does four pips of damage, enough to one-shot some enemies. His secondary attack knocks enemies back and a shield over his back can protect him from back attacks. His ultimate sees him charge around, knocking down and heavily damaging enemies. His dodge is a simple hop with no other effects. Lastly, Shocking Shelly uses an electrified staff with good reach, her secondary attack stuns enemies and she can drop turrets that fire stunning shots.\n\nShelly can use her ultimate much more often then the other characters, and its possible to have multiple turrets active at once. Combined with her reach and stuns, I feel like she is the most effective solo character as a result. The least so is probably Ivan, who has very short reach and limited health, and doesn't have any attacks that disable enemies completely. Kate also has some problems against robotic enemies, as they are unaffected by her knockdowns.\n\nRegardless, each character can even the odds by using a secondary weapon and consumable items. The sub-weapons have very limited ammo but offer much needed ranged attacks, and include a handgun, various types of grenades, flamethrowers, rocket launchers, a hookshot that pulls enemies towards you, and a \"chain-cutter\", a weapon that creates an energy tether between you and the target point, which constantly damages enemies it touches. Items include medkits, proximity mines, temporarily increased movement speed or damage, temporarily infinite dodging, damage reflection, and the rare \"ultimate power\" item that gives you infinite uses of your ultimate ability for its duration, a good way of quickly ending a boss fight. \n\nGameplay is split up into individual missions, or \"Bounties\", consisting of three or more floors, with the final floor consisting entirely of a boss fight. These bosses can use similar attacks and sub-weapons to the player, and often have additional perks, such as a teleporting around the arena. Completing a bounty rewards you with credits, which act as experience towards unlocks. These unlocks include new starting loadouts, character skins, gold weapons and titles.\n\nThe game recently added two-player local coop, a much-requested addition, and of course it has four-player online coop.
