It often reminds me of massive's sounds in that you can easily get a synthetic growl out of a bass, but at the same time it might be a bit harder to come out with \"softer\" sounds (not that it can't do it, simply I wouldn't say it is this synth strongest point).\n\nBeen using this for years now in ableton and along with massive it still remains a staple synth in my setup.\n\nps: seriously if this is under 50\u20ac jsut get it, I'd rate it practically on par with Native Instrument's Massive VST which costs 150\u20ac. this is so worth it.", "timestamp_updated": 1498305164, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498304948, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 25, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 28}}
