Ultimately, the puzzle-solving in the Deponia games just isn't good enough for me to recommend them over the many much better point and click games out there. Although Deponia's story is ok, it's not like the story is enough to redeem the game. If anything, Deponia's story is just a justification for the puzzles.\n\nPros:\n+ Decent story\n+ Storyline is fleshed out and resolved much better than previous games\n+ Same characters and sense of humor as the other games, assuming you liked them\n\nCons:\n- Same convoluted puzzle-solving as the first two games. You go through a chain of 10 puzzles that are barely related to the game or story at all, and then finally find out that the larger puzzle you were solving was pointless anyway and didn't achieve what you were trying to do. Such an exercise in futility. Also some of the solutions simply don't make sense.\n- The convoluted puzzles result in poor pacing of the story. It stagnates for long periods of time while you work on asisine puzzles before finally lurching ahead with a cut scene.\n- Poor mini-game puzzles, which are just confusing rather than challenging\n- Very disappointing ending to the story. I won't spoil anything, but don't get your hopes up.\n- I have to mention a shockingly offensive moment in the game in which Rufus ends up [spoiler]selling the only black character in the whole series into slavery where she has to pretend to be a monkey for coins[/spoiler]. How does something like this end up in a finished game without anyone realizing or caring how inappropriate that is?", "timestamp_updated": 1503089399, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503089265, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 270, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 64, "total_reviews": 334}}
