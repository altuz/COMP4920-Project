It treats the setting in an excellent fashion and explores one of its more mysterious sites, Mordor.[/b]\n\nAs an avid fan of Tolkien's work, I was worried that [i]Shadow of Mordor[/i], with its flashy screenshots, would introduce flashy magic or similar stuff too much apart from the lore.\n\nI was happy to find that concern nil: while they have certainly taken many artistic liberties and little inaccuracies abound, the overall lore is adeptly executed.\n\nHere I will cover both the main game and briefly its expansions.\n\n[h1]Story of life and death - but mostly death[/h1]\n\nYou play as Talion, a ranger and a great warrior. He and his family get murdered by orcs, but a vengeful wraith brings him back, effectively rendering him immortal. Together they start a reign of terror in Mordor to murder all the orcs.\n\nYou have several objectives:\n[list]\n[*]Find the one responsible for your family's death and have revenge.\n[*]Wraith remembers nothing. Find out about his past.\n[*]Help the human slaves in any way you can.\n[*]Kill lots and lots of orcs.\n[/list]\n[h1]Open world in Mordor[/h1]\n\nConveniently, the curse of the wraith keeps you from leaving Mordor giving an in-universe reason for the boundary. Otherwise, a large region of Mordor is up for exploration. Everything is accessible from the beginning, though you get more skills and upgrade weapons along the way.\n\nWraith grants you The Sight, that's basically an X-ray vision with Terminator-grade recognition powers to identify mission objects and special enemies from afar, hidden stashes from up close.\n\nMissions, while usually occurring within the same open-world region, are found around the map launching a separate mission phase, whereupon you must focus on the mission lest it get cancelled or utterly failed (with endless re-dos) by useless wandering or loitering.\n\nMissions are reasonably varied, though aside from the few rescue missions, they very often involve massacring or assassinating countless orcs. It's cool that many quests can be completed either through direct combat or by more tactical stealth strikes.\n\n[h1]Gameplay: So many keys I don't even[/h1]\n\nI played exclusively with keyboard+mouse combo but gamepad should work alright.\n\nMoving Talion works well and expectedly: mouse moves camera, WASD moves Talion. Aside from running, you can stalk, climb almost any surface and use ropelines to swing long distances.\n\nCombat is of the safe formula: attacks, combos and parries work with a couple of buttons. However, the controls soon get much more complex: there's a separate key for each special combat ability to a total of some ten different keys. That's huge for a mere action-adventure.\n\nGranted, not all of them are needed all the time but it makes it hard to return to the game after a long break.\n\n[h1]Go Pickle Rick on the trolls[/h1]\n\nCompleting quests and generally wreaking havoc awards exp that yields various skills and upgrades to make your un-life easier. These range from e.g. pinning orcs with arrows to tele-strikes to insta-kills (many involving those extra buttons), among others.\n\nIt's particularly fun to get to tame and ride the crazy monster animals of Mordor, like warg-like caragors and troll-like graugs. Especially graugs are super-fun as they both barf and munch on the silly Uruks.\n\n[h1]Corrupt chiefs and the magic wololoo[/h1]\n\nAll regular enemies are orcs of different kinds: warriors, archers, berserkers etc. and have their special skills. Any of them can be promoted to captains, receiving a name, quotes and special abilities (and/or weaknesses).\n\nBecause of special abilities, captains are usually harder to kill than normal orcs: you might even need to beat a short QTE to finish them.\n\nCaptains hang around doing orc-things: organizing hunting parties, hosting drinking feasts, trying to assassinate each other, you know, the normal stuff that bigwigs-in-chief do. The thing is, you can infiltrate any of these and ruin their day. The reward for captain skin is a shiny rune to upgrade your weapons, the worse the enemy the better the rune.\n\nIf they still manage to slay you, they become your Nemesis, which is infuriating so of course you try to kill them again. A kind of multiplayer feature, you may encounter the Nemesis of your friends and avenge them too.\n\nAs a late-game feature, it's possible or even necessary to build an army of your own by converting the orcs and their dear leaders to your cause by mind tricks.\n\n[h1]DLC, i.e. a new region and play as wraith mode[/h1]\n\nI completed the main game to 100% in 28 hours. But it got two big expansions, both of which introduced their own maps with new game mechanics.\n\n[i]Lord of the Hunt[/i] brings a new biome to bring some color to the greyscale of Mordor. It introduces new creatures (similar to previous caragors and graugs), along with a new friendly face involving a story to hunt those creatures.\n\n[i]Bright Lord[/i] has you play the wraith. He works a bit differently to Talion and has some awesome special powers but the story felt more lackluster, probably because it has so little to do with Tolkien's original lore.\n\nThe rest of the DLCs are mainly cosmetic. The Test challenges introduce leaderboards with specific challenges that really test your skills with the game mechanics. You have to play at least a couple of them for all achievements.\n\n[h1]An excellent game[/h1]\n\nVery stable and awesome graphics. Not even the few QTEs in combat bring too much shame to it. I had fully completed it achievement-wise after 54 hours, so I dare claim it has plenty of content too.\n\nCombined with lots of (in Tolkien-terms) fitting lore, I think [i]Shadow of Mordor[/i] is a must-play action-adventure for any avid gamer.", "timestamp_updated": 1504789921, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504747265, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35276945", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511618", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504974900, "steamid": "76561198160796640", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Loved this game after I got it on sale a couple of years ago (I got it for $20, it was priced at $40 at the time), and even though it's been dropped to $20 because of the soon to be released Shadow of War, I'm not mad at all... in fact, I'm very thankful that they lowered the price.

It is a fast paced flow system that involves quick hack and slash with counters and extra moves to respond to the enemies and thier unique units and abilities.  There have been some slight changes from Arkham in that the fighting is slower and has more weight.  The overall difficulty is much higher as well.  Both to scale and given the fact that the number of enemies can easily swell and leave you at an insane disadvantage.\n\nThe overall quality is much lower however.  Arkham had color coded enemies with obvious designs.  Large, ranged, etc enemies were easy to identify and react to.  The Shadow of Mordor Urakai look exactly the same.  Having played somethign better, it's more than little frustrating to be smacked down by one unit hiding in a group of one hundred that I could have easily dealt with if I had realized he was there.\n\nOutside of combat, the world map is very small.   You can explore everything within the first hour of play if you are intent on just looking around and don't get caught up in missions.\n\nMissions are. . . pretty much combat.  They try and flavor them with different objectives, challenges using a bow, stealth.  But they all come back to combat.  Stealth is a missed oppurtunity.  Half the map is open fields, and even in the sections wtih cover, the player isn't given any tools to utilize stealth like in normal stealth gameplay. It's mostly just waiting for patrols to clear out so you can sneak behind and knife someone.  \n\nThe player character has the ability to level up.  This section is fleshed out.  The level up system has meaningful upgrades that can add flavor to the different core abilities.  There is also a second skill tree that allows bulk upgrade to stats such as health.  \n\nA big problem I ran into, however, is that most of the abilities are locked behind a secondary experience system called power.  Power is recieved by killing bosses that roam the map.  We'll get into them in a second, but the ammount of power you need to advance tiers and unlock abilties was absurd.  I had to straight farm bosses for no other reason than to be allowed to use the level ups I earned.  \n\nFinally the boss system that the game calls Nemesis.  This is a fantastic inovation and the real saving grace to the game.  A score of perhaps 20 enemies with unique personalities, traits, and abilities roam the map.  They will fight eachother, become stronger and level up themselves.  They will try and live, running away when in danger, and they remember when they lose to you.  This is the one area the game truely shines.  \n\nAt the end of the day, being a Lord of the Rings fan is probably not that important.  There isn't a lot of lore, sights to see, or characters to recognize.  The narrative and world are bare bones.  At least this means that people coming into the series won't be lost.\n\nI would recommend playing one of the Batman Arkham games over this.  That game has slightly better combat with a much richer, diverse world that you can play with.
