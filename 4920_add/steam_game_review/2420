That's a shame, because it looked fantastic in the previews. The gameplay itself was pretty different to what I'd imagined it to be, and you should know if you're going to buy it that there's a resource management aspect to the game (like The Sims series) regarding your character's needs (thirst, hunger, fatigue etc.). Besides that, it's essentially a stealth game that will require you to think quickly on your feet after assassinating someone. ***"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503090788, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34336807", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198009263731", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1503458713, "num_games_owned": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 257}, "timestamp_updated": 1503090788, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The single player is a stand alone game which is based on the original multiplayer retired game \"The Ship: Murder Party\".\nIt has all the elements of the original game except that instead of taking part in the Murder Party (hunting and being hunted) you're making your way through to escape the ship by completing tasks which are part of a pre-defined story line. The story line is not long, I finished it in 3 hours first time, and in 1 hour the second time. The gameplay is lovely though! I highly recommend you playing this single player version. For me it's something between Postal 2 and GTA: Vice City but with it's own unique charm. Postal because you can do crazy things here, some are pretty violent, also you get to do routine stuff like eating, drinking, going to the bathroom etc. GTA because well, you have certain tasks to complete in order to progress towards your character's goals, like get a poison and inject it in someone, guard an ambassador, get in prison and kill someone, etc. In short, the gameplay is very unique, it grabbed me from the beginning and I even finished the storyline twice so that's how charming this game is. A must play in my opinion."}]}
