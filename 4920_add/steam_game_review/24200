So, one would expect that with DCUO being one of only two MMOs set in the superhero genre, it wouldn't be difficult all that difficult to make an amazing game. Indeed, this game has some of the best ideas I have ever experienced in an MMO... yet manages to bork the implementation of every single one of them.\n\nFirst, lets talk about character creation. At first glance, it looks pretty decent. There are a fair selection of quality starter items, and lots more can be unlocked by playing the game. Unfortunately, those unlockable costume pieces are unlocked *per character*, which means you can never actually start with the character look you *want* to have. In some cases, unlocking the pieces you need to complete your character's look can take *weeks* of grinding for *hours every day*.\n\nThis purposeless, artificially-limited aspect of the game has all but destroyed DCUO's role-playing community. And if you know anything about the tight bonds that role-players bring to a game, then you'll recognize the assinine idiocy behind the way this game's character creation continues to be handled.\n\nOn a somewhat less-intolerable note, the colour pallet is limited to storing four colours. They can be any colours you want, but once you pick them, all of your costume pieces are limited to those four colors.\n\nThe power and weapon sets in this game are probably it's biggest boon during power creation. They really are fantastic, even if some of them are locked away behind paywalls.\n\nThe missions are fun and not too tedious, even when replayed. And there's lots of raids, PvP, and open-world events, too.\n\nDCUO is often compared to Champions Online, the only other active MMO in the genre. This game has better gameplay, a better setting, better combat, better enemies, better raids, and better overall content. Yet, DCUO universally considered a vastly inferior product based almost solely on gamers' (in)ability to create the character appearance they want from the start.\n\nUltimately, if you're looking for a game to create the superhero of your dreams, go for Champions Online. If you're looking for a game with an active community, go for Champions Online. If you're looking for a game to role-play a superhero of your own creation, go for Champions Online (or Paragon Chat). If you're looking for a game to play with friends, go for Champions Online. But... if you're looking for a game that has great content to solo, and you don't care about how your character looks, or that lots of powers and weapons are stuck behind payways, and you only intend to play one or two characters, then... THEN... consider DCUO. But honestly, you'll probably have more fun in Champions Online--which is sad, because Champions Online really isn't that good of an MMO."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486150869, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469256", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "29676359", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198034813176", "num_reviews": 55, "last_played": 1486163930, "num_games_owned": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1598}, "timestamp_updated": 1486165511, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Not really sure what to say about this.

Anything over that goes in to your Escrow and 1500 can buy you next to nothing and anything it can buy you you'll likely have out-leveled in about ten minutes. This also means you can't really buy much from the Auction House either.\n\nNow \"Escrow Accounts\" are nothing new in F2P MMO's but at least in other games you are allowed a sufficient and substantial ammount of in game currency so that you don't feel like something as simple as purchasing items is locked behind a pay wall.\n\nYou'll constantly spend your time thinking \"Oh that looks really cool\" or \"That's a cool idea\" and then go to try these things out only to be greeted by a plague of a paywall.\n\nFun game held back by ridiculous pay wall. tries too hard to force you to spend money."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486250685, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515514", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "29705676", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130347210", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1491083985, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 12731}, "timestamp_updated": 1486250685, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This could be a great game, possibly in the top 5 MMO's of all time.
