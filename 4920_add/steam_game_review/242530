It actually took me some effort to find the game since I could not remember the name of it. It feels sooooooo great to be able to play the game again, bringing back so much good memories. OH BOY, SUCH NOSTALGIA!\n\nThrowback to the early '90s, when I was 5 or 6, I had a lot of fun playing this game in my mom\u2019s office. Those damn leaping frogs and running hands had really given me some heart attack lol. It\u2019s such a difficult game that I never made it to world 3, well maybe another story if I was allowed to play a little longer as a kid :)\n\nEven I see myself as a better gamer today, I still find this game to be difficult just like the original version. It gets somewhat frustrating after dying few times. It might just take me forever to finish the game without using cheats haha.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1500997019, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500997019, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 77, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 37, "total_reviews": 114}}
