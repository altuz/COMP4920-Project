I thought I might have had an account from Assasin's Creed 2, but I had a faint memory of it being Uplay being a finnicky piece of garbage back then and why I hadn't finished that game. I tried to go through the usual usernames and passwords, no dice. Tried password recovery, website had an error about parameters being unexpected. Tried to create a new Uplay account, server is apparently down. At 7:30 PM on a Tuesday. Why do we even still have DRM on a pretty much single player game? Glad I wasted my money on this.
