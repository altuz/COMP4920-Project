The story follows a foul-mouthed, drug-addicted goblin named Styx as he tries to get into the Heart of the World Tree.  Language content not appropriate for younger children, violence content is typical for games in the genre.\n\n[b]What's The Best Part?[/b]\nThe game is all about stealth.  You have multiple options for dealing with enemies (avoidance, distraction, clone ambush, etc.)  There are multiple paths through most areas, although sometimes the safer alternates (i.e. paths that stay away from all the guards) can be hard to spot.  I also enjoyed the strong \"vertical\" theme in level design.  Often avoiding guards means climbing up and over, which I found fun.\n\n[b]What's The Worst Part?[/b]\nCombat, no doubt.  The combat system is difficult to handle - I basically gave up and outright avoided combat for a long time, until my skill purchases made it more feasible.  Even when I could do it, I found it tiresome.  However, a good stealth game encourages the player to avoid combat (and detection of any sort) anyway, so I didn't mind this drawback too much myself.\n\nThe story is grating at times, but it comes together in the end.\n\n[b]Will I Like It?[/b]\nIf you like stealth games, you ought to at least try it.  Unfortunately there doesn't appear to be a free demo for Master of Shadows, as there is for the sequel (Shards of Darkness), however, as I write this, Master of Shadows is on sale for about $6.00.\n\n[b]Should I Buy It?[/b]\nI would say yes, if you're into stealth games.  If you're on the fence, wait for a sale.  This one is getting pretty cheap on sale now that the sequel is out.\n\nThis has been a 5TYSK review.

Most complaints are either: Jumping isn't great, AI is awful, hanging from ledges is hard because you have to walk off slowly, checkpoints are too few.\n\nHowever when I played I expereinced no issue with Styx. This is a pure stealth game, a really good one at that. Jumping isn't bad from what I've played, it is sort of like a platformer in which you have to know how far you can actually jump (which is pretty god damn far). I'm using a controller and it feels really good jumping around on support beams for the roof.\n\nAI is pretty normal. You should know however it is not like most stealth games. If you crouch in darkness a few feet from an NPC, they will spot you. You absolutely have to stay out of their sight even in darkness unless you are far away.\n\nAnd a huge complaint is that you have to slowly walk off to hang from a ledge which is hard when you are about to be spotted. No, it really isn't, just walk slowly off while being spotted. Not really difficult.\n\nFinally the checkpoint/save problem. You HAVE to quicksave. Checkpoints are far apart so you definitely have to quicksave a lot. Not a problem if you have it mapped to a key.\n\nI'm so glad I gave Styx a try, it is now one of my favorite stealth games.

By the end of it all, there are more cons that outweigh the pros and it just makes it an overal unenjoyable experience. \n\nI'll start with level design. I find the leels to be similar to dishonored where you have a large area with multiple ways to approach a situation andcollectibles to find. But there's a lot that Styk misses out on. First off, the collectibles are very spread out and hard to find, having small coins that are hard to spot where there are 30-40 on each level. These levels are already really long so I imagine it being a huge pain to actually go out of your way to collect ALL the coins, although you do get more skill points for doing it (I think). The levels are also made in a way where it's best to avoid enemies often instead of taking them all on, as there can be about a hundred enemies per mission. The biggest problem with level design is that halfway through the game, they make you go back and do EVERY LEVEL BACKWARDS. I'm not joking; you have to go from the jail cells all the way back to where you did the first mission and it's HALF THE GAME. You go from A  to B, and then back to A. This makes the game way longer than it should be (took me 20 hours to beat the game, started to get tired after 15).\n\nThe story is ok. I can't really explain my issues about it without spoiling it so I'd say skip this paragraph if you haven't played and are reading reviews. For a long time I had no idea what the full objective of the game really was; just something to do with the heart of the tree because \"Styx\" couldn't remember much. I was actuallyreally interested at the plot twist halfway through when you find out your playing the clone and that the real Styx has been giving you orders the whole time. But then it started to get confusing because Styx and Rakesh (I'll just call the clone Rakesh since it's what Styx refers to him as) look and sound basically the same other than some scars on Styx's face. It took me the rest of the next mission to figure out if I was even playing as Rakesh or Styx, and even then there were some inconsistancies (such as when Ozkan frekas out when you return to the hideout, despite the fact that you've been working with him for 3 or 4 missions [Also they say multiple times that he's blind but he's suddenly able to see Rakesh]) The end was also anti-climactic. No boss fight, just kill a couple of clones and then it's done with a cutscene. Very uneventful conclusion between the scuffle of Rakesh and Styx.\n\nGameplay. As I stated in my first paragraph, I did enjoy the ability to have multiple ways to approach a situation. There were some glitches with hitboxes (especially the ogres and amber cockroaches, they need to be fixed badly). I like the ability to have a skilltree as well, but I feel that the entire 'kill' skilltree is unnecessary as it's all something you should already have as abilities when starting the game; being able to pull people down from ledges, attacking from above, attacking from around corners.\n\nBy FAR my biggest issue is with enemy types. As the game goes on, more and more enemies are introduced to the game. Enemies in a stealth game should provide a new challenge without becoming more difficult, so as to not make the game too challenging. This can make it so that certain options may not be feasible to get past a section due to a new obstacle. What does this game do wrong? HALF THE ENEMIES IN THE GAME CAN KILL YOU IN ONE HIT!!! I'm not even kidding. Enemies that can kill you in one hit are; Knights, Ogers, Elves, Crossbowmen with poison arrows, and amber cockroaches (they technically can since they're melee attack can chain you and you can't excape from it). Enemies that CAN'T kill you in one hit; Standard Guards, regular crossbowmen, clones, workers of any sort, doomed, and possesors. This makes it so that even if you're playing on the easiest difficulty that the game can be INSANELY hard. Especially by the last mission where they have almost only elves who can one hit you AND sense you without needing to see you.\n\nI find it hard to recommend this game to someone. If you get it on a good sale then it might be worht picking up. I payed ~$5 for it and I did have some fun, but it was stressful by the end. There seems to be a large lack of tesitng done to evaluate the game before release, especially in terms of bugs. It might be a reasonable to get this when it's on sale, but I can't give it a thumbs up when it's at full price.", "timestamp_updated": 1506578537, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506578537, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34903791", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497904", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505762673, "steamid": "76561198325906884", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "3 hours into the game and so far I must say it was absolutely worth it!
