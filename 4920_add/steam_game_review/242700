Few months passed (and btw I didn't even know that the game was out on PC) and I saw it for only 3.50$ and I was like Christmas came early with a huge smile on my face and it was nowhere near Christmas. Anyway I got the game played it and absolutely loved the story and found it to be quite fun for every skill group with multiple challenges and gamemodes and it also has a multiplayer system. It's 20th of September 2017 11:40 PM and in a sudden outburst of creativity I decided to play some multiplayer and learn some new combos instead of waiting for Injustice 2 to hopefully get a PC release.
