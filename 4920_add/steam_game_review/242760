If so then don't complain that it was too easy.\n\nThe developers have put across the objectives of the story in such a way that the character makes logical notes in their handbook, notes that everyday people would make, realistic. The game doesn't have bright flashing markers on where you should go, the map is great as it allows you to know where you haven't explored, but it doesn't tell you that you will find \"Useful Item\" here. \n\nI remember going all the way down the large pit, right down to a large door, only to realise I needed something to open the door, and such began my quest to find said item. But I remeber drowning to death, falling off rock faces and all experiences that told me I was mmissing something. \n\nAnyway, what I really wanted to say was that the story is not underwhelming, if you do it properly and not just read up online then it will keep you thinking and exploring for a decent amount of time, constantly having to go back to base to resupply on vital resources. \n\nFor a game that's in alpha, the story still immerses you into this character that's just as lost as you are when you start the game, with the simple task of \"Find Timmy\".

The game at release was buggy, poorly optimized and lacked a lot of content.\n\nI put the game in the back of my mind until recently. My friend picked it up and I had read that co-op was added. So I thought \"Why not?\" and picked it up again alongside him.\n\nThe game did a 180. It ran and looked awesome. The melee system is intense, although sometimes frustrating. The atmosphere really gives you chills.\n\nMutants stare at you silently behind trees and off in the distance. Sometimes they attack, sometimes they run away. Things were tense at the beginning. \n\nWe started to feel more confident in our abilities and as most horror games go, we stopped being scared. Until we found a cave we didn't know even existed.\n\nThe caves in this game are so vast, intertwined and full of suspensful moments, it's like playing a different game. Quietly walking through the dark with your little plastic lighter and seeing something massive move in the shadows had my heart racing for the first time in a game in forever.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the ending is actually an ending. There's actually something that ties it all together. My friend and I figured it would just be a little \"Hey you did it!\" and that was all, but the ending actually surprised us. \n\nFor $15, this game is a steal. Plenty to build, hunt and craft.

What is a survival game like 'The Forest' to me?\n\nI'll tell you. \n\nIt's countless hours of terror as you familiarize yourself with being the only civilized being on a massive island over-run with savages, mutants, and animals. It's a cavalcade of days you spend listening to the bustling of leaves as it could be your next meal, or your last. You either hunt, or be hunted but during your first many hours, you wouldn't dare hunt at night. No, You make every moment of sunlight last because when the sun goes down.. Well, let's just say; the screams of the cannibals are much more intimidating when you aren't sure how many are surrounding you.  But don't worry. It's not so bad. At least you start off with a lighter to guide you through the pitch black. \n\n'The Forest' is a suspenseful story with very few words. It's grotesque visuals, and smooth gameplay offer for one hell of a ride as you build a stable base to fend off the cannibals and mutants. There's just enough of challenge to make you want to keep playing, and quite a bit of content to help you do just that. For a game that is still in 'Early Access', I HIGHLY recommend this game.
