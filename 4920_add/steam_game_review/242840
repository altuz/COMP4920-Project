An incredible game. The story telling is superb, the quality and scenery is unmatched, game play feels great, and I was able to get quite a lot of playtime out of the game. The puzzles are difficult, but not difficult enough to discourage you from play - and the combat system is fun, and can get surprisingly intense.", "timestamp_updated": 1502009890, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502009890, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34719618", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502654", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503429989, "steamid": "76561198126131226", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Catagories[/th]\n        [th]Ranking[/th]\n        [th]Summery[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Value[/td]\n        [td]$20[/td]\n        [td]Given the interactivity of the games features, well worth the money[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]8 stars[/td]\n        [td]pretty solid puzzle solver game[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]7 stars[/td]\n        [td]It's kinda light on the verbal story aspect but you kinday piece one together in the back of your head.
