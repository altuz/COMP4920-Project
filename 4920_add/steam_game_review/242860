I've played this game since its earliest build, when it was still a free beta download on the internet, with two maps, a handful of guns and only four squads. I still can't believe how far its come in the years since.\n-------------------------------\nI get back on after several months of inactivity. Its christmas time and the game is hosting its annual Christmas Truce event (MUST credit the game for doing something no other wargame has ever done, annually commemorating a truce event where we all just play soccer and write digital christmas cards instead of killing each other). Of course, for us veterans, we know that each christmas brings new players.\n\nI join a Stosstruppen unit on an Ardennes match. I spawn in a trench with a fresh batch of newly converted BF1 and Call of Duty fanboys who bought the game on a one off this christmas because its WW1 like BF1. They go over the top in a twitch shooting induced frenzy and get cut to pieces by a machinegun. I joyfully listen to the screams of their dying characters as I weave my way up the trench towards the area with the most cover between lines.\n\nI cross over and with my MP18, clear out the first line trench, allowing the newly respawned pubbies to finally cross noman's land and cap the trench. The match switches us to the defensive and the Allies start dropping heavy arty on us. The pubbies line up on the line and start pouring out fire while the shells and mortars start dropping on us from on high. Then someone calls in gas.\n\nThe pubbies have never seen something like this before. They freak the fuck out and start running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Some jump out of the trench and are cut down by MG fire again. Others run away and are exectued for deserting. Most just suffocate in the cloud of mustard gas engulfing our trench.\n\nI calmly don my gasmask and crouch down among the bodies as the enemy starts to creep into the trench. With the low visibility and natural camoflauge I manage to kill three before someone drops a grenade at my feet and I get gibbed. By now the pubbies are starting to rage quit and the team has become heavily unbalanced.\n\nI know the match is effectively over, especially on Ardennes, we can't win without at least equal numbers, especially from the German start. Then, a miracle. The Almighty ZAB, twitch shooting jesus of Verdun, descends upon the German team. Armed with only a Kar98AZ and the speed of his OP twitching BS, he quickly kills over 60 enemies in two minutes without suffering a single death. The enemy team starts to rage quit.\n\nTen minutes later we win the game. Afterwards the game shifts to Truce mode, ZAB leaves immediately for the next killing field and the few remaning pubbies that stuck around start wandering around in confusion as I go to send a christmas card to a friend. Later I sit around the fire with some NPCs and a pubbie comes up to me. \"This is so weird\", he says. \"This is history\", I respond, \"this is Verdun.\"", "timestamp_updated": 1505765931, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505765931, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35330687", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506720731, "steamid": "76561198275506161", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The game is alright but the controls could be easier.", "timestamp_updated": 1506765395, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506765395, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10591, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 1521, "total_reviews": 12112}}
