Some complain about the lo-fi graphics, but they make the absolute best of what they are -- and I expect my robots to look \"clunky\".\n\nSound is more of a mixed bag. The voice effects are entertaining through and through, and distinct enough that you can quickly tell who is in an area and what they might be doing at that moment. At other times though, I hear rustling grass as  proceed over a stone bridge, or no sound at all in the water. It brings you out of \"the moment\". I quite enjoy the spooky narrator though, and the music always fits.\n\nGameplay wise... it turned into a slog by the time I had finished my first three (of five) islands. I didn't try more than one character, but there doesn't seem to be much to gameplay besides avoid-avoid-avoid, which basically means to move slowly in crouch position. Attack is naturally limited because, well, you're the one being hunted, but it would have really helped the game to have a few other creative ways of eliminating the danger of the robots. I managed to get every collectible piece of my matter transmogri-whatever by using glass bottles, alarm clocks, and toy trains. None of them felt all that different.\n\nIf it's $9.99 or lower and you live these open-world survival games, give it a try.

Your job is to find stones to put into a machine to escape.\n\nThe gameplay can be pretty fun, you need to hide in bushes away from the robots, loot houses for food and supplies, and eventually get a weapon to help defend yourself.\n\nThere is a large variety of robots that can hunt you down. There are normal hunters, poachers, air balloons, a robot scarecrow and more.\n\nFor me the gameplay did get a bit repetitive after an hour of looting and running away and it can take a while to find all of the parts to escape which can get boring.\n\nThe AI in the game is decent. They see you based on a visibility and sound system which is a bit flawed. If you're sitting in some thick grass and don't move the robots can basically step on your toes, but if you even shift your foot everything in a 10 meter radius will immediately storm to your location and fire.\n\nIf you can past those couple of flaws and don't mind spending a couple of hours doing the same thing then this is a pretty solid game although it is a little pricey.", "timestamp_updated": 1505105904, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505105904, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34793850", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504207", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504790109, "steamid": "76561197981342364", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's good for a little time waster.

It gets all the basics of good stealth gameplay down pretty well, for sure. It also gives you an incentive to choose stealth, as ammo is scarce and fights can easily turn against you even when you have enough ammo through dogs or traps that immobilise you. One of my absolute favourite aspects of this game is the atmosphere, it's moody and just slightly oppressive while still being beautiful despite the game's presumptive lack of graphics budget. The game is also extremely immerssive, as any first-person stealth game worth its salt should be. I find myself checking my \"visibility meter\" and listening for the chattering of robots sometimes when I zone out at work. Speaking of the robot chatter, this game has a good sense of humour without it becoming TOO present so that the game is still taken very seriously. I adore this game, and my only notably negative note is that the game's updating days are almost certainly over. Big Robot, if you read this, I will buy up to five copies for five friends. One for each major update that comes out for this game.
