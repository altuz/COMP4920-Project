Because I was looking for medieval-ish building game.. Then I found this on sale.. Picked it up, I noticed there isnt much of a tutorial to help you with the whole game.. So i was left to test out things over and over again.. I never found the game boring or what, the difficulty of the game made me want to beat it.. In a sense of beating, is that i can reach 10years in the game.. Which i found difficult to manage, and soon after realize the difficulty of raising and managing a growing town.. It kinda hit me, that its a bit close to reality (Or maybe im just getting too hooked on this game) when it comes to food and methods of surviving this game.\n\nThis is pretty fun to play.. If you want to play it very casual without worrying about resource and food, there are mods to use.. Which i gave it a try when i want to play it casualy just for the heck of it.. And also for the house model included on the workshop which are well-designed i must say (kudos to those modders)\n\nI say this game is one of my favorite building games.. I'd give it an 8/10 hahaha\n\nWhere is the 2? Well.. I kinda expected the buildings would change over time, like after a year of gameplay, the houses has an option to change it looks.. Tho im not yearning for it to happen, its just a thought.. I like the game already as it is.. Well this part is just an opinion, so just ignore my mumbling about the changing look of the house..

From a development standpoint, the fact that one guy not only did the assets and the code but also made the god damn engine from scratch, all by himself, is nothing short of outstanding. And not only it's a one man project, the quality of it all is superb. It runs smoothly, predictably and airtight from the very beginning to when it hits 1k peeps and beyond, so first things first, technically it's nothing short of an achievement.\n\nNow, as how it plays: it's a city builder through and through, and it's one of those simple in the surface, yet tricky to completely master games. There aren't a myriad of layered systems to it, and actually some of the most advanced stuff is absolutely optional, but even when one fully understands all the ins and outs of it, the game still remains addicting due to the uncertainties inherent to it's design. Let me explain.\n\nIn Banished, the player starts with a handful of villagers smack dab in the middle of a virgin, random plot of land. From there it'll be up to you to keep your guys fed, clothed, warm and healthy as you advance through the years. However, it won't be just a matter of plopping a few fishing docks and hunter's huts here and there at random and expect them to just make by, because planning is one of the primary requirements to the success of your village. Travel times must be kept short and supply points must be evenly spread to guarantee the resources get to your guys in time, and population density according to the needs of your industry as well will become the lynchpin of the game's flow and the first thing any player will have to learn to master.\n\nKeeping up with development will always keep a player on their toes, because shortages can give way to all sorts of negative feedback loops and need to be addressed before it's too late. The game nicely complements it's apparent simplicity with an element of uncertainty that will push the player to constantly expanding and keeping a new resource production facility or three on the back burner, ready to start work at a moment's notice, but as the village expands, infrastructure will have to be built to support that. Even when one masters the principles of building, just growing a town add keeping everything on the black is addicting and relaxing all the same, and helps replayability a lot. The \"endgame\" stuff, as I said, stands uncomfortably on the point where it's too costly to start with early but too laborious to work on later on, and the efficiency bonuses don't have that much of a payoff, but the basic building blocks are done well enough that the player won't really need them anyway.\n\nIn closing, banished is a game that makes the most out of its simplicity and that it's very well built all around, that always offers something to come back to, relaxing and entertaining. Feels a bit short on its more complex mechanics and is relatively challenging. Definitely a recommended purchase.\n\n8/10.", "timestamp_updated": 1506465418, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506465418, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35236867", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506714234, "steamid": "76561198137778562", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 113}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a very fun game, you can play it in many ways with many different strategies, it is a big community, with a lot of Youtubers playing it.
