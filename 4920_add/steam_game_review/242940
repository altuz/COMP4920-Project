Hands-down, one of the weirdest, most atmospheric, and fun RPGs I've ever played.  Also one of the few I've replayed in its entirety several times over just to spend time in the game's world.\n\nHaving owned the game since shortly after its release, the Quake 2+ graphics feel a little dated in 2017 and the resolution options (all 2 of them, 640x480 and 1280x960) are limiting, but the gameplay, music, characters, and plot stand the test of time.", "timestamp_updated": 1502163735, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502163735, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34009477", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505139", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501827719, "steamid": "76561198011231411", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First time I played this game was when it was kind of new.  I absolutely loved it.  Nice story, good voice acting, memorable characters, and generally everything that makes a game good.  I bought it on steam a while back but haven't gotten around to playing it but now I really wish I hadn't.  The game is totally bugged.  I never downvote a game for graphical glitches because I always entertain the possibility that it might be my graphics card or some kind of compatibility issue.  The bugs I'm talking about here are massive game breaking bugs.  Here are 3 examples:\n\n1. During whackmaster combat tutorial my character decided to fall through the floor and keep falling and falling and falling.   Had to reload.\n\n2. After first whackmaster battle the coach came to talk to me but during his text conversation with me I could see the cut scene (with voice) of that ass whooping I got outside the bar when I first left.  Total wtf moment.\n\n3. Now the final bug which has made the game literally unplayable for me.  I keep calling one of the elevators but it won't come.  No amount of reloading has fixed it.  I basically cannot continue since I'm stuck in the Anachronox Tours area.  \n\nI've now uninstalled the game because what's the point?  A huge shame since this is an awesome game.  Now I would like to pre-emptively say to anyone who will say \"I haven't encountered any bugs\" that bugs don't always happen but that doesn't mean they aren't there.", "timestamp_updated": 1501828149, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501828149, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34381214", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486525", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503258943, "steamid": "76561198016603957", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I must have gotten this for under a dollar... on some sale or pack.  I don't remember buying this... as I know I can't enjoy really terrible 3D graphics such as this.  And trust me... the pictures make the graphics look WAY better than in game.  I'd rather have good 2D graphics than terrible 3D.\n\nBut, I did try to give this game a fair shake... after an hour... nothing in the game was fun.  Combat was *terrible*.  Graphics are *terrible*.  Every conversation is a joke (or meant to be one)... and the jokes... are terrible.  The only one I found funny was \"There is a man on fire, and this section is closed off until he puts himself out.\" The interface is *terrible*.  Even the font is really bad.  Trying to navigate that mess... (find your way around without an automap, and no idea what walls are actually doors) is terrible.\n\nBugs: I got stuck in the combat tutorial and had to reload.\n\nI'm filing this game under \"Kill it with fire.\"\nI quite honestly don't believe any of the 'good' reviews are legitimate.
