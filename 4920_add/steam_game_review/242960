The problem iam getting is a load failure at the main menu, basically a ``freezed frame\u00b4\u00b4 but by messing around with this error i was able to find a way around the malfunction and finally play the content. If you are thinking about buying this game and/or have bought it already and get the error i stated above proceed as follows; make sure you have the steam overlay activated, once you enter the game and reach the main menu use the overlay hotkey (Shift+TAB) repeatably till the screen has loaded the appropriate interface, now sometimes the clicking on an option wether that be \u00b4\u00b4start game`` ect the frame will freeze again, just repeat the hotkey as needed and the rest of the game should run with no interruptions.
