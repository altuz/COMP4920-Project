I haven't played the game as it is (1.2). If the A.I isn't great with the 1.3 patch then it must be atrocious without it. Link below to 1.3 patch.     \n\n\n\n\n\n[u]What I liked about the game[/u]\n[list]\n[*]\tInteresting story. I like the concept behind the game; travelling to different time periods; trying to get to the right one. Episode 2 reminded me of Clash of the titans (1981) and Jason and the Argonauts. I especially liked the boss in episode 2; thought that was pretty cool. \n\n[*]\tEach time period has its own weapons. \n\n[*]\tImpressive level design. Plenty of secrets to be found throughout the game.\n\n[*]\tI like how the game has a similar hud to doom; where you can see the characters face and general information (ammo and character stats).\n\n[*]\tYou can level up and it isn't too complex, although you will have to bind the keys before you start the game (might be just with the 1.3 patch), so you can upgrade a specific ability. \n\n[*]\tThere's an option at the start of the game that removes the sidekicks; I highly recommend it.\n\n[*]\tBrilliant ending.          \n\n \n\n\n[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]\n\n[*]\tYou will find that throughout the game, sidekicks are a pain in the ass (unless you ticked the box at the start of the game that removes sidekicks); despite my game being updated to the 1.3 community patch. Your sidekicks can get in the way, especially when you are crawling in vents; which causes them to repeat the same sentences over and over again. Sidekicks and enemies can get stuck on objects easily; it's especially annoying with sidekicks because they need to be with you when you reach the next checkpoint. You can sometimes lose your sidekicks; which again you need to find them to progress to the next part of level. Sidekicks sometimes struggle to understand the concept of levers, doors and sometimes have trouble jumping; which sometimes puts you in a situation where you have to start that part of the level all over again. I wish sidekicks would make more of an effort to join you in combat; it fells like you are doing all the work. It would be better if your sidekick teleported to you when you reach the next checkpoint; it would cause less frustration. It would have been a good idea as well to show how much ammo the sidekicks have for the weapon that they are currently using. It's a shame there's no command which tells your sidekicks to fuck off. \n\n[*]\tWould have been nice to have a flash light, torch, lantern, or any portable light. \n\n[*]\tYou can't block with the Daikatana.\n\n[*]\tEpisode 1 is a bitch, especially after when you team up with your first sidekick; the difficultly just sky rockets in that first episode, but fortunately it calms down when you go into the next time period.    \n\n[*]\tWould have been good if you could play as the other two sidekicks.\n\n[*]\tThe game went on a bit too long for me; gets a bit boring at the end. \n\n[*]\tBoss fights are a bit too easy.\n\n[*]\tDidn't make me John Romero's bitch.          \n[/list]\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\n\nA good game that has been overshadowed by bad AI; luckily you get the option to not have sidekicks, which I recommend to first time players. Did the game really deserve the amount of negativity and controversy it got; no it didn't. I've played worse; wouldn't like to play the game without the 1.3 patch. If I where you I would play it safe like I did and buy this game at a discount. The game is sort of similar to Quake and Unreal. \n\n\n[h1]6/10 (with 1.3 patch)[/h1] \n\n\n[u]Link  (1.3 patch)[/u]\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/daikatana13/daikatana/wiki/Downloads", "timestamp_updated": 1500153783, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500153743, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34624919", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499280", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503432776, "steamid": "76561198281084628", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The sound effects are bad.\nThe gameplay is bad.\nJohn remaro made me his bitch.\nJohn remaro made hundreds of people his bitch", "timestamp_updated": 1504150653, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504150653, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 73, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 39, "total_reviews": 112}}
