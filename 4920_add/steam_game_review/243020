Not well ported to Steam. I had a lot of moments where the game ran too fast. Gameplay itself is outdated despite the strong showing for the time period. Removed for declutter\n\nWas very impressed at first. Good 3D for 1996. Fixed camera did a good job of following the action around. Control scheme made sense and Xbox360 pad was detected out of the box. The game worked well, maybe too well, sometimes it seemed like the game was way too fast, and there would be parts of levels were it would consistently happen. Game requires you to go get keys and go for exits in typical uninspired platformer fashion. 3D is good fo the time but mostly trash for today and there is not much of a setting or story. Saving is with a password only but I did not bother testing", "timestamp_updated": 1505085656, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502068975, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 30, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 24, "total_reviews": 54}}
