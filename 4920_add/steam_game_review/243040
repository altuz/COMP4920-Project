Just build your way into the perfect space station and try to please everyone.\nThe game is realtime, but you can take your time building stuff.\nYou can let your workers clean, build, research, grow food, sleep, eat, love, party and battle other competitors.\nThere are missions, challenges and it's also possible to play sandbox.\n\nThe game music is unique and relaxing to listen too. I think it really suits the game.\n\nGameplay is pretty good, it's pretty easy to move the camera around and also building is pretty straightforward.\n\nThe tutorial did not cover all aspects of the game, so it's sometimes hard to find the hidden menu's in the game.\nHere are some tips:\n- to conquer/battle a competitor you first have to declare war, otherwise you cannot reach enemy grounds.\n- if staff is leaving, you probably forgot to give them a raise\n\nSimilar games:\n- Theme Hospital\n- Evil Genius\n- Spacebase DF-9\n- Planetbase\n- Anno (1404, 2070)\n- Space Colony\n- Spore\n- Dungeon Keeper\n- Dungeons\n- Maia\n", "timestamp_updated": 1501613374, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501613374, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34015813", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507977", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503786897, "steamid": "76561198013621474", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very relaxing strategy game with a little bit of tension and goals sprinkled in every once in a while. One of my favorite PC games of yesteryear, this one mostly flew under the radar. It's got a great little soundtrack and theme, and with a mod you can have it running at 1080p fullscreen and it looks fantastic.
