I will say the game starts out slow, and drags a little and the main character feels a bit bland. But as the game moves on the story gets pretty interesting and really picks up. Perhaps this was by design as he really is kind of a boring nobody so in that sense its freshing. He was not some grand savior, just someone trying to make their way in the world. The art is very nice and getting around is simple with chapters using a few areas to work as you complete the puzzles. Most of the puzzles are semi intuitive, but can resort to trying everything on everything at time to time when you are stuck. The voice acting is first rate, and the story is spot on for this fairly tale adventure. \n\nMemoria, Part II\n\nMore of the same but it\u2019s in a good way. In some ways I enjoyed it more than the first. The story and the new characters are very interesting. The Story also has some interesting twists that the first story lacked as the first was a bit more strait forward, the second had more to figure out and wonder about as well which was nice. Basically the game is good right from the start as it is basically the continuation of the first but better. Voice acting/story are a step up over the first in the way of the new characters are even better with more interesting folks to meet. The one down side I found the puzzles a bit to random, with more just try everything, unless you under stood the clue, which I often did after. \n\nOver all it\u2019s a great series. The second I enjoyed the story more, the first was better for the puzzles. But don\u2019t take that as meaning they were bad in either. It\u2019s just more the way the games felt to me.
