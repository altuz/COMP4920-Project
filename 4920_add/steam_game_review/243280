You control Poof, a dog that has to protect a cat hanging in the lower center of the level from getting attacked by all sorts of creatures. Kill enough enemies, create combos, and use your other abilities to complete objectives, score points and unlock extras, new weaponry and new abilities. The more you play, the more you'll unlock, like towers that shoot arrows or ice cubes that freeze enemies for a short while, allowing you to create even longer combos. The downside is that there's only one level. You'll unlock different backgrounds, outfits, et cetera later on to keep things a little bit interesting, though. You can even unlock an extra (still small) part of the level making things even more hectic.\n\nIt's a game that keeps challenging you. Rounds can be short but never frustrating. You'll most likely want to keep trying to beat your old score and unlock new stuff, but after about 3 hours you've probably seen most of it already, even if you haven't unlocked all of it yet. It becomes too repetitive too soon. That doesn't make it a bad game, because there's always stuff to unlock, but it needs more than just one level.\n\n[Rating: 70/100]", "timestamp_updated": 1401980525, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1388972957, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "9471398", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507555", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1397087302, "steamid": "76561198001046455", "num_games_owned": 7083, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Po\u00f6f is basically an action defense platformer. It's also a bit crazy: in it you are, after all, a hat-enthusiast doggy with a magic kitten that poops golden eggs. Monsters want the kitten too. The curse is that you will DIE if they get the kitten so, ironically, you need to defend it with your life.\n\nBasic idea is simple. Monsters come through doors that are scattered over the level, and you must kill them before they get to the kitten. You can jump on them like Mario or kill them with special items or defensive structures that can be placed in the assigned places. Being a dog you can also poop - yes, poop - golden poop that slows down anything that passes over or through it.\n\nPlaying along, you get more items and abilities. There's just this one disappointing thing about the game: there's only one map. Granted, I do not think I spoil too much if I reveal that as you complete missions, you will eventually unlock new areas in the one map. These spawn new, usually more dangerous monster types. Also the style changes: you'll be wearing different hats and outfits, as is the kitty and the level's appearance will change randomly between games as well. It won't fool anyone, but is a nice change for the ever-repeating map.\n\nBesides the single map, the game is quite fun for a while, and it's rather cheap. If you really get into it, you can try to work your way up the global leaderboards.\n\nOne last thing: At the time of the writing, Poof's cards are quite expensive. While the recent sale has lowered their price a bit, you can still get quite a large penny back just by selling the cards. Check the market for the current situation though.\n\n(Edit: Changed part that was no longer relevant)", "timestamp_updated": 1397087391, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1394837454, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "7875974", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503872", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1397793582, "steamid": "76561197973026808", "num_games_owned": 3053, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's like Orcs must die + Mario Brother's arcarde + three times the amount of poo that is present in Castle Crasher's\n\nIt's challenging, very fast and fun, the only thing it really lacks is a 2player mode.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1385960983, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1385960983, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "16416889", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1434295044, "steamid": "76561198026285238", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Mac users beware.

There's no free agency, you can only get the upgrades in a set order, you don't gather any sort of currency, you're just given three missions and when you complete the set you get an upgrade.  The gameplay itself is awful.  Shallow and clunky.  There's no real difficulty, just frustration from hits that shouldn't have happened and crap like that.  Don't get it.  Just go play one of the many, many better ones on Kongregate or something.", "timestamp_updated": 1389054465, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1389054465, "votes_down": 17}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 24, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 29}}
