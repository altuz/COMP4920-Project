Even though graphics don't make or break a game, I was still greatly dissapointed that the E3 presentation wasn't the true representation of (at least) the PC version.  2014 was one of the lesser years for gaming, and I'm certain Watch Dogs was on a lot of peoples' shit list.  \n\nThat being said, I admit (to my greatest shame) that I actually enjoyed my time with this game.  I had already heard many reviews claiming the game to be mediocre at best, before actually playing it.  So I set my expectations to the lowest point possible....\n\nSTORY:\nThis game's story is not very compelling.  It tries to tell this gritty revenge narrative about a broken man, but it just isn't well done.  Aiden Pearce isn't a very interesting dude, so its very hard to sympathize with his motives and goals.  There's no real tension or actual stakes for the player to truly give a damn.  It isn't all bad though.  There are some parts I particularly enjoyed.  Even though Aiden is boring, some of his dialogue with the other members of the cast is quite entertaining.  Jordi Chin is a perfect example.  He's a fun character who throws Aiden shit, and is used properly for comedy relief.  \n\nVOICE ACTING:\nI thought the voice acting in this game was pretty solid.  Even though I wasn't affected by some of the more \"emotional\" scenes, I could tell the actors were doing their best to protray the characters they were playing.  Jordi, T-Bone, Clara, Lucky Quinn, Iraq, and Damien all had convincing performances.  Even though I didn't get attached to Aiden, I thought Noam Jenkins did a great job with the gruffer tone Ubisoft was looking for.  Shame that the story's direction couldn't highlight this good voice acting.  \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nCombat in this game is like any other third person cover shooter with SOME added layers of depth.  There are different ways the player can approach certain scenarios and its all thanks to the hacking elements.  If you successfully clear out a room of enemies with hacking and stealth, it can feel really rewarding.  I remember I once threw explosives onto a car, hacked it so it ran into a group of gangsters, made a blackout, and stealth killed the remaining enemies.  It was good fun.  The side activities were surpisingly entertaining.  Criminal Convoys were my personal favorite because I loved setting up ambushes and going guns-blazing in the middle of the street.  DRIVING IN THIS GAME IS VERY POOR, IT FEELS LIKE THE ROAD HAS SOAP ON IT OR SOME SHIT.  ALSO SOME OF THE PHYSICS ARE TERRIBLE. \n\nGRAPHICS/ART DESIGN:\nAs stated above, I was disspointed that the game didn't look like its E3 presentation.  The graphics are ok but they are certainly not the best.  Nothing truly impressed me and it was just meh.  I do appreciate the fact that Ubisoft tried to give an accurate depiction of Chicago.  It shows that there is a good amount of dedication in the level design/development.  \n\nSOUND DESIGN/OST:\nThe sound design in this game was good.  Not fantastic, but acceptable.  The soundtrack wasn't all that memorable but it did serve it's purpose and changed the mood appropriately.  The techno stealth music is a great example.  But the in-game radio...well, I wasn't a fan of it.  There were no songs I really enjoyed other than one or two.  I was able to give this a pass because I know its difficult implementing outside music into a game.  Legal trouble and what not.\n\nBAD BLOOD/DLC:\nThis was an alright expansion.  I'm glad I got the complete edition for 12 bucks on sale cause I wouldn't do a stand-alone buy for this DLC.  It was cool to play as T-Bone, and I thought some of his new gadgets were fun.  However, the gameplay was practically the same and the story was again, not very compelling.  T-Bone only has a few animation differences than Aiden.  The only other notable DLC was the new digital trip, and I didn't think those were all that fun to begin with.\n\nVERDICT:\nIt's a medicore game.  I guess the reason I am recommending it is because despite all the negatives, I enjoyed myself.  I had some fun and I don't regret playing the game.\n\n\"I don't look back anymore.  I don't regret.  I look forward.

As far as Ubisoft open world games go, this was probably my least favorite game out of the bunch.  It's not bad, but rather unspectacular.  I remember hearing a lot of people around launch day saying this game was very shallow in comparison to what was advertised, and after finishing the campaign and DLC, I'm inclined to agree.\n\nThe story does a decent enough job to see you through to the end, though I found virtually no likeable characters out of the entire bunch.  So many of the central characters in this game feel like hollow, stereotypical \"hackers\" that some out-of-touch design committee put together because they assumed that's how they look, act, etc.  The game tries so hard to come off as cool, hip, and trendy to its audience, but doesn't really succeed in doing so.\n\nI liked the gameplay, but again, there's really no USP that makes the game feel unique or special.  The hacking ability is fun to use on people in the game the first couple of times, and then loses most of its interest afterwards.  Perhaps the game's best feature is being able to take advantage of hacking cameras and using them to your advantage by scouting enemies in front of you, sabotaging/boobytrapping certain guards to assist with stealth, and doing a few hacking minigames to progress through the story.  Money is practically useless to obtain since you will never usually have a problem looting ammo, supplies, guns, etc. from enemies after you emerge from gunfights.\n\nThis game seems decently optimized and I never encountered any major framerate drops or glitches, although I did have one problem a few times where there was no sound at all when launching the game.  I have no idea what was causing this, but restarting the game or my computer usually did the trick.\n\nOverall, if you're really interested in playing this, wait for a pretty heavy sale and don't expect anything too revolutionary.
