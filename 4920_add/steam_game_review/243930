The game world gets rather bland and repetitive the more you get to the end of the game. It often looks like a PS 3 game which is fitting as Spiders used a Sony engine.\n\nI tried Hawk difficulty for starters but soon found out that although you're free to choose your combat specialization I didn't do well with the warrior class I chose. So I turned down the difficulty to Recruit and now the game felt too easy. You may say I suck but wait for the end boss. The difficulty is very imbalanced and the ending has a huge difficulty spike.\n\nIf you didn't bring a crate full of potions and ammunition you're pretty much sol. Hopefully, you did save often.\n\nI'm a fan of studio Spiders and played through Mars: War Logs and The Technomancer recently. In comparison Bound By Flame is their weakest game. On sale, you should give it a try.\n\nThe fully voiced dialogues are sometimes really funny. From time to time you can imagine what the game could have been with a bigger budget.\n\nThe game supports 4K resolution and kept me entertained for more than 20 hours. As the story is branching there's a lot of replayability.\n\nOn a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give Bound By Flame a 6.5.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506037234, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506037234, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34855126", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505530000, "steamid": "76561198038685354", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I tend to have the attention span of a Knat any more and purchase lots of games and play few to even close to the end.\u00a0 I was hesitant on this one because of the Mixed reviews but I really enjoyed it a lot.\u00a0 Great story, and a pretty neat ending I think - gets a huge A+ from me.\u00a0 Thank you very much for a super fun and satisfying game!", "timestamp_updated": 1505027219, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505027219, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34873950", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505194235, "steamid": "76561197998587657", "num_games_owned": 654, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Well I have to say after reading all the bad reviews about this game I was not expecting a whole lot, but when I actually got into the game I really was enjoying it.

Come talk to me.\" When he says this, you're not more than [b][i]5 feet away from him[/i][/b], but he's on a higher platform that you have to walk 15 feet to get up to in order to talk to him. I'm 5 minutes into the game, and the first 3 minutes were a lore cutscene (which wasn't bad) and a combat cutscene (which I think was drawn out way too long and should have been a combat tutorial), and then after being able to walk around and collect materials (for a reason I don't know yet because crafting isn't something that has been mentioned at all yet) I get stopped by a [u]pointless cutscene[/u]?\n\nAt this point, I'm already kind of upset, but I figure \"[i]Hey, maybe I'll get a look at the combat and this guy will be like a sparring partner or something.[/i]\" Nope.
