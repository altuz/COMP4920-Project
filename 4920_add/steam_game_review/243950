But the wizard Maxos remembered that his emperor friend had a romp with a giant fire breathing lizard because the Emperor was a total G. You are the outcome of this little relationship, a man who can turn into a dragon, a dragon knight if you will.\n\nMaxos tells you you need to conquer the world, destroy this new technology while also using said technology, and also deal with people that can be so annoying you'd wish you could just throw them off your high powered magic airship called the Raven. \n\nAlso you have a jet pack. So there's that. \n\nI'm a casual fan of the series. I managed to get my hands on most of the Divinity series, though I haven't played through Original Sin or Original Sin 2 yet. Though since everyone is raving about OS2, I may as well just swoose right in and review the game in the series nobody cares about! Yaaaaayyyyyyyy! \n\nDragon Commander is the first game chronologically, taking place even before Original Sin. Most of the gameplay revolves around this risk style game mode where you need to build armies and invade other territories, but there are also a few choose-your-own-adventure style activities while aboard the Raven. \n\nOkay, so now it gets a bit difficult. See, the game is neat, but it's not really all that fun. The campaign mode itself is pretty barebones, and when you go into battle, you can play as yourself, the dragon commander, and personally take command of a battlefield.\n\nThe thing is, you can only command on one battlefield per turn, so if there are multiple battles you have to give it to overwhelming force or a luck of the dice. You can also assign a general to command the battle you cant be at for a certain price, but usually you just end up letting the Imperial Army do the fighting and commanding since it doesn't cost anything and they're usually enough.\n\nYou have four generals to choose from. The loud Henry who will later go on to voice the Roman General in Total War: Rome II. The proud and uptight Catherine, the \u201ctrying too hard to be one of the boys\u201d Scarlet. And Edmund the genius tactician and narcissistic Lizard. That's not an insult, he's an actual lizard person.\n\nI don't like any of them. \n\nDon't get me wrong, there are some fun moments with them, but for the most part they're just annoying. Self centered, arrogant, hostile, surprisingly annoying, and a lot of the times just a piercing sound in your ear. I couldn't even stand Henry all that much even though I think his voice actor, Alistair Parker, did a pretty admirable job as the General voice in Rome II and Blackwall in Dragon Age: Inquisition [spoiler] Even though I wasn't that big of a fan of Inquisition. [/spoiler]\n\nBut not only are they outright hostile to you through most of the game, but you rarely have an opportunity to tell them off. At a few points of the game you can point out Catherine's hypocracy, but for the most part it just feels like the Dragon Commander is going \u201cYup, uh huh, alright.\u201d Through most of their discussions. \n\nThen there's the counselors from the five races of Rivellon. \nYorrick the undead, Oberon the Elf, Falstaff the Dwarf, Prospero the Lizard, and Trinculo the Imp. \n\nThese people are fairly one dimensional, though I guess it kind of makes sense considering the political satire of the game. Yorrick is very religious, but then again most Undead apparently are, Oberon is a hippy, but his questionable stance on other races sometimes makes itself known, Falstaff likes money, Prospero is the \u201ccold\u201d one [spoiler] Get it? [/spoiler], and Trinculo is my homie. \n\nEvery now and then you have to attend a meeting in the throne room of the Raven. Here you talk to the council and discuss politics of your realm. It's kind of interesting, but you never actually see real outcomes of these events, they just kind of tell you what happens every now and then. So basically you just kind of end up picking and choosing political positions depending on what your approval rating is with each respective races. If anyone drops under 50%, then just do something they like the next meeting. No real thought behind it. \n\nAlso, you have to choose a bride sometime into the game. But uh...It doesn't change much outside of cards and bonuses you can get with their events. \n\nYou know, all things considered, a lot of people like to talk smack to the person that can turn into a giant fire breathing monster and eat them at any moment. I guess you could say they know that you \u201cneed\u201d them. But I don't feel like you really do, considering the person doing all the heavy lifting is either me or the Imperial Army. \nMaxos is basically your only friend. Just remember that.\n\nOkay, now the combat part.\n\nWhen I first started playing the RTS stuff, holy hell was it ever a ball buster. There's almost no breathing room, especially when your enemy seems to be able to completely obliterate your entire attack force in just a few seconds with basic units. I'm ashamed to admit I actually had to turn down the  difficulty for a bit until I figured out you can just bring a massive amount of heavy tanks to the fight and then just rush them. \n\nThe big feature of the RTS mode is that you can transform into your dragon form and wreak havoc among the enemy ranks. Not only can you just blast them with your breath, but you can also activate a few abilities to do things like cause more damage, heal yourself, or buff your units close to you. You also have a jetpack, which is radical. \n\nBut it's all just so weak. The RTS is barebones, the dragon loses it's novelty quickly, the choices you make on the Raven don't really affect anything except for a few approval bars, and your generals are only necessary if you either can't be on the battlefield yourself, or your auto-resolve bar is 50/50 and you don't want to spend any bonus cards. \n\nIt's all serviceable, but that's it, just serviceable. The RTS is basic, the political choices don't mean much, and your supporting cast can shove off. It's like they really wanted to make a great game, but then ran out of time. \n\nShould you play Divinity: Dragon Commander? \n\nIt's all still pretty neat, but not neat enough to keep you coming back time and time again. I almost wish they went for a more traditional army thing with infantry instead of the whole magic robot route. Maybe larger scale, bigger formations, a morale system so you can just terrorize enemy armies as a dragon? It could be like that kind of okay PS3 game \u201cLair\u201d except without the framedrops and with a command feature. I think it would be cool, just wailing on fools who think they can fight a dragon. \n\nBut anyway, it's not bad, but it's not all that great either. Wait for it to go on the cheap and pick it up for five dollars or something. Or just pick up any other Divinity game. I'm hearing nothing but praise for Original sin and Original Sin 2, and Divinity 2 is still my favorite in the series. \n\nDivinity Dragon Commander gets a disapproving lizard out of a tank with legs.\n\nTodd Howard is a fifth dimensional being.

The quality in several areas, and sometimes the transparency of what will occur, is extremely lacking. The combat is barebones basic, with minimal strategy elements.\n\nThe writing is decent, though the scenarios presented are in a definitive political lens, and I am unsure of how to view that part of the game as a result. I don't really like politics in my games, I can deal with it minimally, but when it goes all in, it kinda sours the experience.\n\nNot the worst game I've played, but the combat is poor. Enemies using anti-air defenses will summarily two shot the dragon, and enemies without air defenses will be two shot by the dragon. \n\nMissiles can track you across map? Literally...the dodge mechanic doesn't work as intended (still taking damage when visually cleared missile, missiles chasing you despite the dodge (even in circles).\n\nI could deal with the majority of that, if it weren't so boring. I essentially won the game within the first 20 minutes, the game is extremely snowball heavy (a single victory at a location where their forces are stacked can allow you an easy victory). Normally I wouldn't rate a game within 3 hours of playing, but in a case like this, the quality of gameplay doesn't significantly increase. It's main element, that is tactical combat, is severely lacking, and the world is rather small.\n\nIt uses a risk-esque system for the strategy layer, which isn't that bad. The game (minus the tactical layer) is rather good in fact, but there isn't much to do on the strategic layer beyond have the occasional conversation, usually political-based, with one of your underlings, which is where the issue lies. \n\nYou 'research' by spending points on improvements, which add abilities or unlock new units (not really that interesting. There is also the option to 'empower your dragon', allowing you to take a keybar of abilities, which vary in power. The dragon itself is powerful, but instantly dies to missiles, has nothing to do with being bad at dodging, I'm pretty sure missiles don't spin around 8 times in a circle and still collide into you...\n\nIt's just not fun or particularly entertaining.\n\nThe dragon gameplay itself, and the switch from 'strategy game' to more or less FPS dragon gameplay IS good, and I'd like to see this done in a different game (preferably without the dragon, or other unit being grossly overpowered and therefore having a massive weakness).\n\nI can applaud the attempt, while still criticizing the result. What they did here, if successful, would have revolutionized gaming, and it is moderately impressive for what it turned out, just nowhere near what we expect to be present in a strategy game. They tried to input decision making (politics, usually based on real life :/ ) and tie that in with the strategy layer, which ultimately ties into the tactical layer by how many troops you can provide, etc, along with creating a strategy game, and a third person dragon-shooter thingy on top of that, and the complexity ultimately kills the joy of the game. They tried to do a bit of everything, but instead failed at everything. \n\n5/10", "timestamp_updated": 1504858197, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504857194, "votes_down": 9}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 571, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 186, "total_reviews": 757}}
