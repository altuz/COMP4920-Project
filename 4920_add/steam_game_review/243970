There is a great feeling of success when you can stealth your way past guards, steal victory from defeat, and sometimes hide practically in plain sight.\n\nOf course, the 'rewind' ability helps, but the fact that you're limited to 5 rewinds per mission (and only one turn each) gives you enough leeway to recover from a mistake without turning the entire game into a cake-walk.
