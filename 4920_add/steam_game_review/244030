From this you can gather the idea that it's not optimised in the least and i found that out even more so at how rushed their missions were into the game. A normal sandbox game can have tonnes of items without much frame issue yet the missions you only need to build 10 items before seeing the camera shake bug which is directly attributed to frame rate. This all happening on a 1080 G1 graphics card.\n\nThe devs have stated one last patch was coming and I did also try to mod with this game finding lacking guides and asking the devs directly, they didn't come out with much more, even their manuals / youtube modding guides are incomplete as well.\n\nIf you want a great looking and smooth running game, head over to JCBpioneer and get on their stuff, it does look extremely polished even before release and shows amazing potential to already be this game and more.

I think it is nearly contenct complete, but there are still bugs to fix and multiplayer optimisations to do.\n\nThis game IS playable, but it takes very very loooong time until you have constructed something. I have used the Manned features nearly all the time alone and it took me nearly 8 hours until i had build an airlock-chamber for my planned base. This time was needed to construct the 3D printer, more effective power generation and resource mining facility\u00b4s before i finale started with the basebuilding.\n\nWhen you are alone it is very lame in the first 2-3 hours, but then you have enough to do for yourselft alone and after 5-6 hours there is enough work for a second player it think.\n\nThis are the times for a standard scenario, you can short this time extremely by using an custom scenario, but i have used the originals for the most time.\n\nThis game isn\u00b4t something for everybody, but i think it is very nice for everybode who likes e.g. the film/book \" The Martian\".\n\nHere you have no gun fight\u00b4s or attacking animals like in the most other sci-fi games, the action in the competitions with other players in multiplayer is based on something like killing them with a truck or steal their resources out of their facilities. To win a competition with another base it could be enough to steal them their food and seeds. Or you can work together and build a giant base oder base-network on the crater map.\n\nLong story short: This gime is NOTHING for People who only wanna play a game for a couple of hours or who need action very fast after startig the game, but when you want to get a little feeling how it is to live on the mars, how there there could likely be build realistic colonies, then buy this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1506936539, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506936539, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35411572", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507127376, "steamid": "76561198003234214", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1719}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "The Silent Killer: or how I stopped worrying and love the free chemotherapy.\n\nSo the game has been out for a while now, and it's been 6 months since last update, so I'm considering this the final form of the game.\n\nIf you go outside the lander hab you are exposed to radiation. This radiation will eventually build up and kill you. The only way to avoid it is to not go outside the lander. Apart from the radiation it is almost impossible to die in the game. Potatoes grow in 5 minutes, giving you infinite food. And water is abundant in the top soil, and you only need to go out for a couple of minutes to get it.\n\nNot sure what this game was going for, but if it was \"Radiation Poisoning Simulator 2017\", then they did a fairly decent job, I have never been so sick and tired of radiation in a video game. Not 25\u20ac worth of job tho. I even regret paying 10\u20ac for this mess. I could pay 2\u20ac for a radiation poisoning simulator. There are no goals, no objectives, no tasks, nothing to work towards. There is no progression, other than the inevitable progression towards death by radiation.\n\nSo in summary, don't go outside other than to get more water, don't collect mineral samples, don't analyze said samples, don't build anything, and maybe you won't die of radiation. And the easiest way to avoid doing all those thing is to uninstall.
