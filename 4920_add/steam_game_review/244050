Very detailed, not a \"full procedure\" sim as DCS (airplanes start with the push of a button, although you can see the actual start procedure in the cockpit), but you do have to manage the engine completely.\nThe behaviour of the planes is very realistic, damage models are very precise, making battles a cinematic wonder in some cases. All natural forces are replicated, from wind to gravity, exceedingly high speeds will rip your plane appart, damaged wing may suffer from stress and detach easily, and you can even try your last resort and pull your Luger out and attempt a more...\"personal approach\".\n\nAlthough it has training and campaigns, this is more dedicated towards sorties and online play (don't disregard the campaigns though'!)\nThis is not an experience that holds your hand through learning how to fly, you are expected to do some research appart from the sim, but this is an excelent entry point for the flight sim enthusiast, as cockpits are much simpler than newer flying machines (WW2 and later).\nWith the right approach, you will be fighting in no time!\n\nSo summing up:\n\n-This is a simulator, not a \"game\" per se. Expect studying a little about airplanes to master the controls.\n-The \"Free\" portion of this sim is more of a \"Test\" than a \"F2P\".\n-You don't need all the planes for you will most likely dedicate yourself to master only a few of them.\n-Wait for Sales to get amazingly low prices!\n-STICK IS REQUIRED! (for a pleasent experience).\n-Track IR is recommended for ease of enemy detection and situational awareness.\n\n\n10/10 best WW1 aircraft sim out there...", "timestamp_updated": 1492126263, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492126263, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "31812937", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505192", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501736385, "steamid": "76561198275982557", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I love this game!  That doesn't mean it's easy to play - but if you're willing to be patient and enjoy the ride, the process of learning can be a lot of fun.  I bought all the planes during a Steam sale for about $60, and with a joy-stick and a head-tracking system (TrackIR 5) I took to the skies starting with an early fighter (Airco DH2).  I plan to work my way through the war and learn each plane as they historically entered the fray.  Free-flying practice on Mission mode is perhaps my favorite.  I found that it's important that you spend time in the air just flying for the joy of it in order to get a feel for what your plane can do.  This should be done BEFORE you start flying around people who want to kill you.  :)  After awhile you'll discover that the flying part gets easy.  The taking off and landing parts...may require a little more practice.  Just remember to take your time and not be in any hurry.
