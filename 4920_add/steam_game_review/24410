I bought this game through a Christmas sale one year but didn't play it right away. I finally got around to playing this and I'm extremely glad I did. It's a solid game and it doesn't try to be more than what it is, a great RTS. I thoroughly enjoy the time period in which this takes place and the true history behind the story within the game. It plays really well and I never once had any issues with crashes or glitches. I did also enjoy the option to restart a mission without a penalty against me. I actually \"cheated\" a little in this game to earn extra gold at the beginning of each mission (editing the .sav file through a hex editor). Even with doing this I fould the game still very challenging but very rewarding. The last mission was diffcult but I feel it really capped off the game well. It was what your army was fighting for throughout the game and it was a very satisfying end to a solid game.\n\n+ Focused on what it does best and didn't try to do to much\n+ For a game that is over 5 years old the graphics weren't that bad\n+ Challenging but rewarding in the same token\n- Enemy sigh seemed to reach further then your own (some missions this was extremely frustrating)\n"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1405294419, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512961", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "11223882", "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198117612975", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1405293908, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 97}, "timestamp_updated": 1405294419, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I find myself constantly wrestleing with the camera.

That's a real g o d d a m n accomplishment. I can micromanage the S H I T outta the Holy Roman Empire in less time than it takes a single retinue of crusaders to identify, track, and engage a band of filthy Saracens. Might as well be playing this game in real time, over the course of hundreds of years.\n\nCamera is jarring, vertigo-inducing garbage. Controls and interface are poorly designed so it's a slog to get anything done. I admire the historical accuracy, but at the end of the day if the game ain't fun, you made a bad game. And \"Crusaders\" ain't fun in spades.\n\nI know we're fielding a pretty empty bench when it comes to Crusades games, so if you're a diehard Crusades nerd and scratching that itch is more important to you than good gameplay, MAYBE you'll enjoy this title.

Your guys literally don't run as fast as their legs would have you believe.\n\nBut again, there's a great game in here.  The character models are VERY impressive, the maps look quite beautiful, your army's progression and upgrades are very well done, and the inter-faction rivalries keep things interesting.\n\nThis is practically a Total War game by another developer.
