The new graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay for HW2 is great in the remaster. The HW1 remaster, however, is clunky to the point of unplayability. \n\nHW1 should never have been ported into the HW2 engine, it's fundamentally a different game, with different mechanics. The attempt to overhaul them has fallen short of the mark, by a long shot. To me, it feels as though I have to fight the game to get fleets to behave as expected.\nHowever, HW1c plays as smoothly and beautifully as I remember, and is still worth playing from a strategy perspective.\n\nHW2r is more beautiful, more smooth, and all-round better than its classic counterpart. HW2r is the game as if it were made today.\n\nOverall, I think in order to properly remaster HW1, it should simply be re-built with better graphics in mind, the movement and combat code can likely be copied and pasted direct from source. The HW2 remaster is, without a doubt, better in every way than the original.\n\nTL;DR: Play Homeworld Classic and Homeworld 2 Remastered.", "timestamp_updated": 1505598586, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505598586, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35033981", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1453696403, "steamid": "76561197966463890", "num_games_owned": 695, "num_reviews": 131, "playtime_forever": 1069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Classic games whose design stands the test of time", "timestamp_updated": 1505685211, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505685211, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35233338", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1466730612, "steamid": "76561197993175551", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 4554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's a strange hybrid of Homeworld 1 & 2.
