It's a beautiful tale of a girl's search for adventure and her identity. Beautiful world, music, story, voice acting, and the list goes on.

I did have fun before that, but the game just fails to get better and justify its overcomplexity. \n\n9 out of 10 times, the reward for 10 minutes of painstaking movement and exploration is a healing item recipe.\n10 out of 10 times, there won't be a shortcut to go back to the start, and you'll have to backtrack. I estimate around 2 or 3 hours of my 12 hour playtime are backtracking alone. Fast travel is so insanely restricted it's basically useless except in late game.\n\nThis could have been a great game, and you can tell they put a LOT of effort, love and money into it, but it falls apart due to poor game design and its age. I can almost recommend it, but I gotta be sincere here, after beating the game I felt like I had wasted my time waiting for it to get fun. \n\nIf you must buy it, wait for a sale, and if you're not enjoying the game by the time you get the Beast or Nature forms, drop it. It's the same thing the rest of the game."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501523751, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495631", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33932476", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198019715411", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1501523356, "num_games_owned": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4648}, "timestamp_updated": 1501523751, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I had loads of fun playing this game!\n\nArtwork: 11/10\nMusic: 11/10\nStory: 10/10\nGameplay: 9.8/10\n\nThe only real gripes I have for this game are that the recipe menu doesn't have any particular order to it, making finding a particular recipe a tiny bit inconvenient, and that the dumbo icecream item didn't do what it was supposed to do. Otherwise, a fantastic fun game all around."}]}
