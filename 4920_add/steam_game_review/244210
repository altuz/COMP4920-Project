I really couldn't see what the fuss was about. The real issue is that I had no wheel. Just a joystick. If you you have is a joystick, I'd stay away as it is way too sensitve to drive with even after a lot of profile tweaking.\n\nHowever, get a decent steering wheel, then this game REALLY shines! It's outstanding. The physics, the feeling of grip and the bumps through the road are sublime. I thought I had reached the pinnacle of racing nirvana, until I got a HTC Vive Headset.\n\nOMG!!!!!\n\nThis game is just out of this world in VR. It helps that the AI is pretty savvy and doesn't treat you like a bumper car. This leads to some very exciting and tight races. Can't recomend this enough.... If you have a steering wheel.
