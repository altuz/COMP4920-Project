Day and Night cycle added for immersion. \n\n+ Very distinct \u2018levels\u2019 that feel very different from one another and fun to explore. \n\n+ Puzzles that are creative and compliment the atmosphere of the world \n\n+ Fantastic soundtrack\n\nThe Average:\n+/- Though I love the puzzles there are a few that can be difficult to figure out. \n\n+/- This is not a well optimized game, even with a system that should be able to easily play it, maintaining 60fps was very difficult, often hitting 30 fps. \n\nConclusion:\nThis game brings back childhood memories. I feel that if you ever played the original Myst you would enjoy and appreciate this game so much more, however even if you didn\u2019t, this is still a great game to play if you love exploration and puzzle solving. \n", "timestamp_updated": 1500209398, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500209398, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33362569", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510763", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499476010, "steamid": "76561198074251850", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Finally, my childhood demons are quelled.\n\nThe ultimate frustrations of never getting off the island, of desperately flicking switches and pressing buttons with no success have been sated.\n\nrealMyst includes some nice tweaks, but wisely has kept the game intact, even including the option to play with the original control scheme. Both the original and free roam can be a little clunky, but the game moves much more quickly.\n\nNow that I've finally beaten this game, I can safely say MYST remains probably one of the best adventure games ever made. The style, sound design, acting and puzzle integration are something you would think every adventure game designer would have picked up on. While Myst has a reputation for being cryptic and difficult, I contend that's nostalgia talking. Lack of inventory eliminates tedious item-hunting and the frustration of throwing things at the wall until something sticks. The structure of the game immerses the player in the puzzles/realms rewarding them by revealing more and more story, rather than having a linear plot be bottlenecked by puzzles as obstacles.\n\nI would also like to give the developers of realMyst on making the in game walkthroughs spoiler-preventative, though I rarely had to consult them, given the quality of game/puzzle design.
