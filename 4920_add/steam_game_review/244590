But, I cannot.\n\nI became enamored with the game over a free weekend. The sparsely populated servers with people as new and clueless as me made the game seem fun and the three-something dollar price tag appealing. I bit. \n\nOver the course of the next week or two the population disappeared. But I was able to learn the nuances of the game and navigate the not-steep, but completely unexplained, learning curve thanks to spotty appearances of other players. This made the game seem fun all over again. Over the following weeks I became comfortable with the game and really enjoyed the few times another human was actually on a server. Some players were better, a lot were as lost as I previously was.\n\nBut in the end, I never witnessed a game larger than 2v3. Morning, noon or night. Any day of the week. Any server from West to East to Europe to Asia. There just isn't people playing this game. Perhaps some games just shouldn't be open betas or 'Early Access'? People were done and bored before it had legs. \n\nOr perhaps other issues are really holding it back.\n\nThe learning curve isn't hard but requires other players to actually learn. There's documentation of what items do or how to prime your two jumps. But nothing about the useful ways to use the items, tactics to employ, using momentum from items/jumps/enemy fire, etc. All things you can only learn with a live enemy. And I still feel like I only really learned how to play 1v1 and what tactics to use in that situation because that's all I ever got to regularly.\n\nThe devs have an idea of what they believe gameplay *should* be like if you read around the web some. In the perfect world all the servers would be 5v5 and somebody would be playing \"goalie\" and people would pass the ball. Combine those Ideas with the game that really does feel smooth and man that sounds great!\n\nBut the dead community means you'll rarely see 5v5 or in my case; never. I tried to play \"goalie\" in a 2v2 after I had read about the concept on a forum. But it's just not a logical choice to do when you aren't realistically going to stop many chances.\n\nAnd passing? That would make the game that much more interesting but the speed of the players (especially once powerups are planted) makes that a colossal undertaking to time correctly. And because of this, nobody ever expects a pass. I never witnessed anybody else even attempt one. \n\nI could go on and on. Its a great concept that is fairly polished and fun in theory. But has a dead community and suffers from a multitude of other problems. I could never recommend it even at the price I paid much less it's regular price. My twenty-plus hours of play consists of maybe five with other players and maybe three of those five hours was \"competitive\" play rather than goofing around. The vast majority of my play time was spent alone achievement hunting. The bots are awful.\n\nIf it gets lots of people suddenly, better maps (another issue I didn't delve into), and one or two other things I forgot to whine about... And it's like $0.99USD.

The opponents will be trying the same thing, and using their weapons to try and knock you you off the platforms before you get there. While you are carrying the ball you can't shoot back, and have to rely on your teammates clearing your path, or maybe a lot of like and well timed dodges.\n\nThe weapons in the game don't do damage they just push you, and there are a few variants - long range, medium range, and area/explosive types can be chosen at the start of each game, and you can switch between two modes for each as you like (in a more focused/powerful attack, or in more area affect but less impactful attack). You also have two different jump/jet pack modes - double jump and charged jump, that are attached to the weapon choices, although this could be annoying if your preferred weapon mode is attached to a jump mode that doesn't suit your playstyle). \n\nThis leads to some fun and frantic gameplay where at any moment seemingly on the way to a certain score you can go flying into the air and have to try and spot a landing, or maybe quickly try and adjust your aim and launch a \"Hail Mary\" before you get too far from the basket before falling to your doom (and then respawning a few seconds later). \n\nScoring a goal gives the scorer a seed to plant, which has three options to chose from, out of a selection of bonuses such as putting down a mortar or turret, a ramp making it easier to move towards the enemy basket, or a shield that covers most of the platform (possibly some more that I didn't notice). Each option also has a side effect of boosting the team stats a bit - making you jump higher, run slightly faster, or have more control while in the air. While an interesting addition that can significantly affect the later minutes of each game, it does seem like it makes games tend towards being more one sided as it means the team that starts well and scores early get more advantages, and are more likely to keep extending their lead.", "timestamp_updated": 1427495311, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427495311, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "8944178", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1413263774, "steamid": "76561198044514230", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Fast-paced, colourful, jumping.
