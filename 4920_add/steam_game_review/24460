The only thing that is accurately represented would be the choose-your-own-adventure style visual novel which are pretty spot on. with the choices you make directly influencing the units you will have in the battle at end. The consequences of your actions are not always clear either. forcing you at times to carefully think about your decision lest you wish to redo the \"novel\" chapter to get the ideal end.\n\nThe battles themselves play more like an Age of Empires campaign level in the sense that you progress. sometimes linearly. through a battle to complete objectives such as defending for 20 minutes or gathering forces from different parts of the battlefield to attack an enemy. \n\nThe campaign map has no free-roaming and is simply select one of the three champions' storylines and begin the next mission.\n\nAll in all, only get this if, like me, you love the series and are interested in what happened between King Arthur 1 and 2 (the story doesn't have anything at all to do with the legends of King Arthur, so if buy this solely because you love the King Arthur legends then this won't serve you any purpose.)\n\nFor five bucks (USD 5) the game is to me a 7/10. nearly an hour of entertainement for each dollar!"}, {"votes_down": 16, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1389428756, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517762", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "8658657", "votes_up": 28, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197999111837", "num_reviews": 47, "last_played": 1337929200, "num_games_owned": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 63}, "timestamp_updated": 1389428756, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Pretty disappointing attempt at a traditional RPG using the King Arthur: the Roleplaying Wargame as a source.
