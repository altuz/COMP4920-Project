Sometimes the quality is, well... ugh. Enough said. \n\n2) Animation: The animation is sub-par, today. I mostly speak of the mouth movements. Everything else is quite par.\n\n3) Lockpicking: You can skip doing it altogether.\n\n4) Issues: Now, this is an interesting con. I would have broken this one down into more than one part, but, the single word \"issues\" really sums it all up neatly. For instance, near the beginning of the game, it seemed quite impossible to be able to find a light switch in a blackened room, which prompted me to get frustrated and stop playing for months. And then, when I finally mustered up the jimmies (yes) to play it again, and use a walkthrough to figure out where the hell it was, I still couldn't find it with my cursor for quite some time. \n\nAnother instance was when trying to get around some NPCs to investigate; finnicky business, that, at times, but not awful. Just.... finnicky. You really have to play the game to know what I mean by  just saying \"Issues\". It's definitely not (it can't be) a big-budget game, by any means, though it does have it charms, and humour enough to keep me interested.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n1) Humour: The game has a good sense of humour, of which I won't spoil, because there's some fun quirkiness that you need to play into to appreciate.\n\n2) Interactivity: The game is very interactive, for a point and click, and doesn't hold your hand too much with what you're doing. Though, as I said, Lockpicking was just... yes.\n\n3) Story: The narrative is actually kind of interesting, once you... well, wrap your mind around it. Don't take this the wrong way; it's not complicated. It's just... a series of things happening, to the point of me not really remembering what sparked the narrative in the first place. But to be fair, I got frustrated and put this on hold for a few months. Maybe you would fare better..? All I remember is that I'm now framed for something I have to prove I didn't do, at this point. That's all I'll say, detail wise. That small tinge of con aside, it's amusing and not too shabby at keeping you engaged, so I take this as a positive thing.\n\n4) Puzzles: The puzzle solving and clue finding is just what it should be; involved. You really need to think hard, search around, and try every angle you can to get the solutions your looking for. Some are easier than others, but none are 100% obvious.\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nIf you like detective games, point and click, and something that feels a little rough around the edges, this is the game for you. As long as you don't mind the awkward and sometimes questionable quality of the voice acting...\n\nIf you are looking for something to keep you on your toes, immersed, and delving into the shady underbelly of society, well... not so much.\n\nDo I recommend? \nSure, why not. \n\nBut only if it's very, very, very cheap.\n(Did I add one too many again?)", "timestamp_updated": 1419761752, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419761651, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "10542962", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505190", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1382102521, "steamid": "76561198093541326", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very entertaining all-around.

The writing feels like a first draft where the second draft was just the same thing with bad attempts at slang shoehorned in.  There are multiple conversations where the word joint feels like it's being used every third word.  The acting is only slightly better than the script.  The only voice actor that felt like he belonged in a game that people charge money for is a character that you have a brief phone conversation with and (as far as I was able to get in 6 hour) never see. \nThe gameplay feels like something from the 90s.  The screen is slow to move and so is the character.  If you're in a large room with a lot of things that can be clicked on, you'd better brew some coffee because you'll be waiting a while as Del Nero slowly plods across the room.  Fortunately, while examining things in smaller rooms, you get to see him occasionally flap his arms like a chicken, but I don't think that was actually supposed to happen.\nDespite the script, the story seemed fairly good for the first little while, but occasioanally you have to make some leaps in logic to figure out where to go next, and if you save and come back or miss a line of dialogue, you may as well just throw darts at the map because there's no real way to figure out where to go next.

It's priced at $10 as of the writing of this review, and it's worth it, but getting on sale would be better!\n\nExcept for one point, the story was excellent, the feel of the game was great and very immersive in 1930s New York, the soundtrack kicked butt, the puzzles were intelligible (I knew exactly what to do most of the time, but there was just the right amount of difficulty in getting it done), and I thought the humor of the protagonist was fantastic, but I like dry humor. The connect-the-dots mechanic was pretty inventive, I thought and added a good detective story even better, IMHO. The mannequins were probably the worst part of the game because they sometimes looked or did things that weren't right, but almost all point and click adventure puzzles suffer from this. My second complaint would be all the Dannazionis that were liberally peppered throughout the game. It was a bit overused.\n\nTo address some complaints about the story being too linear or limiting in that I can't grab an object or do something now, but can later on when the story advances, I actually thought it made sense and, once again, is something most point and click adventure games do. I actually didn't mind because I viewed it as a story-focused game and that stream-lined it so that I could enjoy the story instead of getting caught up in picking up a bunch of useless stuff that I didn't need and wouldn't use.\n\nSPOILER ALERT AHEAD!\nThe one thing I didn't like about the story was the paranormal element that was thrown in regarding the girl. While she is basically the MacGuffin for Face Noir, there is this allusion to her being able to control time and dreams and that she is going to do something supernatural in the sequel. This kind of threw me out of the immersiveness that the rest of the game established so well. The supernatural really has no place in a good noir story. Read any of the hard-boiled detective writers like Raymond Chandler, Dashell Hammett, and Mickey Spillane that typified the detective/Noir writing and none of them ever got caught up in that stuff. I also thought that its introduction in the last 1/3 of the game kind of blindsided me after being so true to the hard-boiled detective genre for the first 2/3 of the game.\n\nI do look forward to Face Noir II, though.

However be wary the ending is slightly abrupt less cliff hanger more oh its over, to be continued in the next game.\n\nWhat I Liked: \n\nThe Story, It was interesting and kept me intriged even if it did get a little left feild at the end.\nThe Puzzels, nice mix.\nThe graphics, all though I would of liked it to use more of the film noir style it take from with the heavy shadows.\n\nWhat I didn't \n\nThe controls, I felt when using the mouse during the puzzels it was very on or off. The hand cursor made some of the     puzzels fiddley the arrow cursor would have been fine. The abilty to run would have great, double click to run, after walking round the secne you've visited before can really slow down the gameplay. keyboard controls would of been a god send, trying to stealth with point and clicking can be quite infuriating.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1447015579, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447015579, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "25550721", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501358", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1474128869, "steamid": "76561198006875525", "num_games_owned": 395, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game.
