Shelter is the most basic of survival games. A mom badger and your 5 babies. Will they all last to the end of the game? Keep them fed and keep them safe, darting from cover to cover as predators hunt for you.\n\n[b]Like[/b]\n\n[*]The simple gameplay. WASD, sprint, sneak, interact.\n[*]The simple missions and objectives. Stay alive, keep babies alive.\n[*]It's got that \"linear but with the illusion of a more open world\" feel that's well made.\n[*]Lovely low poly esthetic, done right.\n[*]Camera is on point, handling all sorts of tight spots and other common pitfalls.\n[*]Music and sound are great.\n[*]The baby badgers all have their unique markings and you soon assign them names. I named mine Loop, Strip, Junior, Alt, and Tri. And it matters because you need to remember which ones have fed the most recently so you know which to prioritise. Anyway, these little buggers are so expressive. With their wiggles and their squeaks, they communicate various messages such as \"there's an apple in this tree!\" and \"wait for us!\" and \"I'm hungry!\". It's perfect, and very endearing.\n\n[b]Dislike[/b]\n\n[*]That horrible low contrast, washed out look. Just why? Ugly and undermines the lovely low poly esthetic of the game.\n[*]The unbearable sadness when you inevitably lose one of your baby badgers.", "timestamp_updated": 1504994258, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504991530, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35079941", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497949", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1441144489, "steamid": "76561198166260468", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "You have to be aware that your babies may die because you missed something or did not manage to do the task.\nYes, I made some progress, but for me this game was no \"fun\", as it depressed me every time I lost a cub.
