Fights are quick and take some practice to master. The 8 weapons in the game all feel quite different and have uses that will cause you to switch between them mid fight.

What really shines through though is the great art and flavor text all around. Being Mexican, I bought this almost as soon as I  randomly stumbled upon it, and was not dissapointed. The god powers are awesome, using a macuahuitl in a beat em up is 10/10, and the unlockable cosmetic changes for the character and the weapons are all cool and well designed.\n\nThe game also features a campaign mode map, which requires you to pass a beat em up stage for every event that pops up, either furthering your imperial conquests or preventing bad stuff from screwing said conquests up. The fact that there is no way to save scum makes them feel like the stakes are high always, but since theyre reasonably short to play through, failure never feels frustrating enough to not go \"AAARGH THIS TIME IS THE TIME\" and start another.\n\nThis is a fun little beat em up, ive spent 6 hours in it and ill probably put in some more. The game itself centers around learning the enemies attack patterns and your own combo possiblities with the several available weapons. The variety in weapons and enemies is decent, and if the game wasnt so hard they would probably get old faster. That being said, my experience in beat em ups and overall skill at games is average at best, so others may find it easier.\n\nGive this game a try, its a good deal for its price", "timestamp_updated": 1505814627, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505814510, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 30, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 32}}
