I'm pretty new to Python and was previously just using sublime text and notepad++.  I was looking for an IDE and checked out the major ones, including pycharm.  Pycharm also seems to be a great package, but Wing does everything I need, has a very intuitive layout, and--best of all--is on Steam.  That means I can pay once and download and install it on all of my machines.  I love multi-platform, multi-install, single-user licenses.  This is the future.  I recently decided to install zbrush (which I have licensed and installed in Windows) on my Mac partition, and they wanted me to buy a whole separate mac license.  I was reminded that Steam and the Apple app store have totally spoiled me when it comes to my expectations around software licensing.  Bring on the easy installs and easy updates.  Kudos to Wing for releasing on Steam, and let's hope other dev tools follow suit!", "timestamp_updated": 1402680851, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1402680851, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "14395034", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519605", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1480278631, "steamid": "76561198026069277", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 55718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Beyond the outstanding features of the editor, this software is excellent on two fronts:\n\n1) It integrated with Autodesk Maya perfectly, on the very first try, no issues what-so-ever.\n2) The tech support is phenomenal.\n\nI mostly use the software to develop python helper scripts for Maya and Nuke, and while the interface is touch on the ugly side, the functionality of WingIDE is far better than any other option I have tried (Notepad++, Pycharm, and Sublime). I also use Eclipse for Python/C/C++ dev at work, and god how I wish it had the ease of use that WingIDE does.  Eclipse has a lot of setup, where WingIDE just works.  \n\nWhat put me over the top to fully recommend this software is the tech support. They are phenomenal. I had a problem with the software not finding a license after the most recent update on steam, I sent an email to thier tech support and got a response almost immediately. They solved my issue and they were a joy to deal with. This is the best cutomer support experience I have had from anyone ever.\n\nPros:\n+ Very powerful, fully featured python IDE.\n+ Extremetly easy to setup and integrate with various 3D software packages.\n+ Probably the best customer support on the planet.\n\nCons:\n- The interface is need of a facelift (it's a little on the ugly side).", "timestamp_updated": 1423437631, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423433748, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "13212055", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510514", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499931615, "steamid": "76561198061352821", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Easy to use, good debugging options and nice UI, direct Python Reference, good project managment.

I got a response in under 24 hours, which is a great sign of an engaged dev.  He suggested that the problem was likely due to security software blocking application access to the system clipboard, and mentioned webroot by name, which I have.  The solution turns out to be to allow the wingware app to access the clipboard in webroot (or other security software) configuration.\n\nI made the change and now I can paste in the wingware editor.  Due to this excellent support response by Wingware, I am updating my review to \"recommend\", although it is still a little frustrating that this issue exists:  other apps are able to use the clipboard without needing an exception in security software policy.\n\nBut all software has little issues, and not all companies have this kind of customer focus and dedication to their product.  Now I am excited about Wingware again, and am looking forward to checking out all it's good qualities!  :-)\n\n20150615:\nPasting text (Ctrl-V) into the code edit window does not work by default on Windows 7.  This is a pretty serious failing of basic UI functionality.  Ctrl-X \"cut\" operation works, and I can Ctrl-C copy text *from* the code edit window and paste elsewhere (like notepad++ for example) but I can't paste *into* the code edit window.  I also tried to paste by clicking Edit > Paste with the mouse, but that doesn't work either.  Weird...
