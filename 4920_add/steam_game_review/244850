Back then, the game was very stable; I could spend hours working to survive while slowly taking apart my wrecked starting ship and rebuilding it into something of my own design. When they added an endless, procedurally generated universe complete with abandoned ships and stations to find, I couldn't have been happier. I lost countless hours to Space Engineers and never looked back.\n\nAnd then the game's community rallied for the developers to add planets. The idea of adding planets to the game was never part of the original plan, and it took months to force them to exist and work in an engine that wasn't designed for it. I don't know if this was really the tipping point, but it certainly feels like it on looking back.\n\nThe game, as it stands, is nearly unplayable due to the number of bugs that have been introduced in ever growing numbers. There's no reason to bother with Survival Mode any longer, because the game will happily destroy whatever you've spent hours building for no known reason. Features like pistons and rotors will be perfectly stable one day, and then rip your ship apart from the inside the next time you load your save. Wheels and rotors need you to spend hours tweaking their settings in-game, and even after that they still don't work correctly.\n\nKeen Software House decided the best way to continue work on their product was to.. nickel and dime the playerbase. Where in games like Factorio, playing older versions are simply an option in a drop-down menu in the \"betas\" tab for the game. In Space Engineers, they expect you to pay $9.99 for the \"deluxe edition,\" which lets you play the original creative-only game as it was when it first hit Steam. And now, as of writing this review, they've decided to start selling \"engineer skins\" in pieces, with each of the four pieces costing players anywhere from $1.49 to $2.49.\n\nI've lost all hope for this game. Endless Early Access shenanigans where every Thursday the update would claim to fix bugs and issues only for the game forums and subreddit to say that no, the bugs are still there, and have somehow gotten even worse. But Keen would rather try and squeeze more money out of their playerbase than actually knuckle-down and fix their game so that people can play what they bought into.\n\nI have over 300 hours of play time for this game, most of which were spent during the early days after Survival Mode was added, some of the most fun I've had in any survival-crafting game.

You just get lots of toys ot play with some of which are armor, but others have lots of interesting functions like sensors, cameras, timers etc. There's even a block for writing your own programs. It's also nice that there's an OK physics system, so you can crash things and it's interesting. You can spend a very long time perfecting your mining and refining operations, transports, and fighting ships, which is very satisfying.\n\nThe bad news is that the game is too buggy and clunky. A lot of the time while designing is wasted on trying to figure out how menus work, or finding out that you can't do something which you should be able to, so your designs can't work.  (eg for some ofjects the timer block doesn't have separate on and off option for something, only on / off, unnecessarily limiting what you can do.) Some of the simplest things like saving a design are also too clunky (esp in survival). More importantly you might start working on great designs with moving parts just to realise, all those are effectively too buggy to be useable. (rotors, pistons) Even worse, sometimes major updates cause existing designs to stop functioning by mistake (happened to me with merge blocks). This just ruins the fun.\n\nA minor issue is that there's not a lot to do with your designs. The AI is pretty bad and boring in terms of fighting so you can't make good use of some of your designs, and other than there's just mining and refining and moving from one place to another. You have  to set your own goals. This is not necessarily a big problem though as the design itself and pushing boundaries could be the goal like in KSP.\n\nNote: I have only played single player.", "timestamp_updated": 1505923150, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "7", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505923023, "votes_down": 20}, {"recommendationid": "34959199", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 33, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509703", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503616016, "steamid": "76561197996731408", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 103909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 6, "review": "I've been following this games development for years, and it really pains me to have to write a negative review.  It started out with an endless amount of solid potential, that has slowly been snuffed out bit by bit with each update.  Widely requested features have for the most part been ignored, or implemented poorly.  The game has struggled with the same infuriating bugs constantly, in spite of the Dev's weekly cries of \n     \"Honestly, we fixed it for real this time\".\n     Most disappointing is this games glaring lack of content and purpose.  So much so that I can barely bring myself to call it a game at all.  There is no plot. There is no antagonist, or quest to overcome.  The setting is dry and artificial, with oceans of ice existing on seemingly warm planets (they didn't want to spend time coding water) who stand stagnant in an endless expanse of evenly spaced,  ludicrously shaped asteroids (they are truly immersion breaking).  The lack of functional multiplayer or implemented AI (they expect the players to code it in themselves), makes the prospect of ship combat completely nonexistent. \n     If I where to summarize the experience, I would liken this game to playing with broken legos alone in space.

Planets, gameplay functionalities, script...\n- space is too empty, it need some kind of AI, mobs, maybe PNJ, traders, pirates... Aggressive drones are not enough.\n- sometimes feel pretty slow in regard of it's progress.

It is more than that.\nOriginally, it was just e game where you build space ships in creative and fight. EA was supposed to be used for tweaking and some small additions. But in regard of the community's enthousiasm for the game, they decided to add more and more things, from basic survival mod to planet, including ship pressurization.\n\nThis is a fantastic game, but not for every-one. It is all about creativity and/or PvP fights, and eventually Role Play.\nIt also had a heavy reliance on mods. There is hundreds of them and modding the game is an encouraged practice. Best and most popular mods are even sometimes directly integrated in base game in order to make them available to everyone.\n\nBut beyond that, the game is empty. Actual objectives are bug-fixing, optimization.\nDevs also stated they are working on wheeled vehicle rework and surviving mod improvement.\n\nSo if you are looking for a simple game, adventure game, easy craft or anything like that, don't buy Space Engineer, it will made you upset in a mater of hours.
