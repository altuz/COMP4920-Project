I am personally a big fan of the genre, and can't seem to get enough of new versions of the game, so keep that in mind for the review.\n\nIt does a lot to set itself apart from the others.  The level design is new enough to provide newer experiences and challenges.  The music matches the pacing of the game to keep it fresh and exciting.  The controls are tight and responsive like other games in the genre.  The leaderboards actually work properly to provide replayability.\n\nIf you like Super Meat Boy style games, I'd recommend this one too.

Murder the pope, defeat the Groove Wizard, and shake your booty like the music won't stop in a refreshing challenge for veterans of the genre.\n\nPlay it loud, the music makes the game. The well-composed tracks leave just enough room for the gameplay to assume the limelight, with the DLC worth the purchase for the soundtrack alone. \n\nCombined with the rapid respawn, the pulsating rhythms of the game give no time to recover and keep you playing through dozens (sometimes hundreds) of attempts to reach the next goal. Some of the stages pose a real challenge to even seasoned gamers, although checkpoints are abundant and the maps are relatively short. I was able to finish all stages in the main game and DLC in 25 hours of gameplay, with most completable within a few to ten minutes.\n\nElectronic Super Joy is a [i]feeling[/i] that delivers an immersive platformer experience to players who can get their groove on.", "timestamp_updated": 1505348787, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505348355, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34945113", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505549662, "steamid": "76561198084902227", "num_games_owned": 1030, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "best soundtrack ever, oh yeeeeeeeeeeeeeah", "timestamp_updated": 1505380756, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505380756, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35225739", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500512242, "steamid": "76561198062770853", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Music: Awesome\nLevels: Awesome\nGameplay: Awesome\nGame: hard af", "timestamp_updated": 1506445076, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506445076, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35092058", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498510", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505940453, "steamid": "76561197993004333", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I like platformers but not this one.
