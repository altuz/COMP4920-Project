The player usually takes control of an aircraft (or spacecraft) to do this, and today, we define this sub-genre as the \"Schmup\" (shoot-em-up).  These games were such a staple of gaming's earlier developments that you can see thier DNA now infused with many modern games.  The problem is that the more pure form of vertical and horizontal scrolling shooters doesn't seem to surface very often anymore.  The more recent release of Radiant Silvergun in the x-box live marketplace makes up for some of this, but the modern shoot-em up world is still barren!  \n\nEnter Velocity Ultra-- possibly the most clever evolution of the classic shooter genre, since Ikaruga.  This game takes the conventional shoot-em-up, adds an excellent teleportation system, throws you into it's more than fifty mini-playgrounds, \nand challenges you to adapt to them while meeting certain requirements.  Those that find an affinity with this game, as I have, won't be able to stop until they've gotten a gold medal in every stage.  \n\nThe graphics are more than adequate, and have a consistent style to them that doesn't confuse the eyes or get in the way of the gameplay mechanic.  The comic-like art in between missions is fun to look at, and serves as a throwback to the \"barely-there\" style of storytelling that most shoot-em-ups adhere to.  Why tease the player with too much story when all that'll be needed is very twitchy hands?  The comic-frames more than suffice.  Music is above average techno (I understand that electronic music consists of multiple sub-generes, but \"techno\" seems to fit the profile here), and carries the game's pace nicely.  Controls are fluid and responsive, with only the occasional failed teleportation to make the player question his or her controller.  And even then, practice makes perfect is the bread & butter of this game, and evidences it's tight gameplay.  I'm curious as to how the controls feel in the Vita original, and I'm even more curious to see how curve studios might integrate the teleportation controls in to IOS, or other mobile devices.  \n\nBuy this game.  It's an evolution of one of the most classic genres of video gaming, and it does what it does very well.  The price is certainly right, and we need to encourage more development of games in this genre!  Oh, and did I mention the game has a built in calculator, as well as the game Mine-sweeper?  Does this enhance the experience?  No!  Is it awesome?

Where many shmup's difficulty stems from bullet hell, Velocity\u00aeUltra's challenge comes from fast pace manuvering. The game's fluid and tight mechanics are its stong point. However, this is what will make or break you during your play. In other words, it's a perfectionist type of game.

It boasts a cartoonish art style which is a nice touch, offering a different atmosphere than most shmups. However, It can be somewhat repetetive.

Unfortunately, like all puzzle shmups (excluding a particularly awesome boss sequence in Shikigami no Shiro II), the shmupping(?) falls a bit flat.  Ikaruga fares a bit better in this regard with the awesome boss battles but Ikaruga not only sucks as a shmup (enemies never aim at you, they just spray patterns, everything is pre-set and once you get the hang of it every game will be the exact same) but it sucks as a bland match-three puzzler.  If you want a good shmup I would generally avoid Steam because even the ones with more praise such as Jamestown are not that good (fine, if you really want one maybe try Ether Vapor Re-master) so graduate to the Sega Saturn or at least download a good version of Shmupmame.  Now, it may sound like I'm bashing the game, but in reality I'm just very long-winded; the puzzle half of this game rocks!  The levels are tight and well thought out, the controls respond perfectly, and there are various techniques to master if you want to improve your time and score throughout all 50 levels.  The shmup aspect does fit in such a way that it makes what are already complicated puzzles more stressful and constrained adding to the challenge.  There are neat frames shown before missions giving you the gist of what is occurring in the level and the music is your standard techno affair but done better than most.  My two largest complaints so far are that the leader-board scores seem broken (or I'm just the worst player ever) and the screen tears at the top quite frequently.  I'm only eleven levels in and those eleven levels did not take me very long but the difficulty is starting to ramp up to a point that I'm being genuinely challenged which, for being only a fifth of the way in, is awesome and leads me to believe that there should be some decent longevity to the game, especially for its genre.

Throwing powerful bombs in every direction is as easy as flicking the right stick, yet the less-powerful main guns have their place. Every stage in Velocity is designed like a puzzle, with switches to hit in a certain order, enemies to kill, and civilian pods to rescue. A single miss-placed bomb can reset the switches, while the main guns take far more shots to activate a switch.\n\nSwitches and shmups wouldn't seem fun on paper, but Velocity includes a teleportation feature that makes missing a switch far less punishing than it would be otherwise. In certain levels, you can place a limited number of checkpoints to allow you to hop between switches with ease. The teleportation isn't limited to the checkpoints, however, as you are also free to teleport into any open space you can see.\n\nThe combination of the shooting, switches, and teleportation with a screen that constantly scrolls upwards (you're always forced to go forwards, so without the teleport you could never move back) seems overwhelming. However, Velocity does a very good job with pacing. As someone who is usually terrible at these kinds of games, I was surprised how quickly and easily I got into the game. I'll probably never get a handle on all the systems in play, but I'm definitely having fun.\n\nI only have two issues with the game.
