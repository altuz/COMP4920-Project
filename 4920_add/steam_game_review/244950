The sound design and music are great and create a very relaxed atmosphere that doesn't distract you from the puzzle but rather draws you in.\n\nMy main complaint would be that the parts where you use the rainbow spirit to flip the screen around can feel a little tedious and try-fail try-fail sometimes.
