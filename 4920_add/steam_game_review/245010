Think tomb raider 1 with the platforming replaced with maze navigation and handling locked doors and spawning monsters. Expect traps. \n\nOutstanding Issues:\n-Unintuitive control scheme\n-No camera control - camera jitters uncomfortably often\n-Monsters spawn all around you as you explore, sometimes being invisible due to the camera\n-Constantly running into locked doors in a maze-like environment with limited assets that often look repetitive\n-Clunky combat, that at least has a nice kinetic feel to it but is hard to control, and you die fast", "timestamp_updated": 1502776915, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502776890, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 12, "total_reviews": 28}}
