I think I paid $5 or under while it was on sale, and I feel that that's a fair price. The game, while it has replay value to reach different story outcomes, only lasts about 1.5-2 hours on the story mode playthrough. You could probably squeeze 5-10 hours out of it (with the replays), depending on how much you enjoy the game and your play style.\n\nThe choices you have to make affect the way the story flows, but it's basically like an interactive visual novel. I was satisfied with my first playthrough and ending and will probably replay another story mode to screw everything up, and then play once more through the stealth mode just to experience it.\n\nI didn't notice any bugs and the navigation is simple (mostly due to how small the setting is - you are confined to a single two-story house). I was pleased with the art style and found the setting to be quite nice, although I do wish the ocean was textured better (while it blends with the art style, it does look a bit stagnant). Some tree movements (blowing in the wind, or pine needles falling) and ocean water movement would have been a welcome addition. The house also felt a bit empty for its size, but it didn't take away from the gameplay at all.\n\nOverall, it's a nice story and experience on a sale price, but I wouldn't recommend getting it for full price.", "timestamp_updated": 1505781283, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505781207, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35307377", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503106", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506706465, "steamid": "76561198058002503", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Unfortunately, I don't recommend this game. Though the basic idea is charming, it is so redundant. I was expecting something compelling, a psychological thriller in which you have to draw conclusions from details and behaviours. But no, the characters barely interact with each other, you just wander in the house, finding letters, journals and notes in order to find out what are their struggles, you read their memories to discover what they are longing for, and then you propose a solution. Either way, someone is unhappy. My story didn\u2019t end so well, in fact.
