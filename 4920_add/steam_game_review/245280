At first glance, it looked to me like any other puzzle platformer hack'n'slash. Having grown up on Legend of Zelda and Prince of Persia, I love that kind of thing, so I thought I would give it a try.  I got it on sale for $5, but I wouldn't consider it overpriced at $20.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly straightforward with mostly linear maps; you are very unlikely to get lost.  The combat is mostly simple (with a few twists during boss fights that make you think a little bit) but very satisfying, with excellent combat animation.  The combat and platform puzzles are enjoyable, but not the reason this game is a hidden jewel.  What really make this game great are the little details, the breathtaking visuals, and the lifelike performances that make the game come alive.\n\nThe two lead characters, Monkey and Tripitaka (Trip) are voiced by Andy Serkis and Lindsey Shaw.  They both provided motion capture, so their characters' motions and facial expressions are grippingly real.  The relationship they develop over the course of the game is powerful and believable, and where I generally hate having a companion forced on me in a game (they almost always feel in-the-way), these characters work together so well.  I found myself terrified of failing Trip (and consequently dying), especially when first confronting a Dog.  Her AI worked for me and never felt intrusive while I fought mechs as Monkey, and their teamwork made their relationship seem more profound. \n\nAll sorts of little details made this game come alive for me.  The way Monkey often has to catch his breath after a mech fight makes him feel more like a person than an action hero.  Trip is often terrified - of the mechs, of the constant threat of death - but pushes herself forward with the hope of reuniting with her people.  The scenery, especially during the early game set in a post-apocalyptic NYC - not dead and brown and rusty but overgrown, green and vibrant - was spectacular.\n\nNot everyone will love this game the way I do.  It is not very long and could be finished in about 10 hours, give or take a few based on personal skill, difficulty level, and how much you explore for collectibles.  The maps are linear, which some people don't care for.  The combat can feel repetitive, especially if you mash your basic attack on easy difficulty.  The ending seems to be hit or miss for most people.\n\nBut if you could appreciate believable characters with strong chemistry, beautiful scenery and a strong, compelling story, consider giving it a shot.  If you happen to see it on sale for the price of a latte, it is absolutley worth it.", "timestamp_updated": 1504824556, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504824556, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35034820", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505785200, "steamid": "76561198071626471", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a solid game and there's really no reason not to buy it at a great offer deal in my opinon.\nThe game is quite enjoyable, the combat system is good though it might take some time to get used to... it's not good to mash button (particularly on hard).\nThere were no big issues or glitches, a minor thing here and there... maybe minor dialogue mistakes (like using names before introducing themselves) or some random audio bug that corrects itself in no time.\nWhat can be a little bit annoying, especially if you are hunting for achievements.... is that you cannot skip the non-cinematic scenes. At least you can select chapters, but it still can get a bit annoying when repeating.\nDid i say i really enjoyed the voice acting on this one? =P\n\nBtw, if you are hunting for orbs.... you have to actually be on the constant lookout for any orbs that may be hidden or that you may miss. Some missions due to their progression will make it easy to miss orbs just because you are on the clock for the objective trying to make it in time, so while it is possible.... it's highly unlikely you'll be able to collect all orbs in one try (without a guide at least).\nIf you are hunting for orbs, you may find these two tips useful: 1) Sometimes the camera will make it hard for you to check the area for orbs, if you use the aim mode you can bypass that and look anywhere you want. 2) Bear in mind that orbs don't actually save all the time when you pick em, the important part of this is if you die... there are parts where it happened to me that after dying some orbs that i couldn't get back to were \"lost\" and had to get them in a second try.\n\nHave fun!\nCheers", "timestamp_updated": 1505688859, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505688859, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35011351", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504902", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506386105, "steamid": "76561198193234735", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 78}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Literally only about 16 minutes in, and let's just say i'm glad I got it on sale.

It desperatly needs enemy lock on.  I used stun for multiple enemies and when I tried to finish one of them it would hop back and forth hitting each of them so neither one of them was killed at the end of the stun. \n\n The difficulty varies wildly, I played about an hour on normal and it was way too easy so went to hard and started over, I'm about seven hours in and it's taking numerous (7-10) tries to get through waves that occur, and most if not all deaths are camera related.  There is no way to change difficulty mid game either.\n\n The difficulty along with the broken camera make it an extreme effort to stick with this game, not sure I'll be able to do it, probably just watch it on YouTube.  I'd still reccomend it on normal difficulty though because I'm sure the camera won't be enough to make some wave battles that difficult that you quit the game for good. \n\nUpdate, about an hour after writing this there is a hoverboard chase scene that is the most unnecessary, HORRIBLE controlling piece of garbage I've played in a Loooong time.
