Now without the hassle of having to run the whole thing in DOSBox!\n\nPros:\n - Genuinely disturbing story content focused around five miserable humans and the AI who hates them.\n - Some flexilibity in how to advance the game. Moral choices that steer the direction of each episode.\n - Art style that holds up pretty well despite its 20+ year age.\n - Episodes are short, but leave an impact. The game does not overstay its welcome.\n\nCons:\n - Clunky adventure game interface.\n - Typical adventure game puzzle logic, now with the added benefit of allowing you to make mistakes that doom your attempt at completing an episode.\n - Dated MIDI music distracts from horror atmosphere.\n\nMinor Gripe:\n - No main menu. To load a game, you have to escape through the introduction, wait for AM to ask who will go first, then load from that menu.\n\nWould Recommend To: Fans of games like Dark Seed, Harvester, Phantasmagoria or 7th Guest. Horror game fans who feel like games such as \"Five Nights at Freddie's\" miss the point. Fans of surreal, dark media who aren't ashamed to pull up a walkthrough once in a while.", "timestamp_updated": 1505890894, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505890894, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 419, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 46, "total_reviews": 465}}
