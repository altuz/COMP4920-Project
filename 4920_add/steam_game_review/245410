Also, this was within the last year, I wasn't alive when these games came out originally.\n\nBane of the Cosmic Forge is something pretty unlike any other cRPG I've ever played. Sure, it looks uglier than sin and the character design has aged like shit and the story is complete nonsense BUT! The dungeon design, while really brutal in the early-going, consistently surprised me. Essentially the whole game takes place in a single mega-dungeon type area with several different subsections. The design of these individual subsections and the way they wove together at times was clearly the work of a group of designers who knew what they were doing. Once you've got a handle on the mechanics of this game, exploring these areas becomes so much fun. Some of the puzzles were pretty obtuse if you werent drawing a map (or unless, like me, you cheated and used the automap mod) but this is the age of information and if google's at hand you'll be fine, there's tons of resources for this game.\n\nThe character creation in this game is pretty cute, you have to roll high in specific stats to qualify for individual classes, like so many cRPGs from this time. The thing is, as you level up your stats will advance and you can actually switch to these classes at level 1 later on, while keeping all of your skills, which is a neat feature.\n\nHonestly though, having played through a good chunk of this game's frankly incredible sequel, Wizardry 7, I can't say that this one is too worth playing. There's one tileset, the sound sucks (I just muted it and listened to podcasts while I played), and after a while the tedium does start to set in. Still, coming out the other end of it is pretty rewarding (even if the final boss that I experienced was kinda lackluster). \n\nBasically, it's pretty good, pick it up if you already have any interest in DOS cRPGs, and the ability to import your characters into Wizardry 7 with some of the neater equipment from this game is fun. If you get bored of this one though, it's packaged with its sequel which just takes all of its ideas and improves on them, with several more tileset and beautiful VGA pixel art. Plus it's dirt cheap so if you don't like it or it takes you a while and a few tries to even play the damn thing, like me, you're not losing too much.", "timestamp_updated": 1503176078, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503174016, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34253991", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504006", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504353976, "steamid": "76561198078582252", "num_games_owned": 852, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's wizardry 6/7 they have built a world that most CRPGs would kill for pure dungeon crawling.
