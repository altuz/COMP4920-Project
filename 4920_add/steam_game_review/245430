Too bad we can't have Gold's automap and sound effects.

There are quite some races and character classes to chose from (ofc the classes depends on what stats do you \"role\") from the standart Warriors to the sneaky ninjas you can find classes for any role (altough you have to be lucky to be abble to make a ninja or anything more complicated  from the start othervise you will have to get certain statistics and then you can change the character's class). I have to admit I wasn't abble to finnish the game because it's hard (like Dark Souls level hard) and I don't have time for that sadly, but what i experienced from this game so far it's pure gold. Every character class is some what different and it's simply impossible to make a totaly same character twice. It is full of content, challange, exploration (geting lost in the forest because you can't see anything...). Also it had an awsome combat system (which is sometime unfair, but still awsome) that every gamer who ever played a game like this will completly understand and enjoy.\n\nIn conclusion this game would be a solid [b]8.4/10[/b] for me.\n[b]HIGHLY RECOMMENDED[/b]", "timestamp_updated": 1503568527, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503568527, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 41, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 43}}
