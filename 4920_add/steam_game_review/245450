I remember always wanting to play these old style RPGs when I was younger but I never had the patience for them. I felt like I could enjoy them more now where as a child, I just felt like the game was unfair and I couldn't understand why. And while I wanted Grimoire, I didn't want to pay that price. And then I found Wizardry 8, a game from a tried and true series and said, what the hell.\nI tried 6 and 7 first. I wasn't a fan. Some things don't age well and the aid of nostalgia glasses don't help. They were just too outdated and honestly, the graphics were too pixelated and I had a really hard time reading them. The games literally hurt my eyes to look at. And I thought they were too clunky. I just didn't have a whole lot of fun in the short time that I did play them, so they got returned. But Wizardry 8 however, was a different story.\nThis game is closing in fast on 20 years old and even though it looks like it (albiet in a charming early 3d way), it sure doesn't feel like it. The frame rate is surprisingly smooth for something of this age. The sound is very high quality and the dungeon layout is beautiful. \nThe controls are a little odd and the default key layout is strange, but nothing huge to complain about. It's a minor gripe at best.\nThis game truly holds up after all this time and still runs wonderfully on modern systems. Unlike it's predecessors, Wizardry 8 has aged gracefully. It shows us that modern, phot-realistic graphics do not always make the game.", "timestamp_updated": 1502389628, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502389628, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34064583", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500095", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502051329, "steamid": "76561198023221061", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Wait, you dont own this game yet?!\nThen pick it up, its one* of the best party RPGs\n\n*needs player patientce since amount of random encounters can hold you in one spot for an hour\n", "timestamp_updated": 1502040206, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502040206, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34059154", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499818", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1489138629, "steamid": "76561198040532093", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fantastic Old School RPG.

Can't go wrong with that, right?\n\nIt turns out that you can. I wrongly assumed that since Wizardry was a little newer than Might and Magic it'd control better, work better. But instead it's like playing a game in molasses.\n\nI'm seven hours in and I feel like I haven't done anything because every combat grinds on for ten minutes while you sit twiddling your thumbs and it auto plays out.
