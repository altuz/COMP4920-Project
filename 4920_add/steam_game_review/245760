Although that did suck ass, i think if this studio was given more time and ideas they would've made something amazing. Its got amazing quality but dull quantity.\nOnly 2 modes. An averge amount of characters. Just so barebones. This game would've been great had they had more time to develop the idea they were clearly going for.\nAlso i think in my opinon its stupid how when you go prime mode you keep your characters. It makes the supply crates absolutely useless because lets be honest tf fans, we're only here really for a good game and the transformer designs. First day of playing its fun as hell but when you unlock everything, theres just no reason to go back to it. Didn't anyone at this game studio even consider the icredibly terrible replay value?!\nAlso story was okay but could've been so much more and that pisses me off. How about you let us play the charaters you selected for each mission and then when you complete it you can maybe play as your escalation characters in singleplayer. Just something more! This games just so sad like a homeless person. Someone who could've bben so much more :(\nThis game doesn't anger me. Just saddens me but don't let this be death of third person shooter transformer games coz i hate that mobile strategy game. transformers is not meant for strategy or at least even if it is, strategy games are so ovversaturated in mobile gaming", "timestamp_updated": 1504955781, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504955781, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 86, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 158, "total_reviews": 244}}
