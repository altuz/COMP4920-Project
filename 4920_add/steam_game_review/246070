Unfortunately, each new concept is tossed at you as a one-off novelty that is quickly replaced with the next step, which really detracts from the exploration of the concepts.\n\nBefore long, you are given incredible power to really delve deep into how each thing works... to the point where you can crash the game. Over and over. Trial and error becomes a test in monotony as you sometimes lock-up the game and have to reload. On occasion, it can be hard to tell if it's due to something you caused or a bug in the game (and trust me, there are definitely bugs). And boy oh boy, let's hope you have experience in reading LUA, because I sure didn't and I found some of the puzzles incredibly obtuse to solve (I am an intermediate programmer, otherwise).\n\nI did find that, shortly after the halfway point, my patience for solving some of the puzzles wore thin and my investment did not match the feeling of achievement anymore. I'd end up referring to a walkthrough after a few minutes of skimming over a bunch of confusing syntax. This game is definitely not a tool to learn programming through -- it will only strike fear and apprehension into the hearts of novices.\n\nAlso, there are way too many ledges to accidentally walk off in this game. And the game likes respawning you right on the tip of the edge so that you'll almost instantly fall again if you're not pressing in a direction away from the edge. Frustration mounts.\n\nI really wanted to like this game because I love the idea.
