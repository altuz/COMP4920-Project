Combat is basically like xcom. However, the other portion is basically just a huge eugenics program lol, where you assign characters to a keep, to rule and marry them off to another character which in return produces your children and soldiers. The game spans over I think 300ish years and is very replayable in my opinion.", "timestamp_updated": 1505297087, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505188364, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34873762", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505087856, "steamid": "76561198047524156", "num_games_owned": 462, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 1052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game was very interesting and I really enjoyed playing it. I loved the bloodlines, class mixing, researching, artifacts being passed down, events, and the tactical battles. It was a bit tedious managing replacing dying reagents, spouses, scholars, and standard bearers when you have all the buildings built. It took about 15 hours to complete one game on normal. Will be a long time before I want to play another.\n\nWould definitely buy a sequel.", "timestamp_updated": 1505089033, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505089033, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35098664", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1479574179, "steamid": "76561197968652293", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Painfully repetitive and dull, I wish this game were better.
