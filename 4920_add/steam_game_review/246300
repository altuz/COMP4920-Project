This game has been in my library since 2012 and is a perfect example of the early access beast rearing its ugly head.\n\nIt was started by a 17 year old which I was quite impressed with at first. But that teenager has since married and started a family. \n\nWe have waited patiently for 5 years to see some sort of meaningful progress on this game and there really hasn't been much at all. I REALLY wanted to believe in this project. But I just can't lie to myself about it anymore. It feels like it has become abandonware at this point.\n\nThere are always promises of big changes coming, but after 5 years most people still can't make it beyond the beginning area. That's pretty alarming.\n\nUpdates come every 6 months at best(the last major update was Dec 2016) and change very little about the game. Aside from updating to Unreal 4 engine, the only real changes that have been made are only tweaks of the current system. \n\nJudging by what he's said on the forums, he has a lot on his plate so he probably shouldn't keep stringing people along or charging $10 for a game that he doesn't have time for anymore. In my opinion(and I expect there are some who will disagree which is fine), he should just scrap the project entirely or hand it to somebody who actually has time to develop it and move on with his life. \n\nThat being said, if you are interested in a 5 year old early access game that only gets updated twice a year, go for it!", "timestamp_updated": 1500386626, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499605768, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "34477733", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489948", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503020173, "steamid": "76561198047486812", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Its fun for about 5 minutes, then it gets really fucking boring.
