And... Let me just tell you a story.\nI was playing perfection. The first few levels were actually kinda fun! It was like a super crappy puzzle game that was just kinda good for the first two or three levels. I then got to the levels where you have to start rotating the object... It was probably the most painful and miserable moment of my whole life... I felt blood dripping from my fingers. It was all over my keyboard. I then took a knife and started to chop at my moniter... I just couldn`t simply turn off my moniter becasue I knew when i went ahead and turned it back on, Perfection would be there. To fix this problem. I took a magnet and shoved it inside my tower, onto my harddrive destroying it and any evidence of me ever playing Perfection. I then made this new steam account. It was tempting to go back on the store and buy that stupid game again. I tried to stop myself. I even considered suicide. But nothing could stop me. It was like being addicted to herione. I started playing I only made it 14 minutes before I collapsed on the floor. An ambulance came to save me after my neigbours saw that I never came out of my house for at least 4 weeks. I was just on the floor twitching. They managed to bring me back to life. All I had to do was play a small amount of Perfection every day to create a antibody to this thing that they call a game. Just recently I went one day without playing Perfection. It was very painful. I could feel my skin rolling up and rotting as if I was dead but still alive. If you see me now, I don`t even look human. All I look like is a pile of flesh. My heart seemed to have stopped the day I started playing perfection. I`m DEAD INSIDE! But still some sort of living being on the outside.\n\nIf you don`t want to be like me, never lay your eyes on this game. Don`t even consider buying. Look at the page and turn away. This is a warning. I`m Sorry to all the people that have already bought the game. DON`T BUY THIS GAME!
