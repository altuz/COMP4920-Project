I went to sleep, dreamt about playing Kingdom Rush and then played about 4 more hours trying to beat the end game content before work the next day (didn't even make a dent). Definitely play this if you love tower defense games. It starts off easy but it definitely gets much harder. The last 4 maps had me really stumped but the feeling you get when you win makes it wooooorth it. I'm already planning on buying the rest of the series.", "timestamp_updated": 1506221258, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506221030, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1611, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "review_score": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 62, "total_reviews": 1673}}
