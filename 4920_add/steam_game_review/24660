Its a steal at 7 euro as you can use all the assets in your own routes too. Before i bought it I was hessitant because of all the bad revieuw this got but its great its the modeltrain track you always dreamt of as a kid only virtual so it gathers no dust and doesnt need an extra room in your house.
