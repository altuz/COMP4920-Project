Set in an uncharted area of the Alpine mountain range, players assume the role of a native bird who uncovers the remains of an ancient civilisation.\n\nSecrets of Raetikon uses an open world environment with a heavy emphasis on exploration, item collection and puzzle solving. The primary objective is to retrieve seven mysterious shard fragments and return them to a central location. Each piece is protected by a combination of hostile wildlife, hazardous surroundings and environmental based puzzles.\n\nIn theory the game world is open plan, allowing the player to free roam and collect shard fragments in any order they like. However in practice, the routes you take often require you to complete a puzzle before you can proceed further, which ultimately results in a much more linear gameplay experience. There is no in-game map so players must keep track of their route themselves.\n\nSecrets of Raetikon uses a simple control scheme and your bird protagonist handles responsively enough. It does a particularly good job at conveying a sense of flying by utilising wide open aerial spaces and wind currents to help propel you faster through the sky. There are hostile animals which present some light combat elements, but there is more of a focus on evasion and retaliation through indirect means.\n\nThere is a decent amount of interactivity built into the game world. The puzzles revolve around physics based gameplay, usually requiring you to manipulate a mechanism or assemble a statue in a jigsaw piece fashion. These concepts initially feel quite novel and satisfying to solve, however they really are quite simplistic and do become a bit repetitive by the end.\n\nGraphically is where Secrets of Raetikon truly shines. It uses a 2D polygonal art style which has a paper craft / origami look to it. It combines bold shapes with strikingly vivid colours to create a genuinely unique and appealing aesthetic. The game also conveys a good sense of scale by occasionally panning the camera angle back to reveal large background canvases set against your tiny protagonist. The soundtrack also deserves an honourable mention as it provides some nice instrumental tracks which help provide a theme to each territory.\n\nWith regards to storyline, there is no real overarching plot. The only slight hints at lore are presented in the form of rune stones which are written in a coded language. Runic letters are hidden throughout the game which will enable you to transcribe the cyphers. However, these rune stones reveal so little in the way of story that it becomes a large investment for such a small return. The ending scene is also an enormous disappointment, the tone of which feels counter intuitive to everything else portrayed in the game.\n\nOverall, Secrets of Raetikon is an entertaining enough game with highlights in its art style and soundtrack. It is a short diversion which should only take a few hours to complete. It does have some definite flaws and weaknesses which are hard to overlook but I personally feel that there is still enough enjoyable content here to warrant a positive recommendation.", "timestamp_updated": 1505059083, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505049251, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 90, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 35, "total_reviews": 125}}
