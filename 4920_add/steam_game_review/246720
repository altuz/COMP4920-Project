I could understand some of the points others were making and I went into the game worried about gameplay, graphics, and story; but I pleasently surprised.\n\nThere were a few bugs here and there, but it looks like the developer is taking care of them as they find them.  This would explain not encountering some of the bugs others had previously mentioned.  As time goes on, I am sure there will be little to none to speak of.\n\nThe graphics, although not up to the quality of some of the larger titles, has character and style.  It was actually an enjoyable break from the drab color-palatte of larger games.  And since this game is tagged as both indie and casual, I am to take into assumption that it isn't meant to rival a heavy-budgetted game and just live up to what it wants to be; fun.  Intent aside, the rooms are fun and visually enjoyable, the characaters are amusing to watch, and the resolution seemed fine for whatever screen I played on.\n\nThe gameplay was simple, a point and click combination puzzle game that didn't have me frustrated by level 2 by some overly-complicated design.  Even further in, the difficulty was raised, but feasable.  The complexity came into the 'secret scares' which would be the achievements for this game.\n\nThe story felt a bit loose, but the quick cutscenes between the worlds as well as blurbs from stuffed animals/gargoyles/tutorial-like house narration helped keep you tethered to the story and who was involved.  I didn't feel like it was a visual narration of one of Neil's books, which I can only assume others felt dissapointed by.  All in all, the focus was more on the fun gameplay than bogging the player down with too much story.\n\nAs a over-all whole, I enjoyed the game.  I even spent time trying to get all the secret scares, some of which took me a while to get, and some yet elude me.\n\nTL;DR : It's a fun casual puzzle game with some character with a bonus of Neil Gaiman's narration.", "timestamp_updated": 1405559676, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405559676, "votes_down": 17}, {"recommendationid": "11290794", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506995", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405587906, "steamid": "76561198127479614", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A lot of people seem to not like this game. I'm not exactly sure why. I like it.\n Neil Gaiman does an excellent job with the short narrations. And the entire concept of an old house calling on a ghost to haunt the current annoying residents out is in no way a new concept but it is done well here. \n The artwork is interesting. You won't see much like it. Now some are really hating it because they just can't seem to get why everything is so...well ugly. However, I see that it is all based on Victorian style cartooning, (please go look up Alice in Wonderland and look at the original artwork by John Tenniel, you'll see exactly what I'm referring to.) So its not supposed to look pretty by todays standards, its supposed to look the way it does and I find that its quite charming. \n The puzzles; if your an adult or near adult then I imagine this game will be rather easy and will just become tedious to you. If however, you have children or if you are a child then the puzzles will be challenging but not too much so. \n Now the Music, at first the music isn't the worst thing in the world but yes it does become very very irritating. The sound effects are very repetitve and will make you want to shut off the sound. At least they did with me. \n Lastly, the bugs, yes there are some serious bugs. One is that the objects sometimes don't interact with the enviroment like they are supposed to. Sometimes the items at the end of the level when they are all flying around the room will indeed go through each other or through the walls. And yes sometimes the game will in a sense freeze up because the people wont run out of the room but rather just run around the room trying to get out and you will have to restart the level. \n As it stands currently I'd give it 3 out of 5 stars. If they fixed some of the bugs, then maybe would consider raising it to a 4 out of 5.", "timestamp_updated": 1405615860, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405615860, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "11251725", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506357", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405452341, "steamid": "76561198088619683", "num_games_owned": 1169, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I was really excited to play this on release but was extremely disappointed.
