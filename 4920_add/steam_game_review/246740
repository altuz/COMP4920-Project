It is one of those games that whilst you can watch people play it, the only way to really get the full experience of the game is to play it yourself. \n\nI also like how they take the sound of a ticking clock and make it something that you will learn to fear. I have lost count the amount of times I thought I heard it in game and breathed a sigh of relief when I realised it was the clock on my wall that I heard, Which to me shows how atmospheric the game is if they can make me get scared by my own clock. The stories that each of the characters have to tell also add to the games atmosphere. I honestly believe that these stories wouldn't look out of place in a movie as it is just so well told by each of the people that they got to play the characters in the game.\n\nAnd they have gotten a Ripley's Believe It or Not master to create the maze that the Huntsman calls home. And you will get lost in it, I have many times, I usually end up visiting the same grave 3 or 4 times as I look for the Orphan I am trying to free. Not to mention nearly jumping out of my skin as I turned a corner and there was the Huntsman making his way towards me in the maze. \n\nThe Huntsman himself is a creature I have learned to love and fear. He is based on a Huntsman spider: Only he is a lot bigger and his prey is you.This is a rare gem of a game, with so many games out there going for the jump scare tactic. It is a nice refreshing change to play something that goes for atmospheric horror and really gives me the creeps whenever I play it.

Then you have to go back to the house and get another item, go through the maze again, find a different grave, rinse and repeat!

(I'm going to post my thoughts on why I don't like it).\n\nCons: \n\n1. It does a terrible job at making you nervous since the game's antagonist moves way too slow & does a lame life sapping technique if you look at him (Doesn't that sound familiar?)\n\n2. Your main character moves slow and your always tapping Shift all the time just trying to run (The running in that game feels like fast walking)\n\n3. The lack of names on the graves makes it annoying & time wasting\n\n4. The lack of exploration sucks too because the orphanage is too small in my opinion which has a short basement, 2 short floors & that annoying hedge maze which takes forever to figure out\n\n5. Finding Treasure and setting them on a certain grave kinda reminds me of a matching game except a more boring version of it\n\nPros:\n\n1. Really good voice acting on each of the characters\n\n2. The story is decent\n\nOverall I personally think this game is terrible but some people might like a creepypasta based game with no blood or violence but don't bother wasting $15 on this game (I'm sorry about the negative review but I just didn't feel it).", "timestamp_updated": 1385513016, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "7", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1384833485, "votes_down": 27}, {"recommendationid": "8000939", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520521", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1401092871, "steamid": "76561197983197880", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I'll just say this out front: This isn't a perfect game. I do feel that there are some things that were done right and some things that could use some improvement, but I'm also confident that any perceived negatives will be addresed by Shadowshifters.\n\nThe game does a good job of setting up a creepy environment with a creepy backstory. If exploring an old, abandoned orphanage marred by an unexplained, supernatural tragedy doesn't give you a few chills, then you might want to check your pulse and make sure it's still there. The Huntsman himself is a creepy character too, although maybe based a tad too much on common creepypasta tropes in his appearance, but I'm largely quibbling on that one and have probably read too many creepypastas myself. The cellphone flashlight and screen are a nifty addition that makes you wonder why it hasn't been incorporated before in games like this. The flashlight mechanic is obvious, but the use of the screen is a very nice idea that can really enhance the genre. You may also wonder if the character is lugging a car battery in a backpack that's wired up to the thing, too, heheh. It's used to decent effect with some creepiness, although granted, I feel there's more potential in the idea than we currently see.\n\nThat being said, I feel like this game could do more with what it has. More mystery would be very welcome. Handing much of the story over in narration isn't so bad, but I feel like feeding the story in smaller chunks via exploration and other means could have been a better hook. One item in particular was pretty difficult to find. The mechanics can sometimes be a bit too simplistic.\n\nHowever, I'm giving this game a solid recommendation based not only on atmosphere and some inspired mechanics, but also on Shadowshifters (the folks who made the game in case you didn't notice). They have been very active on the Steam forum for the game and have been very receptive and open to the community. I've reported a few bugs that were fixed within days. You are going to be very hard pressed to find that kind of open ear or dedication in any game company, big or small. Don't forget that this game only came out of early release status about a month and a half prior to writing this, so rough edges are still being smoothed and they're still expanding on the game and fleshing out further details. Some people have complained of low-quality textures and some rough sound effects. I thought so too when I first got this game, but before I even got through it I would fire it up and notice that I must've grabbed a patch, because they were steadily getting fixed. Better textures, better sound, bugfixes, adjustments to mechanics, and more have been pouring in for some time now and it doens't look like they'll stop while there are things left to do. The surprising rate at which they've been fixing bits and pieces (and hinted at some further expansion of the game overall) along with enthusiastic community interaction gives me great hope for Shadowshifters and the games they can make in the future. As such, I solidly recommend The Huntsman. It's good for some crawling skin and there's a great deal of further promise in the game and in the company who made it.\n\nSnag this game, turn out the lights, and have some fun.

Why? Because at the time I didn't want to say anything bad. Now I feel bad for my fellow gamers because I DIDN'T say anything. I'm sorry, guys. :(\n\n----\n\nI will note, my post may be recent but my review of the game is older. I haven't touched that game in over a year and I'll tell you exactly why...\n\nThis game falls flat. Flatter than a pancake lost in time. Now originally I was hyped before it was Greenlit as I thought there'd be more to it. I even pre-purchased the original Halloween edition to show my support, esp for more content. I was very disappointed. And still am.\n\nIt's just plain boring. The in-game audio-dialogue goes on for what feels like forever and it's designed to punish you for wanting to listen to it. When you hear that ticking getting louder, it means the monster is approaching and you have to flee. Because you abandoned the audio, you have to come back to listen to the whole thing all over again.\n\nI had to ask myself why: why would the creator do that? Why would they make us loathe the voice actors/characters because they took too long explaining their sob-story. The reason is, because it wastes time, and more \"X time in game\" statistics makes it a better sell on Steam.\n\nAs for the 'monster', it is in my opinion the worst part of the game. And that's saying something...\n\nIf you haven't seen it in the Store's preview yet, it's basically a 3' tall spider-chicken. It's not a scary thing towering over you in a sinister-like manner - nothing that brings chills up your spine or causes you to scream in terror when you see it. When it does find you, it meekly expresses itself in pantomime by swishing its pedipalps (claws) at you like a silent game of tag. That swish means you're dead, btw. Otherwise, the rest of the time you never see it but you hear it quietly ticking around the house as if it's lost its way. It shouldn't have been called the Huntsman, but rather the \"Meander-man\".\n\nSpeaking of spider-chickens...\n\nAs a farmer, I've had to deal with far scarier roosters in my lifetime. Ones that wouldn't hesitate to fly up to your face to peck out your eyes or tear into your jugular with their 3 inch long spurs. They could bring on real terror, and they were 2 feet tall at best! Of course, they were also easily dispatched with an axe. So why can't I use an axe on Mr. Spider-chicken? It would actually make the game somewhat enjoyable. \n\nBarely. \n\nProbably not.\n\nWhen I first saw the Huntsman in game, I laughed my butt off. It droped down from the mannequins in a \"Ta da!\" stance. It looked silly, and stupid. It glanced up at me from the ground as if to say \"I'm powerful because I have .kill command!\" Ugh. Laughter really shouldn't be the first reaction a player has over a horror game monster.\n\nTo finish off I'll say this game is in my hidden list, along with the other junk I regret purchasing.

What most people fail to see is that this game offers you the chance to get the whole story before playing which is nice since the main gameplay involves running back and forth from a maze hunting tombstones. The maze itself is probably the best idea i've seen for a horror game as maze's are ment to be confusing to navigate and this such maze will confuse you to the point of getting lost with the huntsman after you. The walking and running speed could be better then again it my by involantary stealth to avoid the huntsman. Plus his constant ticking makes you doubt that upcoming corner or him popping out of a path in the wall you can't see till you get further down said path. The maze itself is not just a cube splased with normal maps and textures like most 3d gamemazes, it actually looks like a hedge a iv scared myself from the bits of the hedge that stick out.\nThe Huntsman design is excellent i completley didnt expect it and i killed myself by accident just trying look at it on all sides. The huntsman's in-game reach is abit off though as he can get you about 5 steps away which needs to be fixed along with the 3-5 minute death scene. Basically if you die you have to watch a floating phone for a bit before credits rock up. Not bad the first time but each time is annoying and is a pain as i havnt found an actual skip button.\nThe objectives arn't ground breaking since they are find and place quests but are much more fun and difficult thanks to the maze and the huntsman.\n\nOverall this is one of the better horror games, it has some problems that are minor and are doesn't force the player to go through a gauntlet of jumpscares but more originality than anything.\n\nAll Horror games lose that \"horror\"element after 2 or 3 plays and have to resort to jumpscares to fix it.

Just a bad game, pick up outlast and/or amnesia (even a machine for pigs) far superior games.\n\nHere, I'll slap my first reply up here to help quanitfiy how bad this game is:\n\nThe graphic design is bad. I don't know how much further you want me to qualfy that for an indie game that wouldn't bother me so much if it weren't also for how poorly animated everything is. The sound was recorded poorly, and is balanced horribly speach that pops up is at whispered levels while a slight wind buffetting a house sounds like a hurricane.\n\nThe game goes long stretches of nothing only to show you a monster who stands stock still and talks (whispers) at you for a minute or two before vanishing.\n\nIt is a terrible game. I don't care if you trust me (and why would you fully trust anyone reviewing a game, everyone is biased in some way you dolt)\n\nGo ahead and buy it though.
