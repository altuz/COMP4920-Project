Or you can turn the timer off so that nobody moves unless you do.  This is a great feature to be able to adjust the game travel speed.  People complaining about it being slow maybe didn't notice this feature.  There's an auto-combat feature to speed up combat, but I haven't used it yet.  The strategy, leveling system, and combat are refreshingly different from HOMM and other similar games so you don't feel like it's just a clone.  Most of the fun is figuring out by oneself how it all works.  The artwork is well-done but not flashy.  The game seems solid, no crashes or interface problems.  It feels a bit low-budget in some ways, but nothing is broken.  There is a nice balance between combat and questing.  I give it 8/10.", "timestamp_updated": 1504839542, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504826896, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34753631", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498865", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1456914803, "steamid": "76561198035066284", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 10344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Played since beta, and still believe this is one of the best turn based game on Steam.
