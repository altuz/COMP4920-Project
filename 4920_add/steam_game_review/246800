The game is beautiful, the art style is topnotch, sometimes weird but always appealing. The music is fantastic too, transforming as you use of the 3 powers. It's electronic with dubsteb. The rhythm part consist of pressing the recharge buttons at the right time to create a combo, refilling your power meter. All considered, it's a good buy for whoever love electronic music, funky visual or a challenging platformer.

I tried the demo first and since it was on sale, I bought it - big mistake. I have to agree with the people who didn't recommend this game. Not only does this game not work very well, the controls (WASD for powers, arrow keys for moving) are messed up, making protecting items and characters nearly impossible and recharging powers a constant inconvenience and the beat is a bit off. Recharging \"quite often\" is an understatement in this game since one's powers last for only seconds before having to recharge and since recharging depends on the beat, which is out of sync with the controls and seems to depend more on watching the recharge bar and ignoring the beat, it takes much longer than using powers. One might as well forget using the powers. It would work out better if the powers lasted longer or recharging them worked better.\nWhen the level requires one to use 2 powers simultaneously, ie. shielding and jumping, the combos rarely work and that throws the entire level off and makes one lose the level. What happens is that the character jumps off of or away from whatever one's protecting since using the shield doesn't move objects like the game claims it does, leaving items and characters unprotected.  Also, when shielding an obfect and trying to move forward doesn't work either, it just moves your character and shield away from objects.", "timestamp_updated": 1475045961, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1475045961, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 4}}
