The game is set in the village of Jeklynn and the Rich and Poor factions are battling to be able to leave the town. Players can chose from a hero from either Rich or Poor who all have different abilities (tank, glass cannon, healer etc.).\n\nThe art is amazing, and the music, although very repetitive actually fits the atmosphere so well that it adds to the game and doesn't get annoying. The extra addition of the Mayor who doles out little quests for the players as they fight and kill one another adds a fantastic element to the battles. I also love that he plays to each sides stereotypes and biases of one another, the rich blame the poor for their woes and the poor blame the rich, while the Mayor is really the problem. So you have these rpg elements and a simple little storyline turning what would otherwise be yet another first/third person shooter, into a really fun little experience. \n\nEarly access with a few bugs, but surprisingly stable and the issues were easy to resolve. Good indication of a well made game.", "timestamp_updated": 1464252201, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464252101, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "23227548", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504719", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1464324235, "steamid": "76561198074286175", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Good Fun, Needs more players. nough said", "timestamp_updated": 1464315456, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464315456, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "23209715", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491606", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1465837590, "steamid": "76561198060259578", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "Very fun multiplayer can't wait to see what's down the road.
