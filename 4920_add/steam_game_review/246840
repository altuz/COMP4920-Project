This game litteraly was my childhood, but I could only play the trial version and only while I was at my grandparents house. Now that I am 20, and have my own computer, I have decided to pick up the game for nostalgic reasons. After playing it, I was once again hooked. This is the type of game to get if you are looking for a challenge while also just walking around and cutting someone down or fireballing them to death. Now that I am older and know how to play strategically, I have made myself a Mage that regens more mana than I use. \n\nThe game definitely is geared to make you constantly have trouble clearing a floor, but the harder the enemy, the more xp you get, so it balances itself out. Besides, who would want to play a game that is easy to beat? The game also incorporates a special On-Death question. It gives you the choice to revive on the spot at the cost of XP and Fame (my least favorite option), Revives you at a \"Nearby Level\" for a Cost (It can send you lower in the dungeons), then finally you can choose to drop ALL of your money and be sent 3 levels up in the dungeon (Provides you with a speed run challenge to get your money back), oh and if you aren't fast enough, your money will disappear. Isn't that awesome?\n\nAs for graphics, you shouldn't expect very much. The game was released in 2005 and hasn't had any graphic updates that really CHANGED THINGS. But as for me, I do not care if the graphics aren't that of the newer games coming out these days. You can see what is going on and you dont have any trouble understanding what is what.\n\nStory? There isn't really a story to go by other that: \"After many days of travel, you've reached the forest town of Grove. On the outskirts of town, and once inside the fiery dungeon gates, you'll find fame, adventure and fortune.\" Then the big quest that you have to complete by going very deep into the dungeon to defeat a big boss monster. My game gave me a boss on level 51 of the dungeon.\n\nOverall, I think everyone should play this game, its as fun as the new games but has been around much longer. Its a game that if you haven't played it, then you dont have a childhood. So what are you waiting for? Choose your FATE and get to playing!\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1504448428, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504448428, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33919020", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511979", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501796217, "steamid": "76561198398787737", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Loved this game when I was younger.\nIt was the first RPG I ever played", "timestamp_updated": 1501469380, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501469380, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33624054", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505327", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503961160, "steamid": "76561198262079757", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Really fun!
