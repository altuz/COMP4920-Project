For the second time.\n\n[h1][b]Update - October 31, 2015:[/b][/h1]\nAnother six months passed and this game is still in an unknown state. I just found out that a gaming website called AbsoluteGaming made an [url=http://absolutegaming.co.uk/gaming-news/xbox-one-reviews/interviews/1351-an-absolute-gaming-exclusive-recruits-q-a]interview[/url] with the new developers. According to that interview the PC release is planned for 'early 2016'. They also said that DLCs are planned, and that online matches will be limited to four players, which is pretty disappointing.\nSomething I really don't like is how these new developers also don't seem to give a f*** about the people here on Steam. No communication with us at all, zero, nada. Recruits is still flagged as an Early Access game, but isn't the point of Early Access to let people play the game in an early state and get feedback? Seems like they just code away and don't care if their potential changes to the game are actually welcome by the people who already bought it.\n\n[h1][b]Update - May 5, 2015:[/b][/h1]\nA user named [i]mcabral[/i] said on the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/246880/discussions/0/624076027754349382/?tscn=1430852733#c620712364045626859]forum[/url] that development is being continued 'from now' and that they (QUByte Interactive, a Brazilian game studio) will announce their 'partnership with Commotion Games'.\nAccording to their [url=http://www.qubyteinteractive.com/games/newgame/]website[/url] they are also working on ports for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Wii U.\n\n[h1][b]Original review - April 8, 2015:[/b][/h1]\nLooked very promising, but the developers decided to abandon it at pretty much the first possible opportunity.\nAlso, as usual, Valve doesn't give a frak and is still selling this abandonware.", "timestamp_updated": 1460183192, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428482739, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "14341758", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516853", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1412966135, "steamid": "76561198022241634", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Abandoned game - don't do it.", "timestamp_updated": 1423162642, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423162642, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "21241080", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526004", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1424313423, "steamid": "76561197993869831", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Game is 100% dead.

The controls are swift and the enemies are fast; so are their bullets.\nBasically, \"Recruits\" is a lot like \"Cannon Fodder\", but a lot more unforgiving. You have to learn to aim fast and steady while outrunning enemy bullets.\nBesides some basic gameplay elements which I think are kind of missing, the foundation is solid and deadly.\nI think it could be best described as a mix between \"Cannon Fodder\" and a breeze of \"Soldiers - Heroes of World War 2\" and a lot like \"Running with Rifles\" with nice graphics; because it's fast, easy to learn and hard to master.\nAlthough the game can be prety entertaining it can also be very frustrating. For instance when you're playing a jungle map you can't rotate the camera to look around. It seems to be fixed at a certain angle. (Facing North). Maybe I overlooked something, but if they don't fix this, well, that could be a major killer, because that small feature made sure that I died many times.\nAlso, some things seem to be just scripted. Like: approach enemy, shoot, he throws grenade, even if he's dead already. Seems a bit off to me and kills the stealth factor.\n\nBut, due to the fact that this is an early access game, I have high hopes for it. \nSo far what I've seen is good and solid.", "timestamp_updated": 1406851257, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406850322, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "14283290", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508118", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1408119319, "steamid": "76561198000430815", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "There was no update since August 2014 (and this is 5 months ago).\n\nI thinks its just a little project to earn money.", "timestamp_updated": 1422812309, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422812309, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "11504507", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516415", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1406978977, "steamid": "76561198004723179", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Do you remember cannon fodder ? Of course you do. If you liked that game you might like this one to.\nIts a topdown squad shooter game. It has nice graphics and good controls. Overall its a really good game with lots of potential.\nBut.. yeah there are plenty of buts in this game. The AI is in this game leaves plenty to the imagination. Your own squad AI consist of shooting you in the back or the other AI in the squad. And the enemy AI move like squads and throws grenades and shoots at you instead of their own and they are pretty accurate with their guns.\nYou can give your AI soldiers commands but they hardly ever work like they should and the AI get stuck quite often in trees or pallets.\nIn this version we get to try jungle warfare, flying a chopper and driving a tank and even stealth elements.\nSo it got very much potential in form of maps/gameplay but then again the AI strikes. When flying a chopper or driving a tank the AI doesnt do much since you just wreck the place yourself pretty much godmode. The stealth mission the AI get stuck in the fence, rocks, trees yeah well i think the rolled themselves in glue before the mission. And in the first jungle mission you can rush like rambo until your AI shoots you in the back.\nBut if you dont mind the broken AI and perhaps play with your friends instead, when this options will work i'm sure the game will be freaking awesome just like cannon fodder was back in the day.\nSo to finsih it up\n\nPros:\n+Its cannon fodder HD\n+Solid Gameplay\n+Nice maps\n+Tanks/Choppers\n\nCons:\n-AI\n-AI\n-AI\n-AI", "timestamp_updated": 1406890171, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406890171, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "14023129", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508265", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1434157640, "steamid": "76561197966786200", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've sat down and played this well over 20 times and can't seem to do it for more than 10 minutes at a time.\n\nThis game looks extremely promising at first glance.
