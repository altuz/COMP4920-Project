I walk around my apartment, and want to throw [i]everything[/i] away and chuck my garbage can into the nearest woodchipper... or if I'm playing any other game, I can't help but notice the mess of alien corpses I'm leaving behind, and I always feel obligated to come back into VCD and clean up after myself. It does have bugs and glitches, its not perfect. The physics can get insane, and sometimes frustrating. but I love it. VCD is great to solo, and even better to play with friends. Its become one of my favorites, worth every cent!", "timestamp_updated": 1505117529, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505117529, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34978287", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514892", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506869615, "steamid": "76561197971777277", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 3060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The stand alone Shadow Warrior expansion of Viscera Cleanup Detail was a fantastic idea in and of itself, raising the question what happens in the game world after you're done playing. So for example, if you leave a trail of bodies behind in an FPS game, who will then clean up the mess? Enter the Janitor. You are here to clean up the remains of a repulsed alien invasion. Get to work! Viscera Cleanup Detail includes 18 levels of various sizes that are full of trash, spent bullets, blood and body parts of humans and aliens, crates, barrels, tools, debris, secret items, collectibles and so on. It also includes three expansions, one of which is Shadow Warrior and an office where you collect your trophies, items and it's also a level you can clean, so all in all 22 levels of ultimate cleaning pleasure.\n\nI'm not sure if I should say this, but this game is probably a better fit for introverts and/or for people who take at least some satisfaction in cleaning or putting things back where they belong. But that's my impression, I'm sure it has fans of every kind of variety, cos it's a great game to relax to and everybody needs to relax. If you're not making much progress in your professional or personal life, then cleaning a level in VCD will give you a sense of accomplishment, even if it is only an illusion or escapism. Your messy life will always be waiting for you once you exit the game.\n\nA big part of VCD, for better or worse, are machines that create human body parts. The idea has puzzled me since playing the Shadow Warrior level, cos I got the main game a few years later. How or why does a bucket and a bin dispenser dispense body parts? Sure, it's more mess for you to clean up and I might've missed a bit of story that potentially explains this, but it's the one part of the cleaning process I find completely pointless and often annoying, cos at the end of the job you have to collect those body parts with multiple bins and get multiple buckets to clean up the rest. It's as if the game is not confident enough for you to simply clean up the remains of terrible incidents. Is it funny? Machines spewing out body parts? Maybe the first time around, but that's about it.\n\nThe music. How good is it? Hmmm. Let's just say VCD's soundtrack is different. It has heaps of character, which is more than you can say about soundtracks in much bigger and more expensive games, but I think you'll love it and hate it at the same time. You'll be turning off the Big Banger eventually, just to take a break from the songs, but you'll also turn it back on in the next level, cos you really like that heavier tune, but that's me.\n\nI should say that Shadow Warrior is the only game-themed level in VCD. You won't be picking up headcrabs in City 17, as amazing as that would be, but you won't be disappointed by the selection, cos the locales are varied and it's not all about picking up body parts and mopping up the blood. Some of these levels are huge and you'll have your work cut out for you. Co-op is something I haven't tried, but Revolutionary Robotics, for example, is really a job for two people when I think back on it, but I enjoy the solitude and there's no need to complete a level in one sitting.\n\nIf you're an achievement person, I suggest researching levels before you tackle them, cos you're likely to miss items or tasks on the first try. At the beginning I was very confused about what I was supposed to burn and since there's a lot of stuff you can pick up and move around, you start overthinking it eventually. Supposedly there's no difference between stacking barrels and crates in the appropriate areas or simply burning them. While there's a certain set of rules that apply for all levels, the look of items will vary such as what constitutes a crate, but a barrel is always a barrel. I'm not complaining though, the levels are different, cos they tell different stories, so the items have to look different. You're not going to find \"space crates\" in Santa's workshop.\n\nI have eight more levels to complete, the office needs a bit more work and the House of Horror awaits, but I think I've done a pretty good job so far. I'm not sure what I've accomplished in the 47 hours I've put into this, but I've left some clean rooms behind, so there's that. It's not often you play a game from a South African indie studio, VCD is both funny and engaging in its mundane tasks. It's a parody on the violence of video games and how meaningless it often is when a game has no real story to tell. I'd say this is not for everybody, but Santa's Rampage is a cheaper entry point and if you own Shadow Warrior then you already have the VCD expansion of the same name. Both of those left me wanting for more, so hence the review.", "timestamp_updated": 1505499697, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505499697, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34833288", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505756327, "steamid": "76561198095107668", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "Make sure you do the space clean up.
