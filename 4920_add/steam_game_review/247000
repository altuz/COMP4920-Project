I have bought this and the majority of its expansions for myself and my friends in order to continue to play this with them. unfortunately you can purchase tabletop simulator for cheaper and download talisman off of the steam workshop for free and that is all expansions. but today the reason i am typing a bad review is simply that the AI is broken and does not operate normally. if you do not win within 30 rounds your chances of winning are null. ecample; i was playing an ogre chieftein and achived the crown of command but the last AI a wizard had the warlock quest reward prolific pockets (if his gold count is zero he gains 1 gold) and he has the physician follower (pay 1 gold to heal 1 life) it is now impossible to win the game and wastes about 2 hours of gametime because the wizard AI has no desire to win or lose which means i cannot complete the game. this is about the most frustrating thing i have ever encountered in the game but so far this games single player playability is horrible. and its easier to play talisman on tabletop simulator. the only reason you should purchase this game is for achievements and they will be difficult with a broken AI. until they patch their AI this game is a no go. to conclude, I love this game i have the 2nd edition version IRL as well as the 4th edition IRL ive spent hundreds of dollars on this game and i love the models and designs. but the digital edition is a waste of time.", "timestamp_updated": 1506381352, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506381352, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34998235", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496074", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506052054, "steamid": "76561198037366772", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I understand this game is immensely popular among the tabletop gaming community, but I really don't get it.  Maybe it's the nostalgia factor.  From what I see, this game just doesn't hold up in this age of gaming.  Talisman is definitely a product of its time.  Originating in 1983 (from what I could find), a lot of games back then were \"roll a die, move your token, stuff happens.\"  I absolutely hate this as a mechanic!  Yeah, there are some elements to change your luck here.  You can go either direction, so you're kind of picking your encounter, and using your fate, you can change dice rolls a limited number of times.  It still doesn't make the game strategic enough for me.  This is not much more than Hasbro's LIFE in a fantasy form.  You travel around the board, getting small improvements over time, eventually trying to reach the center of the board.\nUltimately what kills it for me though, is this game is just way too slow.  I hate having things improve this gradually.  I'm down with a game that can take a couple hours.  I fully embrace Chaos in the Old World, and generally enjoy what Fantasy Flight brings to the table.  It's just that I think I was in 4 hours and still hadn't finished a game.  Had I been introduced to this game as a young child, maybe I could've latched on to it.  I was playing a bunch of roll-and-move games back then.  This would provide more agency than I knew.  I just don't think it can contend with the options available to tabletop gamers today.", "timestamp_updated": 1505571675, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505571675, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 984, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 279, "total_reviews": 1263}}
