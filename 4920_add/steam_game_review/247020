I love it, and think it's fantastic.\n\nHowever! There's no real penalty for screwing up. The only effect of making mistakes is that your \"buzz\" is lowered, and the only thing \"buzz\" does is increase how many customers show up. You don't actually have any ongoing expenses running the restaurant, so it doesn't actually matter at all how well you do.\n\nI feel that this is a serious, critical flaw in the game. It feels like it doesn't really matter how well you perform, because there's no consequence for failure. I think this game could be improved 1000% if it was possible to lose the game, eg by going out of business because you ran out of money or failed too many health inspections.\n\nNevertheless, even without that the game is extremely good. Really, really good. The mechanics are tight and enjoyable. I tend to play like every order matters, and it heightens my enjoyment of the game.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game and I recommend it.", "timestamp_updated": 1504961527, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504961527, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35078328", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502841", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505518887, "steamid": "76561197965046644", "num_games_owned": 870, "num_reviews": 186, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Spent hours slapping meat to those buns...the patrons were proud to eat my meat.", "timestamp_updated": 1505886894, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505886894, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2053, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "review_score": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 88, "total_reviews": 2141}}
