I've played so very, very many roguelikes/lites/whatevers over the years, and of course many games in a general sense.  This, honestly, may be one of the greatest of all of them, which isnt exactly something I say lightly.\n\nCrypt of the Necrodancer is two things:  A turn-based roguelike, and a rhythm game.  The core mechanic is that the \"turns\" pass with the rhythm of the song being played.  On each beat, you make a move, and enemies also make a move.  This creates a game that is actually very fast-moving and active.  You must constantly be doing stuff, as if you skip a beat, or if you screw up the timing on one, Bad Things will tend to happen (depending on who you're playing as).  For most characters this involves your coin multiplier dropping to nothing (which can cause any Obsidian equipment to become weak), and maybe certain items might vanish.  For a couple of others, they just outright die if you screw up even once.  The rhythm mechanic is the absolute core of everything in the game.  Not only do all of the game's mechanics and design aspects revolve around it, but it's also a huge part of what makes the game so very, very fun. Two genres that appear to make no sense together are fused regardless, and the result is just stunning.\n\nThe good thing is, you dont have to be a master at music games to play this.  Necrodancer doesnt require the hyper-exact timing that most rhythm games do.  Dont get me wrong, it's still easy to screw up, but this is a game that anyone can get into.  Even the way the rhythm works... with many music games it's this chaotic pile of interspersed notes flying at you in various patterns along with the music.  In Necrodancer, it's an extremely steady beat. It's displayed at the bottom of the screen constantly, but almost immediately you'll find that you dont have to look at it.\n\nHowever, that doesnt mean it isnt tough to deal with in other ways. One huge aspect that goes along with this is the fact that you MUST make some sort of movement on every beat.  You cannot simply stand still; that'll cause the aforementioned Bad Things to happen.  So you must either move, use an item, use a spell, or dig at a wall, on every single beat.  This constant forced action goes along well with the whole dancing theme of the game, but also adds alot to the challenge.  It can be difficult to place yourself into the right position to deal with the myriad foes that will attack you from all angles.  It does create a high learning curve... at first you're going to die over and over and over again simply due to this aspect, which could mean frustration.  But once you get used to it, it just WORKS.  \n\nNot that it'll ever get easy, mind you.  The game's difficulty ranges from \"difficult\" to \"completely absurd\".  Much of this has to do with not only the core mechanic, but the enemies you'll face.  Every floor is absolutely stuffed with monsters.  And these monsters arent the ultra-simple traditional sorts that simply walk at you and deal damage.  Every individual monster type has a unique pattern and special abilities, and learning those behaviors and traits is the most important thing when it comes to your survival.  Some enemies are simple:  skeletons for instance only move every other beat, and they raise their arms up on the beat before they do move. Easy to understand.   Others are much more confusing to deal with.  The infamous Red Dragon for instance has the ability to fire a blazing deathray to the left or right; it'll always try to do this if you are on the same horizontal line as it is, and you get exactly one beat to get out of the way of this extremely damaging attack.  Skeletons may not be so bad, but that dragon is the bane of many players and requires great care and special techniques to defeat.  The good thing is, enemy behavior is very easily understood, very well telegraphed, and NOT stuffed with RNG (with certain exceptions, but even those can be understood in a way), yet these facts absolutely do not detract from the challenge they produce.\n\nFortunately you have all sorts of different weapons and items to use.  The game's combat system is fantastic, and one of the reason for it is the weapons.  Each weapon has a \"hit pattern\" where it can damage tiles in front of you.  The basic dagger only damages the tile directly in front of you as you attack.  A longsword however can hit two tiles away.   A whip on the other hand has that very short range, but also a huge straight spread to the side.  Every single weapon type is useful in some way, and every weapon type comes in a variety of interesting flavors, as do other types of equipment.  For example, obsidian items base their power on your coin multiplier.  Blood items do things with your health.  Glass items are very strong but shatter if you get hit.  There are many item categories, including shovels that let you dig at walls, and torches that not only increase vision range but let you see THROUGH walls, making \"hidden\" rooms a major aspect of the game.   The items in the game are all sorts of fun to use, whether they're equipment or spells or whatever.  They are very, very well thought out and usually easy to understand.\n\nHowever, the game isnt always so easy to grasp.  Shrines for instance can be very confusing in terms of exactly how they work.  Many times you'll run into a new one, try it out, go \"WTF?\" and then die horribly, not because the effect was bad, but because you had no clue what to do with it.  Other quirky mechanics like hidden shops, or the extremely varied effects of each different character (and there are MANY characters) can take awhile to really get the hang of.  There is alot of depth here, but that also means alot to learn.  This is NOT an easy game, and chances are, it's going to take you quite some time to beat it even once.  But it has features to help you learn... lots of such features, actually, something hardly any roguelikes ever do.  It makes it easy to practice against specific foes or test things out.  It even has a full level editor and Steam Workshop support.  There is so very, very much going on here (and even more if you get the fantastic DLC).\n\nOverall, it's a very difficult game (and the difficulty just keeps going higher, and higher, and higher, as you continue to play it), yet one with neverending replay value, and one that I honestly just never get tired of. It also has the very, very rare quality of doing everything it can to help you learn in a non-frustrating way (heck, one particular character turns it into a TRULY turn-based game, letting you experiment and learn without having to worry about the rhythm, and he's unlocked from the start).  It's just plain FUN in a way that very few games truly manage, with a level of quality that is also rarely seen.  Every single aspect of it ties together to create something truly amazing.  Even if you have a hard time with it at first, stick with it:  It's absolutely worth dealing with that brutal learning curve.  This is something you dont want to miss.  I've reviewed many games on here... but this outdoes nearly all of them.  It's that good, in my opinion.  \n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is absolutely incredible?  You can use your own songs, too.
