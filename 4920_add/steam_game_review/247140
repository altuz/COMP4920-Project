That being said Ive only played 2 songs on this game so far and can see myself spending a lot of time clicking into this game when im not looking to get into a bout of COD. Its just kind of fun and doesnt require anything more then your attention and a deft mouse hand. I used the ingame feature to use an mp3 track on my pc, I chose Blakwalls Rebel Yell cover.

However there are a few smalll problems with the game right now. The biggest problem i have with the game right now is that the movement fells to light and floaty. It's a pretty big problem but it's not a deal breaker but it 8s still a problem. My second problem with the game is that the level select is just bad. You are only able to see 3 or 4 levels at a time and it makes getting to the later levels a pain my segestion is to make the selected one a little smaler and have more of the screen used for the list. My last problem with the game is thatgeting user created levels is a pain. Its presented the same wayas the main levels which wasn't amazing in the first place and didn't include a serch bar.
