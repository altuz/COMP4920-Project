The Cell Stage is fun enough, and the Creature Stage is awesome. The Tribal Stage is a broken mess of an RTS and while the Civilization Stage isn't anything to write home about, it's still pretty fun.\n\nBut the Space Stage? That alone justifies this game's existence. I honestly wish it was its own game, but even as it is, the Space Stage is just so excellent. I've devoted countless hours to it on my old copy before I got it on Steam. And the Galactic Adventures expansion makes it even better. I love this game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506208070, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504229", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "35165968", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198121201057", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1506209219, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "playtime_forever": 2199}, "timestamp_updated": 1506208070, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I made a singing toilet. \nNuff said\n10/10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506362642, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504310", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35207816", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198166994935", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1502818441, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 75918}, "timestamp_updated": 1506362642, "received_for_free": true, "review": "i love spore game!"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504895305, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500448", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "34820397", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016477228", "num_reviews": 79, "last_played": 1451182019, "num_games_owned": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 119}, "timestamp_updated": 1504895305, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I spent 2 hours making the perfect ballsack.\n\nI can die happy now.\n\n10/10 would recommend.\n\n- Crankage Games (Developer of Metal as P H U K)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507107573, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501447", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35466667", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198023430257", "num_reviews": 278, "last_played": 1507112128, "num_games_owned": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1145, "playtime_forever": 3630}, "timestamp_updated": 1507107607, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I've played Galactic Adventures when it first came out 8 years ago on Origin, and I still play this monster of an expansion pack to this day.\n\nIn Space Stage your always stuck on your ship, you cannot beam yourself onto a planet and go around killing things or do quests, I mean there was the Holo Scout, but you just walk around and nothing else...\n\nThis expansion allows you to go on adventures, where you beam down to the surface onto an unknown planet, do missions, and earn points to upgrade your Captain to be on of the most overpowered beings in the galaxy!\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\n[b] An infinite amount of adventures! [/b]\n\nWhile you have the Offical Maxis adventures, you can create your own, and download other people's adventures online! You won't run out of adventures, trust me some are giant battle arenas, to saving a town, to a collect-a-thon, or just collect sheep! The amount of adventures are near endless!\n\n[b] The upgrades [/b]\n\nFrom giving your Captain giant blades to slash enemies, to summoning bees to send enemies into a panic, the amount of upgrades and how powerful they are is awesome! \nThere's also upgrades that increase your mobility, health, defences and attack power!\n\n[b] It gives depth to the Space Stage [/b]\n\nFlying around space and blowing up shit is fun, but Space Stage has always felt a bit lacking and repetitive, this DLC fixes that and mixes up the gameplay a lot!\n\n[b] MAKE YOUR OWN ADVENTURES! [/b]\n\nWith an easy to learn creator, you can create your own planet to do an adventure on! I've created tons of adventures with my orignal account, and now I'm currently making my own adventures today! Called \"Trouble on Tiroan\" and it's a multi adventure series with many parts, Part 5 will be the final part and as of this review it's still being created! Check it out when you have some time.\n[spoiler] Sorry for the forced advertisement! [/spoiler]\n[spoiler] Wait no I am not...[/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\n[b] Only affects Space Stage [/b]\n\nNot really a surprise, but if you don't enjoy Space Stage that much, you might not enjoy this DLC that much, however a lot of people (Including me) have said that this DLC makes Space Stage more enjoyable overall.\n\n[b] Can be glitchy [/b]\n\nWhile the DLC is fine, the actual adventures can be glitchy, including pathing of AI, respawn timers of some items, collision of objects (The biggest issue) and more, but these don't come up as often as you think.\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\n\n8 Years of fun so far, and no signs of stopping! Spore GA is one of the greatest expansion packs to ever be made."}]}
