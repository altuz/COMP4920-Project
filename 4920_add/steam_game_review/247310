Even though it's on Early Access, the game feels complete. The controls are fine, while the XBOX 360 Controller plays perfectly with the game. The game was meant to be hard. The game is quite frustrating on the later levels (at least you get infinite lives). Though the devs didn't release the game on Mac or Linux yet, but they know how to keep a promise on these, especially the upcoming release of SteamOS. Music is very fitting for the lab theme (not if repetive), so does the background. The achievements aren't too shabby either. They give challenge and will stump even the cleverest of the puzzle-platformer boffins. Though the graphics resemble more of an actual OUYA game, (in fact, it was previously released on OUYA). Though there are only 40 levels right now (with more added soon), but getting 4 stars and collectibles will crank the challenge up a notch or two.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nMusic: 7/10\nGraphics: 6/10\nLasting Appeal: 9/10\nPrice Opinion: 7/10\n\nOverall: 8/10\nYou can't go wrong about this Early Access platformer that gives you that sciencific feeling.", "timestamp_updated": 1385406446, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1385406433, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "7841657", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516633", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1385810412, "steamid": "76561198025301599", "num_games_owned": 4250, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "in short this game is a fun and challenging platformer but the controls could be improved since its a little loose, still the game is fun while the challenge increases as you progress and keep in mind that the game is still in early access form, i really hope with an update they could tighten the controls a little since the advanced levels requires precise movement", "timestamp_updated": 1385810422, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1385810422, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "7995674", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504961", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1386701473, "steamid": "76561197971355045", "num_games_owned": 689, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fun platformer with somewhat unique mechanic in that you basically grapple around the levels.

But there are countless flaws and bugs in the game and it is basically abandonware at this point.\n\nBugs: The biggest bug you could imagine. The game freezes after the last level. There's supposed to be a final confrontation but it won't actually load the last section of the game.\nMany achievements are described poorly (saying the achievement is on a different level than it is), one seems to be actually impossible to get. The discussions are full of bug reports and the devs haven't responded in years or apparently fixed any. The level collectibles dont update properly so I've collected over 100 so far and the game only has 40 levels (I also still don't have the achievement for that either)\n\nGameplay: The concept is fine but poorly executed in some critical areas:\nFor a platformer where precise movements are fairly important, Gravi (you) slide all over the level at will. Precision jumping sections are a huge pain and will come down to a fair amount of luck and grinding several dozen deaths at just one section. Difficulty curves are all over the place as precision landing is incredibly difficult while some of the final levels aren't particularly challenging.\n\nAbandonware: The devs have left this game as is. It isn't coming out of early access any time soon if it ever does. The devs have actually been posting more about some other games they are working on instead of fixing one they already had customers pay for.\n\nVerdict: Buy a better platformer. Find a better gravity based game. There are many games that outclass this installment in every way.

Roll around, fire out your little gravity bender, get pulled to it.  You can \"resist\" the pull, and use that to your advantage.  However, where this whole mechanism falls apart is in both the control scheme and the implementation.\n\nYour projectile also has to follow the standard parabolic path any first year physics student would be familiar with.  Trying to accurately aim this parabolic projectile with the mouse, while also controlling Gravi with your keyboard, seems to be entirely an exercise in frustration.   If this is where the developers were getting the \"puzzle\" part of \"Puzzle platformer\", I think they should revisit what that means.  There weren't times where I was trying to find my own path through a level, or trying to figure out which switch to pull when.  They levels were incredibly linear, and the only puzzles I could find were the mechanics.\n\nFor instance, there are areas near the end of chapter 1 that require you to \"swing\" from the ceiling, while avoiding the fire jets above, and the spikes below.  This turned into pure frustration for me- minor changes to the angle of my projectile caused it to miss the ceiling pillars entirely, or catch the side instead of the bottom and pull me into the flames.  When I could successfully hit the first pillar, transitioning to the next one seemed to be \"how fast can you slightly adjust the mouse and fire again so that the projectile hits the pillar before you fall to the spikes below\", not \"can you make a good plan through this gauntlet\".  Super Meat Boy was fun because of the precision required and how exact the control felt.  Gravi is not, because it requires similar levels of precision but has controls that feel much less exact.\n\nPerhaps it would be better with a controller, but I feel that the problem is not solely to blame on the control system, but instead lies in the combination of cramped quarters and need to exact responses with pixel-perfect precision.  \n\nControl issues aside, the levels looked rather blah.  Graphically they are detailed enough to have some character, but the limited palette leads to some visual confusion at times.  It also felt at times like the detail of the background fights with the important information about dangers in the level itself.\n\nThe audio wasn't bad, but wasn't great, either.  I would consider the sound and music to be a wash, all told.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this.

You basically throw a projectile against a surface and, if you're within range, you're drawn to it like a magnet. I figured this would allow for some clever level design, but the ten stages I finished were short, cramped, straightforward, and filled with generic hazards like spikes. Level 11 introduced reverse-gravity spots as you would find in some Super Mario Galaxy stages, but I couldn't progress because they made me clip into the ceiling, making it nigh impossible to avoid a spike hazard. Maybe later stages are more interesting, but what I've seen so far makes me wary regardless.\n\nI also feel like left/right movement has too much momentum, especially when you're required to land neatly in between two spike hazards, or something of that nature. I'm fine with high difficulty, but I don't like when games ask me to do precise things with imprecise movement.\n\nI would watch a gameplay video or two before committing to this one.
