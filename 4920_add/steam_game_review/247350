Grab some drinks set up the computers and kill yourself with your own nuke.  The positions in the game fit a medium sized group of friends well.  \nCaptain: semi tactical and slightly too tipsy leader man\nWeapons officer: Guy that wants to blow stuff up and is constantly hoping you'll authorize nukes\nHelm: Probably rides a kawasaki brand motorcycle irl, will ram your ship into the enemy just as your nuke explodes\nComms: Put either the drunkest person here or the biggest memelord.  They get to insult enemy ships and tell you their weaknesses.  This person is also in charge of demanding every nearby station builds you more nukes (girlfriend mode)\nEngineering: Put your sys admin friend here, or network admin friend, you know the type.  Their job is to turn your shields off at exactly the right moment for maximum internal damage.  \n\nThis game is seriously 10/10, for the low price of a 4 pack it is basically the greatest local multiplayer ever.  Sure the graphics are kind of lacking but they're really all you need.  The fun is in the interaction between 4-5 clowns as you take down wave after wave of enemy ship.  Nukes are your friend and make sure your helmsman doesn't ram your ship into the goddman nuclear explosion again.  Come on nick that nearly killed us last time when I say fire the nuke don't go forward.  NIck no stop what the fuck dude no no no engineering shields full.  Mission failed.\n 10/10 would die to nuclear fire again.", "timestamp_updated": 1500491451, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500491451, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33535885", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461726", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500038612, "steamid": "76561197976931939", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "seems like its just takes up a corner of my screen and i cant change the res to fix this.
