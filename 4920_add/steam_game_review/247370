I have now completed Mutant Mudds' demo on the 3DS, Mutant Mudds on 3DS, Mutant Mudds Deluxe on Wii U, and Mutant Mudds: Deluxe on PC.  I was also partially finished with Mutant Mudds: Super Challenge when my 3DS mysteriously disappeared.  Honestly, I think that says enough about the game.  If you like platformers with good level design, play this game.  Also, make sure to get all the water sprites.  They unlock Granny and the CGA-land levels, and you really want those.", "timestamp_updated": 1502116904, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502116904, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 77, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 25, "total_reviews": 102}}
