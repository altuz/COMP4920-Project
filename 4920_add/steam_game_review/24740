Not the best installment in the series. After amazing Revenge and great Dominator, Paradise seems to be a bit over the top. Open world in my opinion is not the best idea for this kind of game. I prefer to jump in - jump out. Also not being able to race on split screen with my friends kind-of sucks. From the positive side I like variety of cars.
