It's got a great horror/murder mystery storyline with 3-dimensional characters.  If you're a gamer who loves good stories, a fan of crime drama/murder mysteries, and/or you enjoy the more psychological, atmospheric horror of games like Silent Hill, then you're in the right place.  If you liked David Lynch's short TV series, \"Twin Peaks,\" then you'll probably like this game, altough there are some fans of Twin Peaks who felt like this game was ripping it off and didn't appreciate that (personally, I found it to be more along the lines of a loving tribute to Twin Peaks, however, I'll admit that, with all the similarities, I can understand where those that called it a rip-off were coming from).\n\nThat said, what is the game lacking?  For the most part, I'd say the game is weak in it's main gameplay mechanics, but I didn't find it to be TERRIBLE.  It's a fairly simple 3rd-person action/shooter style game that implements elements of realism (eating when you are hungry, sleeping when you've been up for a certain amount of time, ect.).  The control scheme is somewhat clunky and not as polished as it should be, but once you get used to it, it doesn't take too much away from the overall experience.  \n\nGameplay isn't all a big negative either - there was a pretty big positive element having nothing to do with the main gameplay mechanics: the game's open-world with lots of optional sidequests.  Some people don't like it as much, but I had tremendous fun collecting weapons, cash, and other helpful items for the main game by doing the errands, jobs, and other plentiful optional tasks that are available to you throughout the game.  If you're a sidequest lover (especially of the open-world/sandbox variety), then getting enjoyment from playing the game shouldn't be a problem for you as you are enjoying the storyline (and it makes for lots of extra gameplay hours, making the game feel more like it earned your money).\n\nOverall, I loved this game, but I will say this: if you're not easily gripped by a game's storyline and/or you absolutely NEED a 3rd-person action/adventure/sandbox game to have well-honed controls and an intuitive, unique style of gameplay that stays fresh and exciting at every turn, then you might want to look elsewhere.\n\nMy Over Rating:  9.0 / 10.0", "timestamp_updated": 1505762147, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505762147, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35034090", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509111", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505685477, "steamid": "76561198041195919", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game doesn't work, I've tried the DPFix, making the program admininstrator, lowering the game resolution, uninstalling and reinstalling and verifying the game integrity and nothing worked.\n\nI've heard this game is good and I really wanna play it since I'm watching Twin Peaks but this is impossible on the PC.

However fair warning - this game has problems. BIG problems of a technical nature. It is prone to crashing, glitchhing and general prefromance issues. \n\nFor some the fixes for these issues work, for others they don't. Some people can play without problem, others get hit with crash after crash. It's totally random as to what experience you will have.\n\nAnd yes it is also true the combat is pretty average, and sometimes even dull. And yes there are some awful quicktime events thanks to its console heritage. Oh and the graphics were considered ugly even when it was released. Also the driving is bad, and gunplay bugged (use alt tab to get your crosshair working). \n\nSo why do I like it?\n\nWell apart from the obvious 'Twin peaks' homage, the game tries to do a lot, has a great story and good characters. The voice acting is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent. The map is large and nice to explore and the games pacing is great, with plenty of little side missions to achieve outside of the main story. \n\n If you can live with the possible technical frustrations this is one of the best story driven games available IMHO.  Becuase of those issues I do recommend that you may want to wait for a sale unless your a major twin peaks fan.", "timestamp_updated": 1504796356, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504796300, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35243685", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505757", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503334351, "steamid": "76561198102174535", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 4184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Unstable, buggy and bizarre.
