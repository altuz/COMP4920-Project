The difficulty 'curve' is shot to hell. There is a GDI mission two thirds in that is essentially impossible to do in the order that the mission tells you to, there are Nod missions that are near impossible unless you follow some specific and unlikely set of actions that suddenly render it simple as if they were trying to sell strategy guides.\n\nIts bad enough, that I consider the difficulty setting to be essentially broken. (Ive heard that patches may quite genuinely have broken it, and the wildly different quality of difficuly curve between this and Kanes Wrath suggests that might be true.) If you happen to be excellent at RTS then by all means dive in, but for the vast majority of people itll pull you in for a good long time... before it beats you down until you hate the whole experience and wonder why you spent so damn long playing it in the first place...\n\n\n\nThats basically all you need to know, but if you want to get in to details lets dive in to Kanes tower, which is flat out impossible for anyone who isnt skilled at RTS. Likely wont matter how many times you play, there is no way you are getting through it without help. \nI ultimately followed youtube videos of the mission and even then the _slightest_ mistake and it collapses like a house of cards. Probably shouldnt have bothered as the final mission of the game rivals it in difficult and led to a pretty frustrated finish. \n\nAhh but there are difficulty settings you fool, just drop it to easy, and so I did. In the first few minutes of the level there is a flurry of activity (because there always is) and you have to mop up an initial attack of a bunch of tanks and soldiers as efficiently as possible or youll get crushed by the next waves. Switch to easy, it sent several Mammoth tanks instead... wh... why? (To be fair it did make me laugh, but I probably shouldnt have been laughing at how hilariously broken the difficulty is.)\n\nIn case you are wondering, that was the point I just looked up some build orders on youtube, and thank god because I would have _never_ worked out how to do what they did on my own. (Immediate expansion right in to their attack path, followed by mass production of your cheapest units which mystifyingly turn out to be far more effective than any other unit composition.)\nThat wasnt the only time those settings fall over, they vary in their effectiveness from what youd expect, to having little effect, to once or twice making easy harder than normal.\n\nIm not the best RTS player in the world, I admit that, but every other RTS has worked out how to have a difficulty that accomodates a wide range of players and Ive never had to drop from normal setting in any other RTS Ive ever played, (Including Kanes Wrath which is _vastly_ superior in its game design.) let alone found easy settings near impossible as well.\n\nThere is a point where a game gets challening and its a joy to work your way through it with a satisfying ending, but this? A dozen different things to do all at once, get them out of order and you are wiped out. An AI that doesnt win because its written well (quite the opposite most of the time) it just blatently cheats with resources and even unit strength at times, it robs you of any satisfaction as the clear way in which it is rigged reminds you it was merely written to allow you to win under arbitrary circumstances. This also compounds problems with pacing, the AI is overwhelming in the first 10 minutes, but once youve stabilised it never learns, never really adapts, its just a matter of time until you win and it can get quite tedious as a result. They only really counter this issue using time limits which Ive come to recognise in games as the ultra lazy, bad designers tool for level balancing.\n\nUltimately after the nth time of trying a mission and finding youve scraped barely any closer to a win over the last few times, you realise its just pummeling you, its tiresome, its work, its anything but fun."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506504908, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35238564", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011119127", "num_reviews": 40, "last_played": 1506501421, "num_games_owned": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 465, "playtime_forever": 524}, "timestamp_updated": 1506504908, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good:\n+ Skirmish can be fun\n\nBad:\n- Patch 1.09 ruined campaign experience for many (changes made focused on MP, changes that made campaign disproportionally in favour of AI)\n- Even worse that one can't downgrade to earlier version with this Steam version of CnC TW.\n- Campaign AI cheats\n- Campaign AI does not think about defence, only offence, causing the game to be frustrating and not satisfying (easy to win with a single push after managing to stall the oncoming spam of units).\n\nIn comparison to RA2 campaign missions where it was more about a strong foothold and battles in between them, leading to enjoyable progression."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506440478, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498836", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35224347", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197986071448", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506440115, "num_games_owned": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 305, "playtime_forever": 305}, "timestamp_updated": 1506440478, "received_for_free": false, "review": "EA has broken the single-player campain by overbalancing the multi-player.
