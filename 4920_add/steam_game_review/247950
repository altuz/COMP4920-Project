What I personally liked about the game was the various characters you could play as (base game- 4 and all DLC- 6), which I greatly enjoyed. It is also within these characters you can play different playstyles (some are the same as others though). It is also a good game to play with firends as it is clearly made for it given some of the mechanics. However, this game has some glaring flaws. First, this game has very little in common with previous Sacred games as other reviews will tell you. Secondly, this game is very simple. Almost every level is \"watch out for falling rocks\" or \"turn the wheel six times.\" The final big point I will state is the dialogue. This tries to be funny but will fall short and become annoying. In fact, the bosses even have jokes in their intro, clearly mimicing Borderlands. It also felt like every 20 seconds Aria, your telepathic companion, pesters you about not doing the objective, even though you are currently swamped by enemies. Overall, I would recommend doing what I did. Just get this game on sale ( I got it for $4) with all the DLC and grab a copy for your buddy. It will at least be a fun few hours.", "timestamp_updated": 1505016755, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505016755, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35081887", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501158", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505992500, "steamid": "76561198014333343", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "All these negative reviews are totes trash-fire as none of them point out that the release was handled quite underhandedly.
