I was extremely close to not bothering with Kanes Wrath as I assumed that the expansion would only increase the difficulty, frustration, my blood pressure, etc. \n\nInstead Kanes Wraths campaign is done in a way that is far better balanced, far more open, and allows for more types of play than its predecessor. It does this largely by slicing up each level, if you are a skilled player slamming through things then youll go through the objectives rapidly with a more organic story feel and an exciting but risky play through. If you are like me and a bit crap then a lot of the missions youll hold off, take your time, stabilise, play a bit of sim city and build a huge army before hitting the objective and moving on.\n\nAs a result, it was so much more enjoyable, there was never a brick wall of difficuly I ran in to, and each level allows you to effectively play at the pace you want depending on your mood. Its a real shame, though understandable for an expansion, that there isnt more of a campaign in it. That said, they do throw in a bunch of interesting additions.\n\n\nSkirmish and multiplayer have been given a boost with the different factions and such, and then there is Global Conquest. A more free flowing version of the old Dune 2 map where you could choose the way you expand. \n\nIts pretty rough around the edges; even after winning a few rounds of it Im sometimes confused by what exactly happened on a bunch of turns and lots of play styles will mean you never actually need to play in real time even at harder difficulties. but its an interesting mode of play to try out, and it had a lot of potential. Its a shame this wasnt fleshed out, fixed up, and maybe made in to a fully fledged expansion/game in its own right, like Dawn of War did with Dark Crusade only with C&C game play and the more sophisticated Global Conquest map.\n\nAll in all there is a fair bit here to get through in this expansion and its really solid, varied, enjoyable stuff."}]}
