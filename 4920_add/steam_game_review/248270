It should not be compared with them or games, not because it's lacking in any way, simply because it is really a different category of application.\n\nWhat it is, is a launching pad for learning repertoire and practicing scales (though you may need to use the editor as the list is short and has no copyrighted music). The program asumes you have at least a passing familiarity with sheet music reading, and know more or less what it takes to make a sound out of the instrument but are either having trouble remembering the specifics (for example you may not have memorized the fingering of a particular instrument) or have issues with intonation (singing, violin, upright bass, etc). \n\nThe application that most resembles it (that I know of) is Canta, however this is much more fleshed out and quite honestly well worth the asking price provided you can orient yourself. \n \nI should add some important tidbits:\n* Guitar also supporst TAB, which is great\n* Keyboards work one hand a time. Enough to carry you over the early learning stages (as you are supposed to learn each hand independently, then combine them on your own). \n* Combining this with the Rocksmith cable is delightful, quite honestly I recomend this or a direct box. * Some instruments can't be plugged into a cable... But often a piezo transducer will do (which you can make or buy cheaply, just look around in YouTube); Other times a simple USB microphone might do the trick (you can use your laptops microphone just don't complain if it doesn't work it won't magically make it a high quality mic)\n* Havent used the editor, will update if Steam allows when used but the tutorial shows it is complicated, but far from impossible.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you have some grounding on music theory and could use some fingering suggestions, or would like a backing track while reading the score, or someone who has intonation issues you may have found what you need . And yes if you make your own complete custom instrument with a radically unique pitch, it will still work (range will be up to you though)\n\nI would say that multi instrumentalists that haven't fully mastered perfect pitch or rythm or would like to have a backing track and are willing to put a little effort could not have found a better tool. \n \nAbout me\n\nI studied a little bit of classical and jazz guitar but am mostly a self taught guitarrist that recently picked-up the bass, keyboards, ukelele, recorder, violin...

I play the Tenor Saxophone, now right here I said that I was disappointed in how little songs there were for the saxophone, but, thanks to the Developers commenting on this originally, I now know that you CAN play almost all of the included songs on the Saxophone, and I assume any other instrument, even if the title doesn't say so. If you want to know more just look at their comment below. I was also disappointed to see how little songs and song categories to see in general.Another thing that I said I was \"disappointed\" with was in how little songs there is to play in general, and now I know that it can be very, VERY hard to get popular/trending music, now only because it can be hard to program it into the game (not sure how hard that it is) but mainly very hard to just get the rights for the song in general. Because it can be a huge investment that they might not even get back, so I don't blame them if they don't have a lot of very iconic songs that someone might want. Before I had said that you shouldn't buy the game now because it is still very early in development and to wait until it adds more songs, but now I have an entirely different approach. Buy it now, because I bet that in the future this game will rise in price, and even if it doesn't have a lot of songs, it is still very fun to use. P.S. If the developers are reading this, just an FYI is that the soprano Sax doesn't usually look like the alto and tenor and bari, it looks more like a clarinet, just a little tip in case you didn't know already. :)", "timestamp_updated": 1421292707, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420413952, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 17, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 14, "total_reviews": 31}}
