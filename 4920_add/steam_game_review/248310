I really did.  But the more I played it, the more I dissliked it.  When I play it now, I get a terrible pit in my stomach.  I was never a huge fan of Sonic when I was little, but I did enjoy his classic games.  My favorite game of the bunch was Sonic 3 and Knuckles because it had great graphics and gameplay and it told a story in a unique way: with no dialouge and the method of show, don't tell (keep that in mind when I talk about this game's story).  When I first heard of Freedom Planet, I thought it would be a good retro-style game, since it kinda looked like the classic Sonic games.\n\nFirst of all, let's discuss the game itself.  As you would expect, it's a good throwback to classic Sega Genesis and PS1 games.  The graphics are colorful and beautifully detailed, the music is catchy, and sound effects were satisfying.  However, the thing that matters most is gameplay, and I believe that was one of this game best features.\n\nAs with any 2D platformer, your goal is to run through large levels fighting enemies and collecting crystals for extra lives and then defeat a boss at the end.  It definatly captures the feel of classic Sonic while being original and the level design is pretty good.  They each have a different theme and a few gimmicks that make them interesting.  The bosses are definatly the best part, either being huge and menacing or avarage sized and fast.  They keep you on your toses and make you use the best of your abilities to take them down. \n\nYou have three characters to controll who each have their own unique abilities: Lilac can boost forward or diagonally up or down, double spin jump, and hair whip her enemies wirh different fighting moves.  Carol uses her claws for quick swipes and kicks and can grabe a gas can to get a motorcycle that lets her ram into enemies while attacking and lets her drives up walls.  Milla can flutter jump and create blocks to throw and a shield to deflect projectiles.  She can even combine the two together to shoor a giant laser.  You were also supposed to play as Torque and Spade at some point, but that idea never went through.\n\nI didn't see too many problems with the gameplay itself, but then they became more apparent as time went on.  For starters, the physics is a bit wonky.  Now usually, I have no problem with it, but the characters tend to stick to whatever surface they want, even ceilings.  Normally in a Sonic game, you need to be running fast to run up an incline, but in this game, if you keep moving forward, you'll make it up.  You can even walk up 90 degree angles, as if the characters have glue on their shoes.  \n\nThe three main girls have so many powers and abilites to use, but the enemies are pretty basic and go down easily.  Another thing to note is that enemies cannot hurt you by touching you; they have to be shooting something or performing an attack animation to inflict damage.  This idea sounds good on paper, but since this is a more speed-running oriented game, you can just run past the eneimes.  They're not obstacles that have to be overcome, they're a minor annoyance that can be ignored for the most part.  And even when they do pose a threat, they have annoying attacks that can take away half your health and bring the game's pace to a grinding halt.  This sort of thing works better in slower-paced games like Guacamelee, which encourages you to stop and fight enemies to rack up combos for better rewards.\n\nThere's no problem with having large levels, but the ones in FP drag on.  The game expects you beat them in about 5 minutes, but on my first playthrough, it tool me about a half hour to beat some of them!  Even as I got better, my time clocked in at about 10 to 15 minutes.  This would have been solved if the game divided the levels into two acts each, like in the classic Sonic games.  The music changes halfway between each level, so there souldn't be a reason not to split them up.  There's no real incentive to exploring, either.  No secrets to find, no upgrades, just those cards that unlock sound clips and concept art, which you can find easily by searching for them online and by hacking the game's files with Audacity.  You can find extra lives and a Chinese symbole that takes you to a minigame where you can get more lives and a shield to start the next stage with, but that's it.  Speaking of lives, their worthless.  You get unlimited continues and respawn at the last checkpoint, so when you lose all your lives, it's not a huge issue.  The lives were only there to emulate the retro style of classic games.\n\nI praised the bosses ealier, but these are where the game's difficulty spikes.  They have crazy attacks to doge, some of them being hard to avoid and able to drain your health fast.  One of the worst conenders is the Mega Serpentine boss from Final Dreadnaough 2.  He moves so fast and his attacks are just annoying.  He's also off screen most of the time, so it's hard to predict his attacks and act accordingly.  You will die many times to there foes before you figure out their patterns.  For example, the final boss, Brevon, has 3 phases, one that's a recycled ship boss from an earlier stage, another is when he turns into a giant robot; the most difficult phase.  Finally, he comes out of the robot and fights you one-on-one.  The very instant the fight starts, you have to jump, otherwise, he'll take away a huge chunck of health with a quick knife attack (this is not telegraphed, BTW).  Other than that, this is his easiest form and you can take him down pretty quickly if you've memeorized his attacks.  The first time fighting him, I died so many time, but after a while, I could beat all three of his phases on one life.  On hard mode.\n\nI often hear that this game is a fusion of Sonic and MegaMan, but I don't see it.  The enemies are not strategically placed like in a MegaMan game and those only thing that's taken from those games is Carol's wall jump.  It actually takes cues from other Sega Genesis games (and Super Mario Bros 2).  However, I'd rather play those games which this one takes inpiration from than this game.  This is a perfect segway into my main gripe with this game: The story.  See, all those other games followed this style of story telling: Show, don't tell.  When you play those games, you understand to story through pure gameplay, whether it's a major story event like a boss or it happens in the background.  When there are cutscenes, they're short and have little to no dialouge, letting the chatacter animations and facial expressions tell us what's going on.  However with FP, they did the worst thing possible for a paltformer and tried to tell an epic tale through voice acting and lengthy cutscenes (This isn't an RPG, people!).  I would have been fine with this, but the story is a sloppy mess with plot holes, ideas and scenes that go nowhere and only serve to waste time, and a tone that can't decide if it wants to be cute and humorous or edgy and serious.  One moment the three main leads will be having a girly slumber party and acting childish and the next thing you know it, one of them is being brutally tortured via electricution in a very realistic manner.  It's very jarring and it only make you angry and frustrated beyond any reasonable measure.  I get that some peole don't mind this and good on you people, but you can't deny that the story was the low point of the game.  Some of there cutscene last for a half hour!  Yes.  A half hour of nothing but exposition and pointless filler.  This is all in the Adventure mode.  You can choose Classic mode to eliminate all the cutscenes and have pure gameplay, but then you have no idea what's going on plot wise.\n\nOverall, Freedom Planet isn't a bad game, but it leaves much to be desired.  If you really want it, wait for a price drop and only play Classic mode, because the story is not worth your time. \n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1504994553, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504994553, "votes_down": 10}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1716, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "review_score": 9, "num_reviews": 7, "total_negative": 52, "total_reviews": 1768}}
