This game...[i] this game [/i]\nI desperately wanted to like this game, I really did... It's not a [i] bad [/i] game, but it's just so mediocre. I mean everything about it is just mediocre. For the sake of ease and for my own sanity, I'll try and explain what's wrong with this game by breaking it down into sections.\n\n[h1] Differences between browser version and Deluxe version [/h1]\nThe differences from the free version of this game are:\n[list]\n[*]Some minor UI changes\n[*]Additional costumes\n[*]Additional achievements and Super Eggs\n[*]Halloween content (five, admittedly fun, additional stages)\n[*]Ability to play in full screen\n[/list]\nPersonally, I don't think this constitutes tacking on the moniker \"DX\" to Dino Run. There simply isn't enough here that differs from the orignal to justify marketing it as the delux version of the game. At least not at it's current price tag, but I'll get to that later...\n\n[h1] Movement [/h1]\nThis game's controls are unresponsive at best and fighting the player at worse. The floaty movement of your dino combined with the wonky physics make for a thoroughly frustrating experience. Perhaps this was an intentional choice on the part of the developer, as it is highly reminiscent of the flash version. Maybe it's just me, but giving the player poor controls feels like a poor substitution for difficulty. It's one thing if that's one of the main selling points of the game (Titles like [i] I am Bread [/i] for instance) but this never struck me as one of the definable characteristics of Dino Run. \n\n[h1] Options and toggling [/h1]\nWhat you can do: \n[list]\n[*]Toggle going into full screen \n[*]Resize the window if you're not in full screen\n[*]Choose your game mode (challenge or speed run)\n[*]Toggle the difficulty\n[*]Customize your avatar\n[*]Turn on or off various cheats and mods\n[/list]\nWhat you can't do:\n[list]\n[*]Customize the controls\n[*]Adjust the framerate\n[*]Adjust brightness or other visual elements\n[/list]\nTo be perfectly honest, the lack of ability to toggle video options or framerate does not bother me. This isn't a particularly processor-heavy game. That being said, neglecting to include a key mapping option irks me. Your movement choices are WASD or the arrow keys. Spacebar/escape is pause. Shift to occasionally speed up. What if I want my speed boost to be the \"E\" key? What if I want to move with the \"r\" \"j\" \"q\" and \"b\" keys for some silly reason? This may seem nitpicky, but neglecting to include this one little bit of agency for the player reeks of laziness.\n\n[h1] User Interface [/h1]\nI want to stress that in listing the differences between the Deluxe and flash versions of this game I stated that there were UI changes [i] not [/i] UI improvements. The most noticeable change is in character customization. Rather than having to cycle through different hat choices and colors via clickable arrows, there are now 6 pages of icons to cycle through; it's not perfect but it's significantly more user friendly than it was. My favorite option of this customization menu is the auto-match feature; this matches the hat you select to a specific matching color combination for your dino. This is what was done right. \n\nNow for what was done wrong:\nNone of the outfits have names listed, as such you can't search for anything by keyword. Apparently I've unlocked the [spoiler] Speed Racer [/spoiler] and [spoiler] Small Pumpkin [/spoiler] hats. Which ones are they? I have some guesses, but I couldn't definitively tell you. So apparently the hats have names, the player just can't see what they are. \n\nThe list of hats can be organized into three possible categories: Classic, Indie, or Halloween. These options serve to sort the entire collection of hats in a different order depending on your category of choice. Where does one category end and another start? I couldn't say, as there are no descriptions. Also, I hope you like the hats, because once you pick one, you're wearing a hat. You can no longer go hatless. Maybe my dino's scalp is especially susceptable to sunburn or something.\n\n[h1] Multiplayer [/h1]\nIt's a ghost town. Multiplayer essentially doesn't exist.\n\n[h1] Single Player [/h1]\nIt's short and quickly gets boring. Yeah there are other worlds but the Halloween world is short (albeit a fun 7 minute romp through crazy) and Planet D is unplayable without having full stats.\n\n[h1] Game modes [/h1]\nChallenge or speedrun are your choices. Challenge follows the harrowing journey the harrowing journey that your Dino must undergo to reach shelter facing the end of the world. Speed run lets you choose between a selection of 24 levels with different weird twists to run through. Does one game mode sound more robust than the other? That's because it is. Speed run is a fun gimmick for maybe 20 minutes. Challenge mode has a life span of a few hours at most. While neither is packed to the brim with content, the challenge mode brings a bit more to the table. \n\n[h1] Improving your dino [/h1]\nYou can choose to upgrade speed, jump, acceleration, and strength. This is identical to the flash version. There was so much potential here. The developer could have expanded this upgrade tree and allow the player to go for different builds.  Maybe there would be more of a multiplayer community if the ability customization was a third as robust as the appearance customization options. Right now, its just a battle of numbers (assumming stats factor in, when playing multiplayer; I don't know since I can't find an opponent). Also, there is nothing to indicate what these different attributes do. I have a pretty good grasp of the first three (speed, acceleration, and jump), but strength? I think Boulders knock me around less or something? Like the other area of customization, the options lack explanation and make the players choices lack meaning\n\n[h1] Rewards and incentives for playing [/h1]\nDNA and bones. DNA lets you improve your stats and bones are currency...I guess. Bones allow you to purchase the levels in speedrun mode, so that you can actually play in speedrun mode. To be blunt it feels like forced content, but that's kind of how I feel about Speed Run mode as a whole. DNA is slow to come and a grind to get. There are a few achievements [called milestones] that award the player with DNA, but the big boons for DNA are finding the various Super-eggs strewn across the levels. Even with collecting these milestones and collectables, the player is still required to run the same levels over and over to try and improve their dino before they can even think about playing on higher difficulties. This gets old quickly. Even though things are \"Procedurally generated\" some two runs certainly feel the same, despite what the game claims. Different screens may be strewn together to create levels, but the choices feel limited and tend to blend together, regardless of which portions of a level spawn and regardless of sequence. I have a sneaking suspicion that \"Speedrun\" may be a glorified level select with some added wonky game features.\n\n[h1] Final words [/h1]\nI have more that I could say. A lot more, but character limitations prevent that. The worst part is, I'm a fan of Pixeljam! I've had a lot of fun with Gamma Bros, Rat mazes 1 and 2, and the browser version of Dino Run. I just was expecting more from a title with a $5.99 price tag. Six bucks may not sound like a lot, but I don't necessarily [i] have [/i] a lot to throw around. If this game were $1.99, I'd be more forgiving. I made this purchase because I wanted to support Pixeljam and I had high hopes for how they may have improved this game. Unfortunately, I'll have to file this one under \"regret.\" I'll return to it and play it some more, but it's sad to see my Dino exist in a perpetual state of mediocrity.", "timestamp_updated": 1499643727, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499643423, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "33397185", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500359", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507096309, "steamid": "76561197999585381", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A fun little arcade game where all you have to do is go from left to right.

It's everything I remember and more.\n\nGameplay is very simple. You're a dino, and you're trying to avoid the impending apocalypse, all the while collecting eggs and munching critters. By collecting the eggs and critters, you get upgrade points (DNA) to make your dino faster and stronger. It's a very simple system, although it can take quite a while to get all the DNA you want for the last few upgrades.\n\nThere's also two main gamemodes, the campaign and speedruns. The campaign has you move through several levels with limited lives. The speedruns have some gimmick attached, and you get one try or you're forced to restart. This version has more than the original browser game, and removed some that were somewhat unfair/boring.\n\nThe multiplayer works relatively well, and can be done with traditional gameplay or can be treated as a sandbox to mess around in. I haven't done too much of it but it works.\n\nControls are tight. You can run, jump, and crouch. You also have a activatable speed boost. The boost can upgrade depending on how much DNA you get, allowing the player to make some harder jumps or get up a hill faster. The difficulty is well balanced in all but a few speedruns on Intense difficulty and Intense Campaign, but if you're a good player and playing with a maxed out dino, it's managable with either a good seed or game knowledge.\n\nThere's plenty of achievements if that's your cup of tea, and the really catchy soundtrack can be unlocked by collecting a secondary currency called \"Bones\" (that also unlocks the speedruns).\n\nThe only complaints I have is that the game doesn't make the boost apparent to you unless you read the instructions (silly I know, but some people just skip by it assuming the game to be simple). Additionally, the physics engine can be a bit wonky. Sometimes some jumps get gimped because the slope is slightly angled, and there are a few spots in a few select seeds and levels where a rock or an enemy dino can push you through the floor (don't worry though, if you do, the game will let you fall for a while and you'll teleport to the top of the world). \n\nAll in all, this game is a great runner. With great gameplay, great music, functioning multiplayer, and lots of vanity options, it brought me back to my childhood playing it on the web.
