If a game has to give you an achievement every five seconds to keep you playing it then it is not worth your time. That is what I love about this game. It starts you in some fairly simple levels where you can get to grips with the controls. Then in the harder stages of the game it takes more and more thought to make a bridge that is under budget and that looks nice. In the world of bridge building simulators this one stands out for it is not like some that have levels that take a few seconds and you're done. You actually have to plan out how each bridge is going to deliver the vehicle \"safely\" to the other sides. Some require a lot of out of the box plans, but they leave you with a great feeling of success after making the bridge work. It was one of my first buys on steam and gave me hours of enjoyment.", "timestamp_updated": 1493068260, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493068260, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 24}}
