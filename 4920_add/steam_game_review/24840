That's how you could easily describe this game. As title of the game indicates, you will play as a member of the 82nd Airborne Division, which took part in many important operations of World War II, such as Husky, Neptune or Market Garden. There are only six missions in main campaign, which is really not enough in my opinion. But I must say that each mission is different and what makes this game truly special is freedom of choosing where you want to land. Once a parachute is opened, you're in. There are of course safe zones for landing, marked with green smoke, but you can decide to land somewhere else entirely, it's up to you. Gunplay feels somewhat clunky from the beginning, but it's just a matter of getting used to it. Your enemies can be really smart and deadly, but you will see the AI cheating a lot as well, for example soldiers shooting through solid obstacles and corners or spawning in groups behind your back. Level desing is really good, locations are open enough for you to experiment with different weapons and have fun while shooting Nazis and completing objectives, which you have always several of and you can complete them in any order you see fit. This level of freedom makes this game really enjoyable. But make no mistake, it's still a strictly linear shooter which you will complete during one afternoon. But there's a very high chance that you will enjoy the hell out of that afternoon, if you like shooter games or just games with WWII setting. \n\n7/10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506729586, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35316509", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198007095865", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506820580, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 124, "playtime_forever": 124}, "timestamp_updated": 1506729586, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's a beautiful game. The levels are pretty well designed and the graphics are good. The gameplay however suffers a lot from bugs. An enemy can take a shotgun blast to the face and not die. You try to shoot an enemy or throw a grenade and somehow you'll hit the corner of the wall. Hit detection is also awful. I've emptied entire clips at enemies and nothing hits them. It's like a stormtrooper simulator. There are many places where you can get stuck. And I mean like you can't move or get around an object because you'll partially walk through. Or you're trying to crouch to hide but it won't work because some other object or ledge is somehow getting in the way. Enemies however, can shoot through objects and walls and their accuracy is excellent. So it makes the whole game unfair. \n\nThe regular single player campaign is too short too. It's too bad that the producers of such games nowadays are relying too much on multiplayer gameplay to sell the game. The first couple of COD that happened during WWII were excellent compared to this in terms of campaigns and stories and missions.\n\nIf you've played COD, you probably will be disappointed with this game."}]}
