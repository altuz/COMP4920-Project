Yet It Trips Up At The End[/h1]\nSalvation Prophecy has some pacing problems. The beginning of the game is grating, working your way through the first few missions on land with no freedom. Then, suddenly, the game opens up with the addition of fighters and space dogfights. Easily the middle section is the best, hunting down bounties, destroying space stations and investigating mysterious wormholes. But then suddenly it all blows up in your face at the end, as you are in the middle of fighting the other space-faring nations as the leader of your faction. The ending of the game completely destroys pacing and ruins it for me; the horrible, ceaseless battles against an overpowered enemy frustrating and tedious. \nSo why do I still recommend this game? \nBecause I enjoy the lore behind the game, for one. I like learning about the android Wyr, the militaristic Drone Unity, the human Free Nations and the Salvation's prophecy. \nBecause the space battles are just so much fun when you are fighting an equally matched enemy, that doesn't come back every five minutes and drain your resources. \nBecause the middle game is some of the most fun I've ever had with a space-faring game, and it checked many of the boxes I wanted from a game like this - to be a cog in the machine, to be involved in large-scale galaxy wars, to dive and twist and turn around, to fire missiles, to upgrade my ship, to be promoted, to become somebody. \nAnd so I do recommend this game, but it comes with a warning. \nThe invasions at the end of the game take far too long to overcome, and their ceaseless repetition with barely any respite in between battles were rather irksome. But should you want an awesome dogfighter, a ground-warfare game, a game of galactic conquest, a game of occasional puzzle-solving, of alien-world delving, then Salvation Prophecy is right for you. \nI just wish I could recommend it more highly. \n\njmcone's [u]Personal[/u] rating:\n[b]Recommended[/b]", "timestamp_updated": 1492479347, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492479347, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32583546", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500907", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503237894, "steamid": "76561198076169747", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "playing as the salavation army felt like some tough charity work, but all and all the game is quite swell.", "timestamp_updated": 1497933667, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497933667, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31911419", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490964", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1495506688, "steamid": "76561197999072711", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "TL:DR = Salvation Prohecy's space flight is about as much like flying a space fighter as playing  the 1982 game \"Pole Position\" is like driving a Formula 1 racecar.\n\nFull disclosure: I only played this game for about an hour, but if you are looking for a space combat sim, read on to see why I only played for an hour.\n\nI started off liking the game despite the dated graphics and somewhat clumsy feeling controls.  The first couple of ground missions were very simple in nature, but I figured that is what they should be for the first couple of missions.  Then I got my first space fighter.  For my first space mission, I stuggled mightily with the controls.  I had to turn my mouse sensitivity (using my Logitech mouse software, not the game engine) WAAAAY down to prevent oversteer.  Once I got that down, I thought everything would be smooth sailing...I was WRONG!  The space combat is NOT a sim.  It is a very simplistic wannabe sim with the WORST controls in recent memory.  If you are going to give me a space fighter, I had better be able feel like I am flying the damn thing.  Even games that make space fighters fly like atmospheric craft, while completely unrealistic as far as Newtonian physics go, are at least FUN to play.  Sadly, Salvation Prophecy is not.  The space ships have a speed slider that is about as much fun to manipulate as the volume slider in your Windows system tray, and also exactly as responsive.  What I mean by that is there is very little (if there is any at all) in the way of acceleration in the space flight.  You set your speed with the thrust slider and your ship goes that speed instantaneously.  The motion of the ship feels like you are maneuvering through a thick jelly.  In short the space ship handling is like a crippled sloth that has had its reflexes slwoed to near comatose levels with a massive dose of Morphine.\n\nIn the end, space combat killed this game for me...killed it dead in less than an hour.  After playing though maybe half of the first space mission I immediately quit the game and uninstalled it.", "timestamp_updated": 1495508405, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495508405, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "33240078", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473870", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1385961821, "steamid": "76561198036954996", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Literally garbage.
