Otherwise, some of the puzzles will leave you wondering what the fuck to do next.\n\nIt's a good point and click and there are some parts that are extremely atmospheric. Some parts of the story will leave you scratching your head. Some parts aren't really explained, but it adds to the mistery. The ending doesn't really match with the rest of the game and it'll leave you, just like the puzzles, scratching your head.\n\nStill, the music is great, the atmosphere is tense and the documents really flesh out the world. There were a couple of times I had to pause because it was just too creepy.\n\nGet it discounted, but still get it.
