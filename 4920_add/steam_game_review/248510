Started playing Dominions 3, few monts later Dom 4 came out - moved to it.\nNow I'm playing Dominions 3 and enormousely enjoying it. Less spells, less magical items than in Dom 4 - somehow even more fun.\n\nWhy I like Dominions: \n\n1. Very interesting fantasy setting (not just elfes and other copies of Tolkien imagination) with Valkiries, armoured gorillas, ghouls, giants, chariots, eagle-men, bat-men, spider riders, raptor riders, fiery salamanders, armoured or undead elephants, giant ants, tiny dragonflies, barechested warriors, tritons with amber armour, hydras, halfblind cyclopes, nagas, twoheaded giants, liches, krakens, dragons, mechanical dragons, trolls, tengu, ghosts, lamias, jaguars, werejaguars, powerfull but insane gods, mages of various kinds,assasins, shark knights, Vikings with glamour, Aztects with flying ability and many, many more...\n2. Ingenious balancing of nations. Other games do balancing + variety this way: one side gets a sword and shield the other axe and a shield. Dominions does it like this: one side gets a sword and a shield the other gets a catapult and a sharpened stick :-)    and it works!\n3. No researching of buildings, basically there are only 3 buildings you can build in a province: castle, magical reaserch lab  and a temple. Less hasle with buildings and a refreshing change from the industry standard.\n4. Spells, spells, spells :-) starting from minor ones like fire flies (weak and available with no reaserch) to fire storm (burns everything on the battlefield that does not have full fire protection, requires a lot of reaserch and a powerfull fire mage).\n5. IT'S DIFFRENT.\n6. Challenging single player even after hundreds of hours of play.\n7. Great and athmosferic music.\n8. The battle set up: give orders to commanders, mages and units before battle; later during the battle you just watch how your orders interplay with orders given by your oponent: surprises guaranteed, especially in multiplayer battles. Many a time I was watching biting the nails, seeing how my main force was pummeling the enemy but my oponents flanking party was going for my commander - battle of Gaugamela all over again.\n9. Great community - higher IQ average than the many other games out there :-)\n10. Small developer firm with dedicated staff. Basically like Creative Assembly before they were bought with Total War series by Sega. Upgrades are free and regular, game works like a clock on day one, patches fix some mechanics you never even new existed, developers behave on forums like your friends: nice, profesional, informative and surprisingly patient towards the odd troll or idiot :-)\n11. Depth. 3 eras with circa 20 nations in each one, every nation has different soldiers (is hydra a soldier?) and commanders, some very usfull, some meh and some ridiculosly usless until that day when you find a use for them :-)    Hundreds of spells that can be divided in 3 categories: battlefield spells that have effect on a particular battle (relevant mage has to be present), rituals used on strategical map (for example ritual that summons wywern or mechanical men that you can use in later battles) and global rituals that have a major effect on the strategical map and the battles (for example global ritual that calls darkness and gives penalty to all units in battle that don't have the special ability darkvision). Hundreds of magical items (dwarven hammer is so  much better in Dom 3 than in Dom 4).\n12. The distinction between strategical map and tactical map and how both are working.\n13. The ideas inherent to the game and seen nowhere else e.g.: \nA. units get tired on battlefield and that makes possible for an army of pitchfork fielding peasants to overwhelm a small group of knights (even though initially the knights cut them in heaps) IF (very big if) there is enough of the peasants.\nB. bless effect that changes sacred units into even stronger ones and you can choose the bless effect at the start of the game.\nC. Dominion which is like the population strenght of faith in you, the Pretender God. Has effect on how many sacred units you can buy, how strong some global rituals are and on morale of your troops. Also as you are pretending to be a God (one of many) in the game, the added benefit is that no fundamentalist muslim can play the game :-)\nD. the way afflictions affect the units - especially extremal cases when you see a unit that is blind, cripled, weakened, with a chest wound and battle fright but still on the battle rooster.\n\nCould go on and on but 13 is my lucky number so...\n\nHere  http://www.illwinter.com/dom3/     you can find link to a manual - try to read a few pages at least.\n\nHere      http://www.moddb.com/games/dominions-3-the-awakening/forum/thread/dominions-3-demo1        you can find link to OLD DEMO OF DOMINIONS 3 - not sure if still works but it was great back in the days to get a taste of the game. Word of warning: do not play Kaliasa as nation unless you looking to get frustrated ALL the time, Arcosceptale is much better (chariots, massed chariots until you meet some giants)\n\nDominions 5 is going to be available from November so try Dominions 3 and if you like it, buy Dominions 5 in November and see you in multiplayer - watch out for my chariots :-)", "timestamp_updated": 1506172531, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506172531, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 51, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 61}}
