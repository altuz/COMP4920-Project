Didn't realize this was a phone game. Wish I hadn't bought it.\n\nMain gripe: say you plan an exquisite route for the mission. 50 waypoints with all kinds of fun tactical details added every step of the way. Then you decide you want to change something at # 20. If you click the wrong thing -- pretty easy to do, by the way, evidently, as it's already happened to me at least 3 extremely frustrating times in my short career -- you'll lose everything beyond that point and have to re-create it all. No \"Undo\" or \"Save/Load\" functions in sight. :(\n\nThere is no saving/loading of plans between sessions, either. i.e. Get it right, and beat the mission, now, or be prepared to re-create your whole plan again the next time you launch the game.\n\nAlso, compare to a game like Frozen Synapse. Not a perfect game, either, but one main thing that makes the whole \"plan then take-hands-off and execute\" thing work is that the run-throughs in that game are largely identical from run to run. In this game, you get different behavior out of the AI and even your own troops each time (accuracy of throwing FB for example; half the time they duff it and bobble it off the door and it lands at their feet!).\n\nFWIW I didn't have any preconceived notion about how this should work, but after seeing it work this way, in comparison to the Frozen Synapse way, I find this way to be lacking. You have a game that requires more extensive tweaks to your plan, and gives you a less-forgiving means of making those tweaks. Not good. I guess you have the advantage of: you can re-run the same bad plan over and over and maybe one day the AIs will have that happy random seed that will allow it to finally succeed. That's not how I want to approach the game, though.\n\nBottom line: phone game; your time is probably better spent elsewhere.\n\nP.S.: \"14 friends already own this game\".
