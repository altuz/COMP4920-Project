It's not as easy like an arcade and it can make you go in full tryhard mode.\n\nPros:\n- Really good cockpit view, i really liked the details on the cars interiors and the blur at high speeds.\n- Personally, i liked the effects but it can make you dizzy if you are not used to it.\n- Good variety of cars and upgrades.\n- A lot of events for each Tier (It gets repetitive, just like any racing game).\n- No problems at all with a Xbox 360 controller, you can change the triggers sensitivity in game.\n- Cheap on sale. (I got it with the EA Racing Pack).\n\nCons:\n- Some bugs when crashing to other cars.\n- Little frame drops when there's a lot of smoke on the screen.\n- Dumb AI only in Car Battles (From my experience)\n\nConclusion:\nReally fun game to play once in a while, if you like racing games with a challenge you have to play this one. \n\nForget the keyboard, you need to use atleast a controller IMO.\n\nPS: The AE86 it's very OP at drift events, even at higher tiers."}, {"votes_down": 15, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504954967, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470622", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "34834655", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197985125672", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1504954448, "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 906}, "timestamp_updated": 1504954967, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Whenever you want to start a new game (a new career) you are forced to watch a video that takes forever and there is no way of ending it.
