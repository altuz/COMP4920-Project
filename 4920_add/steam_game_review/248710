The gameplay is alright.  Controls are a bit awkward. Takes a little to get used to. Eg, aiming is not very accurate and requires you offset your cursor from the enemies a bit.  Many of the graphics are too dark to see correctly and much of the UI needs some fine tuning to look more polished.  Story is bland and voice acting even worse.  If you really love hack n slashes then this may be worth a couple bucks.  Otherwise go for Torchlight if you want a Diablo alternative.", "timestamp_updated": 1503187269, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503187269, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "review_score_desc": "Very Negative", "review_score": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 165, "total_reviews": 204}}
