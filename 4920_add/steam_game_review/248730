The meatboy stages are where the game shines.  Even the autoscrollers are interesting and challenging.  There is enough new here to make the game feel fresh and not just a rehash of its predecessors.  \n\nIt's not all good though.  The VVVVVV sequence stages are just terrible, the controls are laggy and frustrating.  Luckily it is a pretty small portion of the game.", "timestamp_updated": 1504734323, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504734323, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 133, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 31, "total_reviews": 164}}
