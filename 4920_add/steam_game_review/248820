Unfortunately it made my thoughts on the game even more justified. The difficulty in single player is almost absurb, with a large skill gap between easy mode and the next difficulty (seriously, I got about 4 levels of no enemies spawning, even sometimes during the teleporter waiting phases on easy, and then was completely overwhelmed within minutes on the next difficulty). The game is a bit better with friends as long as its stable, but that only lasts until you learn that there is a chance your save file may become corrupt, meaning your unable to save and stuck in a new game state. I've tried the many suggestions given to me through looking up help on this bug, but unfortunately nothing had worked.\n\nI know my experiences aren't the same compared to others, but while i was almost starting to enjoy the game, the corrupt save bug completely ruined any chance that I and any others who encountered this same problem would ever end up liking this game.
