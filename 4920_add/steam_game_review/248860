(when you ARE desperate, of course)\n    -You are not invincible :D encourages thinking before any action is taken\n\nCons:\n    -It takes learning (recepies) to survive (this is actually a pro for me since I like challenging games)\n    -Controls might be confusing in the begining\n    -Turn-based game so really need to be aware of energy and time\n    -You are not invincible D: [spoiler]It is perma-death[/spoiler]\n\n:) Hope you enjoy!", "timestamp_updated": 1504821038, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504821038, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35163613", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504340", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506137338, "steamid": "76561197999498341", "num_games_owned": 480, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 143}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Very deep and intriguing game made by someone who has never worn a hoodie or cargo pants in their life.\n\nThose clothes add some inventory spaces to stash items in the game, but the space isn't enough to fit a standard plastic water bottle.

I am not a fan of roguelikes, but the setting and the promise of a good story drew me in. What's worse than an RNG-powered permadeath game is an RNG-powered permadeath game with a faulty save system that randomly deletes your progress if you don't run the program every few hours. I hunted down the save folder, made copious backups, and had the so-thoughtfully-provided game wiki open in the background. I discovered through trial and error that the crowbar and lighter are your best friends. And when I accidentally beat the story of this game... it was underwhelming. The 18 hours spent swearing at both the game and my machine did not add up to a wall of text and an abrupt smash to credits. It required no skill to get to, just a pair of items easily obtainable/craftable anywhere in the world. My advice: just replay Fallout. Try a new build, crank the Game and Combat difficulties to Hard and Rough, self-impose a permadeath rule, and have at it. \n\nPros: It\u2019s a turn-based, post-apocalyptic RPG.
