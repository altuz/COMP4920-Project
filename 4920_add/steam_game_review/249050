That alone says something about how good this game really is.\n\nI still haven't beat Easy.\n\nI still love this ridiculously brilliant & elegant game.  I'd almost call it \"digital heroin\". \n\nIt hits all the right gaming thrill spots for me:  Action, tower defense, strategy, resource management, and lots more.\n\nMy only complaint:  Why won't Amplitude make a sequel or something very similar?", "timestamp_updated": 1505101617, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505100606, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35029935", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507762", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505671602, "steamid": "76561198067359292", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very, very good game.\n\nThis game is something any tower defense and roguelike gamer would love... but is not exactly my type, I am not really good at RTS games.\n\nThe game is HARD, the fact that the rooms are randomized sometimes screws you over when you find the exit door only at the last possible room. I have only one successful run and mostly is because I got lucky at the last level finding the exit relatively soon.\n\nNot only that, you WILL need to read a couple of tips and tricks to know some of the mechanics of the game as well as what the skills do (like operator) and what to aim for, if you dont balance your party correctly you will lose.\n\nAlso, even a minor screw up during the round might lead to you losing since resources have to be managed a lot. And if you are feeling masochistic there is even harder modes and harder \"mods\" to change the game. Also each succesfull run takes a LONG time to be completed and if you screw up, its all the way back to the start...\n\nIts a good game and I recommend it, just is not exactly what I am looking for. If it was a bit more forgiving granting at least a save point every 3 levels (one that allows you to continue, not just save to take a break, then delete the savepoint) I would be more inclined to continue playing, but each failed run is very frustrating specially once you have reached a high level.\n\nIf you feel joy when a game treats you like a dirty peasant (similar to Xcom does with Ironman mode)  and like RTS and tower defense, this is for you.", "timestamp_updated": 1505672530, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505672201, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34749142", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507211", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504581489, "steamid": "76561198031008463", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Addicting but frustrating, Dungeon of the Endless reminds me of Age of Empires (back when it was good) minus the 'you can build your own troops when the others die' aspect of the game.\n\nAt the start of your game, you choose up to two Heroes whose main job is to explore a randomly generated dungeon until they find the exit.  Once said exit is found, you assign one Hero to carry the Crystal (a power source for your former ship) to the exit while under the assault of an infinite wave of enemies.\n\nDuring your quest to find the exit, though, you have been given Dust, which let's you power a limited number of rooms to keep enemies from spawning in them ala Minecraft (It's dark, therefore monsters appear here when ever they feel like it) and the option of building ONE Resource Generator (Sciene, Industry or Food) in some of the rooms.  Food lets you level up your Heroes, heal your Heroes and recruit new Heroes; Science let's you discover new technologies that make surviving the Mad Dash to the exit easier; and Industry lets you build said resource generators and various butt-saving technologies.  These three resources increase every time you open a door to a new room.\n\nNow, for those of us whose gaming mentality can best be described as \"kill everything that is not one of my allies and don't leave until it's all dead\" Dungeon of the Endless is going to kick your butt to next Tuesday.  The whole point of this game is to make a clear, straight path between point A and point B and running like HECK! (Yes, I am censoring myself because the little Steam Hearts annoy me)  The more doors you open, the more danger you put your Heores in.  Yes, there can be rewards for exploring EVERY room on a floor, but every new room that cannot be lit has the chance of spawning baddies, and the higher the floor the more powerful the baddies are.\n\nStill, if you like resource management, strategy and defence games, Dungeons of the Endless will be great for you.  If you tend to Rage Quit when something does not go your way, you will absolutely HATE this game.  Still, the concept is unique enough that I have to recommend it.\n\nOh, and for some reason, the creative team named the difficulty levels for the game \"Very Easy\" and \"Easy.\"   I think this is freaking brilliant, because when you die two rooms into the first level on \"Easy\" every molecule in your body that has been conditioned since Duck Hunt to know that \"Easy\" means there is no way your can lose unless your controller is dying will demand you keep playing just to prove that 'no, you don't stink at playing video games, yes, you ARE as good a gamer as you know you are, and yes, the game is stupid! and you can beat it with your eyes closed.'
