From moving bits and baubles around to indicate where you want to explore, to blood stained pages in the diary to mark bloodshed, it\u2019s the small things that bring the game to life. You advance the turn an hour by clicking on a watch.\n\nThe custom content generator in the game goes a long way in keeping things enjoyable. You can add your own characters, complete with custom images and occupations. You can also create your own locations and items. \n\nInteractions between survivors is the biggest selling point of [b][i]Zafehouse: Diaries[/i][/b]. Each character is randomly generated, and each one has a prejudice against another group. One might hate the lower class, while another might find educated people snobbish. The relationships between survivors degrade quickly, but can be boosted by spreading a rumor once a day. It becomes a juggling act keeping everybody together. If relationships fall too much then fistfights will start breaking out, and sometimes those fights can end with nasty cuts - or worse.\n\n[b][i]Zafehouse: Diaries[/i][/b] isn\u2019t a great strategy game. But it is a good story generator, and as long as you can make that distinction it offers hours of entertainment.\n\n[B]THE GOOD[/B]\n- Three different game modes\n- Graphics are immersive and bring life to the story\n- Random events keep things from becoming too monotonous\n- Custom content generator\n\n[B]THE BAD[/B]\n- The audio quickly gets annoying\n- Lack of in-game options to change sound levels\n- Negative relationships sometimes feel over-the-top\n\n[h1]7/10[/h1]\n\nDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | [b][u]GOOD[/u][/b] | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE", "timestamp_updated": 1501073568, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501073568, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 147, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 76, "total_reviews": 223}}
