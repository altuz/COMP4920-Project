At its current state, The Castle Doctrine is unplayable due to its extremely low player-base. Although the game is rogue-like and unforgiving, two of its qualities that contribute to an intense and immensely enjoyable experience, the game is dead. Unfortunately, the developer refuses to put the game up for sale, which is a foolish decision on his part, especially considering all of the hard work that must have went into conceptualizing and developing the game. If a lack of players isn't something that phases you, buy the game and try your hand at robbbing the few houses that remain. If you'd prefer a game with a more active population, I suggest looking elsewhere.", "timestamp_updated": 1503441076, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503441076, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 90, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 139, "total_reviews": 229}}
