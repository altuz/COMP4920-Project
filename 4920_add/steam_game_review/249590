Thankfully... your hero knows something ... erm... simply what to do, where to go (I still dind't get what who why). But that doesn't matter. Truly.\nWhat is important that this game have a very good level desing. All puzzles / traps are based on magnetism / gravity tasks and have a logical solutions. Also all boss fights have its own  pattern, which is readable and possible to foresee.\n\nThere is only ONE BIG BAD thing.\nYou have no health bar. No heart (Rayman or other \"lives\" style), etc.\nSo... when You did a mistake You are dead. And You can repeat the last passage of the game again.\nDuring gameplay it isn't so bad. Until... during boss fights its really annoying. Especially if it takes more time to defeat the boss.
