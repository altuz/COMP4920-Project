No Xbox360 pad support. Art assets get distorted when manually selecting a widescreen resolution. \n\nWave based game has balance issues with foes either not doing enough damage to penetrate shields while kiting or large bulletsponges that do ton of damage. A lot of sprites are just untextured black space with untextured neon 3D geomtric shapes floating in them which was odd. The campaign mode does a good job of gradually introducing you to the user interface but it is not really tempting to grind missions and do the tedious travelling from place to place on such a limited ambitions title when you could sink the hours in an experience that is actually worthwhile.", "timestamp_updated": 1504037265, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504037265, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 13}}
