The atmosphere, the lighting, the music, and the art are all spot on.  It reminds me very much of Ultima Underworld (a favorite from my childhood) and the developer has stated that was one of its primary inspirations.  I typically don't enjoy rogue-likes (terrible name for a mechanic imo).  I think my reason being is that I haven't played one that ever felt balanced, or fair.  They're typically too luck based.  Players often defend them as being more \"difficult\".  But often it ends up being a dice roll for the correct drop, or series of events to make advancement even possible.  I personally don't have the patients to re-roll until a game seeds correctly.  This game doesn't exhibit that quality.  To be clear, you will die.  But it won't be underserved.  I haven't died yet in a way where I was able to blame the game.  It's always been my fault.  Generally my cause of death is self immolation (don't underestimate the blast radius of your fireballs). Another general complaint I have about rouge-likes are that levels tend to not feel well designed.  They feel like they've been generated.  The levels in this game strike a really good balance between random and designed, in a way that gives the game good replay-ability.  Also the death animations are especially good :)", "timestamp_updated": 1505520396, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505500095, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35249257", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500042", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506630780, "steamid": "76561197970372066", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Delver is my favorite 3D roguelike at this time.
