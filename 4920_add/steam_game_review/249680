It succeeds at the first admirably, and as a result, hopefully the second happens.\n\nThe game is shamelessly a God of War clone, right down to having 4 weapon types, 4 magic types, one attached to each weapon, and even the identical backwards rolling animation done by flicking the right analog stick to dodge. But rather than try to mimic the grand 'epic' sense of scale, Marlow Briggs takes the combat and sets it into an explosion filled, action packed cinematic adventure full of lighthearted sidekicks (who happen to be floating death masks) and comically evil villains complete with maniacal laughter, making for an enjoyable, tongue in cheek experience.\n\nPresentation is pretty basic, and music serves to be a cinematic backdrop rather than emotional in its own right. The game follows the plot of the evil villain Heng Long, who has discovered ancient Mayan secrets and is using them to take over the world. Our hero, Marlow Briggs, is attacked while trying to help his girlfriend, and is killed, only to be ressurected by the Mask of Death and granted supreme slaying powers as the Sacred Warrior. What follows is a 5-8 hour spetcacle of runnnig through oil rigs, ruins, mountains, and volcanos, blowing up everything in your path. The plot could probably be predicted from second one of the game, but that doesn't really mar the game.\n\nCombat works exactly like God of War, with canned light and heavy attack combos, and weapons that level up as you earn XP based off of actions in the game - from killing enemies, to landing high combos, to collectables found in the world, to orbs picked up for completing time based challenges. Weapons and Magic are levelled up to learn new combos, increase damage, and up your total Health and Mana. I was able to completely max myself out by the second to last level of the game by abusing the whip weapon's massive multi hit mechancis to squeeze tons of extra XP out of fights via high combos. Afterwards, though, the final Hammer weapon becomes the only weapon of choice to use, as unfortunately, later enemies become such damage sponges that the best way to deal with them expediently is to constantly hitstun them over and over again with massive hammer smashes. The game is extremely liberal with magic and health refills, so don't be shy about using your big magic attacks and ranged hits to erase groups of enemies from existence.\n\nPlatforming is minor, and double jumps and later,a glide mechanic, allow for impressive distances to be covered. Puzzles are minor as well, mostly being timed block pushing and platform creating. Even God of War had more complex puzzles, and for the most part, that's really saying something. The platforming and puzzle bits really mostly serve to break up the action and give you a chance to grab life and mana refills, and grab some XP collectables strung around the area in the form of colored death masks that gives life, mana, or XP, based on their color (red, blue, or gold). There's also twelve hidden Blue Masks to find, for the achievement hunter. Most of them are pretty out of the way, and don't grant anything besides an achievement for 1 and an achievement for all  12, so if you really want them, I just suggest using a guide.\n\nLong enough to tell its story and keep the experiences fresh and coming, short enough to not overstay its welcome and bid you goodbye with a sequel teaser that would be straight out of a crazy action movie that you hope will come but probably never will, Marlow Briggs, for $4.99, is an action game experience that shouldn't be mmissed, if you're a fan of the God of War stylr genre.", "timestamp_updated": 1499904898, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499904898, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "33475844", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504196", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1493099119, "steamid": "76561198263128427", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Got it for pretty cheap.
