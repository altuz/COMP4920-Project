The A-Train series has been published since 1985, and was the first game of its kind! It inspired Maxis to implement the isometric perspective in SimCity 2000! It has been a very long time since A-Train received a US release, since A-Train is developed by Artdink in Japan. The most well-known US release was published by Maxis in 1992. A-Train has a very large learning curve, but when you accomplish the basics through repetition. It can be a rewarding experience! As with any simulation management game, each one varies in difficulty and has to be approached with a clear mindset. No references can be made, or confusion is inevitable! A-Train 8 has simple mechanics in theory, but can have very complex behavior at times with certain situations. \n\nFirst, you must build a simple passenger line from point A to point B. This system can be built anywhere on the map (unless you are trying to accomplish a scenario). Purchase a basic commuter train and place it at any section of track that is straight. Let the train make full stops at each station (which will be done automatically, unless you command it a specific route). When this occurs, the passenger line will attract people and businesses to your railroad. \n\nNow that you have people swarming to you transportation services, they need materials to build houses and offices. Next, you will build a \u201cmaterials factory\u201d near your passenger line. You can choose the size of the factory, but larger the building does not produce any faster or better. Larger factories just have more lot space for storage. Materials factories produce \u201cmaterials\u201d which are used to build structures and houses for you town.[i] Tip: material factories only produce materials on weekdays; Saturday and Sundays they are closed.[/i]\n\nYou can combine passenger and freight systems together on 1 rail system, but I see at times they are more efficient if you separate them (costs more money to build extra track though). Build a separate freight line to deliver the newly produced materials. Build another station next to the material factory and one of the passenger stations (for now, point A station we previously built), then build the new rail towards point B. At point B build a \u201cmaterials depot\u201d anywhere near the station. This is where the newly developed materials will be stored for you citizens to use.\n\nOnce all these basic systems are in place, your town will now start to developed and eventually turn into a giant metropolis! You can help further the growth and development of your city by purchasing company owned buildings and structures; when placed properly can earn you extra money. If you continually build more passenger stations around your small town, it will attract more and more people and businesses. Larger the rail system, the more volume of passengers it can handle. \n\nAnd that is the basic mechanics of A-Train! If you need more information on how to play, I found a tutorial at their website: http://www.railwaysims.com/support\n\n\n\nDated graphics, but not the worst. It accomplishes more in gameplay than visuals. Some mechanics need detailed explaining, but once you learn how they function then it makes sense.

Now, being Japanese is important, because they have not been following the western developments of user interfaces. Specifically, nothing is intuitive and works as you'd expect. You can't just click on a train to get information, not even in the train list information window. No, in order to get information about anything, you must know exactly which window to open. The graphics in this game are just that, graphics. They have nothing to do with gameplay. A small city can bring much more passengers than a large one and there is no hint as to why.

I was a bit hesitant to purchase A-Train 8 as it looks dated, the GUI feels awkward and the reviews and overall player feedback seemed mostly negative. But I played the time-limited demo, and even if one hour is a bit short to get a good feel of the game, I ended up purchasing it.\n\nThe game has quite a learning curve, and trial and error is very expensive, so you\u2019ll probably botch your first attempts. There isn\u2019t much of a tutorial, the provided documentation is useful but minimal, and I found very little help on the web. The interface is functional once you get used to it, but not very intuitive and it doesn\u2019t provide much feedback about what you can and cannot do. Finally, the track building is rather restrictive, as there is only one turn radius possible, and that\u2019s a bit frustrating at times.\n\nThat being said, I am really happy with this game, and I am glad I bought it. The mechanics are simple (dispatching building materials and tweaking train schedules) but designing an efficient and profitable network is a challenging task. Watching the city grow and the numbers add up in response to your actions is very satisfying. The visuals are simple, but I like the style and it makes the game perfectly smooth on my mid-range video card, with everything maxed up on high resolutions, even when the screen is filled up with large buildings. I haven\u2019t encountered any bug so far, and the game runs fine in windowed mode and allows unconstrained resizing.\n\nIt is a game that will not suit all tastes, and I think it takes time to start appreciating it.
