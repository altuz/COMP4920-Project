Finished the campaign on 'Normal' difficulty in like 6 hours which then gives you the chance to play the campaign over again on 'Intermediate' etc with the chance to get better items which is fun. The game lets you upgrade and add perks onto the items which is a nice feature too.\n\nIf you're going to play this game, play with friends, it's fun as hell!", "timestamp_updated": 1502107711, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502107711, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33335199", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495989", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499245238, "steamid": "76561198032350390", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The voxel art style is cute, but there's only one town, and there aren't many fun places to explore just for the sake of looking around at things.

The story is extremely phoned in, and although there are a few amusing jokes, it's not nearly enough to make the experience satisfying overall.  My recommendation would be that you save your time and avoid this game, unless you just really enjoy mindless, repetitive dungeon crawling, and you can't afford to buy a more polished dungeon crawler (like Diablo III or something)", "timestamp_updated": 1499411259, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499411259, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 274, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 45, "total_reviews": 319}}
