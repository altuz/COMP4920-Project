This is the exception though. I have been playing this game for years. I have more hours than shown on steam. I have been regularly checking in to see the game's progress. Somehow, it has gotten worse than when I got it years and years ago. As in, the core mechanics don't even work correctly anymore. The transition into beta was the worst thing I saw from this game, as they improved on absolutely nothing substantial. Up until I played it today, I have been extremely excited and happy with the developers. I have always been optimistic with where this game was going. I always had faith that they would actually do something with the game. All they have done is pretend to make progress with the game. The largest things they have done with the game follows: \n\n1: Made horribly designed campaigns with cheesy stories revolving around an edgy \"badass\" whose only real method of combat later in the game is to hop around and jump off of things heads...again...and again....and again...\n\n2: Changed the UI and menus to look different, while adding an incomplete game mode.\n\n3: Decided against the game mode, removing it, and changing the UI and menus to look different to make it look like they are making real changes to the game. Also adding another broken and incomplete game mode.\n\n4: Repeat 3... again. I don't know how much they actually did this, but all I know is every time I would check on the game, this had happened.\n\n5: They have actually changed things with the level designing tools they have provided to people that want to make levels. However, while doing this, they have been designing their own levels I talked about in my first point. Also, they are all changes that in no rational mind, should take priority over the core mechanics (that they have slightly managed to break) and structure of the game itself. This would be fine in 2008-2012 when the game was first made. I mean this game was released in 2008, and they somehow made the mechanics work worse now than when it was made.\n\n\nA big issue I am having is that the game's mechanics have become obsolete, and those are currently the only positives the game has. The game, until recently, has felt very unique with the combat system, and I have spent countless hours in the arena mode, as well as playing tons of player made maps and challenges. The game had loads of potential, and has been very fun regardless of the fact that it never came close to meeting its potential. That being said, the game is becoming obsolete. With the release of games like Absolver, which in it's open beta was more fleshed out than Overgrowth, Overgrowth has fallen behind. Absolver plays like Overgroth, but has an ENTIRELY customizable moveset, far less bugs, a real campaign, a multiplayer, costs the same amount, and developers that have made more good changes in 2 days than these guys have made in years. I can only imagine that more games like that are going to start popping up. The mechanics that made this game fun, are easily achievable in other games now. This game was years ahead of its time. The problem is it never progressed, and time caught up with it.\n\nI cannot, and probably never will be able to, recommend this game to anyone."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": true, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505590296, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498699", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35005286", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198125902498", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505589993, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 390}, "timestamp_updated": 1505590296, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's incredibly unfinished.
