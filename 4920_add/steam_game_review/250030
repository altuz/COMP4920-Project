It has a simple story; Lilly encounters an odd scarf-looking piece of cloth, which springs to life and takes her brother away. With the help of her glasses, which teleports her to another time when she wears them, she has to follow the scarf and save her brother. It's concise, never wastes your time and unlike some other adventure games, all the puzzles actually make some sense. It's a really good example of how to make a game short and sweet, and actually use that to the game's advantage by keeping only the really good elements, with no need to \"fill\" with unnecessary content. This makes for a slim and very well executed game overall, with a good interaction between premise, drive and pacing.\n\nHowever, as many other reviews have said, the ending is quite abrupt. I think we get enough information to imagine what happens next, but it is quite a cliffhanger. This might put some people off, but in my opinion the journey is good enough to make it worth it in the end. Well worth the buy.", "timestamp_updated": 1500046436, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500046436, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 73, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 16, "total_reviews": 89}}
