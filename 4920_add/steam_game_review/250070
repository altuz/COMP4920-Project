By chamber 10, you find your long lost daughter, so she can walk around in a big cube with you too. This is exactly how accurate the storyline gets by playing the first ten miuntes of it, then again thats all you need to see to figure out if this game is right for you. If it's on sale for like $3.00, buy it, open up a six pack or light up a doobie and laugh your ass off as you try to get through some of the more advanced chambers that require more strategic button mashing. Overall, the game keeps you entertained if you're under the age of 7, enjoy no storyline, and you enjoy the same gravity and lava combination in every chamber. The reason why I'm recommending this game is because it wouldn't be a bad buy for the price of a candy bar because there's simply not much else to the game other than what you experience about fifteen minutes into it.", "timestamp_updated": 1422589617, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422589617, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "18023638", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511773", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503012449, "steamid": "76561198140299850", "num_games_owned": 1211, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "So, you think you're pretty good with a controller, do you? Here's your chance to prove it. \"TorqueL\" is a \"controller ONLY\" game, and while it's a simple game for anyone to play successfully, to exceed one must be a controller MASTER!\n\nThe goal is simple, and common, enough. Move yourself, a figure in a small, box, from point A to point B. (I haven't played much over an hour or so, and I presume the game becomes far more complex that what I will have the experience to describe.) The box can roll by means of the left stick. But the box can also be launched in any direction. And not just four directions, but conceivable ANY of 360 degrees. Each side of the box has a color which corresponds to a controller button. Pressing that button rapidly shoots out a \"rod\", sending the box in the opposite direction. But should you desire, any combination or number of the four buttons can be pressed. This allows an average (or less) player such as myself the option to suspend the box in space in potentially dangerous locations, allowing me to plan and act slowly and with caution.\n\nDangerous, I said? Yes, since every \"pool\" (maybe not, since they can also be on the ceiling) of red is deadly, and any contact will cause instant death, and make the level restart automatically. Fortunately, the button-generated rods can be held, freezing them in an extended position. A Controller Master can no doubt FLY across a layout, never pressing any but THE perfect button as they roll and fly. I can't, so I'll press all buttons as necessary, and carefully control the buttons and the stick to slowly move the box into the best, next position. But apparently time is tracked, cumulatively, so speed is very much a factor.\n\nBut there's more to \"TorqueL\"! There are also areas that change the direction of gravity (more like \"Super Goo Goo\" than \"Gravity Error\", both very worthwhile games.) Not necessarily just up and down reversals, but horizontal as well. And several of these areas can be alongside each other, creating a situation requiring great skill indeed!\n\nI notice on the Store Page trailer that at a further point a family element is added to the box, so I presume some form of story may be involved. The Store Page references 50 levels, seven basic routes and one secret route.\n\nTorqueL IS a fun game, and I learn something about control on pretty much every level. Once I gain comfort with the controller (which I intend to) I should be better able to play other controller games as well. I got TorqueL at discount, about $7US, and even that was a bit high. As much fun as this game is, I fear most players would feel $10US is quite high, compared to similar arcade/puzzle games. (I say \"similar, but nothing is \"comparable\".)
