Blockland is a very interesting blocky sandbox game with many things you are able to do in it. And I liked it. Emphasis on \"liked.\" While it had a bit of popularity back in the older days, nowadays it feels somewhat... dead. I do remember playing on various sandbox servers, messing around with friends, building simple stuff (because I honestly kind of sucked). It was fun! It really was. But then friends stopped playing it, lost contact with said friends (because I didn't have them added to anything), and well... sort of found other things that were better.\n\nCompared to Roblox, which is sort of designed for a different, and possibly younger player base, I find it a bit more mature and well rounded. Which is probably why I enjoyed it more.\n\nIt's a cool game, I assure you. It has lots of possibilites with mods and friends. Heck, now that it is on Steam you can play easily with friends. And the art style is awesome because it reminds me of LEGOs. But, again, I've lost interest due to the current path it is taking. I do recommend it to people who love blocky sandbox games with lots of possibilities.
