It's simply brilliant to stand firm against hordes of the undead together with one friend.\n\nGreat little title with more than fair pricing for content that lasts for at least 30 hours.", "timestamp_updated": 1505143481, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505143481, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35432455", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506994482, "steamid": "76561198074031391", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 680}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great games. but sadly keep crashing on my pc.", "timestamp_updated": 1506994576, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506994576, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34942123", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501010", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1478101286, "steamid": "76561198099226298", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Impressive game with small budget but it still good game.", "timestamp_updated": 1505362741, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505362741, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35096460", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500620", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506453313, "steamid": "76561198204424117", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I just happened to find this game just browsing the store and decided to give it a try.
