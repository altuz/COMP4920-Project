HEY JERRY, THIS SEEMS A BIT HARSH!)\n\nStory:\nWell this is easy. There is none. An MMO has to have a purpose other than just run around and kill things. This can be improved on and needs to be acted upon fast.\n\nSoundtrack:\nThe soundtrack is awesome! I'll give you that. The chiptune sounds in this make the music stand out and feel like 4 NES consoles battling to produce the best sound. This is one of the only high points.\n\nArt / Sprite work:\nThe sprites in this game are well drawn apart from the default main character. It's a little bit too plain for my liking. You could've put a shirt and some pants on the guy and I would've liked it more but just plain white is kinda boring.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game controls poorly and has a weird \"momentum\" mechanic in it that changes your speed between two different settings. The first setting is really slow and the first setting makes you feel faster than Sonic the Hedgehog. The thing is weird and using E as the interact button really messed with my head because I was trying space bar and Z and X and everything. E was my last guess.\n\nPOSITIVES -\n* Good Soundtrack\n* Decent Spritework\n* Great Server Connectivity\n\nNEGATIVES -\n* Poor Controls\n* No Story\n* Confusing Mechanics\n* Perspective Issues\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nThis is just my opinion.
