The game is no cargo cultish retro experience which is so common in the modern crpg, rather for good and bad it plays just like the classics. \n\nIt also means no map to guide you and no hints to hold your hand as you wander into highly dangerous areas filled with newcomer slaughtering monsters. Combat itself can come down to who gets in the first crossbow bolt to the head and many reloads of frustration depending on how you play. \n\nThe character system demands specialization which goes against the modern day \"see it all and do it all\" sandbox style so common now and as such it provides the chance to create really bad characters that force you to restart hours after you've made the fatal error.\n\nThe story can get a little out there, but I appriciate the fact that it makes no attempts to be philosophically deep and meaningful, it gets the job done and in this day and age that's a tall order for a crpg to make. It's also quite the long game, sure to keep your busy for a time even if you don't need to reroll. So if you've let this one slip by you and you consider yourself a fan of the old isometric style crpgs then this one is worth checking out.

However, it does suffer quite a bit from a few key points. The level cap is 25, so don't expect to get to do everything you want on a single play through of the game. You just won't have the points to be able to put into it all, and you can NOT respec your character. You'll have to start a new character and a new game to get to do some of the crafting or whatever you leave out in the first play through. Character builds are important, but in Underrail they're... all important. As in, it is absolutely vital to build your character properly. If you make a mistake in building your character, that's it. There is no going back, unless you have a great many saves and you don't mind redoing a lot of what you've already done, in order to be able to put those leveling points elsewhere in order to correct your mistake. Some kind of trainers in the game (say an NPC that you can pay or quest for) that could teach you and give you some skill points, would have been an excellent addition to this game. \n\nBut there is nothing like that, and I can't stress enough with how stuck you are with your decisions. Again, there is no going back, ever. Another thing has already been covered by everyone, but there is no map and a map is REALLY called for in this game. Best you've got is online maps, from which you can work things out, but its something of a hassle and you're still going to be working a lot of it out on your own. Don't expect to not have to consult the internet on where to go, or how to find that difficult location. Because there is no map in game. Those are the only 2 real problems I had with the game. Given its release date, better graphics would have been appreciated, but the game doesn't suffer too much without them. You can imagine a slightly improved Fallout 2 in terms of graphics, and you'll have what this game looks and feels like. Despite these issues, Underrail is well worth playing, and well worth the money. If you like old school turn based RPG's, you should not skip Underrail.
