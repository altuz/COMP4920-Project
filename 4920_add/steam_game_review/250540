And here are the reasons why... I saw it about half a year ago. It was supposed to be a downloadable release on xbox 1 maybe 360... anyway, the sprites and enemies were the same however the background has drastically been changed from a lucius HD platform to a pixelated pile of dog doo doo. I understand that this is a early access game or whatever but I purchased it on sale for half price and it still isnt worth any money. Its an unfinished demo, not even, a taste of what the game might be like if it ever comes full circle. Which it prob. wont. Dont miss understand, I really like where the game is going, and I hope it gets finished, but I cant help but feel that some of these smaller game developers are slowly watching their dream slip between their fingers so they throw whatever they can at the community to scrounge whatever money they can out of the \"burnt-out\" project their shoveling on real fans. Games like Mighty No. 9, CHASM, games I want more then anything to be realized, to become lies and trickery. This game has been around way to long to not be finished by now.

I don't mine Rogue-Likes if there's a point to it.  This game is quite pointless, however, as the difficulty in missions make no sense early on.  There's no real way to earn any progress, the store where you're supposed to upgrade your units is broken, and there are far too many glitches to count.  At one point, my character got stuck in the far-right, bottom of the screen and is completely unable to do anything.
