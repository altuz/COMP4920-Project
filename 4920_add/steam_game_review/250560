If you can get this for $2 or less, it's probably worth that.  If you want a massive grind game, this is it.\n\nSeveral hours in to a game with literally thousands of maps to play, and I find myself bored.  The scenery changes but the core gameplay hasn't.  The speed of leveling feels like the original EverQuest.  Two days of playing and I'm level 6 of 60.  I've unlocked one new ability, and I'm otherwise indistinguishable from a brand new character.  I feel like I've made no progress at all with my time investment.\n\nIt's not even necessarly character progression that's the problem either, it's a lack of depth.  The 4 classes play almost identically. They're so homogeneous they even start with the same equipment as opposed to some class-specific gear.  Equip your weapon of choice and either get in melee range to spam the same button, or stay at range and spam the same button.  It's too monotonous.  The only depth comes in the form of class specific skills, but depending on the map you may not get to use those much at all if the creator neglects to include potions.  This plays like a mobile game, not a desktop one.\n\nIf you're looking for a 10-point rating, I'd say this is a 5.", "timestamp_updated": 1506815101, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506815101, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35468317", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1446397461, "steamid": "76561198143114685", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "ye", "timestamp_updated": 1507113578, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507113578, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 495, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 123, "total_reviews": 618}}
