The atmosphere is really good, because the level design is great and you're in fact playing a 2 years old child, crawling through a house at night that makes coats in a closet look like huge scary monsters. Sadly it's never more than \"neat\". There's a monster in this game, trying to catch you, but it's extremely easy to avoid, not scary at all and really just ridiculous to look at. Getting caught has literally no impact except for a 10 second \"game over\" screen, then you'll start at the same point again. This is NOT a horror game, it really isn't. But the way Among the Sleep uses its level design makes for an interesting approach to story telling.\n\nJust don't expect an especially creative story or challenging gameplay. The puzzles are ridiculously easy, maybe not even worth being called puzzles. It's more of a walking simulator, to be honest, with extremely bland linear gameplay. Don't play this if you're not a fan of atmospheric games, you'll be bored endlessly.", "timestamp_updated": 1505745806, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505744119, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34995492", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499174", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505250216, "steamid": "76561198095666695", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A cute and nice little game where you view everything from the eyes of a child, my only problems with the game is the scares are not that scarey really and the \"monsters\" are easily avoided, not really giving a challenge", "timestamp_updated": 1505564343, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505564343, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34833893", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493173", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504951694, "steamid": "76561198022829029", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The game is a series of very simple puzzles, always using 2 or 3 same mechanics.
