A parody of several different mainstream series at once, and a pastiche of the gameplay of those and other, completley unrelated games that should by all rights fall apart entirely, but somehow manages to coalesce into a neat little package of fun. This is a metroidvania in the strictest sense, in that it is a fusion of both Metroid and Castlevania elements -- but on top of this, it adds bullet hell gameplay softened up to playability with Street Fighter III-style parries.\n\nSkrubs be warned; this is a HARD game. The controls are weird and take a lot of getting used to, and the level design pulls no punches whatsoever with its difficulty curve. This is not a game that you can just brute-force your way through with sloppy tactics, nor is it a game that you can cheese your way through with outside-the-box thinking. It demands clever planning and skillful execution. It's hard.\n\nBut it's fun.
