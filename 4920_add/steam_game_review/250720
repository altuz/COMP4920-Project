I bought this game based on some of the positive reviews posted here, and I had seen that this was a Kickstarter baby.  That gave my high hopes for either something innovative or a true throw-back to Wing Commander.  In truth, this is less WC or X-Wing and more a knock-off of Strike Suit Zero...which SSZ reminded me more of those lousy Wing Commander clones you used to be able to get for the PS1.  I played the game through a Patrol mission and the first Campaign mission.  All i can say is that I really want my $20 back.  For being a game no longer in Early Access and the \"Final\" version, I encountered my first bug a few minutes in when the targeting reticle in cockpit-view mode disappears after firing the gun for a few minutes.  Also, the cockpit graphics themselves are awful, ugly and appear (IMO) to be slapped on as an afterthought.  Reinforcing this opinion is that the starfighter handles better in 3rd person mode than cockpit mode.  The VO sync with the Ready Room animation is like watching bad muppets.  I was so disgusted that by the end of the 1st campaign mission i uninstalled and was compelled to write a review.  Bottomline: lousy graphics, poor space mechanics, derivitative gameplay of shiity knock-offs of a much better game = AVOID, it's not what it claims on the tin.", "timestamp_updated": 1398639148, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1398639148, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "10455990", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517950", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1470888244, "steamid": "76561198088188528", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I bought this game knowing it was early access. First time i tried to play it i couldn't because of a movie loading glitch. As soon as it loaded and you came to the splash screen it crashed.

So i took it upon myself to try to fix the game and found out if you delete all the movies  you can get to the menue and play the game.  The controls are not smooth and if you don't play with an xbox controller, you have no hope in completing the game. Even the contols for the xbox are not smooth and jerky.

You cant see the ships you are shooting at just the aiming reticles in front of them. Walking around on the ship is like you are in a cave and everybody has a tan. The frame rate jumps up and down like a jack rabbit on crack. The second mission you have to turn the dynamic lighting off to even get a frame rate you can play it at. And then you cant see anything until you are right up on top of it.  The developers say this game is ready for final release. If you buy this game you are in for a big surprise.  If this game was freeware i wouldn't even bother downloading it. There isn't one good thing i can say about the game except the demo movie looked good. The people are talking statues and not very realistic. They talk and you cant listen to them for more than a few seconds before you jump to the mission so you dont have to hear them anymore.

With so many space combat sim options now there is no reason to buy this.\n\nPros:  Tries fairly hard to be a good Wing Commander / Freespace 2 clone and briefly captures the nostalgia.\nCons: \n\n- Very outdated graphics.\n- First person out of cockpit experience poorly implemented.  The actual movement lags behind a reticule causing motion sickness and an overall bad experience.\n- Shield / Stealth Module / Missiles / Mission contextual special device all tied to the same secondary weapon cycle.\n- The large amount of ships have been copied and pasted from an online description somewhere without even bothering to change minor things to make it \"spacey\".\n-  There is no incentive in the campaign to use more than 1 top notch fighter with a single configuration after the training mission despite the impressive number of ships.\n- Missiles have a description of Air-to-Air and appear to be copied from the same source as the ships.  They should be described as Ship to Ship or Ship-to-Surface.\n- Taking out satellites is a very boring extra bonus objective that really doesn't seem to affect the overall outcome of the mission or campaign.  The point of secondary & tertiary objectives are to enhance the overall campaign or to be of good effect in case the primary objectives can't be reached or if there were extra ordinance & time/fuel.\n-  Some ground targets sink below the surface of planets/asteroids making them unreachable by weapons and blocking mission completion at 100%.\n\nIn summary I love the spirit of the game, and the desire to make a space combat sim again.  When this was greenlit, there was almost nothing new out at the time and it was a gap waiting to be filled.

I will recommend this game but there are caveats to this. 1) This game is awkward in play. The eating dinner over your best friend's house, after you have just been caught making out with his sister awkward. I absolutely hate the FPS movement through the ships. It's slow and when your alerted to report to the ready room you just mosey along to get there. The tutorial flight needs to more indepth. I \"accidently\" found out how to allocate power and command wingmen 3 missions in. 2) The flight mechanics are disturbing at times as you find yourself struggling to get the ship to right itself on a trajectory. I like being able to fly near the surface of a planet just not in one. One mission requires you to go underground killing bad guys and finding a scientist. You take damage hitting walls but the enemy ships ping pong ball of the sides making it impossible to hit them and they take NO damage. Loose this mission or change the scientist to a surface station.  3) Voice acting poor. The briefer for the first few missions looks like his is in his fifties but the voice is of a later teens to early twenties young man. Same akwardness with the stories one pilot who liked he was straight out of high school had 10yrs of experience. 4) The credit system isn't consistent. I completed a round and saw all sorts of bonuses flash up and completed bonus missions and recived nothing after the brief. All the work for nothing. Prestige points? Really? I have to earn a certain amount of points to get descent equipment? I would understand completeing some missions and getting extra stuff in mission to have new equipment to be researched then availible after a period of time.   \n\nNow after all this I really do like the game, I hate the fact it's VERY Crossfire unfriendly.
