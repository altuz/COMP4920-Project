It worked. It definitely worked. This is possibly the one of the best \"modern\" games I've ever played, (excluding Nintendo games). It brings me back to the days where I was waking up really early on Saturday mornings to play Super Mario Bros 3 all day and night. Speaking of which, this game takes many elements from it and I adore that. I also love it, because it's been 3 years and the developers have not abandoned it yet which seems to be a common issue with many games on Steam. It has a bunch of fun achievements and campaigns to keep you busy so you'll never get bored of it.\n\nYou've got to buy this nostalgic, heartwarming, often hilarious platformer.\n\nYou will not regret it.", "timestamp_updated": 1504980735, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504980735, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35441404", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507151365, "steamid": "76561198063147194", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1548}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Now i know how to bury bodies.
