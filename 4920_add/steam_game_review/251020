However, this program lets you control cars, trucks, planes and ships... Even if they are on invisible track.\n\nThe track-based \"control points\" allows for a good range of flexibility, including sequenced control of transferring freight from one vehicle to another using a crane that you can actually drive.\n\nI have to say, that driving a crane and using it to transfer freight between vehicles, is something I have not seen implemented in any simulator, ever.\n\nI have to warn you though, there is no AI in this game so you have to set either contacts or routes for the trains, then they follow the path you set for them via control circuits.\n\nThe Control circuit design is completely up to you, letting them handle the layout for you the way you want to, without the hassle of assigning priorities and such.\n\nSo, I fully recommend this to anyone that's interested in creating routes and automating them for the player to use because honestly, there are features that I haven't seen in any other game / simulator, including trainz and rail works.\n\nIt does have a large learning curve though, so if you're prepared to put up with that, railroad X can be a very rewarding experience.", "timestamp_updated": 1415045397, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415043195, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "10426963", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 45, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527188", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1402513824, "steamid": "76561197971977215", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 4, "review": "After a couple of houres building my track I will say this game is not too bad but not that user friendly. \nAnd the game contents is limited.

This nicely fits in as a train sim which can hold its own. Positives: Significant amount of options regarding content, editing, multi-layered complexity. Animated individuals are the best even better than Railworks. Why? Because they employ collision detection and move nicely around other characters  although they will go through objects. Not like Railworks which go through things and other characters. Also more animation on them like the woman who is using her cellphone. Nice touch! Great range of trains and rolling stock. For example I like the TGV. None of the current Train players have any TGV trains included in the content. And as varied as they are.  So if some of you are whining about some cost issues keep in mind the trains and stock beats hands down the trains and stock in Trainz or Railworks. Both of these latter you'll have to buy separately comparable stock if they exist or buy a ticket (Auran's Trainz) to download the freeware stock.\n\nYou can make large routes and so this is not just limited to a so-called table-top type creation.\n\nLove the choice in  animated animals such as a flock of pigeons flying over your train station, or those fish in the river, or as your train is going in the country animated farm animals and farm equipment.\n\nThere are various animated industries for your train route.\n\nLove the environmental editing features: scales for controlling, wind, rain, fog,  snow, clouds or random. You can  isolate areas of your route for different types of weather. So for example your train may be moving from a warm dry area, climb to higher levels and you can start to experience snow and a driving wind - all zones you are free to create.\n\nLike the choices of rail types and catenaries, gantries, platforms, etc. No shortage.\n\nHuge number of animated grasses. No shortage of various trees.\n\nHuge number of base textures to paint your world with.\n\nWide variety of sounds easily added to the layout or make your own.\n\nYou can use the Omega feature.This is a novel and quite exciting addition to the animated people.  You can make your animated people do certain things like go down stairs as if they are leaving the platform, checking out the  arrivals/departures. They can be constrained in certain areas. Lots to learn and adapt here for your train world. You can also use the animated people  on invisible tracks to walk up and down platforms and in buildings. For example, I have a river going through the city with people walking up and down the  sidewalk by the river enjoying the scenery. All the while a sailboat is sailing by on invisible tracks set in the water and flocks of birds are flying overhead complete with sounds of all sorts.\n\nYou can use invisible tracks for many other things such as helicopters, planes which bring life to your layout.\n\nWide use of cameras. You can hop in a car for example (clicking on it) and all of a sudden you're being taken for a nice ride around your city wherever you've made the road paths or if in a train on your train route.  Cameras can be placed strategically and triggered by events such as a train arriving at a station. \n\nThere are certain train engines you can actually enter and drive. Hope this is improved as time goes on.\n\n\n Can't access the PDF help from within the game. If you have Windows 8.1 will need to right click the pdf file and use the reader. Editor takes some getting used to as there consists of the 2D editor  and 3D editor, Tunnels through mountains is an exercise in huge frustration. Better to make a flat plain, make your tunnels, then raise terrain over. There are excellent english tutorials on You Tube - Ruud Boer. Thanks to his tutorials will make route creation a lot easier.\n\nSearching for content in the game is not easy and seems limited (right clicking a folder for example).\n\nLayers: These appear to be handled by clicking off certain things such as properties for example. The buildings will disappear allowing you to manipulate objects which would have otherwise been impeded by the properties.\n\nContent creation: Where is the facility for this? The content is in the 3DM format which the Rhino 3D program is known for. Every other competitive Train programs lets its members freely make content. For Trainz as an example I'm making a route in Strasbourg, France. I can freely create my own content in custom buildings, stations, etc. by using any number of 3D programs such as Blender or Sketchup. With the plug-in for Sketchup or Blender (or 3DS Max) the content is easily inserted in the route. I don't want to use buildings which have nothing to do with the area I'm creating. If you protect your content like the family jewels than you are inhibiting creativity and interest.\n\nCAUTION: The  Mod  here who appears to be a developer with EEP stated the Norstructor program a plug-in to make your own content would work in Railroad X. Well I bought it, installed it and it won't allow me to run the program. Appears it is searching for the EEP version and not Railroad X and thus wont install. Moreover, I thought I'd purchase the EEP-X Basic so I'd be able to use it. A folder called Trend is created and both the Nostruktor and EEP-X each have a folder inside it. Problem: Still doesn't work! Moreover, you can't operate both the Steam version Railroad X and EEP-X. It's either one but not both. To go back to Railroad X you'll have delete Railroad X and reinstall it - this will concurrently deinstall EEP-X. Wow. I did this just so I could use Nostrucktor only to find it doesn't work anyway. Now I'd be looking for my hard earn money back. This has to be a significant negative. Anyone not making German routes, everywhere outside of Germany, France, Britain, etc. North and South America,  will be severely disappointed because of the issue of personalized content creation. There is very good and high quality content on the pay site but not having personalized content creation is a significant negative. All the major players in RR simulation have an abundance of  content creation because of the ability to personalize your layouts.\n\nNOTE: Good news! Have been advised that Nostrucktor will be made available and compatible with RR X in a few weeks.\n\nSuggest Heights Explorer from the site in route creation. I\"ve purchased this. With this program I can take a Google image of a layout and with the height aspect imported for use as the base for the layout. It can also generate numerous images for use. For those wanting to use Google images without messing around with that I'd suggest a neat little converter program from this site: http://www.mm2eep.de/.  Downloading and installing will allow you to use the base objects as a base for the Google images. That way you can overlay your tracks, objects, etc. on top.\n\nThere have been several crashes  and it's wise to have the auto saving feature on while constructing or save often. Specs:  i7-920 9 gbs and ZOTAC GTX 650Ti 2 gb card with 340.52 driver.\n\nConclusion:\nUPDATE: MARCH 6/15. NO NOSTRUCKTOR!!! Are you kidding me! This program is a heaven for content exploitation. If you can't make your own content then this program to me is dead in the water! Get that bloody program on its feet and then this game will deserve a platinum badge.

Not a big deal but it adds to my argument.\n\nNext thing is the devs are not very active in the forums. If you have critical problems like I do, you are asked to call a hotline. It may be faster than an email or a forum post but it costs money as stated above.\n\nAbout DLC: the most of them is available only on their store.

I now have a number of purchases that I can't use in Railroad X and no one replies to my e-mails.  \nI used to be able to purchase for EEP 7 but now I find even those purchases cannot be used with EEP 7 even though they were bought through my EEP 7 registered account.\nThe EEP crew have now sorted out my registration to Railroad X.", "timestamp_updated": 1452937479, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452881534, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "24298470", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1482505437, "steamid": "76561198148392374", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have played one of the older versions and have gotten the hang of it.\n\nThe game has its ups and downs. \n\nfor an example, It takes a lot of time to get familiar with the controlls and how the some of the mechanics work. and some of the stuff in the game can easily be extremly overvelming and look some what unnecesary.\n\nbut it still has to be said, it is a well made game with a lot of potential and opertunities.", "timestamp_updated": 1468427089, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468427089, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "12444967", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496836", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1410308650, "steamid": "76561198098096129", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "In all honesty, Hornby Virtual Railways is far better.
