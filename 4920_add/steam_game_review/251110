Corruption and scandal lay at the heart of INFRA's world, and it's a very interesting premise.\n\nDuring your travels and analysis (primarily on-foot,) you'll want to make use of a flashlight and camera, since many locations are dark and many things are in disarray.

(there is 1 horror/spooky aspect in the game but it's just an easter egg from the dev so you can completely skip it)\n\n- [i]setting and atmosphere is great.[/i] the graphic is not nextgen quality, but still more than enough to make you enjoy the  surrounding scenery\n\n- puzzle difficulty is manageable. it start easy and gradually increase it's difficulty and complexity but still enjoyable throughout the game, i played until part 2 and only need guide in 4 specific puzzle\n\n- [i]semi open.[/i] one great thing about this game is that the game will often put you on the spot with a lot of pathway which you can  explore at your own leisure. its not open world but its not \"corridor\" exploring either, the game somehow give you a \"false feeling\" of freedom to explore, but at the same time still manage to \"guide\" you as to where to go next.\n\n- [i]sense of exploring.[/i] another thing that i like from this game is that you actually explore the building and the surounding area, there is no 'stage clear\" or you end up to totally different area in abrupt way. you start from A and slowly progressing to B and C and so forth, it feel serene and very zen like sometimes.\n\n\n[b]things that people might hate:[/b]\n- [i]music.[/i] there is almost no music in this game, even if it's there it's mostly ambient sound.\n\n- [i]missable stuff.[/i] because the amount of path you can explore, you will miss a lot of thing  like document, letter, object to photo, etc, some of this stuff is lock behind puzzle and well hidden, the game really demand you to explore every nook and cranny if you want to get everything.\n\n- [i]no indicator.[/i] aside from highlighting stuff you can pick up or interact, there is nothing else. the game give you no waypoint, no objective marker, no inventory, not even a hud, what you see is what you get.\n\n- [i]clunky movement.[/i] you move slow even when you run, also jumping and climbing is very stiff which is bad considering this game is all about exploring.\n\n- [i]cheap death.[/i] you will die quite a lot in this game, and half of it usually from your own stupidity (the rest is because you are not sure of what to do and out of time), thankfully the game give you save/load anywhere and everywhere. \n\n\n[b]one small nitpick:[/b]\n[i]emptiness.[/i] aside from very early in the game, you will meet no one else, you will occasionally speak on your phone but thats about it. in a fantasy or horror game this is natural, but in this game it feels weird.\n\nsome of the place you go has obvious sign of someone living there but you always encounter no one, its understandable if you are in uncommon place like abandon building, sewer, underground tunnel and such. but even when you are in the middle of city, there is no living on sight not even a cat or dog despite i'am at the part of city surrounded by homes and apartments but, nope not even a soul.\n\naside from that, the game is great and i hope the dev can make more quality games in the future =)", "timestamp_updated": 1506605088, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506604524, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35354327", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506803704, "steamid": "76561198221924628", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1033}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The urban exploration aspect of this game is enough for me to enjoy it due to the elaborate environments.
