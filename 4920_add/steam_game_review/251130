Deal with it.\n\nChroma Squad is a tactical RPG in the same vein as Nintendo's Fire Emblem series, but with a strange twist. Instead of being a knight or a dude with spikey hair and a giant sword, you play as a group of five stuntmen who act in a Power Rangers inspried show, complete with cheesy catchphrases and mech battles.\n\nChroma Squad's story is pretty simple. Your goal is to film each of the gangs' adventures for their TV show. Things seem fine at first, but the group begins to realize that their adventures may be more fact than fiction. I won't spoil any of the three endings, but they're all great.\n\nGameplay: As previosuly mentioned, this game runs in a similar way to the Fire Emblem series. For those who are uninitiated into weeb culture, Fire Emblem (and this game) do away with the idea that in turn-based battles your characters all stand in a line. Instead, you move them around a grid to get an advantage and perform special moves. One of this game's most important features is its' teamwork specials. By having a member of Chroma Squad perform the Teamwork move, other member can perform teamwork attack, Finishers, or Team Acrobatics which extend your sprint range. At the end of each episode, how well you did will be tallied into \"Audience Points\", which are then converted into your profit and fans. You'll also recieve materials which can be used to craft better weapons and armor for your squad.\n\nMecha Battles: These are, in my opinion, the most fun part of the game. At the end of most episodes from Season 2 and on, the boss you fight will grow to gigantic size! In order to combat this, your Squad gears up thier Mecha bot. Your bot and the enemy then take turns hitting eachother, defending, and performing specials. Each time you attack, your percent chance of hitting goes down by 10%, meaning you'll have to be careful to balance your attacks and defences. You can also use the materials you recieve or buy to upgrade parts of your mecha in order to increased attack, defence, hit chance, or give new specials.\n\nCustomization: There are a total of 5 rangers on your squad. The techie is best at dealing ranged damage. The Scout is the best at sneaking in, dealing damage, and getting out. The Assualt is good at hitting things really really hard. The Support is for healing your team, and the Lead is for keeping your team organized so they don't become too thinly spread. Within each ranger, there are 6 actors you can choose from who each gives their own extra stats. For instance, the lead in my first playthrough had the Asimobot actor, while my second playthrough used Mr. Beaver. Beyond that, you can also choose the nicknames of your rangers and what colors their suits are! :D\n\nPros:\n1. Simple gameplay that's easy to pick up, but still has some depth for experienced players\n2. The story is just interesting enough to keep you invested\n3. Multiple endings adds a ton to the replay value\n4. Four levels of difficuly most different types of players (Casual for those who want to see the story, up to Legendary for those who want a callenge)\n5. It's so gosh darn charming! Each boss has their own personality and taglines, and it makes me feel so fuzzy inside. <3\n\nCons:\n1. There are occasionaly a few visual glitches, but unless you're a real stickler, they shouldn't hinder your experience much.\n2. The only real complaint I have is how short the story is. In total, one playthrough of the campaign takes about 15 hours. Again, this is brought up to about 45 hours between 3 different endings, but the 2nd and 3rd playthrough are mostly filler until the last season.\n\nIf you don't play this game, you're doing a disservice to yourself. This game is filled with so much charm with it's characters, palette, and story, you'll find it hard to stop playing. Prop all of that up with awesome gameplay, and you've got yourself an awesome way to spend 40+ hours.\n\n9.5/10, HIghly recommended.", "timestamp_updated": 1505093887, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504406764, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "33445733", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507091", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499899756, "steamid": "76561198104064363", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Amazing game!

The art style and bright colors really popped out to me and made me smile.  All the spites are well detailed and animated.  A lot of love whent into the graphics!\n\nSound:\nBieng that I bought the soundtrack, that tells you that I LOVED the sound of this game.  The soundtrack was always a joy to listen to and the sound effects were funny and great!  So much as that I BOUGHT the soundtrack! I especially loved the impact sounds when you got a critical on enemies!\n\nControl:\nBieng this was point and click, there were few issues with it, save for an instance here or there were it would seem you can click a spot when you can't.  Other than that, no issues whatsoever!  I did not get to try the addiction joystick controls that were recently added.\n\nGameplay:\nManaging a team of stuntment as they evolve into actual rangers may seem silly, but it works well!  You have a finite amount of resources to deal with as your try to buy equipment or crafting supplies and crafting equipment or new parts for your mech.  You gain money from beginning of season grants, completing episodes and crafting supplies from enemy drops.  You also control what abilities they bring into battle, and they gain more as you complete seasons.\n\nEach battle is a careful dance of keeping your rangers alive and trying to complete Director Instructions, additional episode objectives that gain you extra money and audiance, but can be difficult to do at time.  Many battles were very difficult but never unfair or cheap, and at least for me, you could always come back from a major screw up.  The mecha battles used to be difficult, having to deal the RNG, btu after the Director's Cut, this is now alleviated by a reaction bar minigame, making it easier to perform combos and survive battles.\n\nThe story also gave me a smile with each episode, which felt like I was watching an old tokusatsu show!  From dealing with a silly moment to saving citizens from petrification, this game's episodes were always fun to play!  The jokes werte always funny and never ham fisted.
