Controls are good i use a xbox controller. ost is fine, farm equip is normal... all is on shops or chests... fail get chests is not so bad so dont worry about that.. the magic system is fine.. but unless you use aoe.. or abusse the weak element.. you will not use it either... \n\nOk now on what makes a rpg a good game or not... the story... well i will start saying that game have a semilong quest, with some hidden quest... and the hidden quest are well bad designed.. if you dont use a guide.. you will fail a lot of them... is not neccesary for finish game but if you want expect have all.. well i suggest play 1 time without guide and then with guide... really. now the game is semilinear.. that is you have some freedom in how progress but when you change town .. you can't go back.. that meens all non cannon quest are missable. You have a new game + but then the semilinear part could make you game boring ... i mean do a lot for do the quest you miss.. is not fun for me.. there is no other story (i still not do it.. and probably will not do it in a future).. still is 48.1 hours to finish with  using a guide form some quest... so length is good... \n\nThe story is not complete.. that is you will not get a finish... now that probably is bad.. but there are good games that did that in the past... if i can recommend them.. i can recommend this game. but that also means that you have to think in buy a boundle... that steam not sell that is trail of sky 1 and 2(trail of sky sc) so well be preapred... now that dont mean that game dont have a story.. is more about discover the world and a prologue of a story that will devoloped later.. in this you have a objective that is become bracer and all go for that.. untill the end where you notice how all that is not clear .. well happen in second game..\n\nIF you like RPGs and dont know what to play... well i suggest  check first other games.. if you like RTS games this could be semi fun. if you expect admin your party like others rpg.. well is not an option until the end... still that is not neccesary for a game for be good... example wild arms 2... and others.", "timestamp_updated": 1505604328, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505604328, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34922671", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494652", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505259198, "steamid": "76561198082553846", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Overall this is a very good JRPG. While some might be put off by the dated 2D visuals it's surprisingly well done and doesn't detract from the experience. This game is really heavy on story and world-building so if you like RPGs with those traits then you will definitely enjoy this. Gameplay is a grid/turn-based hybrid system that gets the job done but I feel like it could be just a tad deeper. Music wise is pretty good although a couple more battle themes would have been nice. The story is a nice, lighthearted adventure that can get really enriching with it's world-building and interesting characters, and it does get pretty serious near the end and ESPECIALLY at the end, wow. Be forewarned though that the story does continue in the next game, Trails in the Sky SC so you probably will want to play that too, which I will soon.
