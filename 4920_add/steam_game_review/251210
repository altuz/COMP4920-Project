Interesting and different. I have to re-learn the game everytime I play it, and every time it leaves me a bit unimpressed and vaguely bothered.\n\nComplex brainy freeform chess. Solid mechanically but lazy effort on the engine, audiovisuals, game modes, input support. Having to relearn this kind of tabletop chess game to be stuck playing the computer is probably not engaging. Better suited as an actual board game where you can play with a person face to face. I think this was officially backed by the mensa association at some point. To be honest I dont see the relevance. Computers will always beat humans at these kind of games anyways so why bother being competitive about it between us.\n\nThe game does have pass and play as well as online features and I did see some games in progress in the servers...\n\nAs for the strategy itself. It is turn based, with one person moving first but with a handicap to make up for it. You basically construct a snake-like group formation that you can then reshape based on the movement rules of each individual pieces you placed down. e.g. grasshoppers can move over other pieces like knights while spiders can float anywhere on the outer rim of the snake but cannot be caught between two other pieces (im making those rules up). Goal is for snake to coil back on itself, trapping the other person's queen while yours is still free.\n\nThe thing is there is no tutorial and there is just a miniature wiki website inside the help button. I have read that indepth the first time I tried the game when it came off bundles. Got me good enough to get a match going but nowhere near a point where the game got engaging and I could feel myself thinking tactically. It was just clunky to figure out what goes where and the interactivity felt off for a computer game. \n\nAs a result I find myself never really wanting to play and removing it for declutter.", "timestamp_updated": 1506042417, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505361033, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 78, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 88}}
