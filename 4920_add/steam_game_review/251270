One of the best story driven games that was done in an RPG maker style that i've ever played. 26 hours of gameplay to get 100% achievements. My only complaint is that this version is censored a lot. A lot of scenes where the death scenes are supposed to be shown, just show a black screen and describe the death. It leaves a lot to the imagination and is sometimes vague in the way they died, though you know that death came for them. Try the game for yourself, it's worth every penny.", "timestamp_updated": 1505187783, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505187783, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35021867", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505647910, "steamid": "76561198006455520", "num_games_owned": 900, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Corpse party is horror adventure in RPGmaker.\nWeird enough that makes it really good. Archaic engine doesnt let it use jumpscares and grafical violence to scare you.\nInstead it relies on text, sound and enviroment to create scary atmosphere.\n\nStory is really good as well. \nAt begining story is quite simple, you are spirited away into weird school and you are trying to find out whats going on without dying in the process. But as chapters progress there will be more and more things going on and you will keep uncovering one terrifing secret after another.\n\nChapters have multiple endings, mostly they are bad ends, some bad ends gives different outlook on the situation from good endigs. For example in last chapter you can loose one of characters right at begining but game will continue on for about 3/4 of the chapter, giving you quite different story before inevitable bad ending.\n\nI really liked Corpse Party and i can recomend it to anyone who likes tense scary stories without jumpscares.", "timestamp_updated": 1505649973, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505649973, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35403373", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507060472, "steamid": "76561198316441430", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1896}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Amazing game, kept me entertained for almost 40 hours.
