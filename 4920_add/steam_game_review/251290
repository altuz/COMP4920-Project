Music is good.. well i wish i could say great.. but sadly the only song i liked too much was the The Merciless Savior, that i heard before the game.. so when i hear it again on final boss.. well that was awesome for me. \n\nThe combat system is better, move is still a problem.. but the magic is more usefull now. It have less secrets ... still for get max bracer rank.. you will need a guide. \n\nif you are fan of old school rpg.. is a good game.. and if you play the first game... to the end.. i think this is a must. Also this game is more longer.. 61.3 hours to finish it 1 time not at 100% without guide... on normal. \n", "timestamp_updated": 1506823837, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506823837, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 632, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "review_score": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 17, "total_reviews": 649}}
