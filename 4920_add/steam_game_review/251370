The puzzles are too easy, which isn't normally too big a problem since the platforming is fine and reasonably fun, but there's a lot of levels where the simple puzzles are also a bit time-consuming. So that, even if you know the puzzle, it can still take a while - predominantly from deaths. And if there's a mini-puzzle before a hard platforming section, expect to be highly annoyed. It would've benefitted greatly with checkpoints or somesuch.\n\nThat being said, maybe if the puzzles are easier for you you'll enjoy it? Well, in any case, I'm writing this review based on how I feel, and not how I expect someone else might feel.\n\nEdit: oh, nearly forgot to mention - it doesn't work on 144Hz monitors and can't be sped up using CheatEngine.
