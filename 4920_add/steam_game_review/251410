Probably a few hours of gameplay but it is always the same repetitive combat with zoomed in camera, somewhat imprecise aim and enemies that tank quite a bit and almost always get in range to hit you before dying. Storyline not developped enough to grip you or be memorable. Ending is one screen of text as you enter a random room.\n\nPlayed through a bit. Was fun for the first fifteen minutes but then you keep doing the same thing level after level, taking down bugs, using ladders, making medpaks at crafting table and opening doors. Thats it. The A.I. narrator kind of helped a little but not nearly enough. \n\nModels are a little dated but game looked fairly atmospheric with decent backgrounds. Control scheme was okay, not perfect but worked okay for the title. Foes jump in small corridors and no place left to backtrack meaning it all boils down to bringing craftables to bench for medpaks. Occasional puzzle-like elements introduced with use of light switches and flashlights activating or deactivating alien resistance.", "timestamp_updated": 1505939219, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504216977, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 43, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 68, "total_reviews": 111}}
