However...there is a major bug i have encountered so i encourage you not to spend money untill its fixed. putting your hero in idle mode and closing out the application removes all keys, gems, and money you aquired. i had a nice stack saved up and to come back and everything including stars were wiped. thats my only issue with it. Other than that, it has very nice graphics, a different style to the gameplay. you can tap the bars to speed up attacks and stuck.

I have never wrote a review for any game ever. I admit that I rely heavily on user reviews when buying games. After playing this game I was compelled to write a review. So here is my first review.\n\nI saw videos of this game before it was released on steam and I said I will definitely try it.\n\nI love this game so much, after buying the founders pack, I tried to buy the founders pack again. \n\nI been playing PC games since the mid 80s. Tried almost every MMO out there. This isn't really an MMO. No one ever said it was. It does have online features though. The progression is really well thought out. Everything from weapons to evolution, to content, its all there. The best clicker game I have ever played.\n\nAs far as I know there are 3 clicker games out now with multiplayer, this game, iourpg and ragnarok clicker. I find this games implementation of multiplayer is great.\n\nSome may say its pay to win. After playing for 7 hours straight, I have to say that its fair. Of course spending cash will help, but cash does not affect the core features of the game.\n\nI will be playing this for a long long time.\n\n\n**EDIT**\n\nTwo days later can't stop playing it, awesome game. \n\nBTW\n\nThose that see things as they truely are wouldn't call this or any other game a \"mobile port\".
