The game follows a young girl named Iona as she traverses the cosmos to piece together memories that will ultimately tell her story. Gameplay revolves around (ha ha) making the most of Iona's ever-expanding control over the physical rules of the world. Some examples of her powers include becoming more massive to fall faster or becoming incorporeal to pass through objects. She also learns \"terraforming\" abilities that allow her to change the properties of the planetary bodies that form most of the game world.\n\nJust like the game, the story is a mix of whimsy and challenges, this time in the form of human interaction between Iona's family unit. The characters are voiced by several indie darlings such as Ashly Burch and Logan Cunningham. The story is told in snippets so at first it can be difficult to even understand the relationships between the characters. However, as you learn who they are and how they relate to Iona, you realize their connection to her celestial journey. The game's music is also noteworthy, as it is the work of Ben Prunty, the man responsible for the excellent FTL score. You can expect the same lonely and beautiful music in Gravity Ghost.\n\nI finished this game in one sitting (I clocked about 4 hours for 10% completion) so the game doesn't outstay it's welcome. The rate at which Iona gains new powers and abilities kept me completely hooked the entire time. I won't claim the story is mindblowing, but it is a touching tale of family and the way we, like the planets circling our star, have an invisible force keeping us together.

The game has a strong visual aesthetic that seemingly uses southwestern USA influences (Pueblo?) that draws your attention but never distracts from the gameplay at hand. It's complemented by a haunting sound track that's not depressing, but fits the themes that the game is going for. The gameplay can be entertaining and frustrating at the same time: it definitely opens up once you get the float/dive mechanics to get more control over your character, and the use of both of those mechanics to whip yourself around the planets can be good old fashioned fun: even if it may have frustration for some precision you will need. It's a game that won't wow you on gameplay, but will wow you on charm instead, and it's a shame that the game was exploited in terms of scammers/people posing as youtubers (in a black market key investigation), because the game is a memorable one that may stick with those that have had people in their lives recently pass on. It's definitely worth picking up if you like stories with heart, and want some gameplay to boot.\n\n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review (part of a collection video): https://youtu.be/mZnKPYCM5nk?t=598[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] A touching story about loss and acceptance that pulls on the heartstrings. Good writing and voice acting helps to set the mood, but it's also not overly sappy as well.\n[*] Strong visual aesthetic that is unlike a lot of games out there. Has a child like feel to it and yet hits some heavy themes, but strong use of color is what stands out here. \n[*] A haunting soundtrack that fits the themes here, and yet isn't depressing surprisingly. Feels appropriate at every turn. \n[*] Core gravity mechanics are fun to just whip yourself around with not a care in the world. I'd make a joke about whipping your hair back and forth here, but let's be honest that meme is dead.\n[*] Honestly, it's one of those things where you may not make any progress in game, but you can have the time of your life just floating around the map.\n[*] Good addition of alternate mechanics like terraforming that are introduced at the right time to keep gameplay fresh.\n[*] It deserves mention that the developers seemed to have their hearts in the right place with the initial offer of a copy for friends, and even though they were scammed and hurt by people wanting to make a profit, still kept a positive outlook on things. \n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Do wish there was a timer to register how fast you could do a level. It does have a skill element that has me which for leaderboard functionality, for once. \n[*] When re-recording this, wish there was a easy way to record cutscenes. I know that seems like a youtuber complaining, but with some of the touching cutscenes here, it would be nice to be able to replay them easily. \n[*] Lacking some basic options. Like the ability to mute the sound within the game. Actually, no options whatsoever. \n[/list]\n", "timestamp_updated": 1451490600, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451490600, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "21539473", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507359", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1456718076, "steamid": "76561197972420018", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "After an hour, I can't recommend this game.

Almost every level is one of two things, either it is easy to a point of being boring or it is annoying. The powers you get early in the game just make it so that you can get almost anywhere pretty easily, and the times where it isn't easy, is when you are fighting the controls because the movement in the game is chaotic. \nAnd even when there is a level wherein it is difficult to get the star, the best strategy is of often just to jump at it and hope for the best. It isn't a puzzle, you just try and often succeed. (And yes there are proper puzzles in the game but they are few and far between.)\n\nI found the artstyle to be wierd and not that good. But others seem to like it, so take a look at some of the screenshots and judge it yourself. \n\nThe story is the main positive of the game, and it was the only reason why i felt compeled to continue playing. I just dont think its good enough to be the reason why you buy the game at full price.\n\nIn summation.

For me, it did this exceedingly well where I would call it a classic. Just like the story, the game is simple, but it evolves the complexity as subtle and elegant. Tie that together with an amazing yet soothing soundtrack, and it instantly becomes a top game of the year contender of 2015 for me.\n\n\nAt first glance, I was unsure what the target demographic was for the story. After I played a few more cut-scenes, I quickly threw the \"Just for kids\" assumption out the window. If I were to compare it to something, I would probably say the narrative is most relatable to a good fairy tale in a clever and compelling game format. If I were to be more precise, or rather relatable to my 1990s childhood, I would say comparable to an excellent G rated movie (albeit short, old Disney classic), reminding me that subject matter can be literally any audience without beating a \"happy happy, children always be happy\" theme into you. Nope, the subject matter is much more diverse with some of it being a little grim.\n\nIt literally strung me and my emotions along in wonder as the story unfolded in a somewhat mystery-memory format. Much of the happiness was expressed through the game-play as I traversed through this beautiful universe. While short (roughly 3-4 hours), I found myself traveling through all the levels just to get that (optional?) cut-scene out of my own intrigue. As a mystery-esque story, the scenes are not linear and you can view them in any order to understand who the protagonist is, what made her who she is now, and what she needs to do next.\n\nThe game-play centers around collecting stars (progression), flowers (terraform resource), and animal spirits to return to their original skeletal bodies (which triggers a narrative piece) in a 2D space platformer. In order to traverse around, you will be using the gravity physics through jumping, free falling, along with gravity's effect on momentum. However, further progression will allow you to do more with extra abilities like gliding, force falling via increasing your gravitational pull, dashing, air jumping, etc. Obstacles are various elemental planets (platforms), which you can change with your terraform ability, given you have enough \"hair resource\". Each planet-type is unique in how it behaves as an obstacle and can assist you in traversing to the destination, or collectible, you are trying to reach.\n\nYou cannot die in this game, only progress. Replayability is somewhat limited to just achievements, but I personally was immersed enough to know I will be revisiting this hidden gem from time to time. It just was too memorable of an experience to forget. \n\nIf the developer decides on creating a sequel, I certainly hope they put as much love and care into it as they did this one. I will be buying it instantly for that high-quality creativity.\n\nSo if you want to lose yourself in a well written story, have fun with creative game-play, or just simply want to play a game and relax, then this is a must buy of 2015.", "timestamp_updated": 1422470780, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422470754, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "19975221", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501069", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1450958690, "steamid": "76561198128955258", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Oddly charming with a great story.

Beneath its pleasant scenery and deceptively simple gameplay, there's a stirring game about love and loss and shifting heaven and earth - literally - to help your loved ones.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it. The art style is magnificent, and has a wonderful hand-drawn storybook feel throughout. The characters pop and the galaxy dances along. Ben Prunty's soundtrack provides a wonderful counterpoint, feeling spacey and grand without feeling too isolated, and the voice acting is solid across the board, particularly Ashly Burch's performances.\n\nThe gameplay itself has a lot going for it, focusing on physics-based challenges involving the masterful manipulation of gravity. These challenges feel good on the whole and most of them should be doable within a few tries and there are no consequences for failure, leaving you encouraged to take another swing at grabbing that star.\n\nThe story is excellent, though I hate to say too much about it for fear of any spoiling that may occur. Settle in and enjoy it.\n\nHowever, there are some negative aspects to consider as well. First, while the art style is gorgeous and the gameplay animations are smooth, there are times when the cinematic animations get a bit messy. Maybe this was just my computer, but occasionally a character's mouth would lag behind when their head was moving. A minor issue, but it brought me out of the universe of the game for a moment.\n\nAlso, while the forgiving gameplay helps prevent frustration, it also contributes to a short playtime - I grabbed all of the stars and finished the game in under 3 hours. There's still a few more things to explore, but don't expect a 10-hour game going in. This game gets in, says what it has to say, and gets out. \n\nAlong those lines, I'll wrap up this review by encouraging you to give it a try.
