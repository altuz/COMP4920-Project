Developers still work on this and that is really good thing as they could have abandoned this already. This game has some bugs, but not too bad to ruin the game experience. It is really good game in my opinion. This is really fun in single-player and even better in multi-player.\n\nYou have big map with many biomes. Those offer you a lot to do. Loot to find, skills to level, treasures to find and most importantly zombies to kill. You also have to build to survive. You can also mine and get cover by doing that. On top of all that you have crafting system. You can craft weapons etc. \n\nSurviving in 7 days to die reguires a lot of things to do. You need to have good gear and to get good gear you have to craft stuff with proper skills and resources. Also you can find special items. I can recommend this to anyone who likes survival horror games, specially with zombies.\n\nGrade for this game 8/10\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506204004, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1506204004, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "35043966", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508564", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507002217, "steamid": "76561198016209631", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1510}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Been keeping an eye on this game for a couple years, but never pulled the trigger and bought it. Finally did that just over a week ago, and absolutely no regrets. Love the crafting, the building, and even the digging. I'm a huge fan of underground bunkers, and the idea of hiding in (almost) plain sight, so when I found out you could dig, and live, underground, I instantly was hooked. The idea that you might be passing a large corn field, and there could be a massive complex of tunnels and rooms underground is awesome. \n\nOn top of the vanilla flavor of the game, you can also mod it to add more features. I've looked up and found mods that allow you to have classes which automatically give you specialized skills, so you can jump right in and play your way. You can find different User Interfaces, or even write your own one, with the ability to completely edit the game's XML files. The best part of the implementation of modding in 7D2D, is that if you edit your XML files, you can still join other people, and not worry about getting banned for altered files, because when you're logged into a server, you're using the files from that server, instead of the ones on your system.\n\nOf course a game in Early Access like this one, doesn't come without flaws. Above all, in my opinion, are the animations and graphics. While your primary perspective during your time in 7D2D is First Person, there are occasions, when playing with others, that you notice that characters don't have look up and look down animations in Third Person, so when a friend is pointing a rifle at your face, he might actually be looking straight up in the air, trying to figure out where an air drop just landed. Also, when riding a minibike, later in the game, you notice a stuttering that, at first, appears to be FPS lag, but after closer inspection, it appears to be a game sync issue, that makes riding a bike hard to get used to at first. \n\nAll in all, I highly suggest getting this game. I paid $25 for it, and at the time of writing this review, I've gotten more value out of this game, than any other game I've paid for recently.

MMORPGs seem to be obsolete as only fly by night short lived bland flavors.  Been a few years since a game was available that I felt rewarded for my time.  Enter 7 days to die.  This is a fantastic game. \n\nWhile it\u2019s been out for many years I only picked it up a month ago.  I\u2019ve heard a few mentions of it but never tried it for two reasons.  One the title, it implies an ending before you even buy it. While that it isn\u2019t true from the outside looking in that\u2019s how I perceived it. I\u2019m not alone in this thinking as I\u2019ve recommended this game to other age 30-40 guys and they avoided it based on the title for the same reason. \n\nNext the graphics are a bit dated looking compared to the polish out there.  Those two things kept me from really looking in to the game until recently.  \n\nSurvival games being the replacement for MMORPG\u2019s or at least for me, I wasn\u2019t really enticed with the choices out there.  PVP is plentiful but the lack of PVE in these games leave a lot to be desired.   When I first started 7 Days to Die and had my arse handed to me repeatedly I actually enjoyed it. Finally something with a bit of PVE challenge too it. \n\nI reached somewhere in the 70s and decided to reroll on a harder difficulty and start over.  After I got the swing of things I desired more of a challenge and the options provided to scale things up deliver! \n\nDespite its dated look, at least from a single player stand point I have to say this is the best survival game that I have played to date and I\u2019ve played a lot of titles.   In the late future I\u2019ll have to give the on-line thing a go and see how I fair in PVP. But right now I\u2019m not even worried about it.  I have so many more places to explore and things to see.   \n \nThis is an immersive well thought out master piece, I love it.   \n\nDesired requests:\nA graphics update or mod would be wonderful. \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506435743, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506435743, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 17543, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 4523, "total_reviews": 22066}}
