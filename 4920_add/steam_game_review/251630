This is a fun game with levels layouts based off the song that is playing. With 4 main levels and the original level to make 5 I cannot feel like the game lacks in content as it is basically a dollar per level which some may take days to finish if you are not good at the game. The PC edition of this games feels a little sloppy with frequent moments where the levels disappear with the song still playing and the orange cube you play as freaking out sometimes after you die. The worst part is when this happens if you are in full screen it makes it rather hard to close. Besides the glitches and whatnot lies a fun game with great songs and an equally good challenge that can drive some insane.
