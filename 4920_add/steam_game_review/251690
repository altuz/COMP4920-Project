Vague sci fi setting. You're probably better off playing Blood Hockey.\n\nPlays like a SNES hockey game, pass, tackle, reach goalie and shoot. Simple. Implementation of mechanics is done correctly. AI did an okay job. This is a directional arrow/1 button game. The same button is used for everything. Other buttons can pause the game and do strange things that I had to use the keyboard to undo. So stick to the one button. Audiovisually it is a little bit disappointing. There are a few leagues you can pick from but they seem to be just slight tweaks in the player portraits and uniform color.", "timestamp_updated": 1505086167, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500592804, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33566328", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497101", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1387731791, "steamid": "76561198004757606", "num_games_owned": 939, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Too slow", "timestamp_updated": 1500145160, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500145160, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 84, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 43, "total_reviews": 127}}
