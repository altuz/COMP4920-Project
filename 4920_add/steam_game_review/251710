It's not massively complex but always fun to play a round or two if one is willing to die countless times to RNG. All relevant dies are resolved with 1-3d6, there are several different items which allow bypassing traps or weapons which do different amount of damage to different groups of enemies. Additionally all weapons ecxept melee weapons have limited ammo and should only be used when necessary to conserve the very rare ammo pickups. Visually the game is minimal but sufficient.\n\nAll in all, it's a little sideboard game and should mostly appeal to either fans of the original boardgame or to die-toss-enthusiasts with mild masochistic tendencies.", "timestamp_updated": 1503945704, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503945704, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33757460", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504632", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500863689, "steamid": "76561198008411716", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "WTF?
