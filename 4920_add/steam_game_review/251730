There are more tilesets in the first hour or two than in the entire first game. There are way more monsters, way more options for your characters, and so on. They also improved (in my opinion) the already-solid class, leveling, magic and alchemy systems of the previous game.\n\nI feel that the difficulty is sometimes quite a bit higher than before. There's a bunch of fights that just seem broken, but once you figure them out, and finally decide to use some of those consumables you've been hoarding \"in case you ever need them\", become doable. But you need to think and play well. An actual challenge, who'd have thought!?\n\nThe one thing I disliked at first was the new injury system. One bad roll of the dice against the wrong enemy, and your hero can't use one of his hands anymore, walks super slow, or the likes. But then that makes you actually use (and not just hoard) all those healing potions, which turns out is kind of a good thing.\n\nI highly recommend the first game to anyone interested in this genre and I absolutely recommend playing the first one first, because having played it definitely improved my experience of the second one. But man, the second one is even better! :D", "timestamp_updated": 1505110492, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505110492, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34828531", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1496880485, "steamid": "76561198037103558", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I wish there were more games like this, a real gem.", "timestamp_updated": 1504929501, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504929501, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 875, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 88, "total_reviews": 963}}
