I also have fond memories of watching my Dad play. Its one of those timeless classics that has actually aged pretty well. The sound design and soundtrack are hauntingly brilliant and at times absolutley terrfying and adds to the horror soaked atmosphere. Here I am now aged 27 headphones plugged into my ears and alone in the dark still affected by this games twisted level design creepy enemies and haunted soundtrack. I truly reccomend this game to any fan of the multiple genres this game covers and at roughly 30hrs of content the deep and dark story will captivate and absorb you. \n", "timestamp_updated": 1505077737, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505077737, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 127, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 17, "total_reviews": 144}}
