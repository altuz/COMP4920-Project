Got Leadwerks since release 3.1, and did not used it much, but this new release with all the improvements made so far, made me look at it again, and WOW! \n\nIt's like taking Source Engine/Hammer and making it up to date with current game technologies (particulary the rendering that increased a lot in quality because of the environment probes/global illumination). A great plus for me is that the editor has a workflow similar to Hammer(Source). But can get more easier customization because of LUA/C++ of the entities. You can create a new type of entity in LUA in less than 5 minutes! For logic (doors/triggers/etc) the visual scripting tool \"Flowgraph editor\" is really easy to connect scripts and make them work together. \n\nAsset integration is really a breeze, as it import from FBX and convert it directly. You don't even have to create a collision model as it has it'S own internal tools to create them (like convex decomposition). You can take a model, name it's animations and call them from LUA. Some templates are already provided that are easy to customize to your need.\n\nRecently, they improved the terrain system, and WOW, the vegetation system is really incredible! You can directly \"paint\" trees on the terrain, (rocks, grass, about anything!). All of them use hardware instancing so you can create a really dense forest and maintain a good framerate! Another really good feature, is that since vegetation is \"painted\" onto the terrain, you can change the shape of it using the sculpting tools, and the vegetation will reposition itself to the new shape!\n\nIn this new version, a NEW GUI system was added. (GUI was possible but really limited because it only offered 2D shapes, or you could use the PRO version and link a GUI system in C++). Now you have a GUI system that can be used without requiring all that out of the box! As an exemple, it now offer not a game menu template like you would have in \"half-life/portal\". That can be quickly modified to your need with LUA.\n\nNew post-process shaders were introducted that improve the final image quality (Screen space ambient oclusion, screen space reflections, HDR, etc)\n\nPublishing is really easy, as it will put all the used assets in a protected archive from the editor GUI. As an advanced option (from code), you can even split the assets and create multiple protected archives for easy updates of your game assets.\n\nI highly recommend it to indie developpers, as this is really simple to use, and doesnt require an army of developpers to get something that work and look good!", "timestamp_updated": 1499537241, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499536755, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "33636879", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475147", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501358115, "steamid": "76561198059402388", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Piece of shit.", "timestamp_updated": 1500407253, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500407253, "votes_down": 11}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 110, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 44, "total_reviews": 154}}
