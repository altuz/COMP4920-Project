Levels are long, self-contained 2.5 platforming sets, like The Cave. Single level puzzles ensure that everything will be wrapped up neatly and that there will never be a challenge. There aren\u2019t even red herring puzzle items, like The Cave. Puzzles are extremely obvious due to the mind reading effect, which tells you the answer.\nFor example: A dog says, \u201cI wish I had teeth so I could bite these dudes\u201d and by sheer coincidence you have a crocodile tooth sticker. \nThere are only two scenarios in which you'll have a spare item and both of those are used for achievement related side-puzzles. The result is a puzzle game with no challenging puzzles. \n\nThe jokes are really hit or miss and a lot of them are references. Yes, you did a Mario joke, well done; that horse was beaten into a red paste 20 years ago, what else do you got? Aside from \u201chumorous\u201d observations, the game's other running joke is giving animals antiquated Shakespearean accents and vocabularies that can only be discovered by reading their minds. It's funny the first time, but when every single animal talks like a Victorian-era art critic, it loses its charm faster than a Leprechaun on speed. \n\nProbably the biggest difference between The Cave and Stick it to the Man is the atmosphere. The Cave took place in dark empty areas with one or two NPCs. Stick it to the Man occurs in large city environments and is based on quietly helping other characters solve their problems. I was actually really impressed by one aspect: Most puzzles have a running theme of repairing unlikely relationships. Unfortunately, that's the game's only real source of inspiration and, paired with the frankly huge cast of one-dimensional characters, the atmosphere loses its charm faster than a Leprechaun on speed. \n\nThe voice acting is just terrible. Let me explain. In voice work, characters have funny voices; funny voices don\u2019t make characters. With little exception, every character has a similarly overextended speech pattern and a wacky accent which proves to be more distracting than funny or immersive. \nThe main character's voice sounds like a cheese grater with a New York accent. \nIn fairness though, some of the worst voice work comes from horrific dialogue writing. \nYou\u2019ll hear \u201cI should have not stayed up all night LAST NIGHT eating burritos, yet I have no regret about eating burritos all night,\u201d and similar lines about micro-naps dozens and dozens of times. This attempt at humor (its not really a joke) would only have been funny once, but the game design forces you to commit the greatest sin in all of comedy games: repeating the joke over and over and over and over again. It loses its charm faster than a Leprechaun on speed. \n\nDr. Brom (who is based on Dr. Monroe from The Simpsons), the taxidermist, blue haired radio operator, and the mother are the only consistently good character voices in the entire game. \nRay (the PC) and Ted (the alien that lives inside his head) are the worst voices, by far.\n\nYet even the voice acting cannot compare to the hideous \"plot\" of this game. From the get go, the plot is essentially the PC being chased by bad guys. There's an apparent mystery with a psychologist (who Ray has never met before) but it doesn't go anywhere. Despite having a huge set up, nothing in this game's storyline has any pay off.  The antagonist makes a number of intro-cutscene apperances, but they don't amount to anything. You make it to the end of your 3 hour journey and nothing is gained. You don't know why the bad guy is evil and neither does he. Once he finally gets what he wants he say something to the effect of \"Why did I do this anyway?\" The antagonist is as confused as the player. The result is a comedy puzzle game that fails to be funny and has no interesting puzzles, but does have a host of one-dimensional characters, terrible voice acting, and a nonsense plot (even for a game that takes place in a world of stickers and cardboard). \n\n$15 for 3 hours of terrible puzzles, terrible writing, terrible voice acting, and a terrible story.", "timestamp_updated": 1502083496, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499286160, "votes_down": 6}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 191, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 201}}
