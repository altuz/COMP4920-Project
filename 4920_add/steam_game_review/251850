While obviously neither the in-game graphics or cutscenes compare to those other titles, Master Reboot is a solid, story-driven puzzle and adventure game with some quite beautiful levels (Like the field before you enter the Soul Cloud or the level with the encased neon-tree in it) and enjoyable puzzles.\n\nSome levels are deliberately designed simply to be hard rather than fun (The godawful end level following the plane level and the infuriating time-trail end boss are the major culprits here) and the platform gaming elements in first person mode are especially frustrating. Whatever engine this game uses, this is the ONLY game where my laptop was constantly whirring away trying to cool itself and given the rudimentary style of the graphics this is hardly acceptable. Sort your bloody game engine issues out Wales Interactive. \n\nThe save feature is also irritating because the only save points occur after you've finished both the level and end boss/level. More save features more often would have made this game more enjoyable. \n\nThe menu screen also didn't function well on my mac. I had to force quit the game nearly every time I exited to the desktop, so I don't know what's going on there.\n\nOverall however, a satisfying game for entry-level gamers like myself.", "timestamp_updated": 1494134736, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494134736, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "32572446", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508765", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1497895849, "steamid": "76561198028057114", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "To start off: This game has the worst metacritic score of anything in my steam library.\n\nAt first, I did not think this was deserved. The movement seemed a bit clunky and the graphics style wasn't too appealing, but it presented an interesting idea and I thought I would continue to play and see how it went. Though the more I played the more quickly the game seemed to devolve into a chore rather than anything of substance.\n\nTypically I have an easy time letting myself be immersed in a game, its aesthetics, and it's story.  This game I seemed to be forcing myself to feel the suspense. Even playing in a pitch black room at night it failed to elicit more than the minimal responses I have come to expect from any horror game.\n\nThe environment went from being somewhat interesting to seemingly lazy. The only redeeming quality I can think of is the eerie sound effects, but even those got old quickly.\n\nThe puzzles were laborous to solve rather than engaging. The dim and sometimes flickering lighting seemed more a necessity of the genre rather than part of the atmosphere. The cutscenes seemed like some cheap flash animations roughly equivalent to or even worse than ones you would find on most free gaming/cartoon websites like newgrounds or albinoblacksheep 10-15 years ago.\n\nTL;DR: Overall this game failed to engage me on any level and the interesting concept fizzled out quickly with an unsatisfying story progression.", "timestamp_updated": 1497896925, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497896925, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 214, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 61, "total_reviews": 275}}
