There's a lot good about it, but I do get the point of the negative reviews. Here comes my opinion.\n\nShort verdict: I play this game mostly in VR mode and I really like the immersion you get. The Oculus touch controls work really well and after I switched to them from a controller, I don't get VR sickness anymore. I like to relax underwater doing some (actually really stupid) tasks, that give me at least some reason to play this game aside from any sandbox play.\nI know, content is not huge, I know there are some technical issues and some game design aspects are just not up to date to current games, but I have fun with this game, though, and really enjoy the experience of the diving itself. Sadly, this game could be so much more, but thats the way it is.\n\nThe long version:\nCurrently, there are just few diving games out there, I think the only ones worth mentioning are this game, Subnautica and Endless Ocean 2 (only available on Wii). The latter one is a really great game and I played for over 70 hours and it is also either loved or hated but nearly nothing in between. If steam offered Endless Ocean 2 with good graphics, I would not need any other diving games, frankly said.\n\nSo what do I expect from a diving game? First and most important, some underwater immersion created by authentic visuals and the simple sound of muffled breathing. The fascination of some colorful flora and fauna in diverse environments, which I can experience. The mix of solitude as a mere spectator but also a living environment.\nThis is essentially what I like about WOD: The graphics are likable, there are different beings and some different environments (I hope it gets polar map, too, sometime in the future) AND especially in VR you get a good feeling of underwater immersion. IMO, it's relaxing to dive at the different locations and I enjoy exploring them and watching some fishes.\nIn the end, I want to relax, but that must not mean that I get bored! This leads to...\nSecond: I expect some tasks. In this games, the tasks are ... well ... okay. Take some fotos of this, collect that... just simple reasons to get underwater. It's  shallow, but its ok. I get more from this than I get from Subnautica. In Subnautica, you have to explore and survive, simple sandbox concept. Even though I love Subnauticas colorful look, thats nothing that keeps me playing. I prefer concrete tasks, even if they are quite stupid. I would've prefered a real storyline like in Endless Ocean 2,  but this game is far from that.\nI like it that there is no fighting and shooting in this game, that definitely helps with point 1 I mentioned above.\nThird and last, the game should have a smooth gameplay and shouldnt have a lot of bugs. Sadly, the game has some issues. Sometimes fishes glitch, sometimes the game begins to stutter, sometimes you bug though walls, fishes act as if you weren't there... Then there is no voice acting, the way you have to accept tasks again at some random point after you got them from Mr. Jamaika-Man is really confusing... The list goes on. It is nothing that completely destroy the game, but I think this is where all the bad reviews largely come from.\nAdditionally, it is not clear in which way this game is still in development, leaving EA... there were, lets say \"regular\" updates, but seldom something big. I dont think there will be a lot of content added in the future.\n\nIt is a really flawed and lacking game with some good essence after all: The feeling of being underwater at nice locations that you can experience with good VR controls.", "timestamp_updated": 1500394229, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500394229, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "34087073", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486540", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505324686, "steamid": "76561198162416184", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I love it !!", "timestamp_updated": 1502130586, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1502130586, "votes_down": 9}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 118, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 88, "total_reviews": 206}}
