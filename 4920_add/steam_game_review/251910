It's always easy to tell what is background and what is a phyiscs object, which some of these games struggle with.\n\nYou get levels that ask for a degree of pre-planning and then precision execution of each step, and then levels with such a bizarre 1-step solution that the only way to find it is to keep throwing trial and error restarts using different angles and timings, and then watch the game play itself when you finally get it right. \n\nThis is the main problem with the game.

You start out on a space station where you l;aunch yourself in whichever direction you wish, and there is planets and debris scattered around that you need to navigate through. You can use the planets orbits to your advantage to move without using up your fuel, and the same goes for shooting plasma into the stars, it creates an energy burst which also can propel you.
