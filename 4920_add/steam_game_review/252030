Some of the platforming puzzles require patience and timing and are very rewarding once completed. The boss fight are spectacular, and numerous I should add. This game have a lot of bosses that you have to beat in order to progress, it also has very challeging optional bosses that unlock either an upgrade in stats, equipment, material or even add a little bit more to the already existing one lore . The combat is very diverse with 4 characters and many weapons, accessories, and spells to tinker with. The cities and dungeons are interconnected with doors and walls that will unlock once you get abilities and keys. \n\nGreat atmosphere, lovely music, fantastic combat design, intricate city and dungeon design, very challeging platforming(also present in boss fights), hell even a good story.

There is a lot of frustration attached to this title. Categories typically get a base score, followed by pros and cons.\n\n\nGraphics: 7/10\n==========\nAcceptable. Something feels off with the visuals though... almost like this is one of those Free RPG games for your phone. +7\n\n\nSound: 5/10\n=========\nSound effects are weak and lack any pressure behind them. Boring. +5 for effort.\n\n\nMusic: 9/10\n========\nThe music in this game is surprisingly outstanding. Well done. +9\n\n\nStory: 3/10\n========\nIt's just awful. Boring setting and boring characters, boring nemesis who isn't even a nemesis until the very end of the game. +3\n\n\nGameplay: 6/10\n===========\nSide scrolling hack and slash with magic abilities, stealth mechanics, dodging, RPG elements and items + equipment. +7\n\nMany bosses and enemies are a joy to fight, because they have set attack patterns that you'll have to learn in order to beat them. You will get hit plenty, but will learn along the way. Good premise. +1\n\nMagical abilities are fun to use, somewhat useful, and have nice variety and stats attached to them. +1\n\nCombat system is clunky and gets dragged down by the lack of movement your character emits when they attack. I believe the developers wanted this to be a \"opening\" that you'll get punished for if your attacks don't connect. This opening however has a drag time of WAY TOO LONG. It needs to be a shorter delay. -1\n\nCancel mechanic badly implemented as you'll accidentally be using it constantly just for having quick fingers. It'd be nice to hold a button and THEN use the mechanic. -1\n\nSome platforming sections in this game are okay. Some. The rest are extremely frustrating. It's even more frustrating that enemies respawn when you leave the screen, even though you have to come back to some screens, dodging not only the enemies you wanted to stay dead, but continue trying to platform the frustrating sections. You're forced to dodge the enemies and platform. This in and of itself is not a bad thing, but it's poorly implemented in this game. -1\n\n\nOverall: 6/10 (30/50 = 0.60)\n=====================\nAs I said in the opening, this is just borderline of me recommending it. Frustration is never something you want in your video game...ever. You want hard, not frustrating. \n\nStarted boring because of a lackluster story. Gameplay had me hooked for awhile until the platforming and cancel mechanic became an issue. I recommend others who love side scrolling action games to give it a try. A. Try. \n\nIf it had a better control scheme implemented, and the platforming sections were less tedious, this would be an easy 9/10 game.", "timestamp_updated": 1505338364, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505338179, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35093683", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506038405, "steamid": "76561197983934654", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 36}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Valdis Story: AC is a great game that has had me coming back to play since i bought it. I have put 30 hours into the game and that is just on 2 characters. I still have the other characters to play as and the story does change (minorly in some parts and more in others) when you change characters. There is a story but it is more about the Lore than story line. The books you find throughout the game reveal a good bit of that lore. While the mechanics of combat can be a bit overwhelming at times, stepping back and assessing the situation might serve better than wildly running in and swinging. Observe the patterns of the enemies and watch for openings. Just because the game is hard or you cannot perform as well as you'd like, it doesnt mean the game sucks. The music is pretty good as well.\n\ntl;dr\n$15 for 30+ hours of gameplay... worth it imo", "timestamp_updated": 1505949455, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505949455, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1079, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 192, "total_reviews": 1271}}
