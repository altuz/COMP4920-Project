It's getting better, but I enjoy it for more than the gameplay. If you want to know about gameplay and the genre, etc. You may be better served reading a different review. Know that the game is early access. It is improving, with bugs being squashed, game mechanics being tweaked, and new aspects being introduced.\n\nI became aware of slow TV via Norwegian programming. Slow TV programs run for hours sometimes even tens of hours, showing a task in its entirety, like the preparation and burning of a log fire. The programming shows the actual effort that goes into creating things. There's no montage to steal that appreciation for the real effort, which yields the result and how that effort contributes to the satisfaction in the well done job.\n\nMaia has held my interest in a similar way. On the other hand, Maia sometimes feels like an Advent calendar. I open it up, get a treat and go away, returning when it's time to open the next box. \n\nObserving the steady progress and effort put out by Simon Roth has made the game rich for me. I watch the pathing today and know that Simon spent significant effort to improve it. At the start of each game, I wonder how food consumption will proceed, because it's been tweaked over and over in the effort to find the right balance. I take direct control of the utility robot with its laser welder off to the livestock room for some culling, and anticipate the day that the oxygen draining chicken parades are no more.\n\nSimon is a responsive developer, but is firmly set on his vision of Maia. He interacts with the community, taking ideas, offering explanations, and generally demonstrating his interest in what people have to say. If a developer version of the game goes south, I'm used to his quick action to restore the game to a playable state.\n\nOwning Maia is contributing to a Work. What kind of Work might be up for debate, but that Simon Roth has set out to create a Work is unquestionable. Indie gaming has seen its share of failures. Developers throwing up their hands and calling whatever was in front of them \"good enough\". For years Simon has steadily plodded along, singlehandedly developing his concept. I applaud that effort. From the outside it's like watching concert music being composed with various movements being created in a fit of inspiration and then being worked over to complement each other. Frankly, I can't wait to see this Opus finished.\n\nThe fact is that this game has held my attention more than any other purchase I've made.

I am playing the 0.63 release. The game has come along and is in a playable state. There are some balancing issues but nothing eggregious. I feel like the game could be a bit harder. I think you get through the early game quite fast and then it slows to a crawl as you wait for your colonists to build the things they let you know via email. \n\nThe email system could be cleaned up some, as sometimes the emails open on there own, and you have to close them. Other times you see an email that has not been opened. As you read the emails and respond to them, and to other crises around the colony, you decide what should be built and order it. Then you sit and wait until your colonists get around to it. \n\nI am not sure but I think the smelter works automatically though sometimes you check it and as soon as you hover over it it starts working. I would like a dialog of the smelter so you always know what state it's in.\n\nBUG:The 3D printer can be placed to close to a wall and the new IMPs cannont get of from between the wall and the printer. This last item I will report to the devs. \n\nWANTS:I would like to see the walls bias out of view as you mouse over them so you can more easily see what you're working on in the room.\n\nIn conclusion I want to see this game completed and I recommend it even now due to such high potential.", "timestamp_updated": 1505145306, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505145306, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35099351", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462423", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504852704, "steamid": "76561198014148632", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 6, "review": "Refused to discuss issues publically to my satisfaction.\nRefused to discuss privately.
