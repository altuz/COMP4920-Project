I\u2019m not stranger to RTS games; they are my favored genre of gaming second only to RPGs and the two change places frequently.  I say this so that many will understand where I come from when deciding if I recommend this game.  At its heart we have a simple RTS that could find a good home on console or even a tablet, for the PC\u2026well; it is a bit too slow for the average RTS gamer.\n\nUncontrollable:  This game was obviously designed with a controller in mind.  I don\u2019t mean this disrespectfully; I feel these games were needed to allow RTS games to slowly transition as a viable genre for the consoles but I feel the entire game is a bit too simplified for a mouse and keyboard.  The game seems balanced over the intention you are going to be struggling with the controls and not have access to the precision of a mouse.  A small soapbox:  I really wish mouse and keyboard options would just become standard options for a console; shouldn\u2019t be more than a software upgrade but I digress!\n\nChildish:  I get the overwhelming feeling this game was meant for children, or at very least gamers who are not familiar with RTS as a genre.  If you are a veteran player of this genre you will get no challenge from this game.  You will also probably find the game boring.  The story is a bit silly and doesn\u2019t really have any depth but is amusing at times.  I feel as they were trying to find an excuse to do a controller RTS with zombies and here you go; not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nBut will it blend:  Ultimately, you know what you are getting here.  About 4 hours of simplified RTS that would be great for a child or someone new to the genre and for $5 I can get behind that.  The game is old but does seem to keep up graphically, audibly but could use some updates for modern graphic options.\n\nSo, I\u2019m going to say sure, why not.  For $5 and understanding that it would make a great entry to into the Genre then yes I\u2019d recommend it.  This is the RTS equivalent of throwing someone Banjo for an entry into an enjoyable but approachable platformer.  So, if you have a child wanting to play games or never played an RTS here you go!", "timestamp_updated": 1496376773, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496376545, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31464242", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1478756127, "steamid": "76561198154299846", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 237, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Good all around graphics and fun.
