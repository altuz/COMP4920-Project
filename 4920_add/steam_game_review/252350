Old school beat'em up action. This is Double Dragon on steroids.\n\nCons: A little bit clunky in the controls (Double Dragon Advance had better controls). However, do not let this hold you back from a great experience. \n\nOverall, very happy I bought this at launch, full price. It is a worthy title on the Double Dragon franchise.", "timestamp_updated": 1505550958, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505550958, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 577, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 162, "total_reviews": 739}}
