You might call it 3D Dwarf Fortress Lite, but it still already has more features than most other games in the same genre, and it's fully playable and fun at launch, so it definitely gets points there!\n\nHowever, I still can't recommend it in its current state. I experienced several issues, the biggest of which was the framerate. Even on the lowest settings, it was unplayable after a few hours of playing. This might be because I'm using an older laptop, but it runs other games that should be a lot more intense just fine. I noticed the framerate got much worse after I dug down pretty far, but that may just be a coincidence. The autosave feature also needs a lot of work. It completely ruins the flow of the game, and it's very intrusive. You can adjust the frequency, or disable it but that doesn't really solve the problem. I appreciate the feature because I forget to save sometimes, but I would like to see improvements there.

Despite that, I'm having a great time with this game and am happy to be a part of this games growth.\n\nMaybe I can post this on the discussion board for this game, but a few things I'd like to mention are the tutorial and selecting individual dwarfs. It seems like the tutorial won't tell you much unless you actually select and action (build, harvest, etc) then a window will pop up telling you what to do. This avoids the intro system like \"start by diggin here...build something here...now be sure to make a <thing>.\" I know sometimes such tutorials can be a drag but this game could benefit from such an intro.\n\nI seem to have a problem telling say just one or two workers what to do, it seems the AI gets confused with one task and has trouble when you tell it to cancel. There's an option to hold right click and drag over a selected action (when a dwarf is selected) to cancel said action, but it doesn't seem to always work.\n\nQuick tips from me if you try the game (you should):\n\nGo into the audio option > Mixer > lower the voices of the traders. They start way too high and scared me when they suddenly spoke.\n\nPause is your friend. I just pause while I decide what to make a worker do.\n\nSelect every icon to get a tutorial box explaining what can be done, and learn from there.\n\nNow to be fair I'm only about an hour in, so I'll probably get a better handle as things go on.
