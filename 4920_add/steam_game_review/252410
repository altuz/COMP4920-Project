Progression was on point for me, combat started off monotonous, but got fairly interesting later on, and the world itself was intriguing and fun to explore, admittedly after unlocking most tools/equipment, which I adored. My only downsides were that your teleporters didn't have a menu to choose which one you travelled to, and that there wasn't anywhere to store your extra cash while you save for a big upgrade.
