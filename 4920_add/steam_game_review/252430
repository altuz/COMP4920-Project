I am yet to play this game for more than 15 mins without it crashing or glitching. Every now and then the enemies will just turn into white pixels, which can be a completely jarring experience. The combo system is intriguing as it allows you to air juggle, along with incorporate a number of different weapons in combat. However using the assist character isn't a fine tuned enough feature to use outside of the brief puzzle/platforming parts. The levels, background illustrations and character design are gorgeous and the steam punk feel is fresh and consistent, however sometimes hard to appreciate the manic action on screen. Speaking again on the combat, while it has its flashy moments, its not the most rewarding system. True it packs in a bunch of abilities such as dashing, side rolls, and dives, but battle range from simply pressing one button to beat the crap out of all on screen enemies, to furiously trying to dodge bullets and fight at the same time.
