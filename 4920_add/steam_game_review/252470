Extremely fun and highly addictive. Fluff out of the way its now time to break down the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nGreat Devs who have put out consistant patches and continue to crush bugs thoughout the early access.\n\nBlock style ship building with lots of choices for parts and designs.\n\nAlot of weapon choices to deversivefy your play experience\n\nAlot of replay value with multiple maps and customizable map options\n\nOption to select the exact parts you want\n\nGood graphics - Graphics are good and run smoothly even on low end computers.\n\nSmoth game play and Controls - Controls are simple and blend together smoothly allowing you to battle other ships rather then battling clunky controls.\n\nEasy Learning Curve -The game features and strategies are easy to figure out (with help from tutorial) so the player can spend more time enjoying the game rather then trying to figure out how to fight or how to rule the galaxy. \n\nVoice Acting - New addition \n\n\nCons\n\nDificulty curve could use some fine tuning. Base game with base map options player is extremely weak and does alot of running from pretty much everything. About half way through the player is a god one on one. (This con can be adhusted with map options)\n\nComputer control captians who have a starbase struggle to maintain the area. They rarely clean bandits out of their territory unless a bounty is set on it and they rarely upgrade their starbases level. \n\nZombie mechanics could use alittle tuning. When they spawn the game pace changes drastically as zombies convert any captain they beat in battle even if you the player are in the battle and ultimately win the fight. Respawn time for zombie captains and what they spawn with feel amped up from normal as non-zombie captains will take time to rebuild. Fights around zombie space are pretty much just a flood of none stop zombies. Where i understand the zombies are suppose to be dificult as they are the end game, these effects dont make the zombies dificult for the player it just changes the pace to crush the zombies so I can get back to the game. I feel the zombies are trivalized in the base game. (This con can be adjusted with the map options)\n\nMultiplayer option was not able to be. This is not do to a lack of trying on the Dev's part. \n\n\nOverall SPAZ2 is an excellent game that is both well built and Fun.  With Dev's who listened to and guided the game with community feedback in mind. I would recommend this game even at full price as you will definitely get your $20 worth if you are a fan of this style of game.", "timestamp_updated": 1504805511, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504804723, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35070653", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518803", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505847115, "steamid": "76561197960912290", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Not bad at all. A bit difficult to explain really, it's a top down shooter and a 3rd person shooter in real time. It also has base building/empire building mechanics and a RPG level system. It plays a bit like Civilization in the empire aspects, and a bit like Black Flags ship to ship combat in the ship aspects. It feels a lot different from the first SPAZ, but pretty much all in good ways. For as simple as the game may sound, it has tremendous depth in every aspect. It's a bit overwhelming in fact, but it is explained rather well in the tutorial. This is for those who enjoy the empire building type of game but want more action focused, combat oriented gameplay. Not nearly as in depth as something like Galactic Civilizations 3, which I'm happy about. There is just enough empire managing while no real micro-managing. Ship building is actually a little more taxing, requiring you to understand/remember a list of symbols referring to a series of attributes. Pretty easy to understand and read either way, there is a TON of ship parts and overall I feel the basics (how do I get more CORES???) is a little under explained.

I felt the need to place a mothership on one side of my empire to get to quickly when that side came under attack.

And I mean, like, exactly the same. And yet, for some reason I found the characters to be more charming this time around. I'm not sure why, exactly, since they're pretty much the same as ever (maybe I'm used to them and associate them with memories like game mascots?). Don't expect the plot to suck you in, but with that said, I actually enjoy it more this time around than in SPAZ 1, and when references to the original pop up, it actually kind of makes me want to go back and play it for the generic plot (which I never expected). Findable lore (think codex entries) is also implemented. The dialogue for the characters is amusing and well written, and the voice acting is suprisingly good (the voice acting probably made me chuckle at a few lines I would have otherwise dismissed).\n\nThe overall presentation is where I feel this game shines (again, judging the VR version). I never would have expected a game like this to transfer over to VR so well. I got this to try out the VR expecting a cobbled together turd, but the maps and menus look and work great (seriously, one of my favorite, if not favorite GUIs in VR so far) and the gameplay transitions over perfectly. The ONLY problem with the VR version is the lack of keyboard typing (start a new game out of VR to name your profile), and I cannot stress how impressive it was to go from SPAZ 1 straight to SPAZ 2 in VR. The change to 3D looks nice too, and overall it just feels more professional than the original.\n\nGameplay... I have mixed feelings about. Actual combat never really felt like there was very much skill or strategy involved in SPAZ, and with the transition to 3D I'd say the problem is more apparent. Ships move slower now, making it harder to effectively dodge ordinance. Because of this, battles mostly feel like \"whoever has the biggest ship wins\". Sure, you can get creative with your ship building and make strategies like dedicating certain sides of your ship to different functions or something (one side has missile defense, one side is good for removing shields, etc.), but you don't really have many options in an actual fight. Negatives aside, battles are still fun, just not nearly as engaging as they could be. It's still satisfying building up your fleet. \n\nThe biggest change aside from the 2D to 3D transition is the star map. I've seen complaints, but personally I'd say it's a step in the right direction. It gives the game a more open world feel, and makes the universe feel more active.\n\nAll in all, I like this game. I wish there were more \"build up a fleet and shoot s**t\" games like this. That said, if there is a sequel I PRAY that the combat is more fast paced. Something like Star Control 2 - The Ur-Quan Masters (a.k.a. one of the greatest f**king games ever, a.k.a. if you never heard of it GO DOWNLOAD IT NOW and erase a weekend from your schedule). If this game ever gets combat as engaging as that (which I would describe as Asteroids, if Asteroids was one of the greatest f**king games ever), then it would instantly shoot up to my top 10 list.", "timestamp_updated": 1506619964, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506619964, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35332543", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500026", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506765907, "steamid": "76561197987095420", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1019}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It is, honestly, SPAZ - the sequel. And it's good.\n\nThe developers did a brilliant job capturing the charm of the original SPAZ, sprucing it up with lovely graphics, soundwork and adding a few new mechanics that very much feel in place.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- The graphics. A lot of work was put into them, the ships really look their part and watching your own grow from a ramshackle contraption built from scavenged junk grow into a fearsome battleship built from cherry-picked parts is just pure joy.\n\nFans of the original will likely get a blast from seeing familiar strikecraft return - Short Bus and Hammerhead included, along with background graphics that we've seen in the first game. Zoom into a territory segment and spot an old warp gate, a floating sign or a broken up starbase.\n\n- The ship building mechanic. Assembling your ship with a big tractor beam feels cool and I will admit that I cackled like a maniac when I finally got my hands on a Mass Driver. The Synergy mechanic is a cherry on top, adding an additional level of challenge in building a ship.\n\n- The Atmosphere. The 'verse gets its fair share of Dog-eat-dog attitude, and the mechanics back that up. The humour is very much back as well.\n\n- Combat. Slicing hostile ships into bits, watching parts fly off into the distance is very entertaining. For a taste of min-maxed, gimmicky ships there is also the Arena - each station offers simulated battles where you can test various heavily specialized ships for fun and profit.\n\n- Quite fun 4x-lite element. Building up a bit of an empire, hiring captains to work for you - it's actually quite good, fairly polished.\n\n- The Story Mode. Much like the original SPAZ, it introduces certain mechanics as you progress through the game. It's also delightful to see the cast of the original game return, now with voice! If you ever wondered what Carl sounds like, well, you will hear him quite a lot.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Oversaturation. As the game progresses, ships get more and more armed - and there are more and more effects on screen, sometimes making it difficult to determine what is going on - making some battles confusing.\n\n- Repetitive combat in the late game. Once you have your dream set-up for a ship, many battles can be just curbstomps.\n\n- A rather steep learning curve. Those who have played the original SPAZ will know the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon type, but newcomers to the series will need to pay attention to what they loot or purchase. Much like in the first game, it's very easy to gimp yourself in the early game with an inappropriate weapon setup.\n\nThe Your Mileage May Vary:\n\n- The levelling system. I personally liked the progression tree of the original, and while I do see why it was replaced, the current system feels slightly lackluster.\n\n- Simplified resource gathering. The game has shifted, heavily, towards combat between captains and the 4x element, and I personally feel it lost a bit of its \"pirate\" part. Where the original SPAZ had a very hands-on approach to acquiring Goons or Data - such as, in the case of Goons, raiding a spacelane traffic jam, or space-motel. For Data, the original's equivalent of XP - you could go after a Comet, or... donate Goons as guinea pigs at a research station. To top it off, who can forget sitting next to a mining station and stealing their Rez as they mine?\n\nThe sequel replaced those with nodes you can harvest or pillage, and occasionally - Bandit hives and Mining Ops that harbor a certain amount of resources. However, barring bandit hives - which are a typical combat encounter with the rather weak, especially in the late game, bandit faction, and the mining ops which work in a manner similar to the original ones - those are used explicitly from the world map view.\n\nOverall, SPAZ 2 is a title, in my opinion, definitely worth its price - and doubly so if you liked the original and want to see more of Elsa, Carl and Jamison - despite their best efforts at just staying alive and getting rich - ruining everything.
