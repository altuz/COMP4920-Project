The graphics are ok at best, animations are choppy, lightning behaves strangely and textures don't look so good. Another problem is the really weird camera view that can easily cause motion sickness.\n\nWhat this game is lacking is not a good setting, the core idea of a stealth like game set in ancient times is really interesting, it's the execution that fails to deliver. Everything just feels unpolished, weird and glitchy. There's just nothing that feels good.\n\nLastly, the price of 5.99\u20ac is unjustified, if this was a free game then it would be worth a try but spending 6\u20ac on a game in which you mostly just run around searching for stuff with monsters that are hardly a threat chasing you is not worth it.", "timestamp_updated": 1503170278, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503170278, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 138, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 59, "total_reviews": 197}}
