Once you start crossing the border, oh god, it becomes REALLY difficult. \n\n--\nPros: \n+ High Replay value. I'm still stumbling onto new events, finding new cars, new weapons, new strategies...\n\n+ Detailed: Different traits can elicit different responses. Even dogs have their own events. \n\n+ Lots of variations: Characters can be randomized, creating different scenerios and outcomes\n\n+ Dogs!! You can play as a dog, OR have a dogo companion. \n\n+ Customizable characters: Have fun putting yourself in the game...and see how long you last. \n\n+ Humor: There's a bit of humor incoporated into the game, making it fun to play. \n\nCons:\n- Really, the only con I can think of is that once you reach Canda, it sort of loses the replability and challenge. Reaching Canda took me 60+ hours to do though.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1505071338, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505071338, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34978650", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524160", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506777283, "steamid": "76561198168966627", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "I can proudly say this is one of the BEST games I own.\n\nAmazing soundtrack,\nAmazing gameplay,\nIncredible re-playability.\n\nJust get this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1505500912, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505500912, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35212183", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506380282, "steamid": "76561198096614452", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 268}, "votes_funny": 4, "review": "[b][h1][u]The first time I made it to Canada was somewhat like this:[/u][/h1][/b]\n\n>Start off with my friend\n>\"Main\" char is too depressed and runs away\n>Play as Friend\n>Recruit Mechanic\n>Run off towards Canada\n>Halfway there we find a Gnome riding a rat.\n>Reqruit the old bugger\n>Best intimidator simply because he yells and is half deaf\n>Gets us out of various situations\n>Get a dog.
