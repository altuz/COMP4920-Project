I dont play platformers without a pad and I have better sidescroll adventure games that involve real puzzles and better story. Because of the nice art direction, proper PC resolutions, and the possibility that the narrative might open up later I will put this with other point&click adventures of the sidescroll variety but I am not too happy about it. This game was clearly designed as a platformer first and foremost.\n\nRepetitive narrative with near identical lines being read to you every screen. You are a shadowperson from shadowplace but you come to the world to find colors because reasons and the void is after you. Runner sequences are slow and badly executed. \n\nGood pacing. Decent voice acting. Presents like a series of mini puzzles. You get to unlock a paint for every world you beat. Each paint can be applied on ground to change how it reacts (slide, bounce) making the game sort of a paint&run game. Lack of Xbox360 pad support makes sense because of the gimmick involved here but it seriously hurts the value of this title as a platformer. The art was pretty good for what it was, and well animated at that. Story itself just felt like the narrator was repeating himself over and over and over and over again which made the game feel all that more thin and dragged out.", "timestamp_updated": 1505200208, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504900276, "votes_down": 8}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 681, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 99, "total_reviews": 780}}
