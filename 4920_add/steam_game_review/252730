If you aren't laughing, you may very well be dead inside.\n\nThe only \"con\" I can give YDKJ is that given its age, some of the questions and references are a bit dated. Those without ample knowledge of the 80's and 90's might find themselves a bit lost at times, so if you are hoping for something a bit more relevant one of the more recent games may be a better choice.
