That's the only way I can describe the game.  At first it's ok, some what interesting but quickly becomes tiresome.  Late game puzzles have you timing things to split one of your three mice down a different path to trigger some explosion or collect an item, then you remove the block that split your mice and all three get to the end - rinse & repeat. Lemmings had you doing different things with your lemmings, these mice just run in one direction.  There is no real story so it's just progressive puzzle solving but the progression takes too long and is far too limited.", "timestamp_updated": 1505047250, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505047250, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 44, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 55}}
