Just annoying at first, but as you advance in the game it becomes frustrating when you get killed every couple of minutes by some ghost, and then yanked back to a previous save room, only to start your way through that hospital section all over again. I know old school console charm and all that jazz but why can't we just save whenever on PC, it avoids a ton of frustration!\nClaire First Impression 60fps Exploring The Hospital \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv_fWcyZpmc\n0:00 Starting up the game, little girl prelude.\n1:23 Dear Santa.
