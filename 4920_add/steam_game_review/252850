Within a few rounds you can get a good grip of the game. The game can include up to 16 players. 15 Runners plus a Hunter. The Hunter has the ability to kill the Runners in one hit. The runners compete for points by collecting orbs of differing values while using a dash meter. The dash meter is filled by pickups and you gain more points if you collect orbs while dashing. The movement in the game is context sensitive, as you can wall-run and do similar acrobatic feats while holding a button. If you are killed, you become a ghost. A ghost can no longer collect orbs, but can gain an increasing amount of points by punching a randomly assigned, still-alive runner. The game is played in 3 rounds that last a few minutes and the point total is cumulative, so if you die early in the first round, you can try to make up for it in the second round (and perhaps sabotage the runners who have amassed more points than you). If you are still alive at the end of a round, ghosts disappear and a sudden death commences, where you are finally able to kill the hunter by landing a hit on him, you just have to survive long enough and land a hit. The Hunter is scored via a letter grade (F- to A+ it seems), while the runner with the most points wins.\n\nThere is intergration with twitch, as you can host or join lobbies by linking your twitch account in-game and then using the developer's twitch player at https://streamote.tv/. You do not have to install anything, as some people seem to be confused on how this works. The end result is that you are able to find lobbies via this website, join a party, and play with a streamer (or if you are a streamer yourself, host). Viewers are able to view the stream of the game and use a point system to influence the game through different global buffs/debuffs that they choose when to activate. They can also bet on who they think will win and rack up more points via bingo in the lobby.\n\nTo put it simply it's a competitive score-based platformer with asymetrical gameplay (Hunter, Runner & Ghost). It also involves optional stream integration, so that viewers may influence the gameplay. It's still early-access at this point, but feels solid and I have enjoyed the quirky experience so far.

The second game mode is similar to quidditch in that players try to score goals with a golden ball, but they still do parkour rather than fly on brooms.\n\nPlayers move very fast and rounds are full of additional effects that influence each game (chosen either randomly or by viewers' vote if the game is being streamed on twitch). Things such as the floor turning into lava, players exploding if they touch each other and the camera view rotating at disturbing angles make the gameplay diverse during each game.\n\nMoreover, you customize your character with items gained from packs which you open out of play similarly to Hearthstone. From making your character run around in their underpants to having them wear antlers, a gas mask or a hoodie. You can even change your race and gender at any time. Also you have a taunt action which makes your charater do a little performance such as doing the chicken walk or dabbing. It's perfect for when you want want to show off while winning the game.\n\nI got Streamline during a free weekend that was held a few months ago and I've been hooked ever since.
