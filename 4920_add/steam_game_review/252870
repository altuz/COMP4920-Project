Slow paced exploration based game-play, but moments of FTL-like panic as you try and work together to solve the myriad of challenges that can suddenly beset your ship without warning.\n\nI have fond memories of beaming down to alien worlds with my crew, and the suspense of not knowing what we will find as we explore.\n\nHighly recomend, if you like intelligent complex management, teamwork, and are open to a slower paced game.", "timestamp_updated": 1504569928, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504569928, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34892870", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498757", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505184357, "steamid": "76561197960512590", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very solid game with plenty of potential.

Very intelligent open world concept, including a large galaxy that includes hundreds of explorable planets.  However, if you are a gamer who is looking for a good story based sci-fi space exploration type of game then this is NOT the game for you.  This game requires deep thought process and a strong understanding of the game mechanics and roles.  This game is also much better experienced when played with people THAT YOU KNOW AND CAN TALK TO OUTSIDE OF THE GAME.  This will give you the greatest opportunity for success.  The game is hard, and requires a lot of deep thought and understanding as I said, you don't really get a break.  I also suggest reading on how to be successful in this game as well as reading the manual in game.  There is a lot that must be maintained and done on the ships.  Also do not pay any attention to the other reviews....They clearly don't understand that this game isn't supposed to be simple and perfect....there is a lot to comprehend", "timestamp_updated": 1506021642, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506021642, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34969147", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501192", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505457827, "steamid": "76561198064215349", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "allright but noone plays where i live", "timestamp_updated": 1505473565, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505473565, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35038599", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465470", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505707988, "steamid": "76561198053130979", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's a broken, early access game that's currently lacking in any features that make the game worth playing.", "timestamp_updated": 1505708037, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505708037, "votes_down": 18}, {"recommendationid": "34982763", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446052", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506550508, "steamid": "76561198287202132", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 36}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "the talk fecture for the game DOSE NOT WORK and you need it so nobody yells saying and get baned", "timestamp_updated": 1505514996, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505514996, "votes_down": 27}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 961, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 7, "total_negative": 104, "total_reviews": 1065}}
