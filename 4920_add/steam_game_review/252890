He could be good or bad and that depends literally on the player. Choices matter! That is really an interesting aspect that I haven't really seen a lot on hidden object games. So the story isn't new in its genre, but everything else makes up for it.\n\nSo, the characters. Besides Dracula, they're not particularly multilayered, but it doesn't matter. HOGs are rarely as much about characters as they are about playing a detective. In this case, the relationships between characters are quite interesting and change, depending on your choices. It was quite humorous at points too, especially the quarrels between Van and Igor.\n\nThe art is really, really nice. Dark on one areas, light on others, more realistic on some and fantasy like on the rest. It was extremely nice to look at. Though the Queen Of Vampires' hair is a bit ridiculous..\n\nGameplay is pretty easy, but some of the puzzles are hard. And the thing is, that even if there's a strategy guide, it doesn't always offer help. I think it's a slight minus because you immediately lose a chance to get one achievement. If there's a strategy guide, it should have solutions to ALL puzzles, no exception. But there was quite a lot of puzzles I haven't seen in other games - or can't remember at the moment - and nice power ups to collect that helped you along the game.\n\nI don't know if it's my PC or not, but the cut scenes seem a bit... buggy, I guess it's the word.
