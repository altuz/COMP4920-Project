I honestly don't ever see a time where i'll stop playing this, the gameplay never gets old. The physics are spot on for the ball and car handling. If you play Ranked then you will only ever choose 1 of 4 cars to play with that have the best physics, turning radius, hitbox etc.\n\nI will say that it's one of these games that you will either get into or you won't, there's no middle ground really. Actually originally i was gonna hold off on getting this but then i technically got it free when i bought a Steam Controller which came bundled with Rocket League and Portal 2, i woulda got it sooner if i knew how fun and addictive it was...or maybe i wouldn't have so i could spend more time playing all the steam games i neglect cos of this one lol.\n\nThere are 4 standard game modes being 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and chaos which is 4v4, 3v3 usually being the most played and also most balanced. 1v1 and 2v2 are the most tense, if you make a mistake in those modes you will pay for it. The 3v3 mode allows more leeway for mistakes. The chaos 4v4 mode is the most goofy fun one, but only new players tend to play that one, so it's hard to find a game of chaos with skilled opponents which is a shame.\n\nThere are also special game modes which include an ice hockey one where the ball is now a puck that slides around the pitch. Hoops which is a 2v2 basketball mode (i'm not good at that mode). Rumble mode where you all get powerups which enable you to swap places with the enemy or mess with their driving physics, that mode is the most luck based, it's fun to play for 5 minutes but i honestly haven't played it since it released. I think Dropshot is the most recent mode where you have to score by breaking the ground away on the opponents side and drop the ball through the hole you created. That mode is pretty interesting and probably my fave along with the ice hockey one.\n\nNegatives would be that Psyonix are becoming increasingly greedy in how they priced the DLC cars. When they first introduced the DLC cars you got 2 for like \u00a32.50 i think, and then it was about \u00a31.60 to buy each car separately. And finally now to get new cars you have to f*ck with their crate and key system. No longer can you just....you know buy a f*cking car you might want! you need to buy a key or set of keys to open a crate which among other useless cosmetic items MIGHT contain the car you want.\n\nI'm not spending \u00a320 on keys to unlock 2 cars, or spending hours trying to trade crates or a number of cosmetics with people, i don't play this game to trade, If anyone that works at Psyonix reads this can you please give us the option of buying the cars outright again, i don't think it's too much to ask in all honesty. Rule number one of game development should be don't force your playerbase to use a system they hate, especially when you used to be able to buy the cars from the store.\n\nI think a lot of more casual players may not even realise that there are new cars you can only get through the crate system. I know some fanboys may defend these practices because some of the money goes to the Rocket League esports division. My question is why am i being asked to pay for someone elses prize pool? Why don't Psyonix pay the winners through sponsorships or something like wtf really, makes no sense to me.\n\nThe other negative and it's a big one, the one that will turn you off the game is the playerbase, this community is the worst i've experienced, i don't play CS:GO so i'm sure that's worse but dude, you will play against or with the most childish, racist, immature and fickle gamers you can imagine. One minute your own teammate will praise you for scoring or saving a goal and the next they will spam \"what a save\" over and over when they hit the ball passed your own goal and you fail to save it in time, i had this happen to me yesterday.\n\nThere are players who will start playing against your team if you hit them by accident or don't let them have the ball for 90% of the game, hell sometimes they just start playing against you for no reason at all. I will say i think the verbal abuse through the chat window has gotten better, you can disable the chat and also report people, i think Psyonix may actually temp ban people now for that kinda stuff, i've seen people on the forums complaining about being banned for that.\n\nIf it were up to me i would get rid of all of the chat and emote spamming from the game altogether. This is the other thing about it, people use the emote spam to save face when they miss the ball to pin a mistake on you, telling you to \"take the shot\" or spamming \"centering\" or \"in position\" when they just handed the ball to the other team, then when the other team scores cos of their mistake they will spam \"What a save\" at their teammates. \n\nI'm not saying i'm amazing at this game, i can admit that i'm average, i'll go for weeks without playing this sometimes and then suck when i come back to it. I'm only Gold II in ranked right now. I think that gives me a good broad perspective on the playerbase though. A tip would be to disable chat and also don't play ranked when you are new cos that's just messed up, learn to play and then join ranked mode.\n\nTo be more positive you do get nice players from time to time, but they are few and far between and also to be honest it actually comes across as creepy to me when they are nice to you in the chat, it's so jarring to what i'm used to lol.\n\nThe matchmaking system also needs to be reconfigured, some games will have you matched with a whole team who may be 2 or 3 levels higher than yours or vice versa. This happens more often than you would think.\n\nThe game offers a lot of content and different game modes though, Psyonix also continually adds new free stadiums and game modes through updates so the game feels fresh and continues to evolve over time.", "timestamp_updated": 1505245693, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "14", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1504959506, "votes_down": 30}, {"recommendationid": "34871090", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 60, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560483", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507185989, "steamid": "76561198136049718", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 62429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2402}, "votes_funny": 55, "review": "3...2...1...

Despite the negative review I will swallow my opinions and keep playing but that doesn't mean that the game is going to right direction.\n\nThe latest updates have only been about removing important things from the game and adding pointless content such as gazillion stupid toppers and stuff that can be bought in crates.\nSome examples of this:\nThere used to be a few maps that differed from the usual and actually made a slight change into the highly repetitive gameplay. The community couldn't handle this and kept crying about it until those maps were removed from competitive games (and the best of these maps, Neo-Tokyo was even removed from casual). Another map, Starbase Arc, was added in the same update. It was also a no go for people because using a few extra brain cells to play in a hexagon is not possible, and Psyonix removed that in the next update.\nThe cars in the game have felt quite balanced but it's obvious that there are a few choices over others, Octane and Batmobile, as no other car is ever seen in high level competitive games like RLCS. What does Psyonix do for this \"issue\"? Standardize all cars into a few hitbox models so you won't accidentally find some variation to your gaming.\n\nAll of this \"dumbing down\" to focus on esports is making the game just boring. Back in the day you could have every 5th match in an arena that forced you play differently and have some variation, now you can grind 8 hours and see the same damn map over and over again while playing with cars that all feel the same.\n\nAnd if being offended by getting features removed from the game wasn't enough, there is always the toxic community to help if your day was too good.

Since there is no appeal system, there are some cases that haven't been taken into account, and I discuss them in my edit below the main thread.\n**********************\nNew ban system is ridiculous.\n1. The \"Language Ban\" list isn't public, so how can you excpect anyone to know what is acceptable to say? Understandably there are obvious words, but some \"racial slurs\" have other meanings at a school playground, or in different countries.\n2. 24 Hour Ban to introduce to the ban system?? Most people play weekends which means that the very first ban accounts for half your weekly gaming! That's equivalent to an 84 hour ban (more than your \"second ban\" duration).\n3. Permanent ban after 4 convictions?!?!? Players invest quite often upwards of 100's of pounds or dollars or euros, and the best answer to bad language used by your community is a permanent ban? I am going to list some alternatives below, that also happen to be more relevant to the offence committed, and it took me 5 minutes to come up with...\n4. What is your plan to combat troll parties of 3 that will get players instant banned if they all report at the same time? I have witnessed these troll parties bully people viciously in the past, then when that person gets upset and eventually retaliates they get banned for it. How is a system that allows 3 bullies to overpower 1 innocent player a \"fair system\"???\n\nAnyway, here is my list of alternative methods;\n>A warning report that allows innocent players a chance to correct their mistakes, by suggesting that they don't lash out in anger OR it will result in a 24 hour ban\n>Following the previous option, an hour ban instead of a 24 hour ban for the first ban, same reason as prior\n>Restricting voice and text chat for players that have abuse *voice and text chat* rather than banning them from the game completely (seen as they still should have the right to access the servers they have paid for, just not the features they have abused)\n>Ban count reductions for good behaviour. This means that if you have a certain number of months of not having a ban, then your total ban count gets reduced so that the previous ban doesn't count towards you ultimately getting permanently banned (Everyone deserves the chance to correct their mistakes, and no-one should have to play with the fear of slipping up or even getting a typo)\n>An option for you to compete against the ban allegation and tell your side of the story. As I am sure administrators have access to the full chat history and gameplay footage, players could appeal their innocence (for issues such as typo's, bullying and other such issues)\n\nTo be honest, with the ban system as it is, Rocket League and thus Psyonix gives the impression that they support bullying and that they do not appreciate the continual support of their community. This and this alone is the reason for my negative review of the game, and I will be happy to change it once this issue gets fixed.\n\n********EDIT********\nBelow I am going to list a couple of examples of bans that would need a more sophisticated ban system for justice to be done.\n>Replying to a question with 'You cant' but accidentally mistyping the 'a'. The suggestion here is that someone is reporting you before you can correct yourself in chat, so the admin in charge of banning you has no idea that it was a typo.\n>Forgetting that your discord push to talk and rocket league push to talk are the same button, so whilst someone ingame thinks you are hurling abuse at them you are actually just sharing a back and forth with your mates in a different app. Now I don't know how the verbal harrasment system works, because Psyonix won't tell us, but if it is a stacking up of reports that gets you banned then this innocent mistake would contribute to that.\n>A younger player asking the meaning of a word they have just read / heard. I have personally seen this happen ingame a lot. The context for this one is that the original offender can choose when to report the young player meaning their comment won't be in the report. (This is a double problem since whilst the innocent / curious young player gets banned, the original offender can continue playing rocket league happily).\nNow I know that there are other variants of these examples, and probably some examples that I haven't covered, but I think these cover the main ones. I am also happy that there is a system to ban the cruel / toxic players on the game to improve the community, but I believe there needs to be a way to distinguish between the cruel and the innocent. The ban system needs to be less abusable by those with malintent.\n\nThanks for all of the support so far! (Please be respectful to those stating their views in the comments as I am sure you would expect respect in return)\n**********************", "timestamp_updated": 1506778735, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "12", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506696349, "votes_down": 36}, {"recommendationid": "35140926", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510793", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507170056, "steamid": "76561197962649016", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 53337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 756}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game has one of the best ratios between time:joy.", "timestamp_updated": 1506127896, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506127896, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35399945", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517503", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507154516, "steamid": "76561198095213537", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1991}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "tilt", "timestamp_updated": 1506902976, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506902976, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "35268173", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506611009, "steamid": "76561198264053130", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 41}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Awesome Game!\nReally fun game to play with your friends!", "timestamp_updated": 1506623271, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506623271, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35314360", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506728720, "steamid": "76561198035414242", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 366}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Always crashes after the update.
