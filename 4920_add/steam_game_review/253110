What a game, what an experience!\nHigh artistic values, great narrative, very good soundtrack, mature theme, dream logic and protagonist you can fully relate to. I'm speechless. How good that game is... c'mon. Truly PSYCHOLOGICAL horror; so beautiful in it's darkness that it breaks my heart. Because it's real. On a very deep personal level it's REAL.\n\nReminds me of \"Detention\" - I recomend you play that game also. \"Detention\" is more of a horror (kinda silent-hill-ish one) than \"The Cat Lady\" (which is more of a dream logic puzzle with dark and gore esthetics and slice of life) but these two share some strong similarities.\n\nThe Cat Lady has some technical flaws but overall it doesn't matter.

This is not just because of the gruesome artwork and puzzles, but it is more because of the story's moving depiction of depression, suicide, and death. The game handles these issues exceptionally well, making the characters and story heartful, human, as well as horrific. \n\nThe only issues I encountered were that the arrow key controls can be slightly annoying. There also seems to be a limited amount of saves possible (about 50) which is not made apparent. Despite these minor issues, the game is executed well and leaves a lasting impact on the player.", "timestamp_updated": 1506713179, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506713179, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35409631", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506935051, "steamid": "76561198409481250", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 461}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A beautiful psychological horror game with amazing story on exploring human themes such as depression, terminal illness, madness, sucide.
