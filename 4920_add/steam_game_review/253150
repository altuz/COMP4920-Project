The gameplay of Halfway is that of a stripped down xcom, borrowing its percentage to hit system, the ammo management, and xcoms' character action system. While the gameplay itself couldn't be called terrible, it is painfully average and is hardly a selling point of the game. Because of this, I'd recommend playing another tactics rpg like shadowrun, xcom or disgaea, as those would probably be a lot more enjoyable from a gameplay stand point. If you care for sci fi stories however, half way is amongst the best indies you could go for. The writing is consistent, the world is engaging and the narrative has a real tension to it which you don't get in many smaller games. I really love how much effort the developers put into building a concrete world behind halfway, and it really shows in every aspect of the pixel art and the sound design. I'm giving Halfway a 6.5/10, but thats mostly because I have hundreds of hours playing xcom.
