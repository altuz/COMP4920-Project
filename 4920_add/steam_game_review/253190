It runs like shit, it plays like shit it's a fucking disgrace to RTS, in my most honest opinion. What a waste of money, I couldv'e just waited for the Re-release of A.O.Mythology. A stupid suggestion buy from an even dumber steam friend whom I've already blocked for other reasons, equally stupid as they are/were. Essentially, stay away, unless you like games where several sub units of any one group of units is locke outside of castle walls because the AI is dogshit and this undead thing is just a cop out to omaking the game better, they probably arent even considering changing any of the actual flaws to this game, considering that I've owned this for a few years now. Regretted it then, still regret it now, Stay away, go play Age of Mythology, much much much much much much much better game.", "timestamp_updated": 1505734871, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505734871, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 284, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 115, "total_reviews": 399}}
