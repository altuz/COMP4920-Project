With little to almost no change to the typical platforming/running formula something unique can be created only by giving its levels a minimalistic gridwire look and fitting electronica soundtrack to create a specific theme for each stage.\n\nRunning at humanly impossible speeds feels just amazing, while you need to adjust running speed, time your jumps and dives right to survive to the next platform. The learning curve may be a bit steep, but as with all those games, they feel rewarding ever so much when you finally get it right.\n\nSanta Ragione has created something unique for them and I can applaud them for their job well done. You cannot make a wrong decision with buying this game, even if you just want to take it a bit more casually. Give it a try!\n\n[h1][u][b]Design & Art[/b][/u][/h1]\nMinimalistic art for a minimalistic game. While playing, visuals never feel overloaded but always sufficient for the established gameplay mechanics of FOTONICA. I would not call a wireframe look particularly innovative or interesting though. Luckily a possibility to change the overall appearance of the game exists. \n\nThe levels of FOTONICA are distinctly unique and surprisingly well themed. Each of them lets you take a plethora of possible routes leading to the end. Finding the way that is manageable plus rewarding enough at the same time is up to the player.\n\n[h1][u][b]Sound & Music[/b][/u][/h1]\nThe mostly electronica soundtrack was composed by three individual composers and fits to a T. Each of the tracks lends a theme to their respective level and creates a sense of uniqueness. Visuals and audio go hand in hand here in my opinion and fit each other perfectly.\n\nUnfortunately, some notes are really high pitched and shrill and disrupt the otherwise marvelous soundtrack. Not only that, in some cases during my playthrough, sounds were not played when they were needed to which ended in some confusion. Apart from these minor bugs, an excellent combination of soundtrack, visual appearance and gameplay in my opinion.\n\n[h1][u][b]Gameplay [/b][/u][/h1]\nFOTONICA focuses, more than other typical runner games, on correct timing and appropriate running speed. You control your runner through one key only, which, while on the ground accelerates the player and on release makes him jump. In the air, the button initiates a dive through the air, making it easier to land correctly.\n\nCompleting levels simply will not cut it, you need to find the best route through each of them and survive in order to break the approriate highscore. Testing your tenacity in three extra endless levels against other players or against up to four players directly in local splitscreen will leave you with much content to play around.\n\nEach level also has four difficulty levels that do not increase the difficulty by altering the level, but by increasing the game speed and making reaction time windows tighter instead. A really interesting approach.\n\n[h1][u][b]Personal Bonus vs. Penalty (10 points max)[/b][/u][/h1]\n\n[b][u]Bonus[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*]Addictive gameplay, that pushes you to the edges of your patience (never feels impossible though, approx. 10 to 20 hours of playtime)\n[*]Uniquely themed stages with fitting respective soundtracks\n[*]Endless levels to push your limits\n[*]Interesting and working concept for increasing the difficulty\n[*]Convincing feeling of speed, feels very good to look at running speeds humanly impossible\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Penalties[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*]Some audio bugs and shrill noises\n[*]Mastering a level on one difficulty will make it easier to complete it on other difficulties, because the routes stay mostly the same\n[*]Very little replay value, no additional randomized content next to endless modes\n[/list]", "timestamp_updated": 1494285670, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494285332, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32813804", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504744", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506709571, "steamid": "76561198090475134", "num_games_owned": 668, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I just love graphic style and design of the game levels", "timestamp_updated": 1498481778, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498481778, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32154032", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502986", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1496415688, "steamid": "76561197989659244", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Interesting visuals, great feel of speed, simple controls.", "timestamp_updated": 1496500820, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496500820, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32222192", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500147", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1497733409, "steamid": "76561198125343129", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "i bought this when this was on greenlight and it was great", "timestamp_updated": 1496763846, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496763846, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32390251", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500147", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503638924, "steamid": "76561198172940450", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "great game", "timestamp_updated": 1497365211, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497365211, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32461715", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487250", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1497582241, "steamid": "76561198070158285", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "This game makes me have sex", "timestamp_updated": 1497582350, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497582350, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "31623184", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478541", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494240861, "steamid": "76561198012096901", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 5, "review": "I don't think you have any idea how fast I really am.\nI'm fast as fuc, boi.
