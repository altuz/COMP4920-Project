The \"point-and-click\" adventure games of the past would be considered difficult and boring by today's standards. Modern gamers probably won't enjoy stepping back in time to play a game requiring a fair amount of patience and critical thinking. But if you remember those days long past with a warm and fuzzy nostalgia, then I don't think you'll be disappointed by this short trip down memory lane. I say \"short\" because it is only an episode. (The developers did not profit enough to make any more, which I think is unfortunate.) I finished it in roughly 3.5 hours, which is longer than others, but I enjoy exploring every dialogue tree and trying silly things to see what I can make the main character do. While the main character isn't very identifiable, every character is memorable and nobody is a throw-away. I only wish I could hear them speak. The music and pixel art is fitting as a tribute game, though I wish there were a few more close-ups and cut-aways. The puzzles are very well balanced in terms of difficulty, which is no small feat for this genre. I got stuck, but I never felt as though I had nothing to do. I'd simply switch puzzles or try other ideas. I think I stumbled upon a solution or two before I encountered the corresponding problem, but that's forgivable in my book. The very last puzzle was frustrating, but maybe that's fair since it should be the most difficult of the game. The humor ranges from clich\u00e9 to lough-out-loud (I had several of these moments). There aren't any game-breaking bugs, but I did experience a little glitch where everything blacked out for a moment. Overall, I think it's fun, and worth its sale price. Too bad there weren't any more episodes made; I'd have bought them on sale too.\n\nCaution: There's lots of swearing, which may surprise you since it has a cartoony art style.", "timestamp_updated": 1425761260, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1425760746, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "15084264", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504426", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1409054695, "steamid": "76561198071295000", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I love this game. It feels so fresh and retro at the same time. The humor is wonderfully thought out and even the minor characters are memorable. The game keeps the Point & Click tradition of bizarre puzzle solutions so you may need a guide for specific parts, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing considering the genre.\n\nThere are two reasons why I cannot reccommend this title at its current $10 price tag. First, for the amount of money you spend, you won't get much replay value out of it. When you consider Steam sales dishing out titles like borderlands 1 & 2 for a $10 total, games like this become a less worthy investment. Plus, GOG.com has a few Point and Click adventures floating around their site for *FREE*. I think the game could stand more of a chance if it routinely went on sale.\n\nSecond, I haven't heard any news on the game's promised sequels. It's been well over a year now since it released and there haven't been any announcements. Worst case scenario is possibly never seeing the real ending.\n\n\nSo in short, Fester Mudd - Episode 1 has nothing wrong with it gameplay-wise. It's actually a great game. If it were $7 or $8 and had a follow-up in the pipeline, I'd definitely recommend it! If this ever goes on sale, grab it!
