The monsters become more of a nuisance than they are scary after the 6th one you encounter; they also slow down your progression of walking through the corridors. You're better off watching the endings and story on Youtube than wasting hours just walking (which is the entire \"gameplay\").", "timestamp_updated": 1506904841, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506904841, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 397, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 143, "total_reviews": 540}}
