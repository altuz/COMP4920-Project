I never once felt like I knew where I was going and quickly grew frustrated at having to change the bullets one-by-one. There's a rapid reload ability, so why is there no rapid ammo-swap ability? Such a simple feature would have made the game far more bearable.", "timestamp_updated": 1499525728, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499525728, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 32, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 43}}
