I bought the mobile version twice and never could get very far in it because I couldn't get used to the touch controls (not the fault of the game), but I could tell it was a game I would like.\n\nI finally bought the PC version and did indeed like it quite a bit. It's relatively shallow as far as story and dialogue, but the exploration and combat are fun, mainly with stealth and crossbow.\n\nThe voice acting was mediocre, but passable. I had no technical or quest problems at all.\n\nIt's was defintely worth the $7 to me. I finished it in 10 hours. It will probably take longer if you go melee.\n\nI wish they would port the Aralon games to the PC.", "timestamp_updated": 1500906508, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500906429, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 53, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 44, "total_reviews": 97}}
