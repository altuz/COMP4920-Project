The difficulty is weird. You can easily get maxed loot, but even then you get instakilled by a zombie that for some reason, hit you twice in a second.\n2. The inability to move while being hit makes the game far more aggravating and annoying.\n3. Gets boring really quickly. Easily obtaining maxed loot can make it seem like there's nothing else to do. Which there is. With no objective, but to wander and keep getting killed by zombies that should be easily killed.\n4. There is nothing you can do to increase health. Your health is perma-locked at bullshit level. Easily getting killed on easy difficulty. No armour, no nothing.\n5. Game feels like it's in early alpha. Feels under-developed. Could have been a really cool game.  But it's far too aggravating, and goal-less.\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n\n1. If you played this back on 360 it feels nostalgic. Such good times back then.\n2. The ride to the end is somewhat fun, especially if playing with friends.\n\n[h1]FINAL VERDICT[/h1]\n\nThe game gets too boring quickly, not worth the $4.00 for 5-10 hours playtime.

You also get to battle enemies from; Werewolves, The Devil and even to Dragons!\n\nBut hey, I did buy this game after all right? That must of meant that I saw something redeeming in this game.

I know the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"full expierience\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" And I still do not recommend this game. Physics feel way to cheap and the game is abandoned pretty much likely to Castleminer Warfare. Also the effects are extremely cheap and I do not believe this was made off of really any money. All the effects are free including music or modified off of other games. Also I don't want to get started with the port. Its locked at 1080P and graphics aren't very good even at max settings and I cap 60 which is the limit to this game. Save up the money this game costs for a game like Minecraft this game was a buying point for (Back on Xbox 360 before Minecraft came out there) Please do not buy this. The devs don't put enough effort in. No updates. Little feedback. And don't buy Castleminer Warfare it looks like shit and likely is just a mod off of CastleminerZ once again.
