This game throws you into nostalgia, with its direct action, fast pacing, rocket jumping and little interest in story. I'm not saying the story is bad, but I finished the game without even knowing it, because it was presented only at intermissions, so you can just bust into action without any disturbance during the gameplay.\n\nThe game has other aspects, including combo killing, that makes you hungry for blood, even risking your life just to increase the combo meter.\n\nIf you want an FPS game with well designed maps, fun fast paced action and a new style of graphics, choose this game.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1498925304, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498925304, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32824526", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505261", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501013870, "steamid": "76561198087709304", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Pros:\nSoundtrack and gameplay are top-notch. The inclusion of a map editor is generous, and the few maps by the community I've played are also pretty good.\nCool story and personality.\nAmazing animations, except for one enemy that sticks out like a sore thumb. It has the most basic walking animation you can find, as opposed to the, again, personality and quality to everything else.\nI love cel-shading.\n\nCons:\nShort game. There's only one episode. If you're only going to make one, don't name the levels 'E1L1' and so forth, that makes it seem like it's unfinished (which it is) and now the dev team's making a new game. (???)\nFew community mods and maps. Also those are mostly unfinished. Seems like there's a trend going on.\nWeird pacing. The late-game bosses are ass clenchingly hard even on the easiest difficulty, but all of the regular enemies are easy, taking 1-4 pistol shots and then gibbing. [spoiler]Except for the railgun lizards and giant robots eating all of my rockets up like Little Debbie's Nutty Bars, and then instakilling me.[/spoiler]\nCheckpoint system and loading times that take an eternity (I timed it: forty-one seconds.) There is quicksaving, but there's only one slot, and it pauses the game, like saving is a big task you need to take time for.\n[spoiler]Only five weapons. They're pretty interesting, but I'd like a little more variety.[/spoiler]\nI know this is a small irk, but after every boss is defeated, music plays, but at the end of it the main character gestures with his fist, communicating, 'alright! I did it!' ...Shouldn't he have done that DURING the celebration music? lol\n\nOverall: I'd only recommend it if it's on sale, which I got it for $2.00.", "timestamp_updated": 1506738898, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498500213, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33266970", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503207", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500289272, "steamid": "76561198091886736", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[b]Feels like Borderlands and Doom had a child together.
