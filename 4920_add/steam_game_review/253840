The platforming is great and the gameplay is well designed. The artsyle took some getting used to, but it quickly grew on me. And as it is in every Shantae game, the story is simple but still fun, and the soundtrack is awesome.\n\nHowever, even if I think the game's great, I feel some of its potential is wasted, mainly when it comes to the transformations. There's a lot of different dances, but there's no balance whatsoever between how often you use them. Some are overused, and some others are used so rarely it's easy to forget they are there. The Spider Dance, for example, which I think is great in concept, is only required once in the entire game, and that's if you're going for 100%. The levels just aren't designed to fit its gameplay, and that's a real shame.\nAlso, I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to make the last stage a Flappy Bird minigame, but it was frustrating and I hated it.\nAll of that might be nitpicking, but I feel like giving some more thought to the level and puzzle design so they fit better would have made this the best Shantae game by far.\n\nSo, is this game worth it? Yes, it is. It has flaws and I still think Pirate's Curse is the best one in the series, but that doesn't mean the game itself is bad at all.

From the onset of the Kickstarter campaign, it was evident that the direction would not adhere to past titles. The newly cell-shaded rendition of Shantae by way of Inti Creates, to the level structure mirroring Mario land, to seeing my favorite character Rotty make it as a playable DLC long after the initial campaign had ended, WayForward had planted the seal of innovation into our expectations well before the conception of stage 2. It was a risk Wayforward took, as if in search of a breakout. I do think it will pan wonders, because features like expansion packs, variable art styles and level progression, and fan-selected palettes, can become mainstay ingredients for creating newer, fresher titles set in the diverse land of Sequin. \n\n[b]Plot[/b]\n\nSimplicity is an effective staple of Shantae\u2019s romp through Sequin. Deeply asleep, a voice calls out to Shantae, sending her underground of Scuttle Town where a mysterious apparition further lends to the confusion. Shantae is a confident half-genie, but at times most confusing, family have often been her crutch. Believing that her uncle could elucidate the oddity, she visits him which serves as the tipping point for the entire journey. This begins with witnessing a tinkerbat and Risky herself stealing Uncle\u2019s newest blueprint: the Dynamo.\n\nUncle later tells her that the Dynamo [i]parts[/i] mustn\u2019t fall within evil\u2019s grasp. Fueled by her recent firing for failed safekeeping of Scuttle Town, she embarks on a transformative quest, most introspective, and every bit set on proving the mayor wrong, to regain her uncle\u2019s lifework and in the process, possibly learn of that nighttime apparition. \n\n[b]Gameplay/Performance[/b]\n\nThe game ran smoothly for the entirety of my 100% run which lasted just shy of ten hours. Parallax scrolling in the new cell-shaded, 2.5-D render style forced me to gawk from time-to-time and take a few harpy arrows while screenshotting the scenery. The diversity in monster design was on par with what we\u2019ve come to expect. The team went all out with transformations in terms of capacity and aesthetics. Please don\u2019t tell me the siren isn\u2019t cute. Swoons.\n\nBoss fights were a mixed-bag. Most of them fell in one try from my platforming awareness, but I can see newer Half-Genies and those playing the genre for the first time stumbling across a hitch or two as they try to analyze patterns and gimmicks to defeat these two\u2014three phase giants. As I mentioned earlier, the levels now have a beginning and an end and are selected via a world map. Thank you Sky! This is a huge divergence from the open world style of past titles, but in all honesty, it did not make the game feel any less \u2018Shantae.\u2019\n\nThis game also felt more fetch-quest driven than prior titles, especially when compared to the fast-moving Pirate\u2019s Curse, though most of Pirate\u2019s speed was derivative of the sword dash exploit and hover+cannon runs. Regardless, this game is slower in movement relative to Pirate\u2019s Curse, however, much faster than the first two games. This speed difference thus necessitates the constant use of transformations ie monkey, harpy, etc. A veteran would implement these in a heartbeat for speed runs and be left with the envious quandary of choosing which to use for optimization.\n\nSome screen tears were also present depending on the graphics card used, particularly Nvidia GTX 1050/1080, however, scouring the forums helped me in addressing most level 1 issues I encountered. Integrated graphics worked extremely well at 60 fps, granted needing the newer generation, higher end varieties. Vertical Synching is available and window adjustments are plentiful.\n\nI was also pleased to see fan-selected palettes and the gallery selections. Moments like those is why we back games despite not knowing what awaits us. Good, bad, sometimes trust is necessary to gain something. \n\n[b]Tunes[/b]\n\nThere was not a track I found mundane or jarring. The overall selection was more bass heavy this time around, if not more electric. Christina Vee\u2019s vocals starts the game right and the final boss\u2019 theme was comparable to Pirate\u2019s Curse true-final boss\u2019 theme. Unfortunately, I cannot state my favorites given the nature of how stages are unlocked, but trust me when I say it\u2019s upbeat fun. \n\n[b]Magical[/b]\n\nLooking back, Shantae Half-Genie Hero was as much a game about Shantae seeking answers on her own as it was WayForward discovering a new direction. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much between everything\u2014too symbolically even\u2014but I feel that there is a lesson to be had on aggregate: the Kickstarter campaign, the continued donations post-campaign via PayPal, the initial reception, to everything new about the game, along with the slew of Sequin-bound expansion packs. None of it would have been possible without effort, and adversity had served the catalyst for Shantae\u2014both in-game and the developed product, which resembles most development cycles of fan-funded titles. Needless to say, something beautiful and worthy of a genie\u2019s wish was in fact discovered when WayForward decided to take the risk in making Half-Genie Hero. \n\nThank you WayForward~", "timestamp_updated": 1506494835, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506488119, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34766082", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496087", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506034758, "steamid": "76561198087430812", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "While I really loved the visuals and I'm addicted to the soundtrack - they're awesome as it's always expected for Shantae games - and I enjoyed a few smiles with the humorous dialogue and some happy parts of the game, this one has big flaws that ruin the experience. If you played Shantae and the Pirate's Curse you'll understand what I mean in this review.\n\nMost of the game is too easy and even the tricky parts are not a problem because the game gives you too many items and purchasable upgrades to prevent damage, restore heath/magic, and even if you manage to die there are dozens of save checkpoints everywhere now (and they're annoying full screen save dialogs between areas).\n\nThe lack of an open world that forces you to revisit the levels wouldn't be a problem if some of them weren't uninspired and puzzle-free levels you just run around to collect objects while replaying them several times when you unlock a new power-up that lets you access an area you couldn't before. The fact this will give you more gems to buy the shop upgrades that make the game even easier makes matters worse and later it becomes pointless with a new travel feature.\n\nIt feels weird getting transformation dances and magic powers from chests, it kinda breaks the immersion or sense of belief and for the devs to not think about it is lazy and unexpected because in the first Shantae game a genie would appear and teach you magic stuff with some special effects as far as I can remember.\n\nThe story is an excuse to get you around collecting \"nonsensical\" items for random NPCs instead of things that have a connection of sorts with events. There's a funny item I won't spoil but that's it basically. Compare that with Pirate's Curse events where every thing you collect is related to the story and you have to think which character you need to give the item to and the obvious difference of experience shows.\n\nI was disappointed to not having seen a magic carpet race minigame or something like Run Rottytops Run from the previous game. The mouse mechanics would do a great puzzle element but there's only a simple one thorough the game. Lots of lost opportunity. :(\nI recommend the other games in the series instead.", "timestamp_updated": 1504740664, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504652657, "votes_down": 6}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 674, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 44, "total_reviews": 718}}
