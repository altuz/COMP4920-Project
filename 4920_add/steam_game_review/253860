The story is as minimalistic as it gets: two factions vying for control of a handful of territories. While the unit types are fairly varied, map and mission variety are one of the major shortfalls: the mission areas are very much the same, except for possibly some added water and a changed colour palette, while missions see you either capturing buildings, or annihilating the enemy. The other major issue is the behaviour of the AI: it can be both difficult and incredibly frustrating to break their default stance of hoarding units around their base (apparently, this is not present in the GOG version).\n\nTentatively recommended for RTS fans looking for a different experience, or those wishing to try a strategy game from a bygone era.", "timestamp_updated": 1504117447, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504117447, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33809719", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1468178741, "steamid": "76561198042135763", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Game doesnt work on anything above Windows 8.
