As said before, the plot certainly is not the game\u2019s major selling point. The bulk of the dialogue consists of your burly man-soldiers either grunting action-movie clich\u00e9s or stating the obvious, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have a soft spot for this ragged band of gun-toting alpha males by the end.\n\nGraphically, the game is a mixed bag. The 3D models and animations are a clunky collection of fist-sized pixels while the FMV sequences look like someone made a stop-motion video with LEGO puppets. I also found the monster design to be quite unimaginative; they mostly look like giant bugs with the occasional robot parts attached to them.\nHowever, the prerendered backgrounds is where the game still shines. The complete carnage of abandoned buildings, piled-up car wrecks, the subtle light effects; they all make the desolation of Gorky come alive. It really looks like something diabolical hit this town hard and now lurks in the shadows, preying on you.\n\nThe battles, as said, are rather repetitive, yet oddly fun and rewarding. It\u2019s all pretty straight forward: walk, attack, defend, heal, exploit weakness, kill stuff with fire\u2026 Every now and then there is a boss battle or an extra objective such as preventing a friendly NPC from dying. Because of rather arbitrary restrictions to the use of weapons (for example: guns can only fire in four directions, shotguns in eight) it sometimes feels as if you\u2019re playing a weaponized version of chess (i.e.: not being able to hit someone standing right freaking next to you\u2026).\n\nYour characters can level up their stats, but since there are no random encounters and you cannot sell or buy items, the appeal was lost to me. The battles you fight are often tough and resources are sparse, but many players have commented on the fact that the game is actually quite easy when you play it again.\n\nOne minor gripe that deserves mentioning: every now and then, the plot demands that one of your party members either die or run off. When this happens, they take all their inventory with them. I was rather dismayed when I saved right after a death scene, only to later discover that I also had to say goodbye to some of my best weapons and healing items.\n\nLong story short, the game has its faults and at times I found it to be too difficult, but it was great to play this old-timer.\n\n\n+ Fun gameplay\n+ Engaging\n-/+ Difficulty\n-/+ 2D graphics good, 3D graphics bad\n- Repetitive music\n- Story lacking in depth\n\nFinal verdict: [b]8/10[/b].", "timestamp_updated": 1503069183, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503068823, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34226386", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490698", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502478496, "steamid": "76561198175471086", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Would you like to hear the tragedy of Gorky-17...?", "timestamp_updated": 1502673489, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502673489, "votes_down": 10}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 127, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 41, "total_reviews": 168}}
