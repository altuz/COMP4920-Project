Well, game works fine for me ...loads fine, runs fine under WINE. i like the dynamics of the game and think the game is worth the purchase. For those not getting things running right under linux ...make sure yer openGL is working well and make sure yer video drivers are up to date , and if ye need any firmware for chipsets make sure thats working well too or ye may have video driver issues. I think a proper setup linux system supporting graphics properly will run the game fine under WINE. as for the ALT-TAB issues ....when i alt-tab out i get a little Enclave icon like i would if i was running a wine desktop but on my native desktop ....click that twice and the game full screens again. so not even an issue with alt-tab.\nGOOD JOB FOLKS , THANKS FOR A GREAT GAME !!!  :>", "timestamp_updated": 1505840228, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505840228, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 364, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 170, "total_reviews": 534}}
