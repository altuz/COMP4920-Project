Good game though campaign content is a tough shallow for my liking compared to the length of other campaigns on the previous title mentioned.\n\nGood to pick up on sale for a play through as like the Earth series it has aged quite a bit and it isnt as easy to handle as more modern games. Still good for a bit of a laugh as you try to work around the terrible pathing and your army units dire need to run face first into any enemy they get a glance at without being told to just sit there :P\n\n3 Campaigns in it, which i enjoy getting the different flavours as it were of each nation in this conflict.\n\nIf youve played earth 2150 before or dont mind spending some time doing the tutorials to learn how to work its controls and functionality then pick this one up.", "timestamp_updated": 1501535751, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501535751, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 35, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 31, "total_reviews": 66}}
