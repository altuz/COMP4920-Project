But it\u2019s not perfect, it does have some flaws, but let\u2019s get to the story.\n\nObscure 2 takes pleas two years after the first game. Kenny and his sister are at Fallcreek University. Stan is reforming his life as a Delivery Truck Driver. \n\nAnd I can\u2019t tell you what happened to Josh and Ashley you\u2019re going to have play the game yourself or look it up. But anyway at Fallcreek University a new type of strange flower is growing around Fallcreek University, a lot of the students have made it into a drug, well if you have played the first game you know where this is going.\nBut anyway now for the game itself. \n\nYou can play up to 6 people this time, and like first game each one is good at one thing, like Corey Wilde is good at climbing, Mei Wang is a hacker, Sven Hansen is strong, that sort of thing.\n\nSpoiler warning, as you go through the game these guys and girls all die but Shannon and Stan. Anyway spoiler warning over.\n\nLike in the first game you can only have two at a time, but unlike the first one, were you could use the same two characters for the whole game. In this you need to use all the characters to solve the different puzzles in the game.\n\nNow what I liked it this game.\n\nOne. I liked the story and the notes you can get. They answered some questions I had in the first game.\n\nTwo. I liked the new monsters, but I wish there were a few more.\n\nThree. Liked the atmosphere in the game.\n\nFour. Liked how they give you another way to heal.\n\nFive. I like how the AI is somewhat better than the first game.\n\nSix. Like how they fixed the camera a bit still takes some getting used too. Can be a butt some but not that bad. \n\nNow for the things I did not like.\n\nOne. The characters. This is a big thing witch all most led to a somewhat bad review, but anyway the characters in his game are ether idiots or douchebags or both. \n\nLike take Corey Wilde he and his girlfriend go to this party and outside, they see dead bodies. A smart person would call the cops or get back in the car and get help. But nope Corey with his girlfriend Mei Wang goes to check it out. It\u2019s not like they heard someone call for help or something and went to help. No he and Mei just went to check it out.\n\nThen when Corey\u2019s car gets taken he goes after it on foot. Even those Shannon said she has a car. Now I know Corey said he has his dad\u2019s shotgun in his car, which raises some questions but anyway he and Amy goes after the car thief, all the why\u2019ll Corey wines about it. When he sees his car is trashed he yells like an idiot and attracts some monsters.\n\nAnd there is this thing with Kenny but that\u2019s going into Spoiler.\n\nTwo. There was this glitch were the screen went black, I mean you can see your health bar going down but can\u2019t do anything to stop it. But that only has happened to me three or four times.\n\nThree. The save points. In the first game you picked up disks to save, you could save were ever you want as long you had a disk. But in this game you save by smelling a flower. I don\u2019t get why they changed the way you save the game disk was better.\n\nLastly number four. The game does end on a cliffhanger.\n\nBut anyway all in all this was a good sequel to a good underrated horror game it\u2019s not perfect but still again it\u2019s still good.\nWitch I hope someday a game company picks this series up and we get a third game in this series.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1504827793, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504827793, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 49, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 19, "total_reviews": 68}}
