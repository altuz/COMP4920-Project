The gameplay is so strong that the bonus Mercenaries Mode (which is nothing more than the game's core combat system) is fucking amazing.\nLarge range of weapons, and game design that gives you reason to utilise all of them.\nRidiculous, campy plot and dialogue.\n\nCons:\nThe controls can be a little unreliable at times - for example, the \"instant 180 degree turn\" sometimes doesn't register, leaving you vulnerable.\nClunky controls that might annoy some people.
