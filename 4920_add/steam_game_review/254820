It beats many of the more modern genre options in the way it implements combat and accounts for relevant combat variables such as lighting, visibility and terrain elevation. The most mind blowing for me at the time when I first played this game were the air battles - because of other RTS games I was used for the air units to remain immovable in combat, while in this game when in combat the aircraft remains in motion and fly around gloriously.

Correct, Ground Control is back you chaps and chapettes, and it works flawlessly on Windows 10 I might add. \n\nFor you fresh potential volunteer commanders for the Crayven Corporation, rest assure, you will meet battle where advanced battle tactics need to be used! You do not construct bases, but you manage Dropships in terms of what units you will use, and as you progress, the more units become available, but fact of the matter is, you choose what you want. Do you want to use Jaeger Special Forces recon troops to scout the area undetected to then sneak your artillery nearby to blow everything to kingdom come? Or do you prefer to rush into an enemy heavily defended base with scout vehicles to quickly take out the anti-air defenses, so that you can pull out in time and have your aerodynes fly into the base and bomb it all to ashes without any air defenses. Or perhaps, do you want to roll into the bases with a mix of heavy guns and marines? YOU DECIDE ! This is Gound Control !\n\nThis package contains the main campaign plus the expansion pack (known as DLC today). The main campaign takes you in command of the Crayven Corporation (Crays) and the Order of the dawn (Dawnies). Playing the game on normal difficulty will take you approx. 10 hours for the Crayven Corporation Campaign, and another 8 for the Dawnie campaign. 18-20 hours of missions !! And this without the expansion pack, because with the expansion pack, add another 15 hours, so you are looking at a solid 32-35 hours of Campaign missions on the normal difficulty setting, for this low price! And keep in mind, this is one of the most amazing RTS games ever made, and there is a Ground Control 2 as well !!! (sold separately).\nWith the Crayven campaign you mostly assume traditional missions of base destructions, but once you play for the Dawnies, expect more fast paced guerrilla warfare and hit and run tactics, because you are fighting outnumbered most of the times with inferior equipment because hey, the Crays did kick your ass just shortly before so don't expect it to be easy! \n\nDespite the somewhat outdated graphics the explosions and gun fire etc effects as still beautiful. There are some guys that still play multiplayer, but google it as you will find all the info there (some dedicated servers are still up with plenty of players). \n\nPros:\n\n- Fun and amazing missions!\n- Great visuals despite aged graphics\n- Great sound and amazing battle soundtracks\n- Awesome Units with micromanaging secondary and tertiary abilities during combat\n- Dropship unit loadout customization\n- Plenty of hours of gameplay\n- Low price\n- Classic RTS game (top 5 next to Old westwood studios C&C games, Homeworld, etc), a must have!\n- Entertaining briefing/debriefing and lore (story)\n- 40+ missions!!!\n- Works flawlessly on Windows 10\n- Units have weakspots (rear takes more damage on tanks, etc).\n- Many fun units to choose from and play\n- Battle formations to choose from\n- Can use terrain and shadows etc as a tactical advantage!!!\n- Great tutorial\n\nCons:\n\n- Cannot save during game. Play it on LIGHT or EASY for the first time since normal is like a game on Hard today.\n- No skirmish mode (Single player campaign only and for Multiplayer, find info out of game first how to join!)\n- Micromanaging units during intense combat can be frustrating at times due to game mechanics. Units need a lot of room to pass each other, they easily get stuck with each other showing their rear to the enemy and taking much more damage. Big chance to lose your command APC that way =Mission failure.\n- Constant friendly fire messages \"Squad 1 taking friendly fire\" etc, etc, however, friendly fire is mitigated significantly, you only take tiny damage but still very annoying to hear those messages all the time. Terrain often does not give enough room to prevent friendly fire, thus those warnings and friendly fire cannot be avoided.\n\nIf you are an old school or newbro RTS fan, you MUST get this game at all costs, and after you beat this game and its Dark Conspiracy expansion pack (included in bundle), you must play Ground Control 2.\n\nDISMISSED !", "timestamp_updated": 1486809431, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486371379, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "19212559", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511902", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1448194420, "steamid": "76561198022676025", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Ou yeah, glad to pay 5 eur for this amazing game.

An RTS classic. Ground Control does not feature any base building.\n\nPros: \n- Interesting gameplay (at the time)\n- Friendly Fire system\n- Several difficulty levels\n- Long, narrated story (45 missions in total)\n- Plethora of units\n- 2/3 factions\n\nCons:\n- As I said the gameplay is no longer up to snuff.\n- Atrocious path finding. Units will get stuck frequently or get \"lost\".\n- Very slow moving units.\n- Story gets bland with the introduction of the addon.\n- Factions aren't unique enough. Basically they all got the same units, minus some special skills, stats and a few unique units.\n- Obviously very dated graphics.\n- No save system, no check points...\n\nSummary:\nGC and its addon are definitely not geared towards the casual player. You basically get a handful of units for every mission, which are not replenishable, meaning, when a squad gets completely wiped out it's gone for good, which does not only suck for the mission, but for the overall campaign, since your units \"supposedly\" level up (never really noticed that, but apparently they get more accurate, more durable, etc.). The good thing is that you can restart a mission at any point and get your units back, the bad part is, there is NO save system whatsoever. That 90 minute mission you just failed at the last instance? Yea, you gotta repeat it ALL again. The addon also introduces some fairly asshole insta fail missions called \"infiltrations\". In these you have to find your way through the map with only 1 or 2 sniper squads...preferably unseen. If you get spotted the mission is not failed, but the enemy WILL kill your units pretty quickly. Also, fucking snipers don't deserve the name. While they kill many units in 1 hit, they aren't all that accurate. I've once spent 5 minuts trying to hit 1 infantry guy...\n\nThe game also moves at a glacial pace. You might be looking at your units crossing a desert for several minutes until they arrive at the next nav point. Even worse is that you can't just order them there, because the path finding will fuck it up, so you basically creep forward inch by inch...and wait for your slowest units to still catch up...only to have them encounter an ambush, a mine field or spawned event enemies, which you are unprepared for against. Guess what, you might just have to repeat it all over again. The addon introduces some \"interesting\" mission concepts. However, they don't really work that well with the responsiveness of the game. While your units move fairly slowly (at least the more powerful ones), they can die pretty quickly in combat, especially if they are shooting each other.\n\nSay hello to the friendly fire system...just don't. Theoretically you should be able to arrange your units to not suffer friendly fire. Practically I found that to be an insane amount of micro management and frustration, changing formations, ordering troops out of the way...having them walk around confused in circles thanks to the path finding...and have fun ordering a heavy tank into another position.\n\nThis is a game for die hard fans of squad based RTS games...not sure it's for anyone else. At the end I chose to cheat my way through it, because the glacial pace of the gameplay coupled with the lack of a save feature was just too much to handle for me. I just wanted it to be over. Got through the Crayven campaign without cheating at least.\n\nStill a good game for its age...if you're looking for this kind of gameplay.", "timestamp_updated": 1466460609, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466460601, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "16970858", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503830", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1471308345, "steamid": "76561197979466433", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I will put my nostalgia aside and say after so many years this game holds up. 2 Long and engaging campaigns, awesome gameplay, kick ass music, and an all out fun experience.

A visible field of view or obscuring fog of war would have done wonders).\n\nThe writing's decent, though for some reason it feels like they switched VA's for established characters between GC1 and Dark Conspiracy. But ultimately the game is 95% gameplay, and 5% story, so even good writing can't really bouy poor gameplay.\n\nAlso kinda buggy, with missions that sometimes arbitrarily seeming not to finish/progress, forcing you to replay them, and with Dark Conspiracy forgetting my campaign progress when I exit. Not too great.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent, though.
