The gameplay is both incredibly simplistic (fielding is all automatic and bowling is very toned-down) and needlessly complex (many, many ways to swing, each with their own button combination.)  There's not a whole lot to do but just play games with the teams they provide you (no customization or anything like that) so even if you can get past the controls, there's not much to do.  Worst yet, the game isn't supported anymore and you can't create accounts for it, so setting up multiplayer requires using external programs like Hamachi.\n\nA bunch of my friends bought the game for each other as gag gifts, and even the people who liked cricket couldn't find much to enjoy.

The problem with this is it is almost impossible to know when the game starts timing you as to when you should press your shot selection! Press too early and it does not register as the bowler is still classed as running up, or press too late when the ball is in flight and about 1/3 of the way down the pitch (i.e. when you would actually start making your shot in real life) and the batter misses and gets out. \nNo where is there a timing gauge (like the EA cricket games have) which would let you get a sense of when to time the ball. In the practice nets there are criptic written proms which say 'too late' or 'too early', but This does not help as the speed of bowling naturally varies from ball to ball so it does not let you get an idea of when you should have pressed the buttons. There is no system to tell you how well you timed something in the matches at all, and as the ball often appears to sail through the bat without making contact it is impossible to know what you did wrong!\nAt least once I have been out LBW when the ball did appear not hit the batter but all the fielders appeal as if it did, and obviously the umpire just triggers you. I can only assume the reason there is no 'action replays' in this game is because this would highlight these frustrating incidents. \n\nLike most games of this type, the bowling is dull and the AI batters can play insane physics defying shots which defeat the point of setting fielders.  \n\nAvoid this game.  \n"}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1414196889, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501376", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 6, "recommendationid": "12617746", "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054501126", "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1472987776, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 46}, "timestamp_updated": 1414196889, "received_for_free": false, "review": "fuck you"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1389832877, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503174", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "8722859", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198119226065", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1488772281, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2002}, "timestamp_updated": 1389832877, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great Game, Just wish it could be updated.
