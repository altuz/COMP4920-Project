If you like their take on the genre you will probably like this one. A lot of collecting items and using them in the right spots. A lot of strange characters some which work and some which don't. A functional story that never quite goes deep enough to satisfy. I do appreciate their attempt at a more real world setting, and alcatraz + the 50s is a cool one. While it's been done before, going back and forth between the two protagonists works pretty well, and each section of the game has a slightly different feel. \n\n+ protagonists reasonably well drawn\n+ puzzles are standard fare, nothing too challenging or too basic\n+ two simultaneous storylines keep you interested\n\n- you come away feeling like you have read the outline of a story\n- gameplay/puzzles very by the numbers", "timestamp_updated": 1501578978, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501578978, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33392506", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503075", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499719809, "steamid": "76561198063082850", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Achievements have not worked for me yet and that is a disapointment, other than that I enjoyed the game.", "timestamp_updated": 1499569749, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499569749, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33915440", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500060430, "steamid": "76561198158901185", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Ok so I absoultly loved this story. I got the game in a bundle and didnt think i would ever play it, but i made my mission this summer to play all my games and this one was one of my favories.
