I'm sure the developers would have liked to add advanced track editing, more songs, more characters, more anything, really. It's a game that aspired to be the best, and while it's good, it fell short of staying in the spotlight due to the aforementioned issues.\n\nThe good:\n\nKickbeat features something that most rhythm games don't have, especially among those that try to bend genres to include a wider audience (I'm looking at you, Audiosurf). At its heart, it's a competitive game. It's a hard game. It's one of the few rhythm games out there that has a scoring system which means something. If you can six-star a song on master, you can post a video on Youtube, and and proceed to feel good about it. This isn't a game that you zone out and play. At least not if you want to do well. At the same time, the game's not impossible, nor is it inaccessible. It incorporates a few ideas, but it doesn't make the gameplay awkward. It's simple, but different, and in this case, it works. The developers made sure that this game ran well, and of course felt good to play. What it skimmed on with features, it more than made up for with a good core.\n\nGetting good at the game is hard, and for some people, just being able to play it is hard. Kickbeat's story mode does a great job of at least making you able to. It's cute. It's funny. It'll make you stop and ask yourself why most games try so hard with their stories. \n\nRating the value of a competitive rhythm game is hard, especially one that's well aged. I won't. If you play Kickbeat, from start to finish, you'll at least get 10 hours out of it, which isn't bad for the price. If you put it down because it's too hard after two, I guess I failed to warn you enough. The music selection is also one of the best I've heard in any rhythm game out there. They used good artists, and the tracks fit the gameplay well. \n\nLastly, I feel like I should touch on this, as it's the most important point of all. Do you like the concept of rhythm games, but feel like they're too pointless, are just for wankery, and also like watching martial arts combat too intense for modern kung-fu movies?

It would seem that the ability to play your own music is a great asset of this game however this particular feature falls very short. This is due to the fact that when selecting a song to add to the game you have to go through a beat calulator process by which you manually tap spacebar to the rhythm of 3 different sections of the song. The beats per minute are capped at a certain level so you can't just go crazy with the system. Equally probably the most annoying thing is that you can add any track you like however if the track is longer than 6 minutes anything past the 6 minute mark will be cut off entirely.

WARNING: GAME TAKES A WHILE TO GET USED TO! It doesn't act like a music simulator or guitar hero, its a fighting game set to music and the timings are unique to this game. Don't get easily frutrated! Keep practicing! \n\nI would say it is definitely difficult, play on normal, get used to it, amp it up along the way.\n\nKind of seems like a game that should have been released 8 years ago with the rest of the music game craze... Glad it is finally here :) This was the only music game I am actually good at.", "timestamp_updated": 1390319754, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1390319468, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "8793127", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500275", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1390621026, "steamid": "76561198035786120", "num_games_owned": 461, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Hahah this game is hard as hell and i love it the rythem the music the fighting A++ i love this game", "timestamp_updated": 1390284365, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1390284365, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "10499722", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497572", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1410567251, "steamid": "76561198101405935", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "3 hours later. . . \n\nBeat the game. and wishing there was more...\nOH WAIT THERE IS!!!!\n\nbesides having an orginal storyline thats about 3 hours long...  you can add your own music and have continious fun XD I DIG IT. screw guitar hero XD \n\nAND THIS GAME IS NOT EASY.. lol which also makes it funnnn :D", "timestamp_updated": 1402974928, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1402974928, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "10435252", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501638", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494548191, "steamid": "76561198051317669", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a good addition to the genre of good music driven video games such as Audiosurf 2, Audiosurf 1, and Beat Hazard. It is also quite similar to another great game called One Finger Death Punch. KickBeat combines martial arts fighting and music to create a solid game. The game has a single player campaign Story Mode where you play through all of the songs that come with the game. First as a male character. And then as a female character. As you keep playing and get better scores on the songs that come with the game, you unlock more characters that you can play as. And you also unlock more outfits for the existing characters. You can of course also play this game with your own music files as well. Although in this game, you need to manually set the beats per minute for each custom song that you want to use. Although the game makes it fairly easy for you to do that. The game plays a 15 second section from the start, middle, and end of the song. And all you have to do is just tap the Space bar to the beat of the song. Then you can listen to the final result to make sure that the beats are set properly with the song. Then the song is ready to be played in the game. The game has selectable difficulty levels so you can choose how difficult you want any song to be. It may take some time to get used to playing KickBeat at first because the in game tutorial doesn't really prepare you very well. But keep practicing and you'll learn how to play the game. If you like music driven games like Audiosurf 2, Audiosurf 1, and Beat Hazard, then I recommend KickBeat", "timestamp_updated": 1402549196, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1402549196, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 146, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 62, "total_reviews": 208}}
