A place ruled by the fearsome Lord Mustacho; an old, bitter man who wishes to revitalise himself with a young spirit. Armed with a (magical) marker only, the grand adventure to save Felix from Mustacho begins!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1099528235\n[h1]\u00b0 Forget about guns and swords, a magic marker it is[/h1]\n\nUpon arriving the magical lands that we sent our brother to, we receive strange powers for our - at first - seemingly useless marker. Those powers are granted by the wise old lady, who is portrayed as Mustacho's opponent. This new improved marker allows for the creation and destruction of various objects, such as dirt pillars, branches, vines ... which play an essential role in the game's puzzle-platforming sequences. Want to reach the top of a hill? How about you draw a dirt pillar to raise yourself all the way up. How to reach the other side of the tree? Why, just draw yourself a vine and swing across! \n\n[i]Max[/i] stays relatively fresh throughout as new mechanics are regularly introduced and each new chapter grants your marker with new powers, depending on the environment you find yourself in - or so it seemed. It must not have been a coincidence that within the forest, I reveived the power to draw branches and vines, whereas in the wetlands, I was able to create water streams to help me navigate through the levels.\n\n[h1]\u00b0 An engaging adventure[/h1]\n\nI found the gameplay to be overall fun and exciting. It starts out pretty simple and basic, but in the later chapters you'll have to actively combine certain objects to complete the various puzzles that the game has in store. There are also certain 'escape' scenes to deal with, as in: run away from different threats against time. Most of the puzzles never get really challenging, but that didn't seem to bother me as they were always fun to do and solve. Some of them are quite creative too, which made for an enjoyable experience. Who says games need to be difficult in order to be fun? \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1101412967\nThe real 'difficulty' comes in another form than puzzle solving, and that is dealing with the somewhat ... clunky controls. More often than not - when I entered a new level -, I could figure out what to do pretty quickly. When I actually wanted to execute my solution, I would regularly fail because of how weird the controls can be from time to time. Jumping/climbing is not always as accurate, and let's not even talk about the amount of times I fell to my death whilst swinging on vines - missing my destination by mere millimeters. \n\nOnto the game's length and replay ability: The game consists of 7 chapters in total and lasts for about 6 to 7 hours, which I found to be just about right. Some additional hours could be acquired by hunting down all of the game's collectibles, which consist of destroying evil eyes and collecting secrets. The great thing is that you don't have to replay the whole game while looking for all achievements, as seperate chapters can easily be accessed in the main menu. Sadly, collecting all eyes & secrets doesn't really hold any significance within the story - it is merely a reason to catch 'em all. However, what good is a platformer without any sort of secrets to track down, right?\n\n[h1]\u00b0 A family friendly experience[/h1]\n\nIf one thing became clear whilst playing [i]Max,[/i] it is how child friendly this game truly is. From the story to the gameplay to the cutscenes, this game strikes me as something that could easily be enjoyed by the whole family. Right from the start - when I loaded up the game for the first time - until the end, I was filled with a somewhat nostalgic feeling, probably because of the charming music, the entertaining cinematics and the loveable cartoony look of the game. In a certain way, it kind of resembles games and cartoons I used to play/watch as a kid. If you're still not convinced, well, the game's antagonist is called Lord Mustacho ... LORD MUSTACHO!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1099527974\nI do recommend this game, but please keep in mind that it is not a perfect game by any means. While the music is very charming and cute, it is rather simplistic and not all that memorable. Secondly, the game's got a sweet look, but don't expect AAA visuals. And lastly (and I mentioned this in the section above), the controls can be a bit odd/stubborn sometimes and can therefore make the game a little bit tedious/irritating at times. In the end, the game feels like an avarage title. Not amazingly good, but not bad either. Just good, but still definitely worth playing in my book.\n\n[h1]|| Game overview ||[/h1]\n\n[b]Verdict: - yes, if: you can look past its flaws | Definitely recommended on sale (=$2.50)[/b]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Pros[/th]\n        [th]Cons[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Family friendly[/td]\n        [td]Clunky controls[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]exciting & engaging adventure[/td]\n        [td]Sometimes tedious/irritating[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Creative and fun puzzles[/td]\n        [td][/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Charming tunes & cartoony looks[/td]\n        [td][/td]\n   [/tr]\n[/table]\n[list]\n    [*]Genre (tags): 2d puzzle-platformer\n    [*]Average length: 6 hrs\n    [*]Developer: Press Play\n    [*]Publisher: Microsoft Game Studios\n    [*]Release date: 21st May 2014\n    [*]Platform: pc, Xbox 360, Xbox One\n[/list]", "timestamp_updated": 1502457368, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502377489, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33570116", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507796", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500154937, "steamid": "76561198027651351", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Loved it!
