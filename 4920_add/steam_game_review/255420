If you're bored of 2014, and want to try playing with new cards.\n-> In that case may I recommend 2012/13 instead?\n\n2. If you want to have more flexibility with customizing decks than you could in previous versions. \n-> Yes, that's true, but it's not a quick process. You start with one deck, and unlock a booster pack each time you beat a deck in the story campaign. It's going to take a while before you start getting card combinations that work. \n\nIn my opinion there is nothing about 2015 that is especially good. \n->The campaign is redumentary, and short. \n->The story is meh. \n->The music and sound effects are hit and miss, some are okay, some are annoying. \n->Everything in game feels slow and dragged out.  \n->The menus are a bugger to navigate. \n->There are no game modes like Two-Headed Giant, Planeschase or Archenemy. \n->Graphically, it doesn't look any better than previous versions.\n\nSo, yes, I will probably play it a little more now that I've paid for it and am stuck with it, but do I recommend it?", "timestamp_updated": 1501737406, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501662529, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33605482", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510791", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1406482124, "steamid": "76561198055630726", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "My least favorite of the Duels of the Planeswalkers series, but still a solid game. The change from pre built decks to collection through random boosters made the game slower and less enjoyable at the beginning but gives options once you've beaten it. While the previous iterations served as standalone board games, this requires you to be a fan of deck building to get the full enjoyment. If you'd rather have something you can just pick up and play, grab 2013 or 2014.
