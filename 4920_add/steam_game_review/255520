You will walk around in the palace and clean up all the blood and body parts. After some time your mop will be covered in blood and you will need to wash it off by going to a water source. Body parts can leave new blood marks which you will need to clean up again. Putting a body part into a bucket of water will turn the water into blood and can no longer be used to clean up your equipment.\n\nMeh gameplay.\nLow replayability.\nNot recommended to play.\nOkay controls.\nMultiplayer servers are dead and playing the game alone is boring.\nIs too overpriced if you are not a shadow warrior fan.\n\n[h1]Other things.[/h1]\n\nNone.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 3/10", "timestamp_updated": 1503665874, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502932354, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33513515", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498460", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499944198, "steamid": "76561198190367247", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is awesome!", "timestamp_updated": 1499985403, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1499985403, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "33544350", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.390914", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500061675, "steamid": "76561198046879847", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "Autism -1/10", "timestamp_updated": 1500064819, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1500064819, "votes_down": 59}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 561, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 6, "total_negative": 144, "total_reviews": 705}}
