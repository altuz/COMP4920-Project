I love this game; it\u2019s a little bit more flexible than most city builders out there. But, Its dumb how overpriced the DLC content is and how little it brings to the game. From the release of this game I\u2019ve seen constant praise for (not really so much the game) the developer of Cities Skyline, I have to wonder what's going on? If a company like EA did something like this to their game (which they have) people would be screaming bloody murder.\n\nTo be honest I kinda get it, good developers are hard to come by. But a company that gives you one new building for $15 is not a good company. That\u2019s a company that is trying to imitate the most hated company in America, EA. \n\nNow don't get me wrong, the game is incredibly fun, but with all the overpriced DLC the game has out right now if you refuse to buy any of it like me, you will end up missing out on a lot of important game changing features. They need to combine all the DLC they have, and release it with a 10-15 dollar price tag. The game is not worth all the money you need to put into it for so little content. That's why I can't recommend it right now.\n\nIt's funny to me how the new Sim City did this and died a horrible death. But only recently have people started to catch on to this developer and see just how much they are milking their EXTREMELY loyal fan base. I hate to see it.
