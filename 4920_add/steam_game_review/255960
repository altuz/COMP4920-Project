Worth a watchthrough for the over the top fmv sequences and the kafkaesque tale of a insect trying to get back to primary primate status once more.\n\nYeah just check out a playthrough on youtube. It's more fun than actually trying to play the game and looks better encoded to video as well.", "timestamp_updated": 1499497157, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499496721, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 22, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 25}}
