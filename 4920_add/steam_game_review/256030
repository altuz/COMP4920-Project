When the game first came out it pretty much dumped a load on early access gamers.  So unsurprisingly its ratings went to hell.  It has fixed this, mainly by seperating with the company that was controling its purse strings so to speak.  And then treating early access gamers better, but to be fair if you've moved on your not likely to take the time and now give the game a good rating.\nThat said though, i am not claming this is perfect.  It suffers from rough edges i'd say.  It can't seem to figure if it wants enemies to respawn.  Loot drops can be pretty bad, which wouldn't be too bad but their is no late game town.  They added a merchant which helps but it really isn't the same.  Their are of course bugs, but nothing game breaking anymore.  The game overall just seems to lack good planning later on, the final boss is fun but before that it feels amatuerish in design.\nRegardless of that, the game is very unique in that you basically can shape shift and also move between two slightly different maps.  Plus its a solid hack and slash game.  \nMy only real grip with this game is it ends on a cliff hanger and their is no sequel in sight yet.", "timestamp_updated": 1505565986, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505565986, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 74, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 51, "total_reviews": 125}}
