Going in with the worst of expectations, I have to admit Truck Racer is actually kinda fun. Take formula truck style racing and give the trucks the ability to drift almost perfectly around every corner, and give them nitrous too because why not? It's hardly realistic, sure, but every racing game doesn't have to be a realistic simulation for me to have fun with it.\n\nBasically, that's what this game is, no absurd switching mid-race mechanic to be seen, like in Motorcycle Club. Speaking of Motorcycle Club, here's a comparison between the two games just to show how much better Truck Racer is, based off the list I came up with for my Motorcycle Club review. [i]In italics are quotes from my Motorcycle Club review,[/i] and after that in plain text, if that applies to Truck Racer as well:\n[list]\n    [*][i]The constant screen tearing that requires manually enabling Vsync in the graphics driver settings to fix, because the game doesn't have a Vsync option.[/i] Yeah, that's still a problem here sadly. Also, a game from 2013 that has some pretty noticeable framerate issues on high-end computers in 2017? That's odd to say the least. I suspect a console port.\n    [*][i]The crashes, oh dear the crashes.[/i] During my time with Truck Racer, I alt-tabbed the game multiple times and pulled up the Steam Overlay as well. Both games have an odd sound bug when alt-tabbing back, but crashes here? Nope.\n    [*][i]The music.[/i] There's only one song in this game, the one in the menus, which is actually pretty catchy as far as these kinds of games go. No racing music to speak of, which considering what happened with Motorcycle Club, is an improvement in my opinion.\n    [*][i]The engine sounds.[/i] MUCH better here, the trucks actually sound like big racing trucks. They could sound meatier, but at least the volumes are fair and not ear-screechingly bad.\n    [*][i]The dreadful handling.[/i] Later in the game, boosting can cause you to bounce off walls a little bit, but it's nowhere near as much of a problem here, probably thanks to the reduced screen shaking.\n    [*][i]The fact that sometimes the brakes don't work.[/i] The brakes work just fine here. Huh, strange.\n    [*][i]The jarring redout effect if you hit the wall too hard and have an accident.[/i] This still happens here, but it's not blinding and also is nowhere near as frequent, only happening if you go backwards for too long or somehow flip your truck over.\n    [*][i]The violent retina-bleeding screen shake whenever you gently hit a wall or land a jump.[/i] There's still some screen shaking, but again, it's less severe here and far more tolerable as a result.\n    [*][i]The one time I glitched out of the map.[/i] In comparison to Motorcycle Club, Truck Racer also feels more polished and doesn't really have any major glitches in the time I spent with it.\n    [*][i]The whole mechanic of switching bikes in real-time midrace to deal with cracked roads and tight corners.[/i] Nope, not here. This game's only remotely different mechanic is the ability to regain boost by drifting and colliding with other trucks. Otherwise, it's just traditional arcade racing here.\n    [*][i]The fact that 10 bland race tracks (and their reverse variants) get stretched across a 119 race career mode with absolutely no race variety.[/i] Not only does Truck Racer's 10 locations have multiple track layouts, there are also different game modes that frequently show up. Sprint races (more laps but shorter tracks), time attacks, and knockout races give the campaign some variety alongside the fact that new track layouts show up until the very end of the campaign.\n    [*][i]The AI.[/i] Real talk: [b]Why is the AI in both this and Motorcycle Club so slow?[/b] In that game, it was because of the gimmick that the AI never was programmed to use; here it's because they can't corner without bouncing off walls, losing all of their speed, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=876363944]and in some cases they take themselves out completely instead.[/url] This makes knockout races drag on because you'll be lapping everybody else even with a stock truck. These kinds of games need difficulty options to help with this.\n    [*][i]THE FACT THAT I ACTUALLY PLAYED THIS FOR 15 HOURS.[/i] Fortunately, Truck Racer can be completed 100% in under 8 hours compared to Motorcycle Club's 15 hours of disaster.\n[/list]\n\nTruck Racer has some other things that Motorcycle Club just plain doesn't include at all: Performance & cosmetic upgrades (which probably don't help with the whole AI being slow problem, but ah well, they tried) and local multiplayer. It's limited to 2 players, but how many racing games on PC have split-screen these days?\n\n[b]Recommendation:[/b] Considering this goes for $9.99 these days and I got it for about 4 bucks, I'd say it's worth it at its current price, yep. It's not amazing and it's way too easy, but Truck Racer feels that much more focused than Motorcycle Club that I can recommend it, especially if you don't mind playing a lower budget arcade racer. That being said, if you're looking for a more realistic racing game with some big trucks, either buy [i]Automobilista[/i] with the Formula Truck DLC, or just buy [i]Formula Truck 2013[/i], depending on if the other racing disciplines interest you or not.", "timestamp_updated": 1494897496, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488667217, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 18, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 18}}
