This game hones the previous game's system and adds a lot of new features and additional difficulty options that allows you to customize your game experience a little. The addition of challenges give some replayability to the game. While this entry in the series can be 'gamed' or 'metagamed' it's still a very interesting entry in the series and defintiely provides value to the player."}]}
