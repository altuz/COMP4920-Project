It's workmanlike in that it moves you along, but doesn't get you invested.  \n- Endgame - With such an interesting setting and characters, this game screams for more opportunities for end-game exploration/backtracking or a new game+.\n\nI can't add much more than other reviews have described, but I definitely wanted to give a recommendation in support of the amazing effort put together by a small dev team!  I'm looking forward to their future endeavours!", "timestamp_updated": 1506128898, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506128854, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35353273", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506823011, "steamid": "76561198003920161", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 313}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Now don't get me wrong, I love both Final Fantasy games and Phantasy Star games. But I grew up in the Nintendo vs Sega era. The one RPG that really grew on me was Phantasy Star 4, but no-one ever knew what I was talking about because they were playing Final Fantasy games (which I don't blame them, those games are awesome too). But I saw Phantasy Star 4 with a bit of Bionic Commando and a battle system sort of like Radiant Historia? All a good combination. I am very pleased with everything about the game! Also the soundtrack is beautiful. I still see Alys from Phantasy Star 4 in Alyssa haha, microexpressions and all. <3", "timestamp_updated": 1506803461, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506803461, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 112, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 12, "total_reviews": 124}}
