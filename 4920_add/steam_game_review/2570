There wasnt a whole ton to do either, mostly click on hotspots, I vaguely remember a rather mindless puzzle about having to click on braziers to light them on fire to open a door? Seriously, if dev wants to keep his bad game to himself and no longer share it with his customers then we are no worse off"}]}
