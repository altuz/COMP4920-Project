It looks like you can choose what level to play at any time, so you can go back and switch the difficulty if you need to. The normal difficulty is actually pretty easy, so I would recommend putting it on Die mode (except for the escort missions - screw those, your friendly NPCs will always be slaughtered too fast).\n\nGraphic options are nonexistent - it just says \"low - medium - high - very high - GPU melt\", with no indication of what changes. Even with GPU Melt turned on, it seems like the game doesn't have V-Sync. So, you might have to force VSync in your GPU panel. Also the game can lag like crazy during bossfights, even on the minimum settings with a good rig. The boss fights can be a pain in the ass because of how fast they are.\n\nMultiple-perspective storyline. There are audio tapes between missions that give a bit of backstory. I can't tell if there are story consequences yet if you're too slow to blow something up or protect something, but I don't want to spoil anything. Maybe I should go back and try certain missions again to see. Game is fast and fairly fun with you spamming missiles, dodging missiles, and strafing enemies, though flying in the Jet mode is a bit awkward. Overall a decent way to spend $11-$15 for a few hours.\n\nIf you're an Armored Core fan and you're wondering about customization -- there is none.

I thought my NV-GT540M could handle it smoothly, but it was running in 10-20 FPS all of the time(drops to 1-5 during a lot of entities being rendered in the screen). *This was expected though*\n\nThe cursor in the main menu is nice, but... it lags whenever you lag in FPS. This also goes during in-game.\n\nThe missions should be progressive, dont let the players play on missions or even let them see those missions that are not connected yet to the last mission they finished, lock the other missions and let the players play it out from Act 1 to the final mission.\n\nThe main menu also needs a bit of polishing, its very \"basic\" to look at, and the title of the game is nowhere to be found(even the title bar on the window says \"Unreal Development Kit\"...), maybe make it so that the game has its own window, its own logo and probably a better main menu/missions menu.\n\nThere's no collision damage. Well, its not really a problem, but it adds realism to mech combats. Maybe add damage whenever the player hits an object and takes into account the velocity of the player before it hits the object.\n\n\nOverall 7.3/10. This game is worth the try for my weak PC.
