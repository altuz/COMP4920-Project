Unfortunately, \"Not The Robots\" belongs to the latter type, and it's tragic because I believe this could have been a superb game if only the developers had taken care of the details and weaknesses, of which there are so many that this turned out to be a very long review.\n[list]\n[*] The sentries (armed moving robots) have infinite detection range, fully-random movement, but you cannot even overlook the whole map at once. In combination, this kills the stealth element and means you cannot plan ahead your moves. If there are more than three sentries, it becomes next to impossible to control the situation and the level will more than likely turn into a silly run-and-gun rally (they gun, you run...) through a near empty room (since you have to \"eat\" your cover). Sure, this is \"difficult\" in its own right, but it's also the opposite of great gameplay. What I mean is:\n\n[h1]If you start out strategically removing furniture, meticulously setting and removing wall pieces, altering the floor plan to outsmart your enemies, but in the end you have to strap on your stupid armor and run for the exit under heavy fire anyway, then what's the point??? Every level becomes a total farce and caricature of itself.[/h1]\n\nAs the game \"progresses\" (see below for the weird way this works), it introduces fast moving \"whirlwind\" enemies that freely float across the map, ignoring all walls and obstacles (similar to spotlights in real stealth games, only the latter are slow, cannot penetrate walls and usually move in patterns); from then on, the whole thing loses any semblance of a functional stealth game whatsoever.\n\n[*]  Overall, there is little strategy involved in this game, which I found very disappointing. You mostly drive around, scoop up the \"food\" and hope for the best. The idea to remove the player's cover to forward the game may be novel, but it is ultimately self-defeating because the more is removed, the less options/strategy/stealth for the player to solve the level remain.\n\n[*]  There is too much left to random, not only the gadgets, but even the number of gadget SLOTS. This means if you get to the higher levels and are still stuck with only one slot due to bad luck with the random pickups, you are essentially doomed to fail by a random number generator.\n\nWhat's worse, you have limited slots and never know what you'll get from the pickup boxes (random). This is another example how the game deprives itself of a great opportunity to allow the player to develop a strategy or prepare for the next tower. (Certain towers have certain features, so you just about know what's coming, despite the randomness.)\n\n[*]  This is aggravated by the poor choice of gadgets put in the game, such as \"armor\" or \"speed boosts\". These things have no tactical value for the gameplay whatsoever, they don't give you choices or make the game interesting. There is one good pair of gadgets, namely the wall remover/adder. This DOES give you options, and it is often essential for beating a level. But then why put a teleport gadget in the game which is almost the same as the wall remover? And what's the point of invisible+ when there is teleport+? Stupid design decisions.\n\n[*]  Another flaw I noticed was the lack of precise movement caused by your character being designed as a \"one-wheeler\" which always makes little rotation and jittering movements to balance itself; why, oh why do they shoot themselves in the foot with these stupid ideas? This jittering thing totally frustrates your attempts to precisely come to a halt at positions, move in 90 degree angles, steer into narrow passages, avoid floor traps, or select the furniture to remove (which depends on position). As if the game wasn't frustrating enough, you cannot even steer this thing right![/list]\n\nAll things considered, this is a flawed game marred by many little design weaknesses and a core concept  that seems cool on the surface, but quickly turns out to be a flop. Don't be fooled, the game looks great when you see it, but play it for a while and you'll know exactly what I mean.\n\nBack to the drawing board, \"2DArray\"! You never really thought this through, shame on you!\n\n\n\nP.S.: I corrected some inexact descriptions and also want to add two things I forgot to mention:\n\n1) The game has a very weird (anti-)progression system (allegedly \"rogue-like\") which I found counter-productive and demotivating: If you die, you always have to restart at Tower 1, but the game will still give you (and your enemies!) upgrades for your progress (at failing, LOL). In other words, the game somehow progresses with new opponents, new traps and new gadgets while you restart from the beginning over and over again (the towers are random-generated, but still have fixed rules like Tower 1 is always super-easy, Towers 3 and 5 never have sentries, Towers 5+ may have a tagging extra game, and so forth).\n\nI noticed that you can exploit the procedural generation for your own advantage: Just survey the next level (from the CCTV camera) without entering yet. If you find it too hard or to your disliking, use the CTRL function (save game) to leave, then re-enter. Since the map's random seed is not saved, you will get a completely different map each time you enter. This can make a tremendous difference because some maps are 10 times easier than others despite being the same level nominally. For example, it's entirely possible to get a map where four out of five sentries are stuck in one room because furniture blocks the exit(s). But then again, you may get a map where you cannot even enter safely because enemies block your path and have their paths blocked as well.\n\n2) The game also has a \"story\", told through voice actors, perhaps in a hopeless attempt to make it more interesting/endearing, but that failed as well; I quickly muted the voice acting because it's nerdy, out of place, distracting, annoying, and I didn't give a fuck anyway. I mean, this is a super-abstract game about a robot eating furniture - END OF STORY!\n\nEssentially, the base game was not thought through, tested and fine-tuned enough and all the ideas added to make it stand out from the crowd flopped - and tragically sank it below crowd level in the process.", "timestamp_updated": 1504739606, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504234474, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 183, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 38, "total_reviews": 221}}
