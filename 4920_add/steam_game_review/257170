For example, your units don't have move points\u2014at all. You can at any moment move them to any available location, which definitely makes the game more dynamic and fun.\n\nHowever, most 4X games share a bunch of downsides, like boring late-game and plentiful micromanagement... and oh boy, does Rebuild 3 show its browser/mobile roots by embracing those. It has no general notification system, so you can easily miss that one of your survivors is idle. It also has no sense of late-game, no new challenges to add, and to destroy a faction, you need to grab each piece of their land, so you end up having to click them to death long after they have become helpless. Land-locking your opponents becomes trivial from City 2, since the only thing you need for them not to be annoyed is a lvl 8 Leader, who makes the whole mechanic pointless.\n\nThe visual clutter doesn't help: for example, it's hard to tell at a glance how many livable buildings you have. The character variety is also annoyingly low\u2014which is a functional downside, since faces are generally how you distinguish people on the map.\n\nStill, there definitely is charm to the game. It's mechanically robust, but still simple compared to other 4Xs; it also plays relatively fast. A bunch of its quirks are very cool (for example, you can take care of a child/teenager, who is an 'item' giving negative modifiers, but after a while, when they grow up, you get a citizen for free). And, seeing how you can transfer your top three units from city to city, you do kind of get attached to them.\n\nAll in all, while I think [i]Rebuild 3[/i] is far from perfect, I would cautiously recommend it to fellow lovers of management sims, strategies, and 4Xs.
