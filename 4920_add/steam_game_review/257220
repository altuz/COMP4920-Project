Get it cheap and don\u2019t expect too much and you\u2019ll have a decent time with it.\n\nLong story: Sam Peters was one of the side-characters in Secret Files 2. Here she is again in her own little adventure, starting from where we left her in the previous game. In Secret Files 2 I found her much nicer than the main characters; though mainly because her voice-actress was not completely incompetent. So, is she an interesting enough character to fill out an adventure on her own? Not really. She\u2019s an excellent example of a writer trying to create a \u201cstrong female character\u201d without having any clue how. As a result most of her jokes center around her ex-boyfriend\u2019s dangly parts. The story is similarly uninteresting; you are trying to track down a professor in the jungle and when you get there everyone is missing! So, nothing new, but it works. \n\nThe puzzle design has the same \u201ccharms\u201d and problems as the previous Secret Files games: a ton of items that you are supposed to use, but often a very vague goal that you are trying to accomplish, forcing you to try everything on everything. I found it a bit less annoying in Sam Peters than I did in Secret Files 2; but that\u2019s probably because that was a much longer game which naturally increases the number of times you get annoyed at seemingly unintuitive solutions. \n\nThe length of the game (I finished it in about 2h) is a real problem, at least according to other reviews. Personally I think it was the right decision for the game. After all, the main character and the story could probably not support a much longer game. In fact, dragging it out longer would probably have ended up hurting the game more. Still, it means you have to decide what you are willing to pay for such a short adventure game with a rather bland and uninteresting heroine and story. I got it at 75% off at around 2.5 Euro and that was okay for me.

I never got desperately stuck, so I guess this is one of the easier entries in the series. You can definitely see the budget trappings of the game though - Almost no other characters besides Sam, exposition done mostly with static comic book -style panels and text, pretty lukewarm ending etc. etc. Still, I'd say this is not a waste considering the price, and will aggravate the player much less than some of the other Secret Files entries.", "timestamp_updated": 1385453198, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1383480476, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "8610475", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508382", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1389124501, "steamid": "76561197970394792", "num_games_owned": 1834, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Hmm...a difficult game to recommend because it's incredibly short (took me two hours) with little in the way of replay value (obviously, given it's a point n' click) and a fairly blande and uninteresting story, \n\nBUT the puzzles are solid, the game looks pretty good and it's SIGNIFICANTLY better than the main Secret Files games which are a complete mess so if you can grab it fairly cheap then it's a perfectly adequate couple of hours of adventure gaming.\n\nI give it three Ark of the Covenants out of OHGODMYFACEISMELTING", "timestamp_updated": 1389125996, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1389125996, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "15674809", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502240", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1430680919, "steamid": "76561198030458873", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Secret Files was a great trilogy...
