Penned initially as a tech demo for the Serious Engine 4, Croteam saw potential in their newly developed puzzle format and eventually went on to spearhead the release of their new engine with The Talos Principle.\n\nGiven the first-person puzzle genre had been dominated by Valve heavyweight Portal, The Talos Principle stands up well providing the player with with a myriad of surprisingly challenging puzzles, none of which are frustrating in the slightest. Never does the game cheat you with artificial difficulty and cheap filler material puzzles. The controls feel almost exactly the same as the Serious Sam series and makes for a comfortable gaming experience. \n\nThe story is centered heavily on the philosophy of human life, challenging what it means to be a human, free will and the human psyche. You awaken in a garden and are guided by the voice of Elohim, creator of the worlds who tells you that your purpose is to seek sigils through solving puzzles and attain eternal life. Although not put so bluntly the player is left to draw their own conclusion about what is going on. Through the use of in-game text files and audio logs found on computer terminals scattered across the worlds, you begin to learn about your surroundings and about who you are in this world, deciphering information given by others with their own unique motivations, desires and purposes. The ultimatum towards the latter part of the game really challenges your mind, forcing you to decide whether to disobey the word of Elohim and ascend the mysterious tower or giving into the temptation of eternal life.\n\nThe game's graphics are as equal a selling point as its gripping story and challenging puzzles. The visuals are quite simply incredible, complimented by its beautiful renditions of ancient Greek, Egyptian and Medievil setpieces. Damjan Mravunac heads up the soundtrack with peaceful melodic music which fits perfectly to the given level and even some times it is somewhat reminiscent of binaural beats. Inspired by minimalism, the music is also used to convey the deeper, darker undertones of the game whilst remaining soft to the ear. Each new song fitting perfectly with the level design and somehow tickling that unconscious desire to learn more about your true purpose, a true footnote to the somewhat melancholic undertone of the game.\n\nThis game to me really is a masterpiece. Acting as a window to your subconscious, serving as a perfect satisfaction for the infeasable human desire, the lifelong yearning of discovering why you are really here on this earth. Something we may never discover, so I leave you with a quote.

However there are still plenty of levels that ease you into the new mechanics so you never feel like you couldn't solve a puzzle because a mechanic had not been explained. \n\nThe DLC offers even more puzzles, most of which I found fiendishly difficult. The DLC's story is self contained, though still relates to the main game's storyline in a way. It creates a lot more characters that you can interact with via the message boards, which I found to be a very nice addition.\n\nIf you are a fan of the genre then this game is a must buy. Even if you are not, I would still reccommend you to give it a try.
