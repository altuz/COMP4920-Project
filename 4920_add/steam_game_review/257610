I can't search by text or tags, and the groupings don't really make sense-- e.g., one of the book icons shows up in the 'Human' group.

It reminds me a bit of a program called Printshop that came loaded on my very first PC back in the early 90s. \nFor making logos on the cheap, however, I'd recommend logogarden.com, which will also let you download a vector version for less than $10.
