Initially I gave it a bad review because of a number of technical failures. On the developers reccomendation I am giving Mosaico another go. I've only had a quick play and so far I'm not going to change my reccomendation but it is better than when I first reviewed it. I will keep it running for a few days to see if I can be pursauded to change my mind. Anyway first impressions of the update:\n\n- The ability to anchor mosaico out of sight has been much improved and it is now non-intrusive.\n\n- The abilty to anchor anywhere on a multiscreen setup is great.\n\n- Shortcuts have been added to switch between profiles. This works very nicley and it was one of the main reasons I gave it the thumbs down but the shortcut also opens mosaico. It would be much better if it just changed the profile without intruding.\n\n- Occasionally when you switch profiles Mosaico won't close until you manually minimise.\n\n- I experienced some slowdown of the mouse when switching profiles which lasted for about 15 seconds. I'm running good hardware.\n\n- I would like it to be anchored on the right but when I do this it still opens up to the right off screen.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nOverall I like this product and I want it to work well. I also like the developer who obviously read my original review and made changes. This is good because it means he's still working on it. I will keep testing it for him as the concept is brilliant and when I feel it's ready for reccomendation I will give the thumbs up. Really there isn't a lot to do for this to be a great peice of software but as it is now expect some teething issues.

I saw people mention frequent crashes, but I guess either I'm just lucky here or it's been fixed by now in that regard, as I haven't had it crash yet.  The rest of this review is mainly reports of minor bugs I've encountered and new feature suggestions for the developers.\n\nI mainly am interested in the manual tiling of windows with Mosaico, and that works just fine for me.  I added several different optional positions to the manual arrangement screen through the options to allow vertically dividing it into thirds.  It's great that they can be added or removed for larger or smaller screens to minimize clutter.\n\nI have a few suggestions about the manual tiling feature.  I use a touch-screen monitor, and while it is possible to touch and drag windows easily enough to position them with Mosaico, I believe it could use some additional options for better taking advantage of multi-touch displays.  I suggest the ability to tap outside of a window with a second finger while dragging the window to cancel Mosaico's tiling (which I prefer to leave enabled at all times).  Reaching for the mouse and right-clicking seems pointless and isn't easy to do when touching the screen already, and hitting Q on the keyboard also requires another hand.  I'd also like it if I could leave manual tiling disabled most of the time and drag with three fingers anywhere on a window to engage tiling (similar to Ubuntu's three-finger drag for window positioning).  Besides these things, while this isn't important at all, I thought it would be good to allow the user to change the colors of manual tiling from the default RGB to custom ones, to make this feature seem more like an integrated/native part of the operating system.  That's just a \"polishing\" thing which could come later in Mosaico's development, though.\n\nI briefly tried out the auto-arrange feature, and while it produced awkward results each time for me, I believe it could potentially be very useful if it sees some improvement.  I also think there should be a keyboard shortcut for auto-arrange for when the user doesn't have Mosaico's main window open.  When I used auto-arrange, it made one window I had on-screen not show up at all, another tall and narrow, and another small; this didn't cause the screen to be even close to completely filled by the windows.  (The test windows were Opera 27.0, MediaMonkey 4.1.5, and Windows' File Explorer.)\n\nPresently, it seems like Mosaico can't handle alternative taskbar positions very well when restoring saved layouts.  I have mine on the left side of the screen, and Mosaico seems to ignore that and have my on-screen windows offset beneath the taskbar, leaving some empty space on the right side of the screen when I restore a layout.\n\nBesides these things, Mosaico should also be able to handle arranging skinned windows, namely Steam's main one.\n\nThe main system on which I've used Mosaico uses a 27\" touch monitor with a native resolution of 2560x1440 pixels and Windows 10 Tech Preview.", "timestamp_updated": 1422739034, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422739034, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "11516910", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485394", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1417886756, "steamid": "76561197976289271", "num_games_owned": 669, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 57671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Lame and no need (especially if you have Windows 8.1\n", "timestamp_updated": 1406962395, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406962395, "votes_down": 12}, {"recommendationid": "7778707", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486136", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1429977922, "steamid": "76561198002462191", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 30200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Update Suggestions:\n1.
