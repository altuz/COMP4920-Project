It is a great simulated boardgame with only one single drawback: Missing multiplayer support. Apart from that it is the most fun I've had in a long time with a lovecraftian boardgame.\n\nThe game mechanics are simple: Collect elder signs by completing quests with lots of RNG by matching randomly rolled runes, try not to die along the way and be fast enough to keep the doom-gauge from hitting a certain level, which translates to an instant loss. Depending on what ancient horror the party of 4 is playing against, the necessary amount of signs or doom points differs greatly. The game has five pickable bosses with different difficulty levels, two of which have more than one \"phase\" of gameplay, meaning there's also a changeup of gameplay mechanics along to way on the two very hard campaigns.\n\nInitially got this through a bundle and ended up playing this a lot more than I would have ever anticipated.", "timestamp_updated": 1501669064, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501669064, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 111, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 33, "total_reviews": 144}}
