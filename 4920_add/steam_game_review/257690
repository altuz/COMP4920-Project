Decent length (~10 hours), great graphics and voice acting, difficulty ranging from easy to really tricky (might be a bit challenging for newbies to the adventure genre since there's no in-game help besides a hotspot viewer). Great game all around.\n\n\n[h1]The story[/h1]\n\nYou wake up alone on a spaceship in a far away solar system, with only your board computer J.U.L.I.A. and a small exploration vessel for company. What happened to the rest of the crew? Why did they leave you behind in cryosleep? Your expedition was supposed to look for sentient life in this solar system and you as an astrobiologist were a vital member of the team.\n\nYour task is to explore the different planets of the solar system for traces of your crew members and find out what happened to them. You might uncover more than you bargained for...\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe main part of the game is classic point & click. You send your exploration vessel to the different planets and look around for clues, mainly in the form of datapads and computers but also some environmental clues. You don't have an inventory, whatever you pick up occasionally will just be kept and automatically used in the correct situation.\n\nA lot of your progress will require you to solve puzzles e.g. hacking datapads or constructing an upgrade for your exploration vessel. The puzzles for the most part were unique, quite challenging and fun. Even adventure game veterans won't have seen most of them before.\n\nThere is no in-game help (besides an hotspot viewer and something that explains the mechanics of the current puzzle), so be prepared to really have a think occasionally.\n\n\n[h1]Graphics, sounds and voiceacting[/h1]\n\nNothing to complain about, on the contrary. The voiceacting in particular was top notch, in my opinion. There is not much music in the game but lots of ambient sounds that create a fitting atmospere. \n\n\n[h1]Criticism[/h1]\n\nMy only criticism is that you can't review datapad/computer entries without going to the place where you found it originally. If you want to solve the optional storyline puzzles in which you have to put key events of the storyline in the correct order, you'll likely have to fly to different planets to look at these again. This involves each time leaving one planet, flying to another planet, landing on this planet and then navigating to the datapad location. It doesn't take too long, you can skip some of the animations by right clicking, but still, wouldn't it have made sense that an exploration vessel for a scientific expedition would have some sort of recording device for something as simple as datapad entries?\n\nNot really a criticism, more of a warning: The game does not spell things out for you. There are quite a few details of the storyline that are maybe hinted at but never fully explained. I thought that it fitted very well with the setting, since you are playing a kind of detective who is reconstructing events from clues after the fact. But if you expect to get everything served on a platter you might be disappointed.\n\nI didn't encounter any glitches or crashes. You can save anytime you like while on a planet, and the game even provides an automatic save before you make the only meaningful decision in the game (for different endings) which I thought was a really nice touch. It would've annoyed me to have to replay an hour or more just to get a look at the other ending.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIf you are looking for something a bit different, don't mind sometimes challenging puzzles, and would like to play the detective on a solar system scale, this is the game for you!", "timestamp_updated": 1501150690, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501150431, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33381756", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502894", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499537071, "steamid": "76561197970572217", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Game last updated Jan 2017.

All these gameplay elements feel very well integrated around the story and the world. The graphics are very good, and though the music won't awe you it works well enough. The voice acting is excellent.\n\nBut what makes J.U.L.I.A. especially alluring is how relaxing it is to play it. Despite a complex base narrative and sequence of tasks you need to perform, there is still enough breathing room to explore and learn about the environment. There is never a sense of urgency, as all tasks will be resolved at their own time (except for a handful of action sequences). Even the actors speak in calm and soothing tones.\n\nAnd though the story is quite good, it does get convoluted. This becomes a problem for a few optional puzzles that are basically quizzes about the story. Completing them requires keeping an overly meticulous diary of the order of events, specifically who did what to who and when. Even when I got the order of events correctly, piecing together ambiguous English sentences proved frustrating. These puzzles practically require a walkthrough. (Again: they are optional.)\n\nFinally, thank you, developers, for supporting Linux!", "timestamp_updated": 1504340896, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504340896, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 371, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 60, "total_reviews": 431}}
