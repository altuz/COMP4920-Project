The game has such a unique playstyle with a battleground consisting of four zones to put your cards in. Besides having to worry about your fortress' health, you also have to take the morale of your troops into account - losing too many valued troops will ensure defeat as much a the destruction of your fortress. Combined with the synchronised turn system this creates a tactical element and a mind-game that is unseen in other card games!
