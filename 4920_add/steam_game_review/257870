I'll start off by saying that I'm a big fan of the series and I was patiently waiting for 3 years for this game. Checking the website regularly to see if there were any updates. I've played both Book I and Book II multiple times with different builds and playstyles. I love both of those games to bits. Now after 3 years, what we got was a short and disappointing ending to the trilogy.\n\nI really hate to say this, but Eschalon: Book III is the worst part of the trilogy and very unsatisfying in almost every aspect. Not only is it by far the shortest of the three games (took me around 13 hours where at least 4 hours was aimless wandering, trying to find obscure clues for obscure quests.) but it also has the worst world design of the whole trilogy. Around 50% of the world is swamps and all the roads and passes are infuriatingly designed where every convenient way is blocked, making it a huge pain to get around if you're going for the no fast travel challenge. This was not the case in Book II. I'm not sure if I'm just so used to the Eschalon ruleset, but the game was also extremely easy and only after around halfway the game started throwing at least some challenge.\n\nIn the end, it's still Eschalon. It's still fun for what it is. But I really really hate to see the series end like this. *sigh* I'm going to put a thumb down just to balance things out, but honestly I don't know if I'd recommend it or not. If you're a fan, you already have it and this review won't hold a lot of weight.\n\nSinathor out.", "timestamp_updated": 1392531622, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1392531152, "votes_down": 33}, {"recommendationid": "9116111", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 60, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575232", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1481253510, "steamid": "76561198026562482", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great game!  If you've played the other two and liked them, than obviously this is a no brainer.  It has some new updates here and there, but overall is the same gameplay as the last two.  I havent gotten into the story so I cant comment on that.  The few hours Ive played thus far have been doing the first towns side quests, and now heading off to continue the main plot I got side tracked with this ship wreck mystery.  No clue what to expect, and thats why I love these games!\n\nSo as I said, this review isnt for veterans of the series, because youll be buying this regardless.  This is for those people that like modern rpgs, and have started dabbling into fallout and arcanum etc and need more.  Thats how I found this series.  I hated Baldurs gate and similar rpgs, but love ones I could take my time with and had full control of every action.  If any of that rings a bell in your head check out these games.\n\nThere is a demo available for all 3 in the series at the owners site, and I highly recommend trying that first if your not sure. Or just pick up the trilogy pack while its on sale. Each game can be played seperatly without knowledge of another.  Id recommend starting with the first game and working my way up. Only because youll obviously get the full story, and because of the slight improvments made in the gameplay and mechanics.  Youll get used to the new features of say 2, and decide to play 1 and miss them and the game will feel limited due to that.  I played them out of order(2 and then 1) so its really not a big deal in the end, but you will be saying wtf why isnt this here or that option there?\n\nSo in conclusion, this is a truly old school aproach to rpgs.  If your excited for the new turn based rpgs from kickstarter etc, then look no further for a game to play while you wait for those.  While those guys were making modern day turds before going to kickstarter, this guy here was keeping the rpg tradition alive and well.  Show your love and throw the dude some cash!!   (Hes working on a scifi game next I believe.  New engine etc, so it should be fun)\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1392450057, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1392450057, "votes_down": 17}, {"recommendationid": "10434817", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 49, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574103", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1402543171, "steamid": "76561197992783259", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I loved playing Eschalon Book I and Book II and was eagerly looking forward to the end of the Trilogy.

The dungeons were vast, the enemies diverse, and the story and events were very engaging. I actually replayed the entire Book II again last winter in anticipation of Book III.\n\nBook III falls on its face in comparison. The terrain and dungeons feel simplistic. The monsters feel like recycled versions of those in Book II, and finally, there feels like there was no innovation in the game engine itself.

(The creatures you can ONLY kill with spells or fire)\n\n-If your an archer your special attack sends a HUGE blow on your enemy, but a huge damage penalty to your bow.\n\n-Game encourages exploration, but punishes you for exploring areas out of your level (which is most of them at least in the earlier levels). This normally isn't so bad, if every single damn direction (except the one your main quest is in) is like this. Even the direction your quest is in has enemies you stand no chance against.\n\n-Hit/Miss seems worse than the first book. Last I played an archer was in book I, and I don't remember missing so often. 50% chance of hits feels more like 25%. Because every single encounter, it feels like only 25% of my arrows land a hit.\n\n-Darkness terrible for both melee and archers. Now it was this way in the first two books, but pair that with the Hit/Miss problem, and darkness is twice a problem.\n\n-Much lacking balance. Somtimes the game doesn't make your objective clear, making me wander into areas where enemies are WAY more powerful than I am. I don't even know if I'm going in the right fucking direction.\n\n\nPositives:\n-The story has been made more interesting than the second book, and I feel that I have more incentive to explore (too bad it's only a minor due to the fact that everything is more powerful than you)\n\n-Better portaits (opinion)\n\n-Interesting map design. It's scarier, and the soundtrack brings that world to life.\n\n\nAll in all, the game is still fun, but all the negative things that agrrevate the fuck out of me, cause me to take a break from playing.
