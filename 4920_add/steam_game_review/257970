The angle of playing as not the badass chosen one but as Loren's servant was actually quite interesting, and if executed with better writing/gameplay I would have been more than sold. Well, I was, for a few more hours.\n\nEach companion from that point fit snugly into every fantasy party member trope unabashedly with very, very, few exceptions. About 4-5 hours in I was just clicking through fluff after fluff after fluff after fluff. The combat was so terrible I installed a cheat to just skip all the mess and to just try and enjoy the story - if there was any true uniquity to it outside of your character\u2019s origin story! I appreciate the attempt, but this visual novel suffers from a weak narrative and uninspiring management system.", "timestamp_updated": 1505362995, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505362995, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34815962", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511241", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505080009, "steamid": "76561198010838885", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A story that feels like a D&D campaign as told by an above-average GM.\n\nA solidly constructed, if not horribly original, turn-based combat system.\n\nA large party with plenty of character customization options.

I found the story line to be juvenile and somewhat predictable. Though the game allows LGB relationships, somewhat touch on male/female gender bias, along with having female protagonist... at time I get a sense this game perpetuate these bias instead of the other way around. It's almost like they let LGB relationships and choose female protagonist for the sake of expanding their audience while also insert insult along the way.\n\nIn the other hand it seems like they put effort on making the \"choice game\" more actionable by letting users to fight enemies thru turn based game. Artworks were okay and music kinda grow on me after awhile.\n\nGenerally speaking I feel this game is made for teenagers/ adult \"teenagers\". It's full of superficial fluff to entice people but in the end it's empty and doesn't really have an identity other than typical story of hero/heroine kicking the bad guy ass (boring). In the end, I can't whole heartedly recommend this game. I don't even know if I care to try different choices.
