It's all been said in many of the other positive reviews, but I think it's one of the best couple of dollars I've spent on steam. The real draw for me is the depth in the ship customization. It reminds me of EVE online in that way, except obviously it's a little more stripped down without the MMO elements, and the only thing you're really building your ships for is combat. The combat itself is very fun, with a huge range of difficulty. I'm actually pretty amazed by how much content this little game has, and I've only just scratched the surface. Like other reviewers have said, the 'tutorial' missions are quite long, and it takes some time to get through them, but once you start buying your own parts and trying out different loadouts on your ships it gets quite addictive and fun. \n\nI haven't yet finished the campaign, and I guess my one complaint is that I don't think the writing is as funny as it's trying to be, but the fact that the story doesn't take itself too seriously is a positive more than anything. Overall the dialogue (which is how the story is told) is far better written than it has to be for me to tolerate it considering how fun and well-designed the gameplay is. I got it on sale and it was a steal; a must buy if it's on sale, and a must buy at full price if you're into space combat centered around how you build your ship.", "timestamp_updated": 1500159796, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500159796, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34565845", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503898", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504629204, "steamid": "76561198023859363", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is so much fun!! I was hoping for a game I could play casually, and was pleasantly surprised to find that this could be played either casually or more seriously, and best of all had a hugely entertaining story.
