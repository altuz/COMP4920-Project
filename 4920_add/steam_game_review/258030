If you don't like RPGs, then this one won't change your mind.\n\nMost of the Earthlock reviews are very, very mixed, and this one will be no different. The easiest way to deal with this is to lay out everything it does well and everything it does badly.\n\nWhat Earthlock does well: The game features a excellent combat system that's more tactical and satisfying than in most RPGs but without getting too quirky for its own good. It features a character level system that allows the player to easily build each character in several different ways. The overworld features yet another neat series of mechanics that allow the player to avoid random battles or manipulate them to increase experience. Basically, the developers tweaked the basic RPG gameplay enough to avoid the more common old-school design errors. And while the graphics aren't stellar, the design is exceptional - a visually unique world with a level of detail rivaling that of some S-E titles.\n\nWhat Earthlock does badly: The game is pretty grind-heavy (especially with the poorly implemented farming system that means a patient player never runs out of healing items or ammo), but the big problem is the story. It's hard to explain the many problems with the plot without spoilers, but here's the gist: There's not much of a story for the first half of the game, just a series of extraordinary coincidences and unmotivated decisions to get the party together. Once the story does start up, it moved with headache-inducing speed, introducing new characters and plot points without really establishing them at all. I gather that this first game was meant to establish the world (and it is an interesting world with an interesting history), but the game doesn't even do a great job of that since most of the worldbuilding is in optional flavor text.\n\nI still recommend Earthlock because when it comes to RPGs, I'm willing to forgive a weak story if the game has interesting mechanics - and Earthlock definitely delivers that. It's just frustrating because the developers avoided the world of old-school RPG gameplay snags while burdening the plot with excessive devotion to old-school RPG cliches. I hope they release another title, because I suspect that they will get better at this with time, and they're already more than halfway there - they just need to unlearn what they think they know about writing for video games.", "timestamp_updated": 1506389496, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506389496, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34851531", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509994", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505010382, "steamid": "76561197961255565", "num_games_owned": 1391, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "What a pleasant surprise! I bought this game on a whim, looking for JRPG-ish fare. While not a AAA title, this game is well worth the asking price.\n\nPros:\n- Polished. No crashes or clunky controls.\n- Decent, colorful varied graphics.\n- Decent sound.\n- Solid development system that includes skill trees, recipes, crafting and even bonding bonuses between characters.\n- Constant challenge in both combat and puzzles.\n- Unique party members. No two members alike.\n- Cliched, yet adequate story.\n\nCons:\n- Minor technical bug; if my controller gets disconnected, I can't get controller support without restarting the game.\n- Few side quests. The ones that were there are unique and fun, but there aren't many of them.\n- No gear. All development is done through stats. * I didn't miss this at all. Between the stats and the talents, customizable was satisfactory to me.\n- Dialogue could be polished.\n\nIf you've played Oceanhorn, this game is to Final Fantasy 7 - 9 what Oceanhorn is to Zelda; a solid and enjoyable effort.\n\nPlenty of room for a sequel!
