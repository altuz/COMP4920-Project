From the mind behind Starseed Pilgrim, Probability 0 takes the straight-forward yet challenging run n' jump gameplay of platformers like VVVVVV and stirs the formula up by applying the dynamically randomized levels, skills, and enemies of the roguelite genre (Spelunky, Risk of Rain) for an end result that is [b]infinitely replayable and impossible to master.[/b]\n\nThe challenge in P0 is refreshing, while a lot of your runs will quickly end in your swift and humiliating failure the few runs you do make it far on will feel that much more rewarding and satisfying. There are loads of powerups to play around with all located on a large and expansive skill tree that you are able to upgrade between each level you manage to surpass. Every choice will have a huge impact on how you play and every player will find their own unique path of skills on the tree to succeed by.\n\nThe game has a simple but abstract and almost horror look with a great atmosphere. There's a large variety of creepy creature designs, dark and moody colors, and a rapidly changing Probability message scrawled at the top of your screen to remind you of your impending doom. The soundtrack alines perfectly and feels dark and ominous for something so 8-bit and catchy, fitting with the mood of the game just right.\n\nAt less than ten dollars, Probability 0 is an easy buy for all fans of platforming and random roguelike elements and will be remembered by me along with the most famous of indie titles from this era.", "timestamp_updated": 1402764370, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1402647517, "votes_down": 15}, {"recommendationid": "10582474", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506689", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1404753645, "steamid": "76561198006926626", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "10/10 would die again.\n\nProbability 0 is the basic concept behind roguelikes boiled down to a very few key aspects, and mixed with some clever design elements. It's pure, accessible, deep, and has an eerie, mysterious vibe to it. The platforming and combat both start out really simple, and are continuously expanded upon through new abilities (like firing your ranged projectile in new directions, being able to stomp your enemies, smash otherwise solid blocks, just to name a few). It's worth mentioning that the skill tree is extremely refined and well-designed. It feels balanced, interesting, and allows for an astounding amount of customization and experimentation at the same time.\n\nEnemies start off really simple, but as you get deeper, the spawn pool gets mixed up with very interesting critters that drastically differ in their movement, attack pattern and other behaviour. Since each enemy and environmental hazard is extremely easy to grasp and learn, death is rather caused by multiple of these elements driving you into situations you didn't calculate. Each death, even if they are very frequent, feels more than deserved - an aspect lacking in quite a number of other games.\n\nI would definitely recommend Probability 0 to everyone who likes a good challenge. It can be frustrating, but in the most positive way a game can be.

The only real goal of the game is to survive as long as possible as the game automatically scrolls downwards. You build up a score based on the number of monsters you defeat while descending, and you level up with the experience points that the monsters drop. Leveling up gives you new skills that will increase your chances of survival, but the odds are always stacked against you. In fact, there's 0% chance you'll beat the game.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, but tough to master. At the start, your combat abilities are shooting stars beneath you while airborne and punching. Both are pretty weak, but as you gain new skills, you'll become more formidable. There's a wide variety of monsters to face, each with unique patterns and abilities. Touching them knocks you around unpredictably, exposing you to other dangers below. If you get far enough, you'll even face tough boss enemies! The game's challenge is always in a constant state of pressure: you have to avoid getting crushed by the scrolling ceiling above while taking care not to fall into the abyss without a platform. \n\nThe game's real charm comes from its aesthetic. It features simple pixel graphics with a soundtrack that pulses and screams as you get closer to death. Your chances of success are constantly shown on the screen instead of a health counter, while the distance you've traveled is recorded in all sorts of different units. Everything is incredibly cute, which fits Droqen's style from past games, like [i]Starseed Pilgrim[/i]. \n\nUnfortunately, [i]Probability 0[/i] still has its fair share of problems. There's no native controller support, and the dev doesn't seem to be responsive to players on Steam's forums. Droqen has seemed to have moved on to other projects and isn't interested in offering support. The game's engine was done in Flash, which isn't particularly favored by many players. Personally, it lags a bit for me. Some may find the game's unconventional systems to be a turn off: there's no HP display other than your odds, and the habit of monsters knocking you around is pretty frustrating. Finally, a lot of people will probably find the price to be quite steep for what it is. I'm not sure what to say to really justify its price other than that it was a true labor of love by a humble indie game developer and that it's a pretty fun score-chaser.\n\n[b]TL; DR:[/b] For fans of [i]Downwell[/i], [i]TowerClimb[/i], [i]Just Get Through[/i], [i]Spelunky[/i], and other roguelike platformers.", "timestamp_updated": 1443253916, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443253916, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "19897082", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501841", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1450932651, "steamid": "76561198057473202", "num_games_owned": 541, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's certainly not anywhere near the worst game I've played.

I enjoy speed-run and time-attack games well enough, but for me there is a unique pleasure in trying to hold out for as long as possible. This is a particularly good example of the genre, and it captures much of the magic that was pioneered by classic examples like Donkey Kong. In Beginner and Expert modes, every game is a fresh start. This makes runs comparable -- no need to wonder \"did I only do better because I unlocked something?\" -- which is essential in a high score game. The unlockable \"Karma\" mode is very comparable as well, because there are only ten levels of unlocks, and you unlock them fairly quickly by playing the other two modes.\n\nSome of the mechanics in this game feel downright un-fair. Your projectiles have a tiny hitbox, while you have a rather large one, so it's a common occurrence to throw a star straight down, miss, fall straight down after it, and be hit by the monster that your star had missed. Projectiles also travel downward a bit slower than you do, so it's possible to pass them on the way down. The distance required to trigger fall damage is quite small. Getting hit sends you into a stun animation that can launch you quite far, sometimes it will throw you helplessly to the bottom of the screen, which is instant death.\n\nThey seem unfair, but they are surmountable. Developing the level of precision and quick-thinking that this game demands has been incredibly satisfying. Much like Starseed Pilgrim, another game by the same developer, this game presents challenges that seem impossible, which makes it all the more rewarding when you finally figure out how to overcome them.\n\nThe main flaws are a lack of leaderboards and controller support. Joy2Key mostly overcomes the controller issue, but it is less convenient.
