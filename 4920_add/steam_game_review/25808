There is quite a learning curve to this game -- youtube tutorials and let's plays should take care of most of that. This is a game which punishes reckless decision making and diplomacy, so be wary, and take the time to learn it properly. The multiplayer component of EU3 has offered me some of the most fulfilling gaming experiences I've ever had. If you see this on steam sale, you know what to do."}]}
