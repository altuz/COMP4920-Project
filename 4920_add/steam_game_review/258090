You SHOULD try out the demo before buying it.[/b]\n\n\n\nThe game is about a swords(wo)man, Hanabusa, who fights evil spirits on her journey to restore a blade that is imbues with powers from differents gods and ultimately find out the source for the mass of spirits that have been rampaging lately. How the fighting happens is quite a different aproach from what you'd expect and also is the catch of the game.\n\nWhen you fight the spirits, you will find out that they are practically invincible to your attacks, by attacking you'll gather energy that you can use to not actually damage the spirits, but to gather information about the spirit you are facing. What do you do with the information then? You'll have to find out the spirits actual form in order to be able to defeat it.\n\nSounds crazy all right.\nWhen you enter combat you will have no idea what you are facing, apart from the knowledge of \"this zone has these and those\",  you start off with a round of attacks, hopefully filling up your energy (or gem as the game calls them), when it's filled, you then spend it to gather info, the information gained will be hints about what the actual form of the spirit is, when you think you have enought information you can try to name the spirit, thus revealing the true form, and only then your attacks will start hurting the spirit. Naturally, you can skip the information gathering and just throw guesses, usually the spirits do a rather mean counter attack if you try to call them out and are wrong.\n\nAll this is done with simple controls, you either atttack, or defend, both gather energy for their respective gems, during the action round, you'll have the chance to deflect attacks from the monster and counter attack, in a reaction game fashion.\n\nIt gets repetive, fast, no doubt about that, but the challenge and fun is the little guessing game you have to do with the spirits. Eventually that will get to you too, and you wish it would be easier and faster, well luck is with you! Not too far into the game you actually will be able to start boosting numerous aspects of the fights, making them a ton smoother at which point the game really starts to slowly turn towards a more story telling type of a game with some action as the side dish.\nThanks to the cast of quite charming characters, it's not a bad thing at all.\n\n\nReally, play the demo if you are curious, some will hate it, some will love it. I personally find it quite an entertaining experience. Oh and remember to save often if you end up getting the game, I've had a couple crashes when facing certain spirits and there are no autosaves.\n\nPros\n+Loveable characters\n+Story\n+Soundtrack\n+Guessing the spirits can prove to be great fun for some\n+Original audio\n\nCons\n-Repetive gameplay\n-Soundtrack (too much is too much, no matter if you like the music or not)\n-English audio made me want to tear my ears off\n-No autosaves of anykind.", "timestamp_updated": 1403005535, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403005312, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 32, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 41}}
