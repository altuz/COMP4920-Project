It's a mobile port, so there's not a lot of options in the settings screen and some of the menu UI feels weird. I played on a i5 6500 & a GTX 1050ti and encountered no bugs nor crashes.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nNow surprisingly they made almost no compromises here. Apart from minor things like hiding bodies, everything else from the main series is here: hacking, the cover system, the augs, weapons & weapon upgrades, stealth, the hub world, sidequests, conversations, hidden vents...\nThe graphics and animations obviously look quite dated, but what did you expect from a mobile game? \n\nSTORY/PLOT\nThis was rather interesting. You learn about the main villains of Human Revolution from a different angle. There's a bunch of new world building happening around a new Neuropozyn alternative and we learn Alex Vega's origin story who plays an important role in Mankind Divided.\n\nIf you got it as part of the Deus Ex bundle I'd say play it after HR and before MD and simply igonre the shortcomings a mobile port brings.
