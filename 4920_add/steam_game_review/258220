Here's the breakdown\n   \n---------------------------------------------------------\nPresentation:\n\u2022 Interesting fictional storyline set in world at war between humans and vampires with solid background.\n\u2022 Consistent story pacing, but decent and linear main storyline.\n\u2022 Good variety of world and detailed environment, but filled with uninspired and repetitive designs to support gameplay.\n\u2022 Some clich\u00e9 and cheesy dialogues, few character development, lack of strong side characters which are forgotten.\n\u2022 Lip sync issue and awkward eye contract for some characters in cutscene.\n\u2022 Great soundtracks and ambient musics.\n   \n---------------------------------------------------------\nGameplay:\n\u2022 Mindless and arcadey hack-n-slash combat, it\u2019s fun and well entertained, but lack of depth and complexity. Most boss fight you can keep firing crossbow and it\u2019s done.\n\u2022 Fluid swap character mechanics (Melee / Range). Each character has different set of skills and playstyles.\n\u2022 Character progression by defeating enemies. Skill-point upgrade system.\n\u2022 You upgrade attributes and stats from collecting hidden seals and loots. The more you progress, the better gears you find in chest.\n\u2022 Gear system is very engaging and well in-game presentation. The problem is best weapons from trader are the same where you can easily obtain from end-game. Eliminate the point of progression reward.\n\u2022 The level design doesn\u2019t emphasize the variety of gameplay in both combat and puzzle due to very linear and tight area. In term of RPG, it lacks of level exploration and side quest.\n\u2022 Dialogue option has no real impact to main story beside change of some character attitudes and achievement.\n\u2022 The game has fixed camera angle and rotation. It could be bit wonky in platforming section because the game doesn\u2019t give you clear indicator where character facing to. Fortunately, checkpoint can be saved over as many as you want.\n   \n---------------------------------------------------------\nPerformance:\n\u2022 Responsive keyboard controls\n\u2022 Minor graphical and clipping issue on some levels\n\u2022 Solid and stable performance, experience no single crash and frame-rate issue\n   \n---------------------------------------------------------\nI personally love the story and mythology of vampire of Blood Knights. The game has potential to become great action RPG, but it lacks of polished features to support RPG elements. It\u2019s very short experience (3-4 hours), but still fun game if you don\u2019t take any mechanics seriously.
