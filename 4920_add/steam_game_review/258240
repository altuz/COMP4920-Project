In a lot of ways it's like a turn-based RUSE, but with much more realism and time to think. I have read a lot of negative reviews that say the game is too hard. Oh, poor babies! You think invading Axis Europe was easy? Hell no! So you can't take out the shore batteriess with ships or artillery? Maybe that's exactly what they were desiogned to resist! Oh no! What ever will we do? How about you use your dive bombers? Now there's an idea! This is exactly what makes the game great! You absolutely HAVE to rule the skies before even attempting a land-based advance. My only real criticisms are:  management of your aircraft squadrons is a bit messy, and generally a warning needs to be displayed if aircraft are low on fuel. Also, There needs to be a warning that tells you if you have forgotton to move and fire with any unit when you press 'next turn'.There has been a lot of talk about the following exploit: You can send in one unit followed by a group of ten, attack the enem,y with the lone unit and lose it to their counter attack. Then you can defeat the enemy unit with your ten and recieve no counter-attack. This is not a massive problem, but it xcould be fixed by allowing units infinite counter-attacks (ammo permitting), with exponentially decreasing effectiveness.\n\nPeoiple that are having trouble with operation Torch should think themselves lucky they are not trying to invade mainland Italy.
