There it is. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. I think I even started it, once, and played for 20 minutes. But for some reason I never finished it, always forgot it, or always had other games to play at the time. Admit it, we all have that one steam game we want to play but never do.\n\nThis year, though, I finally started it. \n\nAnd finished it the same day.\n\nI got completely entranced in the prettiness of the game, the writing, and the story. The puzzles were great, the atmosphere was beautiful. The only con was the ending, feeling rather bittersweet to me. \n\nBut short and brilliant, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was a blast to spend a cold sunday playing. Don't wait around any longer with playing these hidden gems in your steam libraries, folks, play them now, and be very happy that you did. And while you're at it, buy (and play!!) The Vanishing of Ethan Carter! It is truly great. <3\n\n(fyi I played the redux version but was not able to review it, so I'm just reviewing this verion, hence the lack of hours.

However, you're going to need more than nice graphics to justify a 20 dollar price tag.\n\nThis game looks nice. The narrative is okay, just okay. The \"exploration\" is just walking to nodes to experience the story, which arguably isn't exploration, it's just going to the next node in a very linear fashion. The \"exploration\" part of it is where you miss a node due to it simply not being overtly marked and having no map, and then waste a ton of time trying to figure out what you missed, needing to backtrack through 10 minutes of walking through scenery you've already experienced, to find something you just might have missed like a needle in a haystack. Very \"fun\" exploration.\n\nHowever, since it's only 3 hours long, and if you removed the walking to the next node it would really only be about 45 minutes long, it's extremely not worth 20 dollars, regardless of how nice it looks. I'd say the only time it's worth a purchase is when 75% off.
