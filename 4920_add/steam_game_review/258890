I definitely recommend it to anyone having an interest for typography and those passionate about it, but also to those who are new to it and want to learn about its history. Gorgeous drawings and fantastic music that reflect the particular personality of every typeface.\n\nPS: I have seen people complaining about the controls, but I had no problem with them whatsoever. Others criticize the game for not being game-ish enough for their taste. Indeed, this it is more of an experience, but it felt very much like a game to me. It is not your usual game - it is an intelligent game. If you find yourself unable to entertain an intellectual thought, then this game is probably not for you.\n\nPPS: Congratulations to everyone who worked at this game.
