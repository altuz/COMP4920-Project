If you are a  wargamer the \"micro management\" needed here will make you smile. If you are not a hardcore wargamer though it will leave you bored and confused and in the end you will probably let the AI run it all for you.\nNaval comnbat and leadership system: Feels tacked on and not well done. There is no seperate command structure for the navy so that you end up with fleet admirals like the German Grand Fleet admiral Raeder or the American full admiral Nimitz commanding individual task forces and German U Boat leader Doenitz able to command but one U boat flotilla. The amphibious assualt system is also weak although some of the issues there are addressed in the \"Their Finest Hour\" expansion. \nAir Combat: Not bad and most of the ideas involved do make sense. However once at war you constantly have to check your air squadrons since they can lose all of their organization and even fall apart completly quite quickly depending on the amount of resistance your air forces face. This causes a lot of micro management that I found a little tedious. A way to get a quick overview that shows what squadrons are in real trouble would have helped.\nPolitics: Next to worthless. All you do is pick the best minister and the best government policy that the game will allow. Very little choice here.\nDiplomacy: Slightly better.  You can infulence nations and do some pretty ahistorical things if you want to invest the time and resources. But otherwise pretty limited and with many nations you can just ignore diplomacy alltogether in which case things will usually work out as they did historically, assuming you are playing against computer opponents only. Against humans this screen does bear some watching. In short the system is not perfect but it more or less works.\nSpying (intelligence): Again very  limited. Also a little obtuse so that I was not always sure what the actions I performed actually did or what effect they would have. Clearer feedback would have been nice. You were also limited in what you could do on this screen but later updates do help here somewhat.\nResources: For some nations getting the resources you need is dead easy. For others like Germany and especially Japan it can be a major hassle. This is historically accurate of course but if you do it manually you have to go to the diplomacy screen and make deals for the resources you lack. Finding nations willing to trade with you can be difficult. And even when you get those trades you still have to defend the sea lanes or the goods may never get to you. Suffice it to say that it does feel \"realistic\" I can't just set up trades and forget about it. I still have to worry about the goods actually making it to our shores. Playing as Germany I found myself not only considering what resources I needed but if it was a land or a sea route and if it was the latter if I could defend the sea lanes invloved. I also preferred countries I wanted friendly relations with since trading helps there as well. \nProduction: I like the idea of splitting my production between upgrades reinforcements keeping the people happy and actual unit creation. I also liked the idea of having multiple production lines that I can open so I can work on many projects at once. I did not like having to constantly go to the screen and tweak sliders. And it was a situation where I did not want to leave the computer to just do it since it did not always adjust things as I would have wanted. This I considered unnecessary micro management.\nIn conclusion this is not a perfect wargame. But then I have been wargaming since the 60's and I've played a lot of grand strategy wargames that are worse than this one and only a few that are better.  If you are a hardcore wargamer this is a must have. If you are not skip this one and buy Hearts of Iron IV. Which is a much simpler game but does improve some of the mechanics such as production. Finally I recommend that to get the best experience you download the expansions (all of them up to \"Their Finest Hour\"). \n Overall rating (1-10)= 7.85"}, {"votes_down": 11, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505015438, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505021", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34852545", "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972136337", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1505014501, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 562}, "timestamp_updated": 1505015438, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Game does not work in WIndows 10 64bit.
