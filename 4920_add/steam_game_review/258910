Not too grindy. Game mechanics are cool.\n+ Setting\n+ Art style\n\nCons:\n- It still has way too many game breaking bugs.\n- Some jokes fall flat.\n\n3/10 It was really, really fun until you hit the spot where doing some actions or going some areas result in a crash to desktop. Its a pity, because theres a good game in there somewhere. I couldnt finish the game because i was too lazy to try and find a workaround for the bugs. Bugs simply killed the charm of the game for me. Without bugs, it could have been at least a game with 7 rating.", "timestamp_updated": 1505544291, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505544291, "votes_down": 6}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 100, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 111}}
