First, the walking stick bit in the beginning of the game...I don't get seasick / motion sick from games... But this game managed..Good starting point.. So I find the stick and move forward enough that I'm to the part where I cross the bridge..Did you know, if you walk at the right angle that bridge will SHOOT YOU UP into the air? Surprise! So I had a lovely eagle-eye view of the island...And then when I landed, deciding to walk forward cause why not, I end up inside of this boulder the game dev designed lol.. Interesting game.. The bridge caused me to be stuck past the part I was meant to solve so I can't unlock that part, though..

Narrative cliched, amnesiac protagonist. Level design very corridor like with pockets of hidden nooks. Hidden objects meld with decor and grayness and are hard to spot. Progression involves a lot of backtracking. Many puzzles are cryptic, such as decoding morse code or going inch by inch to find a drawer on one interactable piece of furniture. Many puzzles require hunting multiple tiny gray parts of objects to combine them together. Mechanical puzzles are frustrating, easter eggs bring nothing to the experience. Plot explains away puzzle with a nonsensical plague where residents tried to contain the plague by putting latches on gates (what the...). Extremely boring. Being remade and a second part has been kickastarted by I was not entertained at all. The headbobbing at the game start is annoying, there is no run, the walk speed is slow, the walking stick does not help nearly enough. Inventory limit is annoying. Possible to get stuck in terrain or fall off map bounds by accident. Game does not have a menu to adjust brightness and game is too dark making item finding and navigation needlessly difficult without adding atmosphere. The plot delivery system through notes is tedious, slow, and not interesting. Setting does not feel real. Island is too empty. Too much recycling of assets with the same framed pictures and broken vinyl records all over the island. Felt like a waste of time to get through. The film grain effect gave the visuals a cheap dated look. The game shamelessly puts a hint guide in the form of complex solution diagrams here and there to help with the ridiculous puzzles which hurts immersion.", "timestamp_updated": 1501712692, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501712527, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 64, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 50, "total_reviews": 114}}
