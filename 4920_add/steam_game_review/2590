Long story short, it's not a very good game.\n\nAlpha Prime is a very basic scifi first person shooter. I'm going to start off with the pros. The story got me hooked, it's the only reason I kept playing. It was easy to follow, there were a few plot twists, good stuff. The Italian prospector you meet early in the game was ridiculous. The stuff that happens will keep you entertained. The graphics are ok for a game almost 10 years old at this point. It also ran fine on Windows 10. Also cheat codes! Really, the only reason I would recommend this game is for the story.\n\nThe game has many faults though, and most of them are in the mechanics. First the AI. It's very unfair in how good it's aim is. Other reviewers are not kidding. They're also bullet sponges that can come in big groups. I had to cheat to be able to finish the game. Second the voice acting is low tier. I only really enjoyed whoever did the Italian guy. The rest of the voice actors didn't seem to try to act out their lines. Finally the level layouts can be terrible. I had to quit several times because I didn't know where to go. Either the path was way too hidden, the corriders look alike and I was going in circles, or I couldn't drive the sensitive buggy where they wanted me to, etc etc.\n\nOverall, I believe you can get better similar scifi FPS games like Doom 3, Half-Life 2, Fear for the same price as this. I already had this for years when I started playing. I think I got it in a very old Humble Bundle or foolishly paid $1 or less on sale. I picked a random game from the bottom of my library by date and this was it. I tried it and ended up playing it all the way through. I wish I had my time back. It also ends in a clifhanger so even then I won't know how it ends. Don't get sucked in like I did."}]}
