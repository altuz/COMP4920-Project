So many schools of magic, and certain spells requiring ranks in multiple schools of magic before you're able to use. You can set strategies and spells to use in combat (including which spell to cast first, etc.), but otherwise combat is played out according to the rules you've set. While it may sound limiting, it's actually pretty amazing to watch and also since manually moving and commanding each unit would take literally hours once you get 100+ units on a tile.\n\nThere's also a counter to everything, some working better than others. That neighboring nation using Blood Magic to get ahead? Use a spell which summons vengeful furies that will (attempt to) hunt down each and every Blood caster in the world. Enemy using a few incredibly strong units? Mind control or crowd-control them until the rest of your army can kill it. \n\nAlso, there's friendly fire.

I haven't yet tested the multiplayer (I'm still far too new to have a chance against more experienced players), but from playing several games against AI I can already tell that this is just the kind of game I have wanted to play for a very long time. \nFor those who know Heroes of Might and Magic this game looks familiar from the beginning, but turns out to be quite different in the long run. As in HoMaM armies need commanders to lead them around the map, and most spells are cast by commanders. Another similarity is that nations and units are based on various mythologies.\nWhat differs is how strategic the games feel. Dominions is mainly played on the world map, which is grouped into provinces. The player has to manage owned provinces (prepare defense, use commanders to construct buildings, etc.) to keep a steady income of resources and gold, and to be prepared should an enemy try to attack. On the other hand one can often choose one of multiple provinces to attack an enemy, and one has to scout for those that are not well prepared. This makes the player feel a bit less \"directly involved\" than Heroes of Might and Magic does, but on the other side one feels more \"in control\". What further contributes to this is that one needs a lot of commanders, as some of them will be busy building or researching, without ever leading an army.\nWhat also makes this game stand out is the incredible depth of simulation. A lot of things can happen in Dominions, and all of them have elaborate rules. I think it's enough to say that the manual has over 450 pages (mostly tables) to demonstrate how detailed this game is.\n\nAnyhow, it's one of the best turn-based strategy games I've played up to now.", "timestamp_updated": 1505662572, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505662572, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34925969", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496942", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506814304, "steamid": "76561198031970534", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 95}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Buy it.", "timestamp_updated": 1505331514, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505331514, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35176323", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490238", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506261026, "steamid": "76561198027701088", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 107}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "good game , but dont buy it. wait for Dom5. it would be fair to consumers who own Dom4 doesnt have to pay the whole prize for a product that changes not much....", "timestamp_updated": 1506247202, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506247202, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 694, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 7, "total_negative": 68, "total_reviews": 762}}
