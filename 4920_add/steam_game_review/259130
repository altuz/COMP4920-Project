And I don't mean the graphics.\n\n- Unbelievably frustrating in many sections of the game, specifically with enemies that go from too easy to unbelievably hard, using items in specific locations, and not having specific items for critical parts to progressing the storyline. The pacing is awful.\n\n- Too easy to screw yourself on character creation, with little tools to help explain the game.\n\n- Items have no description, so you'll have a hard time understanding what does what without looking it up on the Wasteland Wikia.\n\n- Ironman mode always, as the game auto saves with every room you enter. You might get trapped in a room with no way out because you don't have a key and you don't have the pick lock skill. Things like this are EVERYWHERE in this game.\n\n\n+ I'm so glad though that a game like this released so many years ago, for it set a standard for this kind of game that has (for the most part) only gotten better with time.
