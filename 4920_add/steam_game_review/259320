I'll list out my problems below:\n\nControls: For the most part, the controls responded to my inputs. For some reason, my controls gave out on the third tutorial. It seems as though control of your helicopter freaks out sporadically. However, those times are few and far between, so the controls are alright at best in my opinion.\n\nGame Play: Lackluster. There is no real sense of where you're supposed to aim at the enemies and overall it seems like the one thing I look for in a game, bores me to death. Also, the helicopters you get to chooses from don't even feel different in the slightest.\n\nPowerups: I add this because when an arcade game comes along, there is bound to be powerups found. However, most of the time, I don't know what they do. Some are self-explanitory, but other don't make any sense. If there was a system that told me or at least some kind of instruction, I would be fine with it.\n\nVoice Acting: This is one part of the game I like solely for the reason it sounds like early PS1 english voice dubbing.\n\nSoundtrack: Forgettable. Sometimes non-exsistent.\n\n3/10. This game is a lackluster experience unless you have a friend along. If this was a comepletely single-player experience, it would score lower.

It doesn't seem to be much, but genres like this one were already viewed as a thing of a past by that time. I could easily mistake it for a Shareware game, expect it isn't.\n\nAs it's quite an old game, how does it work? Well... one thing for sure is that it works. You can configure the game, where you can set a resolution. But while you can choose widescreen resolution out of a list, a game wasn't designed for this. What it will do is to cut a portion of screen above and below, so in order to see whole intented game screen, you should set resolution to 4:3 one!\nYou also can't change controls, and seeing how it uses Shift and Ctrl, you better be careful at button mashing it, unless you want curious Windows to interrupt you. Just hold it carefully.\nAnd yes, the pleasent thing of having to enter your key and of having score leaderboards not work anymore.\n\nAt the main menu you can choose whetever you want to Start Game or want do Competition. Competition is like a classic arcade game, or like endurance, or survival... Anyway, you have to play from first mission without continues and saving of sorts, and your score will be written down in highscore leaderboard where you compete with other players for better score if forget that it doesn't work anymore.\nOtherwise, you head into simple Start Game, where you can choose mission and difficulty, the missions being unlocked progressively. And you can choose between two helicopters, first one having guy as voice and has more damaging chaingun, while second has female as pilot and has more armor. You probably should go with first one, but then again, you will spam rockets a lot more. Male voice is also more tolerable, and characters speak a lot in this game, somewhat cool and somewhat annoyingly. Yelling to find ejection button upon single hit and saying \"take that you terrorist dog\" upon shooting down a tree.\nAnd then there is a two-player cooperative mode. But it's a local thing only, hope you got a friend who doesn't mind trying games like this. Didn't get to try it myself. But you can also easily control two players in same time on keyboard, if you want to try something new for fun.\n\nThe story is quite simple. You are American. And then there is America's dream enemy, the terroristical group Revolution Now. NOW!! Which has both arabian and russian roots, as well as a bit of alien. \nOn good side, that means that you will travel through stereotypical deserts and snowy areas too, and I must say, 2000 year lighting looks jolly on the nighty Siberia levels. And yes, it's one of better moments in game, while you listen to the better music out of a very small selection that game has.\n\nSo yes, gameplay is your military vertical shooter, not Desert Strike genre, no. It doesn't go too crazy, so it's more simple, just flying forward, sometimes getting to choose direction, shooting down things that shoot back at you and collecting powerups, with only one of them being a negative one (turns screen upside down). Most often you have to do additional mission, that is to destroy something or amount of something. In those cases the direction will loop you around the place. There even once was a single mission in which you had to search for a president from a downed airplane, in which you had to choose what turn to take every few seconds or so, but that's a single case. \nOtherwise, you shoot, you make things explode. You collect power-ups to level up your minigun, which you shouldn't use continiously, as it heats up and starts to shoot slower. And you collect all kinds of rockets, whetever lasers or big nuclear bomb, which is hard not to take damage from, and spam it on everything as well.\n\nOh, and then there are boss battles. You are going to chase some kind of tough airship, which will stay on top of a screen, shooting back at you. It seems to be pretty fine and all tough and great, until you realize one silly thing. Upon getting hit, they activate a one-second or so shield. Thus if you keep on spamming chaingun AND rockets, you will get nowhere. Using strong rockets every few seconds on other hand will give you a victory in each boss encounter quickly, maybe too quickly. Weird concept.\n\nSo yes. It's not horrible. It's a small budget game from 2000s. Doesn't bring anything new, does no horrible wrong, gives you action and explosion. Not something I can recommend to anybody, it's still something you can skip on. But it's good enough for what it is.\nSure not as bad as Steam reviews made me belive.\n\nOh yes, and the non-stop vertical movement in this game will do a weird thing on your eyes. After stopping the game, my eyes kept on moving image vertically slightly for a minute or so.

My first and biggest red flag should have been it was from Topware, a company which should change its name to something more appropriate, like \"Crapware\", \"Shovelware\", or \"Nagware\".\n\nOnce the game started (after the DX installs), the first thing I was presented with was the serial code registration screen. Upon entering the serial code, I promptly went to the \"Options\" area to check / change whatever, and upon backing out to what should have been the main screen, I was once again presented with the registration screen. Upon entering the code AGAIN, I then exited the game, thinking that perhaps shutting it down would save the registration code...\n\nHOW WRONG I WAS!\n\nAfter starting the game back up, I was finally greeted with a proper title screen & menu. I decided to begin the tutorial in order to find out the specifics of this game which I thought would be a nice homage to the scrolling shooters of old (Choplifter, Raiden, Sky Soldiers, Dodonpachi, etc...). Once the mission started, I was instructed to move from A to B and shoot targets for extra points. This is when I found out the only thing on my XBOX 360 wired controller the game recognized was my joystick, so I spent the entirety of the mission moving around on-screen, collecting power-ups / ammo, targeting things, and not able to shoot them. Once I \"completed\" the first tutorial mission, I decided to exit back to the title screen so I could check my control configuration...\n\nAND ONCE AGAIN GOT THE REGISTRATION CODE ENTRY SCREEN!\n\nIt is at this point I gave up and rejoice that I only spent a buck or so on this lesson in terrible coding and Topware \"quality\".\n\nDon't buy this.
