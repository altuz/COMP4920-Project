So if you don't have much time to read all the words I have preaperd to give my emotional, but still proffesional, opinion you can just read short version review and then scroll to final verdict at the bottom of this masterpiece.\n\n Short review:  WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT\n\nOkay Ladies and Gantleman who decided to read the entire collection of my reamarks. I would like to tell you story of this game at the begining, so you couyld understand reality of preapering this interesting title.\nChicken Shoot Gold was released at first november, 2003 by TOPWARE  INTERACTIVE\nAnd here is the first sight that this game may not be top one. Well, I wonder how many of you, my dear reader, have ever heard before about this developer? I mean, well you can be unknown but still good and then become famous, but it's been 14 years already and the game haven't turned out to be succesfull.\n\nGame programmers from Toon TRAXX Studios probably forgot about one X in their name. And If you haven't heard about them too, no worries. Because this game is classified as Indie. Well imagine situation when in 2003 professional game makers do games like\n Prince of Persia: Sands of time; Neighbours of hell; Pro Evolution Soccer III\nToon TRAX XXX XXX Studios decide to release their own (indie xd) game it just can't succed.\nI would be surprised if in a such a good year for games someone would give a look at game based on shooting down chickens. But it doesn't mean this game is bad. Anyway It's.\nLet me justify why I find this game not worth it's money.\n\n\tIt's fucked up.\n\n\nThank you.\n\nWell I'm just joking. \n\nThis game have problem when chickens get stucked behing the trees and you just cant hit them, or when chickens are behind invisible wall and your bullets can't reach'em.\nGame also struggle when we are about showing HP, Well you know when you are low on HP and when you are HIGH on HP, but their is no score and no real possibility to check this out.\nMusic and SFX are weak, bad, and shitty just because I don't like them. You can't feel the character whom I called Hans (Maybe because game comes from german, or maybe he looks like soldier from first Wolfenstein, or maybe because their is Polish Flag on the battlefield) A blood wanting justice warrior who decided to slaughter, slay and murder all chickens (although this hiding deeply in the woods and on sahara desert, askin alines for help) just because he fell asleep and meanwhile chickens decidedd to eat his corn.\n\nWell Hans is retard, there is no daubt about this.\n\nBefore we get into talkie, talkie about few pluses  I'd like to inform you that I'm impressed you are still reading. \n\nCongratulations.\n\nGame is consisted of 3 modes.\nArcade: shoot as many chickens as possible, get as many points as possible and don't die\nClassic: This is shit, dont play it\nMultiplayer: I really wanted to check this out but humans seem to have IQ possitive and do not waste tme on this game, so maybe another time.\nIn all modes (I lie, I don;t know if it is true about multiplayer, but I wish you good luck in checking this out) yoiur hand must be faster then horny teenage from junior high. Your reflex must be better then Iker Casillas during his highlights. And also your patience must be hard, strong w/e.\n\nAnd now for seroius. This game is really challenging and addicting. You want just one more try, and after 667th you decide to write and review.\n\nThat's the reason.\n\nAlso this game is not cheap, and for sure it's not worth 7 euro, But mostly it's not worth time. So if you want to waste your time go buy drugs and have fun.\n\nNo, drugs are bad. Go Sleep.\n\nAnyway This game is bad, and not worth playing.\n\nI don;t know if this review makes any sense, anyway I hope you had some fun while reading it.\n\nHave fun\n\nDon't put hand in pony's jaw.\n\nThanks for your time.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1498433939, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498433939, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 33, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 23, "total_reviews": 56}}
