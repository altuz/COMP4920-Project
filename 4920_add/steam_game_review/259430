From someone who played Eve Online and found it to be rather droll and nigh impossible to be an effective addition to the world, Zigfrak \"scratched that itch\" for me in regards to free-roam space exploration games.

With a name seemingly produced by a name generator, Zigfrak is an action RPG set in space. The game drives the player through a single player story but the player is free to roam off the beaten trail to explore or engage in side-quests. \n\nZigfrak was a game that I wanted to like as I love space exploration action RPGs ever since Escape Velocity. Unfortunately, in my opinion suffers from some key flaws. Playing this game it's fairly obvious that this game borrows alot from MMOs such as World of Warcraft, which is not something I would necessarily want in a single player game. A lot of quests are tedious and uninteresting \"go here and click on this\" tasks. There's a lot of loot in the game to collect, which might generate some interest and motivation to play, but this mechanic feel a bit cheap. A lot of sidequests are collection questions that just involve collecting a specified amount of items and cashing them in for a reward.\n\nSince this game is inspiried by MMOs I don't think it really respects the player's time; for example at one point the player must battle a spacestation with a friendly fleet. It took me nearly 45 minutes to deplete half of it's health. \n\nAside from this, the action is fairly average. The weapons don't have a particularly notable feel and I didn't get a sense that I was actually hitting a target. Instead I just held down the attack buttons until I saw the enemy's health bar lower.  \n\nTo it's merit, when a 'hacking minigame' came up I was given the option to fight enemies instead. I aprpeciated the option to focus on the game's core gameplay instead of getting pulled off into some minigame. \n\nIn terms of production value, the graphics aren't anything to write home about and many things in the game simply don't have any sort of sound effect. \n\nThere is no USB controller support for this game.\n\nIf you like MMOs and space exploration RPGs and you want a single player game you might find this game fun, otherwise there are better options for you.  I played this game a little over 3 hours, giving it a chance to get me interested but it failed to really inspire me to play.\n\nScore: 5/10", "timestamp_updated": 1387141339, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1387067611, "votes_down": 52, "developer_response": "Thanks for giving it a fair shake and providing a writeup.

Unless you're Maverick. \n\nZigfrak is a pretty awesome game. It's amazingly beautiful, but for reasons I can't begin to fathom it has never overheated my laptop. Not even when I accidentally left it running paused and the temperature in my room was in the mid-80s during the afternoon hours (my room sadly faces west). Even games that are 3D only as window dressing tend to overheat my laptop (RTS games, XCOM Enemy Unknown, and many others). This game I could probably leave running for a week.\n\nThis game is what I'd term a casual space RPG. What I mean by \"casual\" is that it tends to avoid the micromanagement most RPGs entail. Unlike most casual RPGs it IS pretty and there's a very wide variety of enemies and components you can add to your ship. No really, there's TONS of things you can upgrade your guns, shields, armor, missile launchers, whatever to. Going along with the casual game theme, they're often whimsically named. Inconvenient realism tends to get glossed over in this game. You're only allowed to carry so many of each object. Once you hit that amount, it automatically converts those items into the type of credits you spend at a trade station (there's at least three forms of currency, which makes game economics all kinds of interesting).\n\nThe author loves puns and references. There's an alien weapon type called \"strange.\" So one of the weapons has an effect called \"When you're strange.\" And given that certain of the higher-end weapon names are prepended with \"tweaked\" they put in one weapon called \"Tweaked Morrison.\" The references vary between movies/sci-fi (obviously) but you can also find weapon types like Larry, Curly and Moe. I want to hope that Moe is the most effective, with Larry being the less-interesting mid-range model.\n\nIt's also a fairly sandboxy game. While there's an arcing storyline, you can freely ignore it if you want, and just go about fighting, looting, crafting or whatever.\n\nThe author is AMAZINGLY responsive and non-dickish (even when folks are being critical). Seems willing to take a look at your saved games in order to track down bugs (or just fix your stuck game for you). It's almost unbelievable how responsive he is given that it's a $5 game. I almost feel guilty mentioning that it's fairly easy to come by coupons for this game...\n\nThe only reason I mention my friend Maverick up top, it's not his type of game. While I wouldn't call the game overly easy, it rather shamelessly lists as one of its selling points that it's a click, kill and loot game. It even describes the things you kill as \"loot pinatas.\" I like the honesty there, it lets you know that this wasn't done by accident or poor design. This game is for people who like getting loot. It's a nice palate-cleanser for my Shadowclan friends *snickers*. Money is easy enough to come by (and if you putter away a few hours in certain areas you'll be absurdly comfortable). You could also avoid doing as I did to get a \"more balanced\" experience. It shouldn't be TOO hard to get the things you'd want to buy (in the unlikely event they don't drop as loot somewhere).", "timestamp_updated": 1400087384, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1400087384, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "13018132", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512196", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1419727499, "steamid": "76561197993423353", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "This game is amazing.

While the quests aren't really reactive and I don't recall any moral choices, some of the encounters you'll run into will make you question your character's morality.  On the downside of the game, some features are really obnoxious (like the ship tractor beams, dear god), and the really slow docking (although automated). Some missions require you to dock with a ship before you obliterate the enclosed crew's only wall between them and the emptiness of space, but the cinematic nature of it makes it quite difficult while 12 of your friendlies are shooting at it.\n\nThat aside, this is an very good game and it is underpriced in my opinion.

Its very Space Opera Like.  The story line starts normal and has alot of mysterious things in it.  However everything is presented to you in the old school way of massive text.  Controls for this game are mouse and keyboard.  I suppose you could use xpadder and map some keys to a controller....but you would still have to click on things.  Learning curve for this game isnt too bad but it does take getting used to.  Like not realizing you have to click on things on the right side of the screen and not from your inventory.  They do a fairly good job during the tutorial showing you things.  And you can skip it as it tells you in the text.  Again massive text to read.  Game play wise its ok and takes a bit to get used to.  Other people compare this game to descent or freespace...um no....not even close to that sort of control  This one is more simple and reminds me of games of a few years ago.  In a way this is a very nostalgic game in that way.  Music is not too bad....graphics are not the greatest but they are not too bad either.  You can tell they are hand drawn or hand painted on some.  \n\nSo let me review...Good things about this game.\nIts a Hardcore Space opera\nLots of things to get\nNot saddled with stupd things like runing out of fuel or oxygen at least that i have seen.\nSimple control scheme\nAlot of extras including a plethora of weapons and ammo types\nTypical mystery space style\nlots of things to find\n\nNow for the bad things    \nWalls of text..yes alot of text...to find out what to do you must read.\nsome things not clearly explained so it might take a bit to find what you have to do.\ncontrol scheme is mouse and keyboard only\nVery nostaligic feel which might not be what gamers want.\nNot all loot goes to your ship no matter how close you are...thus you have to click on alot of stuff.\nCan only tractor in 1 thing at a time at least what i have found so far.\nIts a very long game not going to be completed in 4 or 5 hours so maybe not for the person who wants something mindless\n\nSo in the end I recommned this game to people who like Hard Core Space Opera with mysterious alens and are not afraid to read alot of interesting things.  I dont recommond this game for people with a short attention span or people who dont like to read or people who simply want to blast everything and be spoon fed.

I know that 'only 10ish' ships may not seem like a lot as a first impression, but in reality, considering what your ship is in this game, they are more comparable to playing styles, depending on which ship and how many slots for weapons/ drones / engines etc the ship has.\n-After you beat this game, there is still a plethora of content to be unlocked. ( Through Randomly generated events or Missions, aswell as weapons from special vendors/stations that can only be obtained from 'Research', or Boatloads of credits.)\nFree Roam!!! Not just 'free roam', I Literally mean you can travel to hundreds of different locations,  which all have very decent size btw.\n\n\nCONS\n- No Multiplayer ( possible future devolupment I Hope! )\n- Uhh...

I suggest to grind during the campaign some time outside of the missions to get the level a bit up and shorten in this way the time to the alien stuff (the way seems a bit long, but you need to get the requirement just once and not for every item and stronger weapons in later game shorten the way even more).

I'd say more like Diablo II or Torchlight II mixed with Galaxy of Fire or pretty much any Action game taking place in space.\n\nThere's lots of loot to collect and obtain, and since I'm the type who loves collecting loads of loot, regardless of quality, and taking time to compare them to each other and what I have equipped to see whats best to equip and whats best to store, this is really my kind of game.\n\nI agree with most the other comments. The controls and interface do take some getting used to, but I wouldn't call it difficult at all. Interface, controls, loot sorting/equipping are pretty customizable in the options to. While there are graphic options, they're not as diverse as I'd like. It's pretty much windowed/fullscreen, Resolution, and overall quality. The 'Overall Quality' part I mentioned is a slider that moves between 3 different presets of Anti-Aliasing and the like. It's not a huge problem, the vast majority of players will be able to fit quite comfortably in one of those 3 presets, but it would still be nice to be able to control those options ourselves.\n\nStill, I'd recommend this game easily. Diablo/Torchlight in space, tons of loot, fairly big map to explore, etc. I'll update this review as time goes on, but I recommend this.", "timestamp_updated": 1403764092, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403764092, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "9620428", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507379", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1407128137, "steamid": "76561197995919915", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Quite honestly the most fun I've had blowing things up in a while.\n\nI picked Zigfrak up for 2.49$ in one of the sales, and have enjoyed every minute with it.\nThe combat is fast paced and frantic, the jokes and references are hilarious, and the loot, good lord, \nthe loot is everywhere.

I've only sunk about 2 hours into Zigfrak, but I've already had more than enough fun with it to justify it's extremely low 5 dollar price tag. The core gameplay is the real star here; it's an A-RPG that wears its title proudly: enemies explode in crazy piles of loot which are easy enough to collect (thankfully flying by loot auto collects it), the writing is fast paced and witty, and the world is huge. It's got all the point-and-click-y fun that comes from diablo as well as slightly strategic gameplay that one might expect from a space shooter. All of which is to say, it's a great twitch gaming experience. \n\n      The game itself features a crafting system, mining resources, cloaking, hacking mini-games (which are entirely optional, the game will let you just shoot stuff instead if you prefer), and some slight inventory micro-management (you have a shield for your shield, called an overshield which can take a real beating, but once it goes down, you probably want to equip another one).
