The graphics are simple but work really well, and the game can be played in low specs computer (it runs great on my laptop with intel HD ). The core of the game is trading, which is well implemented, including variating prices of commodities across sectors.\n\nCombat is nice and really satisfying, but limited by the 2.5D aspect of the game. Still, I find it fast, engaging and fun. The various types of weapons and missiles, as well as the need to have a powerful enough engine to power your lasers and shields, help to keep it interesting.\n\nThere's a lot to do in game already (missions, mining, trading, pirating, upgrading your ship), but the game is on early access and it still lacks content (more missions, factions, a reputation system, consequences for pirating, NPCs, all in the dev's roadmap), so [b]beware[/b], buy this game in it's current state if you want to try it and help the dev, but don't expect a finished product yet.\n\nI really like of this game both the graphic style and how simple it is. I like how the stations are made (basically 2D menus with a 3D render as background, but really well implemented), and the models of the spaceships and stations are really cool imo. \n\nThe galaxy is huge, and you can \"jump\" between sectors or use 3 different movement types within sectors (cruise speed, boosters or slipstream \u2014a type of warpspeed).\n\nIn sum, Drifter is a great work in progress, totally worth a run in it's current state, but you might want to look elsewhere if you want a complex, full 3D spacesim or a finished product.\n\n[b]I appreciate the Linux support[/b]", "timestamp_updated": 1499467558, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499466950, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "33808692", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510535", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501075499, "steamid": "76561198029777026", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game was recommended to me as a very promising space trader game with focus on trading and exploration, not on combat. And it would have realistic dimensions/physics.\n\nWhat I get after buying it is a simplistic game with a clumsy UI, medirocre graphics, a trading systems that was state of the art in the early 80s, strange controls, a ship that can only fly along a 2d plane, a ship that seemingly has no steering/braking thrusters (at least not visually) and after making my first 2 jumps I get easily blown to bits by a pirate ship.\n\nThe game feels like a prototype made by a gaming engineer student in his spare time. Graphics are completely ok, though nothing special here. But all other gaming aspects don't deliver. This game cannot be played without constantly duelling pirate ships, trading is micro-management (you don't have a universal stock exchange where you can see which system needs a certain product), you just have to go there, check the prices and remember them, then buy cheaper goods somewhere else and come back. If you buy and immediately resell goods in one spot, they return you the very same price you paid. Where in the world would someone do that?\n\nSorry, but this is not ging anywhere. 12 \u20ac is way too much for this.\n\nI like the star map though and the way you search for systems and plot courses. But manually making several jumps in a row, having a 1minute cooldown in between every jump where you get attacked by pirates (even in rather safe systems), is not what I was lookign for.", "timestamp_updated": 1501076004, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501076004, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "34365128", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506504", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1490911665, "steamid": "76561198246769620", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "EXTREMELY barebones space sim.
