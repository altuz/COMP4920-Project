You don't need to know any science to play though, because the game teaches you everything experientially as you go.\n\nBetween levels, we see glimpses into the life of Allison, our deeply flawed but nonetheless inspiring protagonist. It seems that she's very good at particle physics, and would rather run simulations than deal with the strife and hardship that has beset her personal life.\n\nYou follow her emotional journey. Step by step unravelling clues of her life and psyche... all the while you play as her, running the simulation. In this way the game is a metaphor, as you look deeper into the soul of allison she looks deeper into the quantum world. As I said, this is a game about a particle physicist looking inwards.\n\nAllison is an inspiring role model. She teaches us that it's ok to not have all your shit together, and that scientists are allowed to be human. Together with her friends and colleagues, this game also normalises the idea of successful women in science (Alison's mentor is female, and gives her career advice. That's right an indie arcade game passes the bechdel test) and shows us that you don't need a barbarian saving a princess to tell a compelling story. Like seriously, this game normalises both the idea of a female protagonist, and the idea of a scientist protagonist - these characters are just compellingly HUMAN, and a refreshing change from the testosterone charged male-jock protagonists most games present.\n\nThis game is a must have for science geeks, for anyone who cares about portrayal of women in media, and for anyone who wants to see games used as a medium for telling stories. Or for anyone who wants their kids to have positive attitudes towards any of those things.", "timestamp_updated": 1417607585, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417305554, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "10764162", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501022", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1417243014, "steamid": "76561198059730590", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is game simplistic and enjoyable.
