Depending what you're after anyways. The main game itself I wouldn't say is overly difficult once you get each enemies abilities memorized. Where it really begins to become a challenge is grinding out some of the later missions though. Honestly an advantage in my opinion as the game offers something for both casual and grindy players.\n\nPlenty of items to collect for completionists, you can unlock your favourite enemies abilities for your own use, it has a leaderboard to climb, along with plenty of achievements.\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, it's pretty much a Star Wars/Alien themed air hockey game. For what it has to offer I'd say it's worth the $10.99 mostly if you plan on grinding out achievements and missions though. Otherwise for the amount of game time needed to just beat the main game maybe wait till it's on sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1503470081, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503470081, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33613388", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501420", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1423578942, "steamid": "76561197993227085", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I bought this for the VR support.
