It walls of progress. Rather keep speeding it up. The wyverns are great, they are a threat but slow and deal-able.\n\nI completed this game 100%; It's worth the 2\u20ac price; Mechanics can feel iffy;", "timestamp_updated": 1503557652, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503557652, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33804226", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493307", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501057833, "steamid": "76561198079050211", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It might be cool at the start but this game gets repetitive really quickly especially after you collected a few ability CD's. It's just dodge and blast enemies mostly but to complete the CD's take time to master but the repetitiveness makes it hard to want to continue because you will die a lot~!! And then you have to start over again and again. Also there's supposed to be a free 'Void Expansion' where there's a new Samurai boss but where is it?? No help or info about that so the expansion is missing and I'm not the only one. Only the most patient and persistent players should get this game as it could get frustrating, repetitive and also boring as there's not too much to do really.", "timestamp_updated": 1501545351, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501058916, "votes_down": 7}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1252, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 72, "total_reviews": 1324}}
