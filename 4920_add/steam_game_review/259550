But for now let us take a look at the pros and cons of the game.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[b]+) Story:[/b]\nA simple piece of writing, but it definitely works. You start as a young boy, who is forced to leave his home and start a journey, which ends in him becoming a hero (I didn't use spoiler-tags, since the title already tells you as much). Nothing new, but told well, which is the most important part.\n[b]+) Art style:[/b]\nI have to admit, that I'm not really objective, when it comes to this point. Some of my favourite childhood games use the same kind of art style. I won't go into details, since you can look at the screenshots yourself, but it was one of the points, which sold the game for me.\n[b]+) Music:[/b]\nThe music fits the overall relaxing atmosphere of the game, while also being dramatic enough to fit more tense moments like battles or hostile environments. However it lacks variety. I'm a person, who can listen to the same song for hours at a time, so it didn't bother me, but I know that this point could also be a con for some people.\n[b]+) Relaxing atmosphere:[/b]\nI pondered if I should write this as an extra pro, since it's the result of the former two points. But in the end it's one of the main reasons why I liked this game. Slowly improving a kingdom, while listening to a soothing tune is a perfect way to end a stressful day.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[b]-) Difficulty:[/b]\nI didn't expect this game to make me grind my teeth, but I still felt let down by how easy this game was. There are no instances, where you need to think what to do next or how to solve a problem, something which I expected from a point & click adventure game. Your character mostly tells you where to go next and interactable objects (people included) have special indicators. The only form of challenge comes from finding the few people, who only get such an indicator after clicking on them and hidden objects all over the in-game world, which appear after you unlock them through skills.\nIn the beginning I thought that money might be another source of difficulty, since nothing is for free. From collecting resources to simply resting, everything needs some kind of consumable, which in return costs gold. But fairly early in the game you unlock the ability to earn unlimited money through trading (if you have enough patience), so as long as you have at least 4 gold, you can't become bankrupt.\n[b]-) Item/Work failure:[/b]\nI don't know if it's scripted or random (perhaps I'll update this review once I started a 2nd playthrough and found out). Either way it's a useless mechanic, that lets your equipment (hammers, axes, etc.) break or certain tasks fail (e.g. making a potion, which you spill at the last moment). Both cases provide no source of challenge, since you can buy new tools or consumables (to finish tasks) indefinitely and money is infinite. Instead it's only a cheap way to lengthen a playthrough.\n[b]-) Last quarter of the game:[/b]\nIt starts right off with the story making a leap of logic, but the main problem I have with this part is the following: Right at the beginning you finish the last side quests. Once this is done the game rushes towards the end. Once you reach this stage you have all the money you could ever want, so you just jump between traders (to get the necessary equipment) and the next main story objective. At this point the game could just as well be a visual novel.\n\n[h1]Additional notes:[/h1]\n~) I 100% completed the game in roughly five hours. My stats may say otherwise, since I played most of it in offline mode.\n\nNow to my conclusion and why I was/am unsure whether I should recommend [i]Hero of the Kingdom[/i] or not. \nI liked the game. It was a nice, relaxed evening playing through it. But before I recommend a game I always try to look at how much you get for your money, both quality and quantity wise. I bought the game for 0,59\u20ac. Based on that I'm absolutely satisfied and recommend it. However the original price (6\u20ac) is just too damn expensive.\nSo yes, [i]Hero of the Kingdom[/i] is worth playing, but only if you get it on sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1505049178, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505049178, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34829887", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498825299, "steamid": "76561198171992759", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A very fun, easy & simple point & click game.
