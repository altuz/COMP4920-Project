There is a simple menu to build stuff and all you need is the components. My main issues with this game come down to re-playability and immersion.\n\nFirst off, while this game is game focused on survival and defense, it leaves more to be desired. There are outposts you can explore, enemy encampments you can destroy, but it all begins to feel repetitive after 4 to 6 hours of gameplay. \n\nI haven't explored the terrain all that much but it's very easy to learn where to expect what resources. You go the mountains for gold and silver, and you go to the valleys for almost everything else.\n\nSecondly, and possibly the worst aspect of this game, is a lack of a soundtrack. I'm not immersed into a game unless I have music playing in the background that links to the environment. Imagine if iconic games like Halo or Skyrim didn't have their soundtracks to help draw you in? Would they have the same lasting impact?\n\nOverall, this game is enjoyable. If building bases to protect against orange space aliens is your thing, this game is perfect. However, it lacks that drawing immersion some games need.", "timestamp_updated": 1505122493, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505122493, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35319431", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500046", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506746510, "steamid": "76561198055482842", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 491}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "reminds me of early ark with more sci-fi stuff minus the level system", "timestamp_updated": 1506737408, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506737408, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35237825", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500046", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506506459, "steamid": "76561198101263085", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 166}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": ">Early in development, shows promise.\n>Pre-menu stuff kinda suggest the developers intend on doing two other games, IMHO", "timestamp_updated": 1506500641, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506500641, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35003749", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490407", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505712328, "steamid": "76561198141688714", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A well-made game.
