The visual design is probably the most interesting aspect, it's a pixilated style that's both a little blocky and still rather lush and vibrant and it's pleasant to look at. The soundtrack is fairly atmospheric and can be a bit unsettling at times.\n\nAnd the game has its unique sound-based puzzles though I can imagine those being tricky for people who are tone deaf. The puzzles as a whole aren't too tough and the game is less than two hours long in total but it's enjoyable enough to play. \n\nComplaints would be that the third chapter is a bit weaker than the others - the visual design of the area is much blander, there's a lot more open space, and you can miss solving a puzzle that is then all but needed to clear the final puzzle (I ended up having to use a walkthrough to clear the last puzzle as a result, but otherwise had no trouble clearing the game). But that's mostly nitpicks and yeah it's fine as a whole.\n\nFor a low price I can see this buying you a few hours of entertainment, I mostly only got this bundled with the sequel game and basically played it out of obligation but it's still enjoyable enough on its own.", "timestamp_updated": 1504761866, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504761866, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 136, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 26, "total_reviews": 162}}
