No slowdowns, no crashes. Initial lockups on loading screen that appear to be related to using Windows 10, but I was able to fix (see end of the review).\n\nI was surprised to find I'm actually enjoying this game, given its harsh reviews, It's far from perfect, but it's also far from being a bad game at the current price point of $2.99. I'd probably be annoyed if I were expecting a AAA title and paid $50 for it, but it's fun despite a number of polish issues.\n\nThere was a major controversy surrounding this game and its developer's fight with a prominent Youtube reviewer in 2014. I have no dog in that fight, and it's not a consideration in my review.\n\nThe game:\n\n - It has a good fictional premise: you're an alchemist hired to help stop a mysterious beast that has been attacking people in and near a castle, during the Middle Ages.\n - The artwork is great, sort of a combination of cell-shading and 3D. It looks fairly primitive, but there is something about the style that tickles my fancy. I especially enjoyed the courtyard with falling snow.\n - The music is evocative.\n - It's fully voiced. The writing is generally good, with some obvious weak bits. The same goes for the voice acting.\n - It does a good job keeping the plot moving.\n\nThe game isn't without its problems:\n\n - It tries to install an unnecessary component (Ogg Vorbis) when you launch. I decline every time,\n - Running in Windows 10 requires setting Windows 7 + Administrator compatibility modes on the game's executable file, or it freezes on the load screen.\n - The game only supports auto-saves, done every time your journal updates. This means lost progress if you want to quit before hitting a new save point.\n - You can't view the keybinds within the game.\n - Advancing requires reading the manual, because it describes a couple of controls / features you are unlikely to figure out on your own, and they are necessary to understand or you'll get stuck VERY early. However, the manual spoils a couple of surprises that I think are better left to experiencing in-game. You can read my as-non-spoiler-as-possible hints instead:[spoiler](1) You'll need to use the pickpocketing ability early, which requires crouching (CTRL) and using the interact / hand icon while behind your target. (2) To get past the area where you turn into a wolf the first time, you'll need to use your wolf abilities (run and swipe) on more than one target.[/spoiler]\n - Some of the things you must do are fictionally illogical, such as [spoiler] the early requirement to pickpocket guards.[/spoiler]\n - Similarly illogical are the chests scattered about that you can (must?) pick.\n - The map is useless, as it's just 2D sprites and doesn't show your position.\n - NPC models and animations are pretty crude, though they get the job done.\n - Puzzles are super simple, not much above walking simulator level (might be a positive depending on your preferences).\n\nMost of the above are technical / polish issues that could be patched, though it seems unlikely they will be at this point. The underlying game is fundamentally sound, and an enjoyable experience with a little patience for its rough bits.\n\nFIXING THE LOADING SCREEN FREEZE ON WINDOWS 10:\n\nSetting Windows 7 and Administrator mode on the two game executables fixed it for me:\n\n- RIGHT-click on Guise of the Wolf in in your list of games, and select PROPERTIES.\n- Select the LOCAL FILES tab, then BROWSE LOCAL FILES\n- Open the GAME folder\n- Set the two Guise of the Wolf files to Windows 7 and Run as Administrator compatibility mode:\n\n- RIGHT click and select PROPERTIES\n- Select the COMPATIBILITY tab.\n- Check the box to run in COMPATIBILITY MODE, and set it to Windows 7.\n- Check the box to RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR.\n- Click OK.", "timestamp_updated": 1503886170, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503787695, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33437576", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496030", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503792284, "steamid": "76561198084306081", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I like this game, but it has got some problems with Windows 10 so I cant play it anymore.\nIt is somehow funny but also a trash game.", "timestamp_updated": 1499711472, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499711472, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 16, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 48, "total_reviews": 64}}
