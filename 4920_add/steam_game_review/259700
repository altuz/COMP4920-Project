Again this does not fare much better than a flash game and should only be played as last resort for people with little to no other options which is boiling down to nearly nobody nowadays with the over abundance of games in everyone's libraries.", "timestamp_updated": 1506052678, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492888611, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 41, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 60, "total_reviews": 101}}
