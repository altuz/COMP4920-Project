The way this game was portrayed in the Steam store made it seem different from what I had previously played, and I found that a bit deceptive.  Because I had experienced this game once before without realizing it, it ruined this potential playthrough.\n\nFrom what I remember of what I'd played in the past, the game didn't stand out as being anything super enjoyable.  It was difficult to balance the character's at-home job, and the characters didn't really stand out in my mind.\n\nMy final problem is that when I started playing the Steam version, I randomly got 12 achievements for DOING NOTHING.  And these achievements are all meant to be obtain way later in the game.  One of them was even only achieved by 2% of people who had played the game, and now it's on my hardest achievements showcase on my profile despite me not truly EARNING it.  That really bugs me, especially since it seems like there's no way to UN-achieve it and get it out of my achievements.\n\nSo yeah, my brief time with the Steam version of this game was not pleasant, and if I had known this was a game I'd tried before, I could have avoided this mishap.", "timestamp_updated": 1499112755, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499112755, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 105, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 57, "total_reviews": 162}}
