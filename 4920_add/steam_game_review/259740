Still, I have to say that I didn\u2019t enjoy this game as much as did for other HOG. \n\nThe story and the voice acting are never really that good, just \u201cOK\u201d. Even if I wasn\u2019t excepting much from that, I have to say that the story of The Cursed Heart was disappointing. I was thrilled by the pirate theme, but, in the end, the story was boring and a bit of a clich\u00e9. At least, the artwork was really beautiful.\n\nRegarding the puzzles, they were fun. Like what you expect from an HO game. Except for some hidden object mini-games. Sometimes, there were objects that were really hard to find because the word used could mean many different things. Therefore it was really frustrating to be forced to click aimlessly everywhere on the picture for few minutes just because I wasn\u2019t searching for the right thing.", "timestamp_updated": 1502756455, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502756455, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34104024", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502375478, "steamid": "76561197974105367", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "i have played it on the ps4 first and enjoyed it. there are few differences in solving puzzles but over all its the same. a solid P&C adventure game with some solid puzzles. nothing complicated but enough to keep you thinking without losing enjoyment.", "timestamp_updated": 1502200937, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502200937, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34637001", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498878", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503476969, "steamid": "76561198101447128", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The graphics in the videos are horrid, story could be better, and the voice overs do leave some room for improvement.
