The writing is easily the game's strongest aspect. It's full of refernces to classic games, but it also contains a great deal of pathos and questions about death, science vs faith, and the afterlife. The soundtrack is good as well.\n\nBut this thing has more bugs than the last two Bethesda games combined, and even compared to the games it tries to emulate, it actually falls short technically.

All the side quests are very engaging, and though the game has very little direction, the main story had me 'pining' to know what will come next. It had that classic, old video game story which deals with many adult themes very well in the context of a child's game.\n\nSo, if you're willing to pay 15$ for a buggy, seemingly incomplete game for a great story and truck through it, then I recommend this game.

Roy Guarder was out exploring forsaken lands with his wife when tragedy strikes and they are both killed. Except while his wife moved on he was stuck in some strange colorful limbo world. The story follows Roy\u2019s attempt to come to terms with this strange new change in his life and exploring the world with his brother to collect the color pieces and uh\u2026 er\u2026 I think show them to some group of scientists to prove Roy isn\u2019t insane? I\u2019m not entirely sure actually why we\u2019re out risking our necks for colors other than they\u2019re there.\n\nThis game seems to be somebody\u2019s love child with classic 1990\u2032s Nintendo. The game plays a lot like a combination of Link\u2019s Awakening and Zelda 2 with a similar over world to go around in with various locales to explore. Combat is like much of the old top-down Zelda games but with a large variety of melee weapons to chose from and an infinite supply of \u2018throwing arrows\u2019 to hurl at enemies. There\u2019s a few pokes at Pokemon too with a \u201cit\u2019s hyper effective\u201d screen popping up when you\u2019re using a weapon enemies are weak to and even a weird not entirely sure if intentionally buggy boss fight against MissingNo.\n\nIt is certainly interesting the way the game incorporates things we generally forgive into the game\u2019s story. For example your inventory is carried around on the back of a companion and you \u2018jump\u2019 into his backpack to access things. Also, death is but a minor inconvenience for Roy who caught in some strange after-life loop. He can\u2019t seem to die but instead travels back and forth freely between living and dead. So when you die you\u2019re just sent back to the strange colorful after-life world. Once there you just gather yourself up and go back into the fight. Also the game is monochromatic but it seems that the characters of the world are used to it being varying shades of mustard and olive. The introduction of colors pretty much freaks everyone out and Roy\u2019s ranting about them has had him labeled as a loony.\n\nIn fact dieing is kinda an important thing to do and at various points during the game you must go to the strange after-life world to achieve certain things. The after-life being some strange floating platform in the sky also has a telescope which lets you look down on the planet and spot where the color shards are. It\u2019s sadly about the only sense of direction you get as you wander around the world trying to find said shards.\n\nAnd now this is where I have to start complaining about the game. The story is pretty decent, although at times it can dump some pretty wordy sequences upon you. But combat starts getting pretty dull and repetitive after a while. Most enemies provide little in terms of challenge and just become repetitive time sinks. The occasional boss fight is usually well done but are so few and far between that they don\u2019t make up for having to slog through hoards of pretty uninspired enemies. Despite them having different sprites and varying amounts of health and damage there\u2019s really only two enemies in the game. Those that wander around shooting projectiles and those that charge at you. Which get pretty boring after a while.\n\nAnd then sadly, there are the bugs. There\u2019s a few pretty bad ones in the game. Mark, your inventory guy, I think is not supposed to follow you into the afterlife each time you die. If you try to access your inventory while in the afterlife it screws something up as when you come back to the real world you appear off the map. The only way out is to quit the game and relaunch it. There\u2019s also a few points where you will get stuck and nothing can break you out of it. The music track in the museum is horrendously screwed up and is just a loud high pitch screech that made me want to throw my headphones against the wall. I also have issue with the game not remembering my preference for a game-pad, having to select it in the menus each time. And really, who makes the escape button close the game instantly with no confirmation menu?\n\nThe music of the game though is pretty darn good and the graphics for what they are aren\u2019t bad. I even dig the theme that buildings int he world are actually giant living creatures. Heck if this game was released 20 years ago the graphics would be amazing but today they are just mediocre sprites.\n\nIt is clear this is a someone\u2019s self indulgent love fest to games from the early 90\u2032s. While there is some fun to be had and a decent (if not a little cliche) story to be told here the game started to drag for me. I really wanted to finish the game before I wrote a review but in the end the repetitive combat and bugs in the game really started to turn me off. Having killed many a AA battery on my old grey Gameboy brick I\u2019m as nostalgic as anyone for such things but I would only recommend Two Brothers if it were on sale. Also give it a pass if you can\u2019t stand Gameboy quality graphics.\n\nFinal Score:\nGraphics: 5/10\nGame Play: 6/10\nMusic / Ambiance: 8/10\nStory: 8/10\nValue: 5/10\nOverall: 6.4/10\n\nRead more reviews of Indy games on my blog!\nhttp://www.markofithian.com/", "timestamp_updated": 1387359666, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1387190102, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "20434947", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496760", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1419736863, "steamid": "76561197971264410", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "So much potential... but unplayable.", "timestamp_updated": 1452383677, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452383677, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "8582620", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501593", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1388964167, "steamid": "76561198009517210", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A fantastic tribute to 90s action-adventure games with an imaginitive story and intriguing game mechanics, this title is nothing less than charming.", "timestamp_updated": 1388964758, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1388964758, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "8034771", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500027", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1423766841, "steamid": "76561198000831226", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Two Brothers is the perfect successor to the games made by Quintet in the 1990's.This game has an absolutely wonderful story, graphics, and music, but is just a tad glitchy at times.

The game feels and plays like a Seiken Densetsu but ditches the tired fantasy setting in favor of a more surreal world. It's hard to assign an existing tag to the world style. I would say that Two Brothers compares most closely to Anodyne or even Zeno Clash in this regard. The presentation contains simple 2D sprites juxtaposed with highly detailed pixel art for large scale creatures. This mixing of styles really left me with a sence of excited uneasiness; that feeling where you are a little disturbed but much more fascinated.\n\nThe combat is, from my brief experience, somewhat shallow and uninspired. It serve it's purpose but otherwise felt like a chore between story points. You have a basic melee combo and a ranged attack. Hitboxes are unpredictable and so every encounter feels like a clumsy struggle to spam melee attacks before the enemy can hit you.\n\nThe story is surprisingly detailed and well crafted. It deals with some interesting themes and can get rather philosophical at times. Quite enjoyable but I won't delve into it too much to avoid spoiling anything. It's just unfortuante that the only way it's conveyed is through a painfully slow, two line text crawl.\n\nThe combat on it's own would not be enough to drag Two Brothers down. Sadly, there is a monumental number of bugs in Two Brothers, a plethora even. These range from innocuous graphical glitches to game breakign bugs that will demand you restart. I was about four hours in and had just finished the first dungeon when I encountered a bug that forced me to reopen the game and then broke sequence such that I could no longer progress. Sadly to say I don't believe I will be able to risk losing another four hours or more to a bug. It is for this reason alone that I cannot reccomend this game is it currently exists. I would be more fogiving if this was early access or beta or something, but this is a shipped product and it is not at all ready.\n\nIt's truly a shame. Two Brothers is clearly lovingly created by a team with a great vision. Unfortunately, until the nuts and bolts are not solid enough to properly present this vision.

The sound played further. So I waited...but nothing happened. After restarting the game, I was put into the beginning area. No way to play any further. This is a NO-GO for RPGs.
