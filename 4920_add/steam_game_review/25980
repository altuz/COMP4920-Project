So start again and see if RNG is kind to you; it sadly gets pretty boring after a while. \n\nI'm only guessing this but the game seems to have been messed around by someone and its pretty obvious its been done too. The finest example is that whenever the ingame cinematics are going on the ingame you were just playing is not paused and the old advisor guy is waffling on; if you take the time to watch the cinematics and read/listen to the advisor you can come back to find your fledgeling kingdom in ruins and unable to recover.........\n\nThe game now is little more than a glorified tower defence with wave after wave of monsters. Sure you can if you try hard enough with enough RNG and luck on your side beat every map but really why would you want to put yourself through it? It is so unbalanced its laughable......the game at the start is frustratingly annoying and eventually if you do build a tiny kingdom populated by heroes you are then SO powerful that the end game fight is over in moments.\n\nThe maps themselves are woefully small and the A.I is painfully frustrating at the best of times.\n\nIf you played this the first time around don't buy this and play it again as you will be dissapointed. If you want a game that is going to challenge you with RNG and ultimatly frustrate you then sure go ahead and buy it and enjoy."}]}
