Sometimes the things you have to do are hilariously absurd: you throw your sheep in the air with dynamite, use them as jumping stones, fix the gap in the electric wire with the sheep's body... Don't worry though - no matter what you do to them, your curly heroes will end up just fine.\n\nIn total there are 45 levels plus bonus ones (which you have to unlock first); they are not particularly hard, but if you're stuck, you can use in-game hints. Puzzles have just enough variety to not become repetitive, some of them are pretty creative and, in addition to that, everything is very nicely drawn - the game looks like a picture book for children, and this style suits it well. Besides the main campaign there is a lot to unlock - the game has plenty of hidden items, achievements and a score system for those who like perfecting everything. All in all - for me Home Sheep Home 2 was fun and pleasant experience, so I'd say that, if you like puzzles, this little game is worth your time and money.", "timestamp_updated": 1480185898, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1480185898, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 8}}
