You don't pick your questions, either. Instead, you pick how much each question will be worth, although it's mostly random. It's a much darker and grittier game (literally), with times where it will actively try to mess with you (like disabling all vowels on your keyboard when entering your name), and with a light plot that has multiple endings to chose from.

Yeah, some of the questions are a bit dated (hey, it was made in 1998), but it still fun to play. The classic questions types are back like \"Dis or Dat\" and (to the hosts' dismay) \"Ticklish Testgum\" (Gibberish Questions) along with new ones like \"Roadkill\" and \"Jack BINGO\". \"Roadkill\" is simular to the Jack Attack, but you have to connect two items together instead of finding an item's match. \"BINGO\" has you buzz in when the correct letter of the answer is lit up, simular to Three Way from YDKJ 3. It does add a lot of variety to the game. This game features all the host from previous Jack games and has a small story arc (you'll know what it is by the second time you play). Don't worry, it's still the same game with the randomness and twisted trivia you know and love. Also, screws has been changed and for the better in my opinion. Instead of pressing S once to screw somebody, you have to hit S multiple times to make the question totally unreadable and force your opponents to answer the question, whether it's readable or not. One small thing I want to point out is the music. The electric guitar can really get you pumped to play. Special mentions goes to both versions of the Jack Attack music, by far the most tense music out of all Jack games. The one downside is that this game is very US-centric. So if you do not live in the United States, the jokes and refrences can fly right over your head. This poses a problem since most of the jokes are built into the questions.

Upon starting, a question is posed to the player(s) based around some topic (ranging anywhere from the circus to death).  The only answers available are \"yes\" or \"no\"; the chosen answer will set the tone for the game.  From there on, the player is taken on an elevator ride of sorts, being asked the typical questions by a disembodied female narrator.  A new question asks if the player has gone on \"The Ride\" before; if so, there may be some quirk involved in the naming section (for example, on one of my return games, I was locked into only using vowels to enter my name).  This deliberate change makes for some amusing scenarios.  Gameplay is also different, where players can select the amount of money a question is worth.  A new mini-game called RoadKill has the player(s) finding the shared quality between two ideas/people/etc (e.g., the solution for \"Mini ___\" and \"Bradley ___\" would be Cooper).  After every answer is given, the player(s) are asked what do all the previous answers have in common, proving to be a great test of memory as well as reasoning.  Finally, it ends with the usual round of Jack Attack.  The only difference here from previous games is that the amount a player receives or loses for answers is selected like the questions.
