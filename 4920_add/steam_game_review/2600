I did loads of reviews on RPGs which I have played from Skyrim (first rpg ever for me, I know Im late) to The Witcher 3 ( opinion ), but, I have never did a review on a single RPG Masteriece.\n\nAnd hell it's hard to express all your feeling for a game that you adore, love and formed a small cult your own or go on actively seeking other like minded players, even though t's a single player game.\n\nVampire: TM is a RPG classic which stood the test of time (I wasnt there to witness it, as I only come to this game in 2016. But even at 2017, the loyal player base is considerable), and will be reinstalled many times during many rainy nights for many decades to come. \n\nV:TB gives you the opportunity to roleplay as a newborn vampire in an already established vampre society. However the Final Nights is nigh and the Father vampires are stirringfrom their sleep. Dark, grimmy, disturbed and full of action, full of sexual tension, full of story suspension but also sparks of hope, neon in the black of night and sweets in bowl of bitter-tasted chocolate - these are qualities of the world you will step into when you will buy this game.\n\nYes, you will buy this game. Even though the original developer White Wolf has declared bankrupcy long ago and it's a moddable single player game. You will buy it, regardless, because steam download speed is of immense help when you unevitably reinstall this game 5 years from now, without having to search for a safe Torrent link.\n\nP/S: Oh have I mentioned that V:TB new developer is Paradox Interactive? The same company helps published Mount and Blade Warband? Oh? You dont know what the latter game title is? I suggest you go check it out, I promise you wont be disappointed.\n\nP/S2: Remember to search for community patch and mods on nexus or moddb after you pressed that purchase button. The game is really then completed. 2017 still have people making mods for this game, sigh, timeless."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505089528, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502531", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34873854", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014807154", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1497825605, "num_games_owned": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2204}, "timestamp_updated": 1505089528, "received_for_free": false, "review": "one of the best games ever created. \n\nnothing is shoved in your face and you have a lot of freedom"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505409332, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34952969", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198026562472", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1319958000, "num_games_owned": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3434}, "timestamp_updated": 1505409332, "received_for_free": false, "review": "+ Excellant story\n+Top quality voice work\n+Great RPG mechanics; playing as different clans actually can have a significant impact on your playthrough\n++++Malkavians\n\n-Gameplay itself can feel kinda clunky at times\n-Final 1/4 of the game is by far the weakest part; but to be fair, Troika was collapsing at the time\n-Buggy as hell; you will definitely need to download fan made patches"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506823116, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35360449", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198146357236", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1490039547, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 303}, "timestamp_updated": 1506823116, "received_for_free": false, "review": "You can be a insane man with vampire powers.

Bugs, shuddering frame rate, one glitch which straight freezes you in place during dialogue. Weird design sometimes just seems built to piss you off, and it's not clear what the hell you're meant to be doing. Balancing issues can make the game virtually impossible to complete if you put your points in the wrong stats and abilities.  So if you specced into guns and wasted your ammo wandering in circles in a confusing bit of map and you run into a boss fight at the end of it, you get to eat shit. And don't throw all your points into seduction unless you think you can screw the final boss to death. Awkwardly despite giving us the option to role play and build the character our way, there's some sections and bosses which just can't be beaten without combat. \n\nI ended up using console cheats to finish one of the final bosses because of this combat stuff. In other sections I had to use walkthroughs or guides just to keep up a decent pace and even with them it was hard to make sense of one of the later levels. Yeah it's cheating it's their fault for making this so confusing.\n\nBUT - What the game lacks in its old, weird, broken design it makes up for in making a world that feels beautifully immersive and complex. The world FEELS huge even though there's only a tiny bit of playable map in each region. It feels as though you if you left that map you could just continue on forever in this massive universe the writers have built. The writing is great too, and every npc seems to have an angle, an opinion, a selfish ulterior motive. Every character will have another character either built them up or criticize them, and all of it strained through the filter of their subjective view of their second life. Every line of dialogue has something funny, interesting, or worth reading and decisions have consequences on who lives and dies and what this means for your waning humanity.\n\nSo yeah, took me 43 hours (At least 3 of it spent in the fucking final boss level) to play through with one character but I know I'm going to return to this, so in the end I think I would recommend it. One of the top games I've ever played."}, {"votes_down": 16, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505608201, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472603", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "35010445", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261545544", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505266742, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 56}, "timestamp_updated": 1505608201, "received_for_free": false, "review": "played for about an hour and decided it may have been a good game once, but it did not age well"}]}
