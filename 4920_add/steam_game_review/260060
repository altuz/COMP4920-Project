Speaking of that, the very name of the final round is different from previous entries; here it is Headrush, whereas before and after it is Jack Attack.  Despite having a unique title, it does not focus on a particular area of interest.  The most that can be said regarding its theme is that it might be geared toward a more teenaged audience, complete with animated segues between questions.  Overall, this could be called the black sheep of the general YDKJ games.
