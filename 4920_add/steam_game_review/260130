While I think a lot of its streamlining is in theory moving in the right direction, the actual pacing problem hasn't been addressed very well at all. It's not a bad game, and I think that you again get quite a lot of gameplay for your money here, but I'd caution any prospective buyer to consider if that's really what they're looking for. It's not quite the game that the first Agarest was, so I'd recommend that one first, and after that, if you truly want more, you'll likely enjoy what Zero has to offer.", "timestamp_updated": 1501599252, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499786561, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 140, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 48, "total_reviews": 188}}
