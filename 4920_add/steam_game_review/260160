Game is about Koru, a Monkey who was one day just trying to win a race, and landed up down the road causing the apocalypse of colors.  You are set on a journey to restore the colors, and restore peace to the land, as you battle white and grey monsters with the power of color.  It's a cool concept, and a lot of fun!   At times, the camera can be a little clunky, causing loading issues, but the game runs really good for the most part. Sometimes the story can feel a little bit like cardboard, but it's not a big deal, because where it lacks, it still comes back into.  There's not much voice acting, besides the intro. The characters make funny sounds to talk in their dialogue bubbles.    I got this on sale, and it's well worth it. It's well produced, and fun to play, and worth your time if you love a good action/adventure game.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_updated": 1498848756, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498848756, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "32118297", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1496416835, "steamid": "76561198061753171", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's a pretty good game, but the tags are false.\nThis isn't a platformer.\nNobody calls the Assassin's Creed games a platformer either.\nThe lack of a jump buttons feels odd.\nThat said ...\n\nIt is still a fun relaxing game.
