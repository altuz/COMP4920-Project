Can you think of any besides Jet Set Radio? Well whatever the case you have to admit that this kind of game really unique in that feature.\n\nMarc Ecko's Getting Up is a game primarily made by a guy who said gamers should get up off their butts and buy his games, where you play as a 20-something year old male named Trane who wants to tag his name everywhere across the city just for the sake of getting his name up. All while he is doing this he faces a dangerous graffiti gang called the Vandals of New Radius and an opressive regime of \"peace-keepers\" called the CCK which is lead by the government to stop vandalism and defacement of property to build a better and clean way of life in the city of New Radius.\n\nSounds cool right? Fighting your way to become the best graff writer in town while dealing with not only a rival graff gang but the government itself sounds like an alright idea yeah? How could they possibly make this a frustrating game with so many flaws it can't even really be called a gem? Well... they managed to somehow make it that way.\n\nSee Trane moves like a 20 year old noodle with the brains of a 2 year old, he really is unlikable due to being so rowdy to control. The graffiti system is awkward to use and if you're playing with a mouse then the controls will really start to mess with you. The story is good at best and mildly interesting somewhere in the half-way point but at the end it leaves you hanging with what the f**k happened and what will happen leaving you confused at the end searching for possible answers. There are some objectives and levels that are just extremely frustrating to do and just aren't that much fun. While I'm on the topic of frustration here the later missions are f**king ridiculous in how hard they are, and also aren't that much fun since you have to focus all of your inner brain power to get past them. This port is also terrible and it is probably the worst port for the PC I have seen. There's also a whole bunch of other cons that destroy the game's likeness, overall not being that much fun in the long run.\n\nBut for some unearthly reason I still love it goddamnit. It is likely due to nostalgia from playing it on the PS2 long ago but for some reason it is still fun to play when I feel like playing it, and a lot of the missions are really fun to go through, especially the first few levels and a few ones at the end, and for being a graffiti game in a genre that's not really explored especially nowadays it is pretty decent when you get down to it. The hip-hop soundtrack is simply incredible and really fits the theme of the game perfectly (RJD2 is in this for you hip-hop fans). The cheat codes are also really cool and are just a little extra treat when you might've finished the game.\n\nIf I had a thumbs in the middle then I would click it, but since there isn't I'm going to have to reccomend it. Pick this up on a sale try not to bother with full payment since it might not be worth it, and if you do happen to have a console then PLAY IT ON THAT INSTEAD, since this PC port is really bad and full of technical issues. If you don't have a console, no worries, just find one of the many guides in the community on how to play with an Xbox controller.", "timestamp_updated": 1505376208, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505375979, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35014037", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504567755, "steamid": "76561198391416236", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "really great game loved it since my childhood 10/10 would buy 100 times again", "timestamp_updated": 1505622997, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505622997, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35311089", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499639888, "steamid": "76561197960442014", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of my childhood games, I lost my copy long time ago so I'm really glad to see it on Steam, brings me back memories of being 8-9 years old :)\n\nSeems to work fine on Windows 10 for me.", "timestamp_updated": 1506716439, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506716409, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 151, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 26, "total_reviews": 177}}
