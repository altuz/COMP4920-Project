I just finished playing it and I'm still crying. When I first saw this game I got it for very cheap on a sale and looked at the reviews. I hadn't played many story games before but this looked interesting. I loved everything about it: the story, the artstyle, the characters. and the gameplay was great. The reviews were all great and many people said they ended it in tears. I was like ya sure whatever but here I am in tears at my computer. I don't cry very often at all. This was the first time in a long time.

Many people only care about how many zombies they can fit on screen for them to shoot at, and I mean thats fine if in to that but games like Valient Hearts really show what people with lots of passion and detication can really do. This game is incredible, can it be a bit boring sometimes, yes. Can it be a bit tedious, yes. But the characters, the story and the emotion that this game presents is unlike any other. I think everyone should play Valient Hearts, becuase then people can realize that these are the games that make gaming great. This game along with Beyond Good and Evil and Rayman Legends are the best games Ubisoft has, and that is becuase of one reason, becuase the people making them care enough to try and make it the best they can. Their aren't enough games like this than can make even the hard skinned of people cry, but this game defied all of my expectation. I guess this is more of a commentary on the state of big AAA games than a review, but I feel like it is important for people on the edge of buying this game to understand why this game is incredible and important to the gaming world.\n\n10/10\n\nP.S.
