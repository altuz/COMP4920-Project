That being said, this game suffers from extreme difficulty spikes that require multiple deaths just to figure out the correct pattern. With sparsely placed checkpoints that make this even more frustrating. The story seems uninspired (Underworld ripoff), meaning that you have an angry supernatural female protagonist who is out for blood and revenge. It is a game thats able to present a fun challenge in one stage and then rip that fun right out of your hands in another. No matter how often I come back to this game, I just can't seem to find enjoyment. If you do want to try this game out, I HIGHLY recommend you get it on sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1493782344, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493782344, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32743750", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498338438, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_games_owned": 4956, "num_reviews": 1973, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Tags: Platformer\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Audiovisually pleasant platformer with uneven difficulty, dragged out levels and clunky special ability swap user interface\n\nReview: Blood of the werewolf has you swap between a human protag that shoots the bow, and a wolf that can do dash attacks and charge up in idle time to do a bite, or otherwise claw at people. The wolf is slow and has a large hitbox and being forced to play with him is a chore. Levels can last upwards of 10 minutes and offer present you with the same type of ladder and small platform with foes that shoot at you and crows flying around over and over again. Game is pretty forgiving and instead of giving you insta death pitfalls allow you to fall in water and lose health over time. But then changes pace completely by adding difficult boss battles with the wolf, or adds very tight insta-death section with little to no margins. The sigil collection mechanic seemed rather pointless fillter. Having to access a separate menu RPG style to see and change special abilities felt rather clunky to operate with the gamepad and I would have simply preferred they mapped a quick cycle on one of the buttons to change combat styles, perhaps with a different art for each so that they can be quickly identified. Since the levels are dragged out so long, you get quickly tired of seeing the same environment assets and same foes constantly and not enough variety is introduced. You cannot swap from werewolf to human at will. The checkpoint system at least was somewhat generous enough not to force you to replay too many sections you have already completed.\n\nConclusion: This game looks, sounds,  and mostly feels like a pleasant werewolf themed platformer game but the experience leaves you feeling more than a bit frustrated and underwhelmed. Especially when the game suddenly goes from boring slog through to dying over and over again on one small section.", "timestamp_updated": 1505086729, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498338774, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31830198", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471242", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1407677091, "steamid": "76561198077624382", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 198, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fuck the platforming mechanics on this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1495145151, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495145151, "votes_down": 11}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 133, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 93, "total_reviews": 226}}
