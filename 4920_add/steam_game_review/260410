With this, and the second shotgun upgrade, the game starts to get a bit more rewarding (with 2500+ orbs per game easily achievable), but it takes a little time to pick up a good pace.\n\nOther than that, the little things that add interest: enemies that get progressively stronger, three useful \"helpers\" (especially the pushing wave that repels all aliens to the back, very handy if in a bind), the upgrades for your weapons and defences, but let's face it: the action is quite repetitive and in the end, the enemy patterns are quite too easy to get used to. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a little free-to-play game to let off some steam (ala Iron Snout), you may still give it a try. After all, an average free-to-play game may still stand a little better than a badly-made pay-to-play game, don't you think?", "timestamp_updated": 1485212345, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485212345, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "30024596", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505024", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505107910, "steamid": "76561198281484746", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Fun little guilty pleasure you can have when you have nothing better to do.\n\nThink of it as a modern good looking version of Space Invaders.\n\nGame play is pretty much the same.
