For that I warn folks who have issues to be careful speaking up. Seems this Dev likes their dirty tricks when they don't want their filthy laundry aired out.\n\n\nThis is my final review edit. After enough time with four kings, I have decided they have completely lost touch with the fanbase who supported them from day one. Just as they did on playstion home for six long years.\n\nIm going to be honest here, I'm not liking the way things are going. I thought after they had their time with playstation home, we'd see changes that showed they learned their lesson last time from customer feedback. \n\nI remember a time when DL had a casino on ps home, it was an avitar social world with literally hundreds of mini games and places to chat and play. Game themed rooms and more. They also had a casino there and they did the same thing with chips there. The games there were PLAUGED with bugs and cheaters, very little was done. However they had no issue releasing an apartment for over 50 dollars that came with the same games you already had access to in their casino and they REFUSED to change the pricing even with such negative feedback. Oh and might I add, the people who were stupid enough to buy it lost those items anyway when ps home closed it's doors this past march.\n\nPeople lost thousands of chips with no rembursement, and the tournaments were a joke. You had to pay 4.99 for a tournament bracelet with no guarantee of any reward. Just a pat on the back for those who didnt make the cut, while they pocketed their real money.\n\n\nI was much happier with this game during EA. Now? Theyre making the game completely un fun by catering to the new players they want to spend money. Bingo nerfs are beyond terrible.\n\nIm now seated at a progressive game with over 25 players. The pot would usually be over 100k. It isn't even breaking 40k right now...and rp payouts are the same as the main floor games.\n\nThe people who bought in during early access are being pushed away to cater to the casual player with a spending problem. \n\nI have taken a break from four kings and returned today to see if the nerfs were truly as bad as they say, I'm unhappy to report they are far worse than what players are complaining about. I remember sitting at bingo for hours, and not having this back of luck either. One could say it comes and it goes, but this is just ridiculous. \n\nI was quick to respond to a gent who made a post on how this game is not only exploiting potential gambling addicts, but nothing more than a cash grab. I really would like to recall that person's username, so I can apologize and say they might be right.\n\nBecause the players who bought into this game and made is possible for it to even make it out of early access are being disregarded. If this is what developers plan to do to people who buy into their games in order to support a title, I am swearing off EA games entirely. Because this seems to be a NASTY habit with devs on here.

If  like me you were looking for a fun  way to pretend to  gamble then  do not buy this game because once out of Early Access it could end up costing you a lot of money if you continue to play the game.  During Early Access you can earn small amounts of chips  (usually  25 chips at a time) for doing   several things like visiting certain area's of the casino, plus you can earn the same number of  chips  for every 15 minutes you spend in game.  When you  enter the Casino after purchasing the game you  are given 1000 chips.  \n\nMy first love is  slots, so  I casually ran over to the slots and   after 10 spins  I'd spent  virtually all of my chips.   Thankfully, during the  Early Acess phase you can get more chips for   very little money; i.e.  there are several selections ranging from 500 chips to 40 000 chips each one of which  costs you $0.01 to purchase. This amount is deducted from your Steam wallet.   Once early access is over these will undoubtably change and cost much more.  Sadly, like any gambling den, the odds are always stacked against you.  \n\nAfter the 10 turns on the  slots, with virtually no chips left  and not wanting to wait around for  almost an hour before I could get  a couple  more spins, I left, then rejoined the following day because I was under the impression that during Early Access we would be given   1000 chips every  day, but this was not the case (I purchased the  basic game plus the cheaper of the dlc's, (costing me a total of just over \u00a316).  \n\nI don't know whether   you can or will be able to convert  any winnings  to  real money, but even if you were, it's only a  lucky few that would ever manage to get any real money back.\n\nPersonally I'm really disappointed with this game.  I was  hoping to be able to play a wide range of different slot machines,  but there was little  variety to be found, plus until I decided to buy the  highest  slection of chips I only had enough for two spins and  four goes on the roulette table (which has a minimum bet of 10 chips). \n\nPart way through my second visit there was a server reboot.  I was given literally a  minute's warning in which I was asked to log off.  As I was part way through a gamble  when this occured I wasn't    pleased. \n\nDespite it being in Early Access, so by definition  not a completed game, I can't recommend this game to anyone but   hardened gamblers.", "timestamp_updated": 1424389425, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "11", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424389149, "votes_down": 28}, {"recommendationid": "16111131", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508022", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500875895, "steamid": "76561197984153805", "num_games_owned": 915, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "This game is probably one of the easiest games I've found to just hop on for an hour or so a day and just have some fun.\nThe game is fairly well optimised after one of the latest patches, the game is now most certainly where it needs to be in terms of performace. \n\nThe gameplay is so reliable and enjoyable, the only downside as many have said is the slots. Slots is the easiest game to sink money and time into and the current machine is rather lackluster. I'm aware a new machine is on it's way and that's what I'm most excited for.\n\nThere is some issues with the games UI still and quite a few issues regarding the VIP system and everything relating that is rather confusing and not very well explained.\n\nThe customisation of the characters is very strong and enjoyable, there is a lot of options regarding your style and the currency to buy items is a little hard to get however it's very rewarding when you finally get the item you have wanted.\n\n\nMy biggest gripe is the VIP system and that is runs on a server based clock and if you manage to get VIP one day before the end of the month you get it for only that one day, then when the reset rolls around it clocks you back to normal status. \nEven if you purchased one of the dlc packs for a month of VIP it resets you to normal status when the monthly reset happens - so if you purchase it at a bad time you could only get 5 days of VIP or however long untill the month changes.\n\nThis is a game I have been waiting for, and for a very long time. I am so glad it has finally come and it is so enjoyable. The updates are frequent however often not many new features as there is a lot of work to be done on the backend of the game and the new games etc take a very long time to produce. \nThe payouts are balance, the game is fun, and the servers are fast.\n\nA great game in my opinion and I'm glad I bought into the beta before it went F2P because I got so much out of it.

There's blackjack, single-deck 21, craps, keno, hold 'em poker, roulette, PuntoBanco/Baccarat, slot machines and some kind of \"Wheel of fortune\".
