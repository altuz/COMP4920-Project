Going through the game Filo and his many \"Me's\" often make jokes about 'saving the princess', 'getting the thing on the floor because you will need it later' and many other similar jokes. The concept of having many replications of yourself and completing puzzles with them definitely made the game more interesting to play.\n\nThere are 3 unique forms of travel in So Many Me (apart from on foot) which are by Jellophant (Tank), Jellosaur (Dinosaur), Balloonbird (Bird). The forms of travel allow you to travel on spikes and destroy EVERYTHING, destroy vertical walls and jump higher and fly and destroy horizontal walls respectively. \n\nObviously you have a Story which you can play and complete. Within this story are many costumes and coins which you can get through extra effort to eventually fully complete the game.\n\nLike many other reviews, the only important downside is the Bosses. The bosses themselves are not too hard but there are hardly any checkpoints in these battles so you have to memorise the landscape and the movements of the boss. \n\nPersonally I had trouble with one section of the game.\n[spoiler] After the Final Boss (The guy you meet at the beginning) there is an escape part of the level. The path of this section isn't too difficult but the meteors sometimes hit you at the ONLY moments where you either dodge and fall off the map or jump off the platforms into spikes. The best part of all this is that there are NO checkpoints. [/spoiler]\n\nIf anybody wants to know, I got all achievements in 10 hours and 36 minutes which involves the main story, extra missions (Chrono Castle) and all collectables.\n\nI know it says 11 hours on my profile.
