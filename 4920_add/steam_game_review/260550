The production is excellent. The visuals and voice acting are really high quality. The puzzle design is good at first: it is logically sound and the basic interface means you won't get stuck for long. \n\nHowever the puzzle quality diminishes through the game.

It's a straightforward linear adventure game with an interesting (if somewhat predictable) story, though it suffers from the \"combine random objects to solve random puzzles\" style of puzzle solving that is common to older adventure games.\n\n[h1]Detailed review:[/h1]\nHaunted is a light-hearted and fun adventure game, good for a casual day of playing. It was originally released in 2012, so the graphics and gameplay are somewhat dated but I think the art style has aged well. However, while the idea of using ghosts with particular talents to help solve puzzles is an interesting one, the puzzles themselves are generally best solved not through critical thinking, but rather gathering up everything in the area, seeing what can be combined, then trying everything until it works. The \"puzzle hints\" were supposed to help with this, but the few times I tried them they were so basic (\"you need to use what's around you\"; \"you need to use the window as a ladder\" type of things) that I ended up turing them off because I kept accidentally clicking them when trying to move around. \n\nSpeaking of accidental clicking, the camera angles are fixed and so movement is incredibly frustrating in some areas. I was surpised that movement was forced through the mouse instead of being able to be manually controlled through the keyboard, as static 3D camera games don't really lend themselves to click-based movement. If the devs are going to add any future patches (I believe someone else wanted controller support, which I think would work well with the game), I really do think they should add keyboard movement.\n\nI was also disappointed that a game that featured a female protagonist trying to save her sister and a female villain lacked any other female characters in significant supporting roles. ALL of the ghosts, except for one you meet at the very end, were men and only two out of the about seven supporting human cast were women. I was also disappointed, though not surprised, that while the male ghosts got a bunch of different body shapes the one female ghost was a Jessica Rabbit-style exaggerated sexy cartoon character. It felt to me like a huge missed opportunity, to be honest.\n\nIn any case, overall I think that Haunted is a game worth playing for people who enjoy adventure games. My general rule for games is that $1 (or, in my case, 100 yen) should be around 1 hour of gameplay, so I found the non-sale pricetag to be a bit steep for a game that--from start to finish, including the bonus chapter at the end--is not going to yield more than 7 hours of gameplay. However, I would definitely recommend picking this up when it's on sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1438486418, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438486418, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "21267037", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.995006", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1455681710, "steamid": "76561198026287541", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Utterly Delightful!
