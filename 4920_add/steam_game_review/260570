It isn\u2019t, and it is a good thing: Gray Matter is its own game with its own merits. Despite its troubled development, it is one solid title: the story is the game\u2019s strong suit, as expected. The characters are likable and with their own motivations and despite getting close to stereotypes, they manage to avoid it. The background are a little on the static side, but they are gorgeous and do have bits of animation here and there. The music, composed by Robert Holmes as usual (Jane\u2019s husband by the way) is moody and quiet, and there are some lovely pieces like David\u2019s theme that are just a delight. The game isn\u2019t without flaws, but again even the oh-so-great Gabriel Knight games were: sometimes the story comes to a halt and you need to have the initiative; the magic interface is completely unnecessary and there aren\u2019t even animated; and the Daedalus Club area is a pain to navigate. Other than that, all puzzles aren\u2019t too absurd to figure out.\n\ntd;dr: great story, fun game. shower fanservice.", "timestamp_updated": 1496936079, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496936079, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "32900293", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516693", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498609403, "steamid": "76561198053207163", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Lovely third person pont and click!\nThe magician  tricks are very characteristic and fun to play", "timestamp_updated": 1498609557, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498609557, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "31531919", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501898", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1493847836, "steamid": "76561198000126326", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's a shame that Steam reviews operate on an up/down system, because my opinion of this game is rather mixed.\n\nOn the one hand, it's very clunky. The protagonist controls like a tank, very stiffly and awkwardly. If you've played any early 3D adventure games you'll know what I'm talking about. The animations don't always line up and aren't quite all there. The game lacks polish, to put it frankly. Which is fair for something so clearly on a tight budget. The cinematics, while visually striking, also cut a lot of corners, and it's not always clear what's being depicted on screen.\n\nThe game does not make for a strong first impression. However, I started to fall in love with the game at chapter 3. While Samantha Everett is the \"main character\", it's David Styles who steals the show.  I don't want to give away too much, but I found his character and backstory to be very compelling, and I loved the way the game executed all of it. HOWEVER (again), the game fails to wrap up the story in an entirely satisfactory way. Which again may be to a tight budget, but it left me feeling a bit empty.\n\nOverall, Gray Matter is a nice little adventure game that's rough around the edges, but has likeable characters and a somewhat compelling plot (if you can make it to chapter 3).

Most of them are interact-able with your mouse. Click on them and your player character will either talk to him/her, make a remark about the object(s),pick it up, push it, or do some other interacting animations to it. To get a better understanding of the game mechanism one could  go and watch the youtube gameplay video of this type of game.\n\nGray Matter is a nice game. I completed it in less than 14 hours(with 1 or 2 hours spent hunting for bonus). It has a great feature that lets you open a screen to check you game progress so you will always have a clue about what to do next (more or less). The cutscenes of this game is not very good though. Looked like some kind of slide show made with ms power-point. The story was about a science experiment that were conducted by an oxford university neurobiology professor who lost his wife in a tragic car accident, with a group of students including a young female magician wannabe(protagonist) working as his assistant. \n\nIf you played any broken sword games before(the 3D ones), then I am sure you will like this game.

This game has a good, solid story and decent graphics. The backgrounds are amazing and the character designs are pretty good. I mostly feel bad because this could be a really good game with better presentation and coding, even a decent movie with a good screenwriter and director.\n\nMost of my beef stems from the fact that the narrtive of the game is hard to follow in the beginning. Its easy to get stuck but at least the map screen shows you if there are still things to complete in each area. I feel like I may have missed some things in the story because I didn't get all the bonus points. It would help if there were achievements for completing the bonus parts, expecially if they added to the story and made things more cohesive. The music and voice acting are decent. The music gets a bit repetitive after a few hours and the voice acting is pretty steriotypical.\n\nI enjoyed the story quite a bit and the last few chapters got pretty good, but it felt like a slog often times before I got far enough to get really interested in the story. So if you really love adventure games like I do, then you can probably overlook this games flaws enough to enjoy it. Maybe there will be an aniversary re-release in the future where they tweak it into an amazing game.\n\n6/10", "timestamp_updated": 1495610112, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495610112, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "31362592", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488604", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1493140585, "steamid": "76561198326946816", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I was hesitant to try a game like this, but felt the low price would make it worth the effort.
