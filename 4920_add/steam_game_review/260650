Well, it's cheap, and it's a spy-story stealth game. You can pass without killing, by fabricating your own devices like rubber bullets, silencers and ether mines from a junk and using cool x-ray camera to look behind, well, almost everything.

It felt like I was interacting in a cheesy spy novel, and it did a good job at it. Well, this is a third person stealth/action shooter. The first six to eight levels are more stealth oriented, but once the Russion Special Forces, (spetsnaz) are sent after you, you can pretty much kiss stealth goodbye. It's all shooting from there. It implements a system where you can collect gadgets lying around like rags, alarm clocks, plastic bottles, cans, chemicles, ect. and McGyver them into cheep tools for temporary use. For example, you can use a plastic bottle and rag at the end of your barrel for a cheep, disposible silencer. You can also make explosives, paralyzing chemicle agents, and other completely implausible but fun innovations. But not to worry. It is a very easy system to pick up with very little learning curve. The story is told through a series of comic book-like cutsceens between missions with corny, voice-acted Russian accents that, (in my opinion) adds a lot of charm to this game. I found myself drawn into it and empathizing with the characters. Also I loved the ending! This game is cheep, the controls are very good, the graphics are great for 2005, there is a quicksave system as opposed to a checkpoint saving system, and I ask you: what other game allows you to have a shootout inside of Lenin's tomb? This game has a lot of atmopshere and I highly recommend it. Honestly, if there is anything even remotely negative I can think to say about it, it is that the character moves kind of slow, and has a lot of wide open ground to cover. The sprint system only works for a few moments before your character gets tired and has to rest, so traveling while sprinting isn't too much faster in the long run than walking. Traveling from one side of a map to another can be a bit tedious. But this is a very minor complaint.

It is some kind of 3rd person view No One Lives Forever with hand-made gadgets which starring a journalist. It was really good first. I even planned to recommend it to you, but then, i got bored because of some problems and changed my mind. There are some summarized pros. and cons. below:\n\n[h1] Pros\t [/h1]\n+ Story is interesting enough\n+ Graphics are already outdated but it isn't ugly at all.\n+ Some unique attractions like gadget crafting and X-Ray camera\n\n[h1] Neutral\t [/h1] No widescreen support. Control scheme a little bit weird and dull, but somewhat useful as well. Especially setting your walking speed with mouse wheel is a good idea. Music is OK but repetitive.\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n- Stealth is a little bit dull. You can't do so much actions for best stealth results. Furthermore, at the last half of the game, say goodbye to stealth.\n- Characters you control can't run. They pretend to do so but they seems like they are taking a stroll on the park. Any NPC runs well though.\n- Aiming is bad. You can't change shoulders while aiming, so, time by time you can't see the target properly.\n- You're playing on same locations over and over again.\n- Planting gadgets like mines is deceptive. You have to stop the desired plant location first, then you have to highlight the gadget on the menu and left click to insta-plant.\n- Background sound effects are annoying.\n- A frustrating bug on Meltdown level ( spoiler: [spoiler] When you try to stop meltdown in Chernobyl, you have to press two buttons and start the crane, right? Be careful, you have to use these buttons first or else... you can't use crane again. That means you need to restart the level. [/spoiler] )\n\nAfter all, it worth for $1,25 but don't expect too much. Especially after the last half, quality of the game started to decrease in my humble opinion.\n\np.s. written in 26 August 2014\nedited for new formatting options only (blue texts)", "timestamp_updated": 1414885609, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1409012612, "votes_down": 16}, {"recommendationid": "13380896", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527395", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1418657915, "steamid": "76561198086061585", "num_games_owned": 1833, "num_reviews": 163, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First, don't mind my record times.

My initial impression was mostly correct, this is essentially a low-budget version of splinter cell, but it is done well and if you enjoy stealth games you will probably like this.\n\nThe stealth is handled well, you have a visibility meter which shows how visible you are, and you have 4 movement speeds.  The slowest movement speed moves very slow(obv) but the enemies cannot hear you even if you are right behind them and as you increase in speed the enemies will be able to hear you from farther and farther away.  Movement is easily toggled and as you learn the correct distances to which an enemy can hear you, quickly toggling your speed becomes second nature.\n\nYou also are kind of a MacGyver, you find junk lying around(cans, plastic bottles, etc etc) and you can use this junk to craft al manner of items which make being stealthy easier and easier.  You unlock blueprints as they game goes on and once you unlock a print you can craft that item if you have the proper junk for it, is is all easily done and very intuititve.  The gadgets overall are very cool, you can make a slingshot and craft all manner of silent ammo for it, you can lay traps for enemies(both quiet and non-lethal to loud and boomy) and you can even create luring devices that will make your enemies plod right into your mine, provided you lay the trap in a dark place.  If you drop a mine in the light the enemies will see it and disarm it.\n\nYou also get an x-ray camera weapon which is beyond cool, it lets you see through walls and locate enemies before they can see you, and it even damages enemies through walls, although ammo is limited for it, it is very cool to be able to just blast enemies silently through a wall.\n\nThere are only 2 guns in the game, the pistol and an ak-47.  The vast majority of the game is stealth but there are a few run n gun sections, and luckily the gunplay handles well enough, although it is easy to bait the enemies into choke points and just blast them as they walk through.  \n\nThe story is good, and rather lengthy, the game took me about 11-12 hours to complete and there are several twists and turns as the story progresses, it is entertaining and mostly well done.  There is also a save anywhere function which comes in handy, just be warned the game only auto saves at the start of levels so make sure you use the save system because the missions are generally pretty lengthy.\n\nAt a sale price of $1.24 this game was a steal, but even at the full price of 5 dollars you are getting your moneys worth.

The models are very human like, and have a lot of personality.\n- AI is very smart. No aimlessly running into things. They seek cover, or seek you and attack. \n\n-Hard core reaslism! No standing there as they riddle you with round after round. If you get shot, YOU  GET SHOT! Stealth is the key.\n\n-Guns are very realistic too. None of this \"snipe with my handgun crap lilke in splintercel. Tou need to be really close to use a handgun, just like in real life. Stealth is the key to this game.\n\n-Levels are very well made. Trees are animates. Lights and ambient sounds are all there.\n\n- Great post processing for 2005! You get a MSAA like AA in this game by default! very nice looking atmosphere.\n\nCONS:\n\n it is from 2005, Yes you will need to play it in 4:3 aspect ratio, but it has so much character you will not care\n\nThis is not some crappy console port, expect to play with your full keyboard. Xbox and other controller ,Controls can be used but Mouse and Keyboard are essential in the few times you need to make snap shots.\n\nConclusion:\n\n10/10, For a 2005 game, and a \"GIVEAWAY\" pricetag in the steam summer sale, I say this is a MUST buy!
