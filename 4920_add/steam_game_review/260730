Time passed... I've decided to re-buy the game on Steam and give it a try... oh boy...\n\n... as much as I love the game itself, its story, graphics, sounds, music, dialogues, everything... I just can't recommend the Steam version to anyone, who has Windows 7 or newer. The game just won't run. And if it will, it will hang and crash in more eager way, than bumper cars in amusement park. On my Win7 x64 I've tried literally everything from this topic http://steamcommunity.com/app/260730/discussions/0/540737262306815107/ or https://www.gog.com/forum/desperados_series/possible_solution_to_crashes_maybe/post7 - and even more than that, used all of my knowledge, few other solutions served by Google - whatever I would do, the application randomly exits to desktop with \"game.exe stopped working\" message. Nothing helps; I've been able to finish first tutorial mission without too many issues, but second one just won't let me pass through. Crash, crash, crash.\n\nI'm very sad to post a negative review about this title, but... it's just unplayable for me. Again, Desperados is great, but there is something wrong with Steam version, or modern computers are just too modern to handle the awesomeness of early 2000's.", "timestamp_updated": 1501289357, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "6", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501200582, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "33545923", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510358", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500069793, "steamid": "76561197970624397", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Still a great game.
