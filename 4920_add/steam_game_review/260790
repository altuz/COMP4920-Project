The unfair feeling of being surprised by a situation for which the only success comes from having to fail a few times, no matter how good you are at the game.  I was ok with these because the game doesn't waste your time on the respawn, and I found the timings fun to hone, and fun to figure out, but your mileage may vary.  \n\nThe multiplayer is some of the most polished, wholly mean competitive couch gaming I've experienced.
