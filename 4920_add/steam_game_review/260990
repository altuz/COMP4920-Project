No DAW, as far as I know, provides you with so many building blocks for creating a quick tune. That's not the role of DAW anyway.\nWhat Odesi gives you really is this, hundreds (thousands?) of MIDI patterns that you can mix, match and edit, while making sure evrything stays coherent and in-scale. \nNos I understand \"purists\" might dismiss this as \"cheating\", but this also is kind of ridiculous. What you learn in music school is exactly this: learning lots of scales, patterns, how to make then fit together and sound good. And, yes, also how to break the rules when you have mastered them well enough.\nOdesi helps you skip the tedious learning by putting all this at your fingertips. And, yes, it does let you take things in your hands and modify notes yourself to break the rules and add your personality.\nLast but not least, the tutorial videos are great, simple, and useful, they make you want to jump in the software and start playing.\nIf you like playing around with making music but don't have the technical baggage of years of music school, this really is perfect. And if you do have the years of school, this tool will just make it easier and quicker to apply your knowledge.", "timestamp_updated": 1498542454, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "12", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498542454, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31748277", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507728", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503764073, "steamid": "76561198115626981", "num_games_owned": 608, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a very cool piece of software, I use it to create music for game development, and despite being someone who is not very musical I have been able to create some very nice music with ease.\n\nThe devs are also very responsive to feedback.
