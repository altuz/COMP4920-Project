Back then this was easilly my favorite game, although nostalgia goggles can skew your memory considerably i feel this game holds up excedingly well in 2017. Though the main campaign is much shorter than i remember there are plenty of things to keep you sidetracked for a long time. Every side mission that you do helps you to increase your stats which i feel is an amazing touch. Sadly if you choose to rush through the campaign you will be done in around 5 hours so i highly recomend doing the side missions whenever possible to get the most out of this game. Despite how amazing the meat of the game is i dont find that its worth $20.00 but if you ever happen to find this game on sale like i did i could not recomend buying it enough.  7/10"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505578519, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35000961", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198208494829", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505578125, "num_games_owned": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 388}, "timestamp_updated": 1505578519, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is the one of the best western games which I played!\n+ Good story\n- The game is so expensive (15 \u20ac or 4 \u20ac)\n- I played 6 hours in this game!"}]}
