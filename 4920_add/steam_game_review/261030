The game kind of holds your hand and tells you its going to go either this way or that way and you cant do it any other way. I ran across several characters that I would have loved to kill but I did not have that option. Its kind of masked into making you feel like your changing the story but your really not...It just feels like a long movie that allows you to make mundane choices with that really dont matter much...Maybe their were several choices that were cool but they were very minor...\n\nIf your a fan of the comics or of the show , maybe you will enjoy it, but I can say im a fan of the show and it felt more like a drag then enjoyment. I think it just does not give you enough freedom to change the story the way you want and I guess its hard to create a game in that sense because it would need a lot of different outcomes to work.\n\nFor $10-$15 I say its 100% worth it.
