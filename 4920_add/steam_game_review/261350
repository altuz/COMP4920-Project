Basically, the you build the city to actually provide a home base for your adventuring and support your team, it's not designed as a money sink.  \n\nIn fact, there are no coercive monetization tactics employed at all - the only stuff you can buy is cosmetic.  This is extremely refreshing in today's game landscape, especially in this genre.  The developers are seriously committed to creating a game that players truly enjoy, and don't seem interested in trying to suck players' wallets dry using psychological tricks pulled mostly from slot machines.  \n\nThe art and music style are wonderful and add a great ambiance, and the customization system is already very deep.  Combat is fun, and leveling up your city and characters is rewarding and engaging without being frustrating.  \n\nThe game is, of course, still incomplete.  It has some bugs, and the content is incomplete (duh, it's in Early Access).
