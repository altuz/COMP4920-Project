It's basically a first person 3d adventure where you play a detective in future san francisco solving crimes. The level design is pretty basic and the puzzles are average in difficulty. However the game shines when you watch the full motion videos. They are professionally made and are pretty funny.

Having not played the previous games, I went into this completely blind, hoping to be amused by a fun point & click with some cool FMV. Instead I got incredibly cringe-worthy acting and a 2005 looking game. While I was playing I was constantly shown 'memories' from, what I can only assume, were previous games. None of them were particularly funny or engaging. On top of that was the influence from Kickstarter which was very noticeble with photographs of backers constantly being shoehorned in everywhere. The only redeeming factor (for me) was the VTMB vibe I was getting walking around the dark and moody map. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not a die hard fan of the series.", "timestamp_updated": 1506259316, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502041224, "votes_down": 15}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 283, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 25, "total_reviews": 308}}
