I bought Ori and the Blind Forest because it looked so beautiful--and it is! The gameplay is excellent. You acquire new skills in different locations so that the mechanics keep evoloving. It's never boring, although some tasks are so difficult that you have to repeat them multiple times to move forward, which can be tedious. However, that makes the game challenging, which is an asset.\nThe only issue I had with this game (actually, it's an issue with my comptuer) is that after an hour or two of gameplay, my computer overheats. I don't have a stellar PC, and I don't know a lot about what causes a computer to overheat, but I've played Skyrim, Oblivion, Kingdoms of Amalur, Witcher, and other super involved games without having that problem. Minecraft is the only other game that's ever made my laptop overheat after extended play. So I wouldn't buy it unless you have a pretty beefy gaming computer. If you DO, play this game!
