There are no fast breaks, and if rebounded down low, they always kick it back out to the point guard to set up the play again rather than just taking the post shot. I honestly wish I could get my money back. Even for simple visuals for a simulation management game, they look like something from 10 years ago.

Other than the currency being in the euro I had a bit of difficulty  finding and contacting free agents that could have been better handled such as having the option under the league that you are in or under national instead of under world also would have been better off if they had a section for free agents and then a section for scouts to contact the college students instead they are all thrown in together including players that are already signed to other teams or other leagues so it makes it difficult to  find free agents and to assign scouts to college players. \n\nIt would also be better if they had an option to assign scouts to monitor specific areas and go ont here own to scout players  instead of just having to assign scouts to to players also having a place to go to view the top 25 college prospects as well as each scouts top 25 prospects would be nice.maybe a whole section for scouting.
