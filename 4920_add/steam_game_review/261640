The characters in this game are the best out of all 3 borderlands games. Some of theyre skills you can unlock in the skill point trees are just awesome.\n2. The moon setting is good\n3. Cryo is a better version of slag from borderlands 2\n4. Laser guns are so much fun to use (a cryo laser weapon is so much fun to use)\n5. You get to use CLAPTRAP as a character (some of his skill points are so much fun like the pirate ship mode)\n6. The handsome Jack pack (my favorite character), the claptastic voyage, and the vault hunter upgrade packs are worth it\nCons:\n1. The story isnt as good as the story in either of the first 2 games. (its not the same unless Marcus tells the story)\n2. Janey Springs was a decent character but a not very good replacement for scooter\n3. Nurse Nina was a horrible replacement for Dr. Zed. Shes not fun at all unlike Zed. \n4. The game is $40 dollars (get it when its on sale)\n5. The shock drop and holodome dlc's arent worth it at all\n\nI got the season pass while it was on sale which came with all the good dlc. Good characters, decent but not as good story, fun element and weapon type, i recommend if theres a good sale to get the game.

Let's face it, Borderlands games have never been the most technical advanced and all the things which were bugging them come back with a vengeance in this one: Small ground protrusions about a feet high act as walls you have to jump over, enemies clipping or moving through or into walls and weird terrain interactions especially while driving vehicles plague this game.  \nAll this might be forgiven if the writing were to deliver the good old Borderlands humor but boy oh boy did they mess up the dialogue this time. The new characters are painfully, well, juvenile and obnoxious (and btw whenever I hear someone speak with an Australian accent now I immediatly think of them as being a complete simpleton or braindead yokel. Good work Gearbox Australia!) and much of their actions make almost no sense at all.  \nDid I mention the strange contradictions in the narrative? Like Lilith making the champion tell a story she was directly part of? The story itself is epic in scale but after a while of running around on way too big maps you force yourself on through the main story line which also has the unfortunate effect that you have to face late game end bosses way underleveled.  \nMoreover, the new game play mechanics are horrible. How about if we limit mobilty by introducing oxygen sets which have to be refilled in rather short intervals? That sure was fun......not. Limited resources is the key word here because they very much removed health regeneration in early levels which really makes you hate the Russian stereotype they set up for the health vendor. Item slots are limited to two for a very long stretch of the early game which is annoying es HELL because you tend to run out of ammunition types and you find yourself managing your inventory more often than you really would like to.  \nA word about the AU (artificial unintelligence): It's still Borderlands-style braindead but this time they simply cheated as almost every melee opponent has a high speed gap closer and just so they don't have to aim they give them sweeping attacks, scatter shot attacks or splash damage they use instantaneously after moving in. The ranged opponents on the other hand shoot like they have an aimbot. The devs didn't even try to hide that as they sometimes shoot lock-on lasers. Or they hit sniper shots on flying targets like they were shooting barns at six feet with a shotgun. Some bosses use a bit more finesse: They simply carpet bomb half the combat area.  \n\nThe lists of annoyances just goes on and on and on with this game and the bottom line is that this game just isn't fun to play.", "timestamp_updated": 1506086839, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506086545, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35069443", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506103476, "steamid": "76561198042369881", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 76}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If your'e going to highjack all of the skins, mechanics, and ideas of BOrderlands 2 atleast have the decency to not spend the last 5 miniutes developing all of the boss fights, story is slow, tedious annd boring, some cool areas but seriously... the boss fights in this game such dog dick, you either make a boss fight so easy its almost like your'e insulting whoever is playing the game or you make the boss fight so impossible (RK5) that you literally have to play like a complete asshole to even beat it in the first place.

How about the classic kill this entire wave of enemies to progress the mission and the last enemy either doesnt spawn, or falls through the world making it so you must leave the map area and come back to reload the fight and have the final enemy spawn where you can actually interact with it? Remember that classic? Yup, seen that one 5+ times in the past hour in different missions...\n\nHey, by the way, do you per chance enjoy playing this game on PC with an Xbox controller? So do I, but there is no option in any menu in the game to turn vibration off completely, so be prepared for random vibration when you do random things, like scoping up with some weapons but not others, or walk away from a vending machine and its talking to you, or any number of other random activities...\n\nAlso should you have a beast gaming computer make sure to never set your Physx settings above high, or you will experience random game freezes and crashes with varying frequency (I of course found this out the hard way, and after experiencing 4 or so crashes within an hour I had to search the internet where a forum was filled with people who had experienced the same random crashes and concluded they were caused by the PhysX settings...\n\nIf this game were to be patched to fix all of the obnoxious bugs\n\nTLDR Final Verdict: Is the game worth getting? Wait for a sale because its not worth 40$ in its current state. 10-15$ is acceptable, 20 is pushing it. Unless the devs come back and fix some of the obnoxious bugs, and throw in the option to turn controller vibration off completely thats my final verdict as someone whose put several hours into the game. Is there a rich story line full of classic humor good voice acting and witty quips like BL1 and BL2? Yup.
