They aren't super complex or deep, the opposite really, but I think it plays to it's strength. The main character is self-centered, misogynistic, and completely oblivious to it. The 'love' interest is flighty and hangs on the main characters every word, despite having to do his bidding - even at her own expense. \n\nThere are a ton of pop culture references in the game if you are familiar with them.

The graphics aren't anything to write home about, but I've found that because the environment is bright, made it pleasing for me to play.\n\nNow this doesn't mean that there weren't a few things that didn't bug me. There were. Like how the camera liked to fly away when I moved my mouse. Or how certain dialogue no longer appeared in a box - which made it hard to follow. Then there was one point where there was a battle with scripted dialogue, but I moved and killed something before the scripted actions finished - effectively leaving me stuck and making me reload. Text will automatically scroll fast in the beginning until you change the speed. But none of this was actually enough to stop me from finishing.\n\nSo to be super honest, this game - while enjoyable - is definitely what I call a 'one and done'.

I loved the first two grotesque tactics games. As soon as I saw this I immediatly bought it. The main problem with the game is, that there is less everything. Basically this game is, what the first ( maybe the first two) chapter in one of the first two games is. Only that the first two games had a bunch of chapters coming after that. It has fewer characters (barely any actually), fewer quests/places to go to, way fewer items and is extremely short in general. This is basially a DLC and not a game. Whats worst though, is that the humor this time falls flat. Where usually there was dark humor and many references to pop culture, now there still is a bit of that left but just a tiny bit and the jokes are basically sexist/blonde jokes, which can be funny and only offensive to really sensible people if you do it right, but they didnt do it right. The jokes are performed so clumsily that its hard to give anyone more than a grin at best. Now if this was only 2 dollars I'd say go ahead and take it if you are a fan of the series, since the few characters that you use are still the ones you know and love and a tiny bit of story unfolds itself which might interest you, but for the price it is at right now I can only say stay away, its not worth it.\n\nP.S: If you havent played the other games yet this game is just confusing and totally not worth your money on any sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1411645532, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411645311, "votes_down": 11}, {"recommendationid": "9298848", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504268", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1393100671, "steamid": "76561197963648068", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "this game was MUCH better than expected...\nshort (5-6 hours)\nbut still worth every penny!\n\nfun-humorous-arrogant-rpg goodness :)", "timestamp_updated": 1393642888, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1393642888, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "11847096", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503954", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1408886036, "steamid": "76561198064647117", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fantastic value at the on sale price, even helped me improve my German \"Jungfrau\" ;0)\nI advise you to switch on the German audio, or otherwise the text will scroll too fast, you will pick up the langauge eventually too!!!!\nOnly complaint is I would have liked it to last longer, but cannot fault it for the price I paid.
