the graphics are superb, the sound & music well made, and everything seems to be in order... but not quite.There are a few -but critical- gameplay errors that entirely spoil the -otherwise very well put- experience.\n\nFirst of all, the game is a bit confusing as to what it wants you to do.There are message banners across the levels, but nobody cares to read when you are surrounded by myriads of enemies and/or you want to blow them up.After all, it's a shoot'em up, right?\n\nThe same applies to the buy menu.I simply don't understand what costs how much, what needs to be upgraded first to proceed, basically, it looks like a mixed mess of numbers, icons, bars, etc.It needs to be clean, not confusing.\n\nSecondly, it's the power of the weapons that leads to rationing of shots.The energy weapon, that is the mainstay of your craft, is quite weak.On the contrary, the matter weapon, is faster, and deals better damage with shielded enemies.However since it's got a finite amount of shots (while the energy weapon recharges albeit very slowly) you have to be careful not to waste precious ammo by spraying fire on the level.If you do, you can easily find  yourself either out of ammo, or in wiat for your weaker gun to recharge.Not good.\n\nConsequently, you have to reserve your ammo for the shielded enemies,Which is dowright bad design in such a type of game because, you have to keep track & remember what type of weapon to use on which enemy to make the best out of your guns.All that while maneouvering to avoid enemy fire , and shooting back to a lot of small sized targets.That makes life difficult, especially during the initial levels.You may overcome this by upgrading your weapons, but the buy menu again doesnt help.   \n\nThat's about it.Sorry if I tired you out with my review.\n\nEDIT: \nI replayed the game, still find it terrible.One thing I should add to my previous review, is that I hate the fact that the game has 4 (yes, four) different fire buttons.2 for the main guns and another 2 for the drones (yes the game allows you to have those too) -AND a special ability button-.Needless to say, how much confusing it is to remember what button to press at any appropriate time.Again bad design prevails.This control scheme was made with a console controller in mind (I think the game has native support for the  Xbox device).The rest of us that play with a keyboard we can throw ourselves in front of a bus.\n\nHopefully Jets and Guns is released later this month, and everyone will be able to make comparisons.", "timestamp_updated": 1391298780, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1390259152, "votes_down": 21}, {"recommendationid": "8822297", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509264", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1390508101, "steamid": "76561197971054167", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I came for a nice shoot'em'up.

This is a true side scrolling shoot em up similar to R-Type that harkens to the glorious golden age of NES and SNES shooters. The game has a  great soundtrack and really good graphics. This game punishes you and requires the same old school mechanics that made some of the classic games so memorable. I prefer this game to Sine Mora and Syder Arcade which I just found boring. This game requires almost perfect positioning as well as patient timing and really works your brain. You have to pay attention and know what you are going to do to survive a level. Getting the golden eggs while you are getting shot from every direction and the level is scrolling gives you seconds to figure out the patten and move accordingly. The leve ldesign is great imho. I was acutally very suprised at the low scores at Metacritic and the 1 lame user review. It just shows how lazy game reviewers have become where if a game requires you to memorize or learn something via trial and error or practice like in the goold old days its not good in their eyes. This is an amazing game. The first time I fired it up I played for 2+ hours straight on \"hard\" and it was amazing. I just kept saying \"this game!!\" everytine I died but kept coming back for more. I haven't felt like this since I was a kid. Really solid side scrolling arcade game that requires you to  learn the mechanics, positioning, and item placement. Replaying the levels is not bad as there are many of them that you have access to via branching paths and each is challenging enough not to get boring even during repetitive playthroughs. Each level also ends relatively quickly as you solve or move past the obstacle never forcing you to reply too much of it from the beginning. You do only get one life and in some areas it starts you from the beginning while others from the middle of the level but it does not take long to get to where you were. You can go back to the galaxy map and store at any time if you can't make progress and try other combinations of weapons and upgrades. I have had no problems going through the first 8 stages with just using the 2 basic guns and an armor upgrade and this is on hard. If you loved old school side scrolling shooters like R-Type and wished that modern devs made a game as equally challening and fun as what we used to have that does not hold your hand this is the game for you. This game is affordable and beautiful to play through. This is one of the best purhcases that I made in 2014 and a welcome addition to my library. I have almost every Shmup and arcade game available on Steam and this is now one of my most favorites. Don't listen to the lazy reviews, give this game a shot.
