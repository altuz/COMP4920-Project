Some excellent people in the steam game community provides much-needed feedback to clarify what the player is expected to do in order to reach the advertised levels of mage power. \n\nThis quality will inherently cut out a large portion of the gamers that would enjoy the combat system immensely, but do not possess the time or willpower to go through the numbers game that runs the whole show. In essence, this game will require you to read up on how to succeed as you slug along. \n\nWhat made me stick with it? The magic schools are fun, the spell shapes are decently well-designed even though some could've been left out since they underperform compared to their peers. For instance, why use a ray that will pretty much leave you a sitting duck when you can charge criticals with lobs or missiles? The game plays mostly like an old-school shoot'em'up with the caveat that you actually need to have the right spells crafted to stand a chance of surviving. \n\nThe downsides for me comes down to three things. \n- The numbers game determining the fun explosions you see all over the screen is poorly explained in-game and even half understanding Mastery, Control, and Destruction there's no guarantee you'll have good enough components to craft useful spells\n- Leaving it to the game to manage your inventory and focus on the blasting may actually be detrimental to your success for this reason\n- Punishing the player by losing all loot rarity levels upon death instead of one at a time is harsh, especially since the thresholds for winning some fights are variable and the only way to redeem those loot levels is to go back possibly several hours of gameplay depending on where you are\n\nAt the end of the day, if you are a person who enjoys numbercrunching and seeing the results as coloured explosions on a screen - this is definitely a game for you. If you prefer to just blast things, it would be a good idea to forego this title for something that will let you spend your free time mindlessly blowing stuff up. At any rate, it's a game that stands out from the crowd and if you're curious, well worth the money.", "timestamp_updated": 1506897568, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506897568, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35400561", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506904736, "steamid": "76561198004410106", "num_games_owned": 576, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 395}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Released in 2014, this game was, and still is, a visual beast. The environments look amazing and the spells and effects all look fantastic as well. Story is pretty weak, though voice acting is solid. Of course, gameplay is where it maters and while this does have some solid gameplay, it gets repetative. Yesh, there's no mana pools or cool-downs for your spells, but you can't cast things all that fast and I ended up using the hold-and-charge version of everything offensive because of the damage output, though spaming oyur basic attacks work just fine. Right-clock for each skill is suposed to be a shield of some sort, but I don't think I ever used it. I like that you get damage boosts for combining certain abilities. My go-to setup was to use Necromancy to amass an army, freeze enemies and let the army hit enemies as I did that, and then hit them with the charged up fire bomb for large damage. Worked well throughout the game. Not much challenge except for some bosses that were just super bullet spungey, probably my least favorite part of the game.\n\nNot worth full price of $40, but for$10-15, it's a solid 11 hour game that just looks really nice.\n\n7.5/10", "timestamp_updated": 1506905174, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506905174, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34886672", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505149204, "steamid": "76561198040812164", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It goes from strikingly easy, boringly linear walking to almost impossible (if you haven't built your spells the right way) boss fights.
