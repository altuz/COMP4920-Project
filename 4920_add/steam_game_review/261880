The music is a big part of what makes the game. In general it is very linear with slight variations, resultig in simplicity. Packed with this music, voice recordings of the protagonist's thoughts (same as the cutscenes, ultra funny :D ) and so much love in it, it makes a beautiful game. It's exactly my kind of game, I can't find any negative point. I would recommend this game to anyone who doesn't need much story and wants a simple game for a long or a short time. My favourite parts are the music and the look of the game. Everything is full of love, for example, the frames of pixelated sprites are so detailed, you could see a lot of time was spent during the development.", "timestamp_updated": 1498321726, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498321726, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31990334", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498343", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1429155852, "steamid": "76561197999423205", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fun, but not worth playing again.", "timestamp_updated": 1495869368, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495869368, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 204, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 21, "total_reviews": 225}}
