The pacing is a little slow at times, the dialogue and story is kind of quirky and weird (but intreguing and absolutely hilarious if you share that sense of humour), the world is weird and sometimes confusing, the art direction's papercraft style is very peculiar and unique... And if none of this is offputting to you, it instead gives a ton of charm to a wild ride of a game that you will never forget. Definitely one of the best unknown indie titles to grace the internet and something throughly special, you've never played another game quite like it and probably never will.\n\nIf you're interested in quirky, weird, unique, charming, story-driven games like Earthbound or Undertale (though I'm a little hesitant to include that one because -everyone- came around with Undertale), you'll wonder how you missed this one for all of these years. If you prefer a straight-forward RPG or shooter or somesuch, maybe keep looking.\n\nPS: also, the music is fantastic and a -huge- soundtrack for this kind of undertaking.

It's quirkiness is reminiscent of action RPGs like Little Big Adventure.  Don't be fooled by its appearance -- there's a lot of attention to detail in this game.  You can search underneath mattresses for wads of cash, initiate hidden dialogue with various characters and discover plenty of hidden items, treasures, and new outfits for the Cowboy.  Plenty of heart and humor.  The combat isn't particularly deep as there's more focus on exploring and puzzle solving.
