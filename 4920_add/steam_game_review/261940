BUT even though it may seem to totally represent the early 80s cartoon, this is in fact based upon the NEW MCoG that is currently showing on tv of their adventures in China!  So DO NOT expect the same voice overs, show intro, and locations...even though a huge majority is still intact from the 80s cartoon show.  Now that that's said, let's get to the actual game.  It's a puzzler.  Based on 3 kids alternating to solve puzzles.  The puzzles are not difficult at all and doesn't take more of an elementary level of knowledge to solve.  I would definitely recommend this for kids, but for grown ups I would only recommend it for people who remembered and loved the early 80s show.\n\nRating: 5/10", "timestamp_updated": 1408933425, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1385242254, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "15116454", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506421", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1451324685, "steamid": "76561198030788488", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 1228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[b][i]The Mysterious Cities of Gold: Secret Paths[/i][/b] is a children point & click adventure puzzle game. After the events in South America, you follow Esteban, Zia and Tao as they travel across China in search of the second City of Gold.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]: This is a bright and colorful adventure game, the 3D graphical style very respectful of the 2D anime it follows. Each character has a unique ability, and you must swap between them while traveling through labyrinths of jungle, caves and palaces, avoiding capture and solving puzzles to make your way across. The game is easy to pick off, perfect for any kids to learn.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]: Obviously meant for a touch screen, the point and clicking doesn't work as well with a mouse pointer's accuracy, often requiring several clicks to press a button, pick up an object or move exactly where you want to move. The clip-montage cinematics don't explain the story, but simply tells you at which point of the show's story you're at, so anyone who hasn't seen the Second Season won't understand most of the story or character development.\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 - It's up to you\n\nAlthough many of us grew up with the First Season decades ago, the recent Second Season of [i]The Mysterious Cities of Gold[/i] was marketed specifically for children, and this game targets that audience. Therefore, I cannot blame this game for being easy or meant for children. If you haven't seen the show, you are unlikely to find any interest in this game.
