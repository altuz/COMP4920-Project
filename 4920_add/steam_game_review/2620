I have played other Call of Duty games before this one before but decided to go ahead and buy the original, to really see where it all started. I have to say that this game holds up well, at least the campaign does. I can't speak for the multiplayer for I haven't played it. The soundtrack was great, the gameplay is pretty smooth, the characters and the voice acting is good for its time. I mean sure the character models are a bit boxy, the graphics aren't great by today's standards, and you are pretty limited in terms of weapons and movement as was the case with most games when this came out. \n\nAll in all, I think this is a great game and will probably play this again on a harder difficulty in the future. I totally recommend this game for anyone who can appreciate the origins of a franchise such as this one or like ones such as Medal of Honor. Oh and by the way, I got this on a sale, which I recommend people interested in any game to do, but having played the campaign and looking back, I think the $20 is worth it, especially if you are willing to replay it on a harder setting."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504715672, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34778856", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198043897561", "num_reviews": 28, "last_played": 1494802470, "num_games_owned": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 791}, "timestamp_updated": 1504715672, "received_for_free": false, "review": "First game in the entire series and it's still great to play.

It was my first game ever on PC, I loved it and still love it with all my heart. When I saw it on STEAM - I bought it right away without second thoughts. And this game is still awesome, graphics are outdated, dumb AI, fcked up saving system, but overall storyline, missions are done very well. Every single mission was tons of fun, especially that one where you need to destroy the Dam AA's. + multi-player is decent considering this game was released in 2003 and there's still people playing it! This should be telling you something about the game if people keep playing it daily for 14 years.I strongly advise you all to give it a shot, if you haven't played it before or if you did - buy it anyways, it doesn't cost much and the day will come when you'll feel like going on a nostalgic trip."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505094298, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490291", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34874729", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198170373618", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1491703916, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1259}, "timestamp_updated": 1505094298, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Its an amazing game.
