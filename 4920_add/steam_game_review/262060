However, the game works far too hard against you.\n\n1: As you progress, harder missions appear. This is all well and good, except that there are three mission slots per biome, and your mission options for the base difficulty will narrow appreciably.\n\n2: Heroes will not accept missions a certain margin below thier level. This forces them(and you) into poorly conceived outings.\n\n3: There are seven hero levels(0-6), and three dungeon tiers(green, orange, red). A level 2 hero, fully kitted out, is weaker in an orange dungeon(for levels 3-4) than a level zero hero in a green dungeon(for levels 1-2). This ruins any feeling of progression, but not nearly as much as the last issue.\n\n4: The end reinforces the myopic, nihilistic tone, and devalues any contribution you may have thought you'd made to the story or world.\n\n[spoiler]After a boss fight where half of the four-hero party you've put so much effort into is guaranteed to die, your PC(player character) commits suicide, and the NG+ mode implies that the old PC is the new ancestor, and nothing's changed except now the hamlet is back to being a decayed dump. I am fine with the themes of loss, sadness, and sacrifice.\nI am fine with the more grounded view of what heroes might more realisticially be. I do not approve of a pointless narrative that asserts it's pointlessness.[/spoiler]\n\nIn short, I think the game handles difficulty poorly. I have no issue with difficult games(CRYPTARK, BRIGADOR, XCOM franchise, and the Dark Souls franchise). These four are designed to fairly punish you for stupid decisions. At no point in any of those games did I feel I was randomly screwed over. I failed due to poor or risky decisions. Darkest Dungeon seems designed to randomly screw you over, and I cannot recommend a game of that nature. Here are some examples of how the Darkest Dungeon systems can screw you over.\n-Random insanity\n-Random death due to high stress\n-Random enemy spawns during camp\n-Random negative quirks you will almost certainly not have the funding to deal with\n-Random crits from enemies\n-Random hall object effects, most of which are bad\n...and all of these are permanent due to a auto-save. Enemies do not have nearly the scope and depth of hazards to overcome, and do not suffer attrition as your forces do.\n\nI have not completed the game story, but have put enough time in that I feel I can write an informed/informative review.\n\nEDIT: If anyone wants to tell me how the review could be improved, or is un-helpful, I'd be happy to make improvements.", "timestamp_updated": 1507092437, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506236562, "votes_down": 15}, {"recommendationid": "35236746", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498351", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507076283, "steamid": "76561198026733021", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "An update broke the game for mac.

THEN MY VESTAL (with base death resist at 66%, which is 2/3) DIED IMMEDIATELY TO THE FIRST TICK OF BLIGHT. ON THE VERY FIRST ROUND.\n\n\n\n\n\nI want to like this game. But this 'game' isn't really what you would call a video game in the traditional sense. Apart from a tiny bit of macro (which amounts to getting money, upgrading gear and getting more money) the actual dungeon-crawling part of the game is nothing but a glorified random number generator where the game decides pretty much everything for you. Sure, there are modifiers you could stack to tip the odds a little bit more in your favour, but the variance on every single metric is so high (the ridiculous damage variance in this game can mean that one character can do half of a monster's HP bar in one round, then 100% of it the next. There is no way to control or modify this. If a character says it can do 7-14 damage, there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO to control whether it does 7 or 14 damage this round).\n\nThis means that pretty much the entire game you're praying for things beyond your control to go your way. Praying that your healer doesn't get chainstunned into an immediate death. Praying that the enemy stress dealer doesn't dodge 5 attacks in a row. Praying that the turn order (which is loosely decided in order of speed but might as well be completely fucking random, enemies slower than you can and will go before you) is in your favour. Praying that you don't miss, and don't lowroll on the retarded damage variance of your every attacking move. So many things have to go right for you to get a single successful fight in one single dungeon run in your campaign, and the only thing you can do to impact the outcome of all this is applying some do-nothing buffs and pressing attack while praying.\n\nWhen you 'play' Darkest Dungeon, you're not playing a game. You're watching a movie, the positive or negative outcome of which is predetermined by the RNG seed generated by your computer. All the buttons you get to press just exist to give you an illusion of control. Don't waste dozens of hours trying to defeat this poorly made game, just watch a B-grade horror movie on the same lovecraftian theme and be done with it.

All of those games take patience, skill, and require you to learn the game mechanics and read enemies' patterns.\n\nWhile Darkest Dungeon certainly requires all of those, it also requires an extreme degree of grinding and pure mathematical luck. Even after you know every enemy down to their exact hit chance percentage, even after you carefully construct a team composition, there are plenty of enemies (especially bosses) that can and will often kill you, even if you make zero mistakes. A hero or heroes will die, you'll have to retreat, and you will have to spend hours leveling them up to max rank again (which is too small compared to the max rank of bosses). When you're finally ready to face the same boss again, you'll just have to hope that you have better luck. Dodges, crits, deathblows, virtue chance, bleed chance - there's so much RNG imbued to this game that it's frustrating when you lose. It gets to a point where you know exactly what you need to do - its just up to chance whether you have a succesful dungeon run or not.\n\nWith difficult, RNG-based games like XCOM, you can reload your save file at your discretion. Died to a double-crit that should not have happened? Reload your save and try again. Actually died because you made a mistake? You can take the loss. Darkest Dungeon, on the other hand, is constantly auto-saving, which seems cool at first. After you die to an astronomically unlucky series of events, its far from cool.\n\nWhich isn't to say that this game has cool mechanics. There are also plenty of creative classes, heroes and bosses. But all of this gets thrown at you in the first 10 hours or so. After that, the developers just decided to pump the numbers up on their damage, health, etc. When the game starts getting tough, there's no motivation to find something new. \n\nI love hard games, and I try them tons of times before rage quitting. In fact, I didn't really rage quit this game. I just realized: \"Beating this game is going to take too damn long\". After 60 hours you will hit the level cap for most of your heroes, the wall. Past that there is no fun to be had, just grinding and hoping you get lucky.\n\nHowever, I would recommend this game if you're into the lore and art style. This is one of the must stunningly atmospheric and cool indie games I have ever played. Even the item descriptions have story-driven detail. The bosses are freakishly awesome looking, and the voice narration is nothing short of poetic. But, like I said, most of the unique content is discovered shortly after the first 10 hours, and succesive dungeons just change the numbers. Enemies and bosses don't even get a recolor, they're just renamed. For 10-15 hours of enjoyment simply from the graphics and atmosphere, this game is too expensive.\n\nFind another game if you're looking to challenge yourself. This game is the bad kind of difficult - it requires too much luck,  and it requires too much grinding. Strategy, patience, perception, memory, perserverence, and wit won't cut it here.
