Unfortunately, even accepting that the game's extremely limited player precision, weapons, effects, enemies, and level variety are somewhat inherent to the retro genre it portrays, I would not recommend this game even to diehard fans of retro / 8-bit, as its gameplay is so utterly simplistic and inaccurate.\n\nI had no idea I was buying some \"arena\" game where the primary purpose is moving from left to right on very small maps before the opposing team (or  in my experience, bots...) gets to their \"side of the level\" first. It's a really odd mechanic and doesn't seem to fit this design very well. The game itself lacks much of the implied \"fast pace\" action as seen in the trailers, and instead you meander your way from left to right (or right to left) over a short distance within a limited 1:00 minute time span for each map, clumsily lining up shots and grenades and hoping you can make it to your side of the level first instead of the other team. The strange multiplayer insistence really hinders what could have been a cool aesthetic for a military game with a campaign / progressive levels with more of a through line. Instead, you face off on 5 levels which all mostly look the same (this one has snow though!) to see who can get to their side first the most, best out of 5. \n\nYour character despite having full controller support seems to steer incredibly vaguely, with there not even being a traditional jump button. Instead you hold right and / or up / down and watch as your character automatically bounds over whatever is front of them, which makes for really imprecise shooting. You can't seem to aim up or down with your regular machine gun. You can stop to press A to awkwardly align a reticle over the area you want to shoot a missile or grenade toward, but then it's mostly crossing your fingers that the enemies happen to be within range of it, and it seems like most of the time you just end up clipping some outcropping barely in front of you and killing yourself instead. While this is funny the first few times, it makes for a frustrating, inaccurate experience before too long. Your medic seems to crap out health / revival orbs at random and the game advises you to \"stick close to your medic\" but with most all the characters on either side of the game looking like the same pixelated, small design it's hard to distinguish which one that is. \n\nThe old school military graphics, explosions, and ragdolling / amputated crawling the characters do all looks good, and overall the design / aesthetics replicate the feel of an old NES game well. The sound effects seem fitting to the events on screen with funny but brief character moans and screams amidst explosions and the like. The soundtrack is easily the worst part of the game for me with its incredibly repetitive, out-of-place plunky / lighthearted guitar and feels more like they're squeezing out a song made for the main menu across every single level. It reflects the light-heartedness of the game, but I wonder if the game had embodied more of a Medal of Honor / epic orchestral type soundtrack if it would have been a little more immersive and less elephant in the room, in your face all the time.  \n\nIt appears only 2 people made this game for what it's worth. While it was worth a chuckle or two and I think the graphical style is cool, I will be trying to get a refund. It may be more fun local coop in its versus mode, however I never had the chance to play this option. I could see it still wearing thin pretty quickly.", "timestamp_updated": 1498796094, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498795873, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31576703", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495365", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1479294102, "steamid": "76561198097377539", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's Shame this Game is DEAD... but History Continues\n\nBill Nye the CI Spy Disapproves!!", "timestamp_updated": 1494062648, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494062648, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 19, "total_reviews": 34}}
