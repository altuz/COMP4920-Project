The irony is that I can never achieve that when I play this game seriously.\nEri's typical combo is hard to block and AI really likes to spam it.\nAyane seems able to have her quiver refilled automatically, while Luna has to reload her pistols manually. And the reloading can be interrupted, that's totally unfair.\n\nIMHO, \u6771\u65b9\u8403\u5922\u60f3 \uff5e Immaterial and Missing Power is better polished.\n\n[spoiler]Great soundtrack though, with or without DLCs.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_updated": 1506527929, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506091737, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34777598", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499422", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505989230, "steamid": "76561198022143876", "num_games_owned": 1711, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Vanguard Princess was formerly a freeware game. It's initial release on Steam was censored, but that has since been fixed with the free directors cut DLC patch. It's now a low cost, content light fighting game with some good artwork and unique mechanics. \n\nPros:\n-Good Artwork\n-Approachable Mechanics\n-Works well with all game pads. I have tried some wonkey pads and they all work well\n-Top notch local multi. Pick up and play that anyone can enjoy.\n-I have read that you can play online with some modding, though I have not tried it. \n\nCons:\n-Interface is bonkers. Changing the vs. level is done in a drop down menu. Wut?\n-Forced Practice Mode Each time you do the story. It can get pretty irritating. \n-AI is pretty brutal. Though this is not as bad as it used to be, local multi is really needed to enjoy this to the fullest.\n-The DLC is silly. That stuff should be included.\n\nTL;DR - Good game. Play with a friend for best experience. \n\n\nStay Strong Japan", "timestamp_updated": 1504711657, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504711657, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 503, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 204, "total_reviews": 707}}
