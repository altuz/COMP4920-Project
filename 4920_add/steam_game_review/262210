Do you wish you could gracefully ride a horse at full speed leaping over fences and chasms with the greatest of ease?  Have you just returned from the Renaissance Faire, all pumped up, wishing you could have joined in on all that jousting goodness?  Well, you're in luck because whatever your secret desire is, this game can help you fullfill it!\n\nThis is a Runner/Platformer game which has surprisingly fluid controls (I like playing with a controller best).  I never felt like I missed a hit or a jump because of sluggish-control reaction time or over-compensating turning controls.  \n\nWhat is nice is that there are 3 points-of-view to choose from for playing the story campaign: slightly behind your character (normal viewpoint), first-person perspective, and bird's-eye view (both horizontal and vertical).  You may have found that there are fun platforming games but you just wished they had picked a different perspective because the current one just doesn't work well for you; well, they have included them all, so you can choose your pleasure.  And each perspective has it's own story progression and ranking, so if you have finished the game with all gold medals on the normal viewpoint, you can go ahead and try your hand at bird's-eye view and so on.  It's a simple addition which opens up all sorts of possibilities for different kinds of gamers, and one I wish was implemented in more titles.\n\nThey also have an endless mode and a survival mode to play in addition to the story campaign, and a lot of customization options to unlock so there is actually a fair amount of content to play through, even if the basic gameplay style doesn't change all that much.  And that's a lot of content for a game of its price range.  If you're the type of person who likes to have a lot of objectives to knock off in a game, this title would be one for you.  \n\nUnfortunately, all those objectives are not reflected well in their Steam achievements.  I would say the biggest negative for this game is that it has very poor Steam achievements (not really a deal-breaker for most).  When you have 77 possible achievements, and after 3 years less then 2% of your players have gotten half of those achievements, and barely 5% have even gotten a third, you know you aren't doing something right.  I'm not saying you need to hand out achievements left and right every time a player reads a sentence, but it would be nice to get some achievements for getting gold medals in levels and the like.  Most of the achievements are for doing some odd manuever that you aren't even able to control or track.  If you are a Steam achievement hunter, this title will be a bit of a disappointment in that area, but don't let that be the only reason not to get the game.  It is very fun and has a lot to do in it so it is definately worth its low price.\n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1500675612, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500675612, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 48, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 8, "total_reviews": 56}}
