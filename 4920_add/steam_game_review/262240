The art is also a bit simple, but it did grow on me; the sprites on the other hand look amazing, with the enemies sharing a distinctly different style compared to the chibi-esque style of you and the bosses.\n\nThe music, on the other hand, is overall a bit above average; while there were certainly standouts, namely the final boss and the entirety of Stage 4, the rest is pretty good at best.\n\nOh yeah, and this game is insanely hard. On my first playthrough, I could only manage Easy Mode, and even then it took me quite a few hours just to beat it.
