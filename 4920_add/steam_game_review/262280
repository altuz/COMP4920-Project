It can be annoying at the start as enemies raid your base while your still trying to build a defense or a military to protect you but once you get going you will find your military will become overpowering and will simply destroy anything in your path. \n\nThe overall difficult is rather easy as once you pass the first few minutes of building your base, you should have a decent defense followed by a decent military to keep pushing out towards your enemy base.  Overall if you like RTS you will get a good few hours out of this, just note the mulitplayer seems dead so don't expect much on that end.", "timestamp_updated": 1506013421, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506013421, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35426062", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507110330, "steamid": "76561198082649847", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 835}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Hello everyone,\n\nDungeons 2 is a great game without big pretensions, mixing strategy and humor!\n\n1) Strategy because you can only deploy a limited number of troops.\n2) Humor because the narrator and the name of each character is fun and refers to more known elements!\n\nI bought it today at 4.5 \u20ac which is really cheap and I already had a good time with a friend of mine!
