It's easy to play in chunks and completing levels at all (even if poorly) is sufficient for progression to the next stage, so even if you're not the targeted niche of a speedrunner or a time attack highscore enthusiast, you might like it, if you liked Dustforce or Super Meat Boy or another high quality, viscerally satisfying action platformer.\n\n    The movement system in the game feels hella good (if you can conquer stamina limitations) with the exception of rare wallrunning into corners and ledgegrabbing, and the semilinearity of the levels allows you to choose your favorite mechanics to use to go fast or go safe, all the time. It's not until the hardest, optional levels of the game that this surprising amount of freedom in platforming is taken away, and it's no surprise for those.\n\n    But, there's a catch with this recommendation: As much as I'd be happy to keep playing Cloudbuilt, all the levels that remain after I played enough levels to satisfy completion, DLC levels or not, SUPER CLOUDBUILT has been released. Praises are already being sung. Trust me, Cloudbuilt is shockingly polished for a game of its type (I'm very picky for movement and mechanical responsiveness and visceral satisfaction), and Super Cloudbuilt is Cloudbuilt with refinements and additional content. So if you see Cloudbuilt on sale or HumbleBundle at some point, you can be happy to get it. If you're itchy to get it off sale, scoot on over to Super Cloudbuilt instead, as it's even more likely to be worth your dollars.\n\n    Don't let the small amount of hours fool you, this was absolutely one of my favorite gaming experiences of the past several years, up there with Furi, N++, and Devil Daggers; I cleared it, and as I was getting really into it I only put it down because I've convinced myself Super Cloudbuilt is absolutely worth buying. I can really only say to steer clear if the over-the-shoulder perspective isn't your cup of tea, if you are looking for constant combat, or you want a relaxing easy experience, because Cloudbuilt is a great game, but it is a great intense 3rd person action platformer and works because the developers strongly refined it into that.", "timestamp_updated": 1504166216, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504166216, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34348846", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502437162, "steamid": "76561198001521783", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I'd say I enjoyed the game. I bought Super Cloudbuilt on a whim, and then found it a bit too extreme and somewhat more complicated, so I went and got the original Cloudbuilt, and I'm happy that I did. \nIf you're into parkour and fast unforgiving action, the game delivers. \nIt's a fast paced 3D runner over vaious obstacle courses with traps and enemies in your way, and, well, basically, that it. The levels themselves are short, and once you figure out where to go and what to do, it's easy enough to blast through them. At least, some of them.\n \nThis is one of the cases where the graphics are just right for what the game hopes to accomplish. The soundtack's nice, I like it a lot, but it tends to get repetative, expecially if you're forced to play one level over and over. There are branching paths, though, so if you're stuck, you can try a different level. There are secrets in the form of continues and save points, and that adds something to do. Usually the path through the level is straightforward, but there are shortcuts.  \nThe story is, well, rather irrelevant to the gameplay. The game could've been just a bunch of levels without any plot, and it would've done just fine. Still, there's a story, or, rather, a narrative. Sure, why not? \n\nThe game takes getting used to, though. You'll fail, a lot. But it didn't piss me off completely, and I even enjoyed the challenge, although I'm into much slower games, personally. \n\nHowever, I will say this, and this is my biggest issue with Cloudbuilt - there are special techniques that are absolutely necessary for beating the more complex levels in the game. And the game doesn't teach you any of them. If you're a noob like myself, you just might want to go to the game's community here or on youtube and learn them before getting into the meat of things. Because the game itself sure isn't going to help you learn them on your own. \nBut the community is rather active, and that's a good thing, I guess.\n\nI will say that would've enjoyed an easy mode or something like that (the supercharged jetpack mode is the closest to that at the moment), something that would let you climb around and mess around on your own pace, but that's just me. The game is an adrenalin rush, though, so if you feel like beating your head against the wall for a couple of hours, sure, give it a try. You might even enjoy it ))).

Seriously, this game is terribly hard. I also leave it to your imagination which one of the two reasons made me buy this game:)\n\nAlthough, or maybe because?, the game is so hard, it is very fun. I found myself failing over and over again, yet I couldn't quit. Even when I had to restart a level several times, I tried harder, managed to solve passages even faster or with less damage, eventually finishing the parcour. I guarantee you, this game takes you onto a journey of frustration and even more frustraton. \n\nBasically, you play as Demi, who has to run through several parcours in the sky. While only running and jumping is boring, you also have a boost for speeding up, climbing up walls or jumping slightly higher. Moreover, you also have a gun which fires homing bullets. Trust me, these are necessary - you'll rarely have time to aim precisely. And there are enemies which WILL kill you - be it mines, turrets or bombs dropping down. You can, however, destroy most of them with your gun to clear the path.\n\nEverytime you die or fall from the platforms, you can restart from the last checkpoint, although enemies will also respwan. Yet you don't have an unlimited amount of tries, once all your lifes are depleted, you'll have to restart the whole level. Kindly, the game also offers you a portable checkpoint that even replenishes your lifes.\n\nThe story of the game is told via monologues, depending on your choices of levels, these and the ending will differ. While I don't want to spoil anything, the story actually makes sense and even an explanation for those parcours is given.\n\nAll in all, this is a very decent game, it's challenging but enjoyable - if you are OK with a lot of trial and error.
