I have completed all the levels. I have achieved three stars on majority of the game. I have notice that when you play the computer at such a high level it will bust you many times and in sequence order back to back. You will not be able to draw 2 cards nor 3 cards the bust is that quick. Its like the computer has this hidden trait. Also if you use traits in the game you never see any of your traits. The computer will give you a steady diet of garbage cards not the cards you need. However the computer will always be able to use its own traits no matter what you do. I have depleted all its cards but yet it will draw out 6 or 8 cards in row to get its card. It will never bust on the second card nor will bust on many krakens. I have become like Criss Angel and can guess the cards the computer wil recieve. Random is not how the cards are given. There is no luck in this game. You win by a large amount only if the computer allows you and this occurs infrequently. Winning the tournaments is easy but getting the score amount for 3 stars can be a frustrating feat.", "timestamp_updated": 1496684045, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496684045, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 158, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 32, "total_reviews": 190}}
