First they allow you to download the demo from their website but they dont let you use the demo. It just says demo expired soon as you open it. Now this is probably the most craziest thing ever because why have a demo but not let anyone use it. Now this may not be intentionaly but I think I can understand why which leads me to my next point. This program is basically a money grab. You basically can only do what is shown on the advertisement. Most popular manga take place in a fantasy world. Downloading this program does not let you make any type of genre you want. It only allows you to make a school manga mostly focused around romance with a little bit of comedy with silly faces. You can make a fantasy manga sorta, by downloading the dlc for extra money. But the items in the DLC are so lack luster that not only should it have been an already in feature for the main game, but paying an extra 18$ dollars is also ridiculous. Theres no uniqueness to making a character unless you change a hairstyle or clothing or gender. Everyone looks the same, body portions the same, height. Its so generic and bland it makes me think the creators have never read a manga in their life. If you choose to buy this very lackluster program understand that you will most likely not be able to create the manga you want. Additionally, you will be forced to buy a bunch of DLC just to try to and even then you still wont be able to. I recommend everyone wait and have hope that maybe they actually focus on good content or someone with an actual passion for manga steps up to be a competitor. This game is indeed a joke, but hey if you want a silly school theme anime, with no plot, this is for you.", "timestamp_updated": 1500003176, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500003176, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33675832", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507098", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507174544, "steamid": "76561198082041958", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 104512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6907}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "At first I was super skeptical especially when I saw other people's \"not recommended\"s however with a little knowledge on 3d modeling (and I mean it can be super basic) and basic photo editing skills this program works wonders. I realize that theres limited DLC and such however with proper time and effort you can do a lot with it. You just need time and patience, and for someone like me (who has absolutely no skill in actually drawing) it is amazing.
