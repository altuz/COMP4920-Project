I had a session with over 160 minutes where I did absolutely nothing, and the previous day I wandered around aimlessly for 2 hours. And all because I didn't notice a [spoiler]bump[/spoiler].[/i]\n\nCrimson Room: Decade is a remake of the original Crimson Room game by TAKAGISM. Other than the name, the room and a couple of items and references, everything else is new. Instead of point'n'click, now you actually walk around the tiny room and look for clues and items to help you escape and uncover the secrets of La Crimson, the ship that the main character's grandfather spent his last days in.\n\nUnlike the original, where sometimes you had to click on random places to get what you needed (I'm looking at you, you [strike]damn[/strike] battery), most of CR: D is logical (except for some bits after a [spoiler]literal[/spoiler] twist).\n\nThroughout the game, you can find diary papers that show pieces of the history of the protagonist's grandfather that you can put together to have an insight of the true purpose of the room. And if you played the original back in 2004, it'll also take you on a trip down memory lane. In my case, it took me back to my childhood, when I was a 9 years-old boy learning how to use the internet.\n\nThe game is great, it's not so hard, and if you can't logically do something, you can always click on everything like in other point'n'click games. Or, like on the good old times, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/262510/discussions/0/357288572120667654/]get together with a bunch of nice people[/url] to solve the mystery.\n\nThere's a bit of nonsense to it, specially at the end, and some of the puzzles rely on it as well. But hey, the original one had a movie of a man dancing pointing you to a safe hidden behind a fake panel on a wall, so...\n\nOther than that, the game is very good. If you're already acquainted to Crimson Room or other Escape the Room games, give this one a try, you won't regret it. And if you've never played, then this is a good one to start with.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1465607050, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1465607050, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "23536942", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506254", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1465765630, "steamid": "76561198044053079", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This was a blast from the past, but it's also definitely not the same flash game I used to be stumped by.

The puzzles can be quite challenging but some of these might need to think REALLY outside the box, for example it's just by accident that I discovered that [spoiler]moving the curtains would make the days on the calendar move forward[/spoiler].\nHowever, the new mechanics really made the experience refreshing for me and made me really like the few hours I had with it. The ending is... err... no, not gonna say that. But I'm pretty sure you're gonna exclaim at least a \"... WHAT?!\".\n\nBut now... it's time for the cons.\nThe game is REALLY short. In two or three hours you'll probably finish it (even less if you played the demo first) and the only thing that MIGHT make you continue are the achievements... but most of them are extremely simple to get, except one, maybe. Once you get everything and finish the game once... well, you won't be able to play the game anymore because by now you'll know the solution and everything will become extremely easy. You'll probably play it again only if you want to live again the experience (that's why I finished Entwined Story Mode on PS3 multiple times, for example).\nOR... you can call a friend at home, make them play and watch them struggling trying to find the solution while you look at them smiling evily because you know.\n\nI kinda wished for more content, like Crimson Room Reverse on PSP, but... eh, it's still pretty nice. I'm hoping for the realease of \"Viridian Room Decade\", \"Blue Chamber Decade\" and \"White Chamber Decade\".\n\nCan I recommend this to everyone, however? Nnnnnot really, not full price at least. Maybe wait for a price drop and remember that it's gonna be a short but tense experience.\n\nOh a final note, which I think is mostly subjective: you may get motion sickness after a while, probably due to how the area is small.", "timestamp_updated": 1477085051, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477085051, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "30673827", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513469", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1485481902, "steamid": "76561198024812228", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is not terrible -- but it has enough flaws that unfortunately do not allow me to recommend it in good conscience. [u]Crimson Room: Decade[/u] is an escape the room puzzle game with an unsettling mood. The puzzles themselves are the primary source of trouble. There are two primary ways to approach puzzle design in video games. You either create puzzles that organically come to from the games story and purpose, or, you create puzzles that might not be directly related to the game's thematic but serve as a level obstacle that rewards the player in some way, adds an element of analytical thiking to the level or extends the overall runtime of your game. Moreover, a key factor in puzzle design is the delicate balance between difficulty and purpose. You might design a unique puzzle that beautifully relates to the story [i]and[/i] serves to progress it forward, but, for instance, if the solution is not intuitive (or deductive) enough, or the gamplay is repetitive and boring, or the intended time spent on it is too long, then you might take the player out of the game and ruin the overall feel of your level.\n\n[u]Crimson Room: Decade[/u], unfortunately, does exactly that. The puzzles are challenging, sure, but not only do they feel that they were simply implanted in the game with no clear context, or purpose, but the solutions sometimes do not seem logical and the time spent on each one does not seem satisfying relative to the price of the game and the ending. This brings me to my other two supplemental criticism for this game: price and writing. For the frist, it's quite simple. I believe this game is too expensive for both the content it provides and the time spent playing it. For the latter comment, it is a bit more complicated.\n\nThe writing, in of itself, is not terrible -- but the manner by which its presented is not effective. The story is inherently convoluted, and the method by which the player figures it out does not help. You learn about your situation and why you're stuck in crimson red room by finding anachronistic pages of a journal someone else wrote. Moreover, the text is small, filled with out-of-context quotes and motif and devoid of fleshed out characters. All of this makes it hard for the player to care, particularly after solving seemingly random challenging puzzles, about the story or the characters. The ending, for example, is incredibly surrealistic, and instead of reading as a thematic twist, it just seems unnecesary and ineffective.", "timestamp_updated": 1490210616, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1490210577, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "23515812", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501007", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1482326529, "steamid": "76561198012664458", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've been a massive fan of the Crimson Room games for years; I played all four original games back in 2004, bought and played the DS and PSP ports, and bought the iPhone version too.

Some of them seemed a bit arbitrary, but par for the genre. A few times I consulted the guide to find that I had been using the right item(s) but hadn't clicked in *exactly* the right spot to activate the next step, which was annoying. Despite having multiple 'levels' (or phases) the game didn't seem to increase in difficulty or change dynamically as it progressed, which is my major complaint against it. The narrative 'plot' was a little stupid to me ('OH NOES COMMUNISM' is overdone and dated, imo) and felt tacked on. It would have been exactly the same game without the documents/letters that dictate a plot to the player.\n\nOverall: a fun, short game that will please returning fans.

There are only a couple of points of more than mild frustration where you may want to leave for an hour or a day and then return with a fresh look on things. \nSolving the puzzles is mildly rewarding. They are on the clever side but not analytical like chess games or solving a code. My biggest complaint is that on some puzzles, once solved, the resultant activity that automatically occurs has no logical bearing to the solution. For example, why would playing a record on a record player cause the door to the room to explode open? Why would smacking a light bulb cause it to thunder and lightning outside?  Why would anyone want to put a postcard in a microwave oven and then why would putting a post card in a microwave oven cause the postcard to turn into a toy boat? Minor things like that. It's a world where logic, even the shaky logic of the gaming world, does not apply. \nNote: You can reach the end of the game without reading all the hidden letters.\nThe hardest puzzle is the safe combination lock.
