But after an incredible show of dedication from the developers in addressing and fixing (nearly) every one of my complaints in the \"massive invisible\" patch, I'm finally giving the game a thumbs-up. Very impressive, guys! Previously, I felt that this game might have perhaps gotten more attention and understanding as an \"early access\" title, but now it has earned its status as a finished product, one which can be built upon. I'm confident that the small number of remaining issues left will be addressed, and even if not, they do not detract too much from the game's quality.\n\nThe puzzle design of Chuck's Challenge can only be described as some of the best you will see in any puzzle game, and that's no surprise because the game and most of its levels come from the brilliant mind of Chuck Sommerville, the man behind Chip's Challenge. While the puzzles are quite a bit smaller in comparison to Chip's Challenge, they are so deceptively simple that sometimes they blow the mind. You could spend a half-hour tinkering with a stage that's so small and simple and has such few moving parts, and in the end you can only blame yourself for not seeing that one obvious answer that was hanging in front of your nose the whole time. And that's one of the highest levels of praise I can offer to any puzzle game.\n\nThe game has some great anti-frustration features, namely the ability to undo any move at any time, and even to replay previous solutions (a brand new feature from the old versions)!! The undo functionality was previously horribly broken and allowed for bad solutions, but the \"massive invisible\" update has rewritten it from scratch seems to have made it quite bulletproof. Just be warned, if you're aiming for speed medals and records, the rewind feature won't help you much because it adds +5 seconds to your time whenever it is used, but it's great if you're trying to solve a puzzle for the first time and accidentally push a block into a corner or something.\n\nThe GUI has been criticized for being designed with touchscreens primarily in mind, but enough improvements and concessions have been made for mouse-and-keyboard users that it's not so much of a problem anymore. \n\nOh, and let's not forget to mention the level editor. Though the interface is slightly quirky, it's a cinch to hop into the editor and prototype a level idea, tinker with it, then upload it for the world to see into an ever-expanding database of user-designed levels, complete with individual leaderboards. The game has even implemented a new feature letting you click on a specially-formatted URL which will launch Chuck's Challenge and load a custom level automatically. Though it could stand to have a few more features (functionality for level packs, or some way of knowing which custom levels you've beaten), an eternal supply of user-generated content is the heart and soul of a game like this, and it doesn't disappoint.\n\nSome small quirks and bugs still exist, but they are absolutely benign compared to what they were before, and no longer detract from the core of the experience: the bliss of solving awesome puzzles. Overall, recommended for all fans of Chip's Challenge, as well as any newcomer or veteran to the block-pushing puzzle genre.\n\nHere's my upvote, developers.

Trouble is that you can't afford the slightest mistake in the whole level as it is instant death (or forever trapped).\n\nOf course, whatever the kind of level you play, the ultimate goal is to get a good rank among all the players who have succeded before you (and there are good people out there, so it's not easy to get high in the ranks).\n\nWhat's more ? There is a weekly challenge (ranked as well, of course), and you can create and share your home-made levels (there's an even achievement for that)\n\nWell, to be honest, I have to mention the controls : when trying to play for the ranking, you need as few moves as possible, so you'd like to move in a predetermined path you've selected to be the fastest (or sometimes, the only one). That is pretty hard to do : most of the time, Woop will make one more step before turning, and this step will lead you into ... water !

I wish I would've known about this sooner. It took me about 10.5 hours to beat every stage (everything up to and including flummery), but there's much more fun to be had going for more medals, weekly challenges, and using the level creator.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, you'll almost certainly enjoy this game. It's very well paced and doesn't feel repetitive - each level feels like it has a unique \"trick\" to it and they add new items and enemies at a good rate. I found the difficulty curve to be great as well - I never really got frustrated on a stage and never felt like a stage was too long. \n\nThe levels are always just the right size - unlike chip's challenge where you would not be able to see everything you need to see sometimes (due to levels being really large), this game makes it very clear and precise while maintaining a charming visual aesthetic.\n\nOne of the things that makes this game really fun is infinite undo and rapid restarting. You don't EVER have to go through a section you've already solved if you make a mistake because you can just hit backspace. If you're trying to beat a level without undoing (like making an attempt to get a high score), you can just hit R and instantly restart if you make a mistake. And as a nice touch, the timer doesn't start counting until you make your first move.\n\nThe level design is really what makes this game stand out for me. It's brimming with creativity, polish and game design expertise, no doubt building on Chuck's experience with Chip's challenge. Levels aren't simply about pushing blocks into specific positions - they might be about dodging enemies, using switches, building bridges, etc...it does an excellent job of making every level have a unique concept/central idea/key trick, leading to a plethora of satisfying \"eureka\" moments as you discover them while playing around with the level.\n\nIt doesn't just stop at being a great solitary experience - you can compete for time on every stage using the online leaderboards. At this level of play, the game does become a bit more about execution and less about puzzle solving, but still maintains an aspect of puzzling as you try to figure out the most effecient path to the goal. So, regardless of whether the execution or puzzle solving appeals to you, you'll get something out of the leaderboards. With the stages that ship with the game, you can also just replay them to try to get the silver and gold medals. There's also community-created maps and a weekly puzzle (selected from the best of the community maps each week) - so each week presents a new opportunity to test your skills against other players.\n\nOn a completely different track, you can design levels and share them with the community. There's a rudimentary voting system so you can see how people like your creations. This game gives you such a variety of tools and such a solid mechanical foundation to work with that it's an excellent platform to express your game design creativity and feel good about making something fun for other people to enjoy.\n\nDefinitely give this a go if you like puzzle games. I've played a lot of puzzle games and this game ranks up there with my top 5, maybe even top 3.", "timestamp_updated": 1422752638, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422752438, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "21418003", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501181", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1449932259, "steamid": "76561198196419397", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Here's the thing, if you like puzzle games you'll find this game interesting, the look is appealing, the dynamics are varied and offers a lot of possibilities, the community dynamic and edit/create levels option keeps the game fresh. But it still can be a bit boring or tiring sometimes, and the correlation between the character and the pets/animals/monsters is weird and unpredictable.\n\nMy recommendation is: If you like puzzle games go ahead and buy it, its cheap and worth the money, and when playing go for 2 to 3 hour rounds and exit to get the most out of it without getting tired or bored.\n\nLook, its not a perfect game, but I'm glad I bought it, and I hope my review can be of use for you to decide wether you want to buy it or not, have fun!", "timestamp_updated": 1456284907, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1456284907, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "13763228", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500872", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1462653221, "steamid": "76561198090318829", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Chuck's Challenge 3D is a fairly challenging game and lives up to its name, and while the actual gameplay is spot on with no bugs or problems, one of the  side features is what's causing a bit of concern for me as I delve into the later levels.\n\nNow I'm playing this on a Mac, so I'm not sure if this problem is happening on other platforms, but from what I've seen there have been some issues with hints. 80% of the time when I've been in need of a hint to help solve a puzzle the hint either doesn't exist at all, or is incredibly broken and does some unsmart things like pushing blocks into a corner so you can't get it out. Very rarely have I come across a hint that actually does its job without fail.\n\nNow this doesn't necessarily affect the gameplay in any aspects, but I do imagine this bugged hint system is going to cause some trouble later on when I find myself stuck and am in dire need of a hint to get me in the right direction.

I was just getting to video games at the time, but the PC started my adventure into the gaming culture.  We have two games for it at the start that got my absolute attention: Sonic CD and Chip's Challenge.\n\nChip's Challenge was a puzzle game that got my attention for days on end, and I felt accomplished when I was able to beat a level and shout in victory. Even when it was ten years later, I would boot up that computer just to play chip's challenge, and it still gives a bit of a challenge now.\n\nThis game serves as a spirtual and literal sequel to the game of old.  It has some of the charm and mechanics of the old game in it.  It has a simple plot that surrounds it.  The game even has a level editor and online support, so I await to see what special maps come out of it.\n\nFor any fans of the old Chip's Challenge, this game is definitely worth a buy.", "timestamp_updated": 1393901202, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1393901202, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "20395324", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.992838", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1441679290, "steamid": "76561197981047937", "num_games_owned": 5399, "num_reviews": 408, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "At one point I had a positive review for this, but now that the original Chip's Challenge is out again (and with an entire second game's worth of new levels!), it's hard to recommend this less-visually-appealing, slower-to-play version of the same games, especially when it locks some levels behind time-trial runs of every stage.
