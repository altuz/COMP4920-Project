It fills for me a gaming void I wasn't even fully aware existed.  I really can't recommend it highly enough, even in its still somewhat rough state, for a few reasons listed below:\n\n-It's extremely fun.  This may seem like an obvious reason to recommend a game, but I had to mention it all the same.\n\n-The developer is awesome.  You really wouldn't guess that it's from a one-man studio with the level of quality the various components show!  It's Early Access, but plays like a well-designed full release.  In my experience, there have been almost no bugs or glitches and the game runs beautifully with full quality settings enabled.  And on top of all that, the developer has been incredibly dedicated and active in continuing to improve everything... each time I've left a comment/question/suggestion/etc, the response time is incredible.  He really takes on board everything you have to say, good or bad, and responds so quickly your head'll spin!  If only more Early Access experiences were such...\n\n-It's really well-crafted.  The visuals are fantastic, the style fits the satirically humorous theme perfectly!  And if they're too smooth and 'modern' for you, you can turn on various levels of a filter that gives everything a pixel-art look.  Nice!  The music is just great and adds a great feel, and the sound effects are well-designed and programmed.  Really quality all the way.\n\n-It's really FUN!  Did I mention?\n\nIf you at all enjoy top-down shooters, ARPGs, fast-action titles, or just having fun in general, you owe it to yourself to try this out.  It'll be a joy to watch as it progresses towards a finished release.  There are only a relatively small number of levels thus far, but there's still plenty of play to be had in the build as it stands right now.  It can only get better!\n\nPS - I've been playing Tom vs TAOH quite a bit with Steam in Offline mode which doesn't seem to have accurately recorded how much time I've actually spent playing this game - it's really quite a bit more.  :)", "timestamp_updated": 1424238556, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1424238556, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "22328080", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498696", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1465823862, "steamid": "76561197994959218", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 9691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "So far so good!
