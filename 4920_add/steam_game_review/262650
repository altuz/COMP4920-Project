If you'd like to learn more look up the Text-To-3D mentioned a lot on the main website and page here. \n\nAside from that set of Text-To-3D it has a nice selection of simple tools that will allow you to make some really nice models, whether you want to just get into making models as a hobby or if you're looking to mod a game,  add items to steam workshops or use it with Unity, you can do all of that, and more...\n\nI think that I like how simple this application is to use, its straighforward, has everything there for you in clear sight. If you're worried about paying for this when you see people saying \"just use Blender, its free\" give it a shot and if you're having troubel you won't regret snagging this application, its a lot easier to use, it's not the same in many ways and has unique features and Bledner does a couple of things that this doesn't however... You're capable of doing anything that you would need in regards to modelling for any game you would like to create and or any mod content you desire to make and upload to the workshops here on steam. I mention Blender as I know it will come up if you're looking into a 3d software, they both have their pros and cons but if you're looking for something simple, straight forward and easy to learn, this will be the one to pick, blender is nice, but had a steaper learning curve for sure!\n\nRead over the features, check the site out and if you're interested, feel free to add me and ask any questions. I am a fan of this software and I will be using it to teach a couple of my close friends how to make 3d models with it because they were unable to learn Blender and the way that it worked. I personally take a lot longer to do things in Blender than in this too, and Iuse Maya professionally for work. I would happily and may very well incorporate RaySupreme 3D into my workflow for low to medium poly game assets. I very much look forward to seeing where this software goes, I would definitely say that this software is worth a serious look for any amateur or newcomer to the 3d world and even people a little more versed with 3d, it's fund to use.\n\nI apologise to the devs for mentioning Blender in this review...\n\n\nKind Regards,\nPatrick Griffiths\n\n\n.::Edit::.\nI am currently recording a set of video tutorials on using this software for making game assets and will work on making a bonus video on importing them to certain games workshops here on steam.\n\nPlaylist Link:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMOfDUrmtBQsH4JgIpN38KaXj1-W_qK_i", "timestamp_updated": 1404196791, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404143054, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "11617680", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518821", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403966330, "steamid": "76561198025021719", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "This thing crashes all the time maing it unusable.
