Then I had it for a few days and now I have a lot to say. \n\n1. The game has lackluster customization. Buy a car, pick a terrible texture, pick 2 colors. The end. \n\n2. There are multiple classes for races. The lower classes are more fun but have next to no return. More on this later. \n\n3. Multiplayer lacks any depth at all. You can't select what track you're racing on nor how many laps you're required to do. \n\n4. There is nothing to the game EXCEPT for racing. You'd think the Dev would add a \"battle mode\" or something with pickups.\n\n5. Devs: Add Split-screen multiplayer and this game could go places as a party game. \n\n6. Randomly, and I mean RANDOMLY, your car will stutter when turning and you'll slam into a wall, allowing the AI to pass you. (I think this is just poor geometry on some courses)\n\n7. Achievements and accomplishments are obviously shoehorned in. They're all \"win x races\" or \"come in x place\" or \"come in 1st with x car\"\n\n8. The ranking system is useless. What is it for? Nothing but \"achievements\" which is for their REALLY lazy unlock system. \n\n9. The AI is trash. A rank races are all but impossible thanks to this and the very lazily implemented damage system. Remember how I said I'd come back to why lower rank races are more fun? It's because the AI isn't as fast so what happens in higher ranked games doesn't happen in the lower ranked games - that is, you either spend the whole race fighting with a single AI who keeps rubbing you (you always slow down, they never do) or you'll get ahead, take corners like a sane person and get SLAMMED into from behind and instantly wind up in last. The AI literally just balls the fuck out in every. single. corner. No brakes. Slams into the walls, but maintains speed. If you slam into the wall the same way, your car either bounces in a cartoonish manner or you stop entirely while the AI keeps slamming into you (keeping you from moving) and all of them pass you. \n\nThis game itself is fun, but the frustration outweighs the fun if you actually try to unlock/progress to the A rank races. Also, the \"campaign\" has what seems like a crappy selection of races that are just randomly chosen. You sold your lower tier cars for money to get an A rank car? Haha, jokes on you, there are no A races available until you complete one of the lower tier races. \n\nI almost forgot, the track conditions seem like an afterthought as well. Snow/rain just makes the AI somehow even fucking worse (though can make for some fun slippage) but the night/dusk bullshit seem stupid considering I don't recall playing a single day race, so.... yeah. \n\nI played this game for 30 minutes, thought it was fun, bought 5 copies to give to friends and then later realized these problems. This game has a LOT of potential, but there is very little depth to the races as well. Maybe add some mild shortcuts to some of the tracks. Improve the player car outline when you're using the isometric camera (Half the time it just doesn't work at all). Add a battle mode & multiplayer splitscreen. Improve the AI so that instead of relying on them being retarded to give the player a chance (and inadvertantly doing the opposite) they just become viable yet realistic racers. Add more customization - the wheels are a fucking texture. That can't be hard to change. Maybe add an in-depth texture paint feature for the models since the textures are low-quality garb anyways. Make the ranking system mean more than just \"win races, advance!\" maybe add other kinds of achievements. (Maybe rehash the movement a bit in the game with the ability to spin your tires, better implementation of the handbrake since it's currently essentially useless) I dunno. \n\nUltimately, I do not regret buying this game or the copies for friends, but it feels like the skeleton of something great. I will gladly change my review from thumbs down to up if the Devs take a little more interest in the game and polish it up.", "timestamp_updated": 1505223616, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502025640, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "34080283", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495768", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502107314, "steamid": "76561198733303820", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "very lacking", "timestamp_updated": 1502107403, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502107403, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 140, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 32, "total_reviews": 172}}
