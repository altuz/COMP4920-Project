GoD (Graphite or Diamond) Factory is definitely the space shooter I have been looking for. It has a tremendous amount of different playstyles available, with not only a staggering number of parts for customization (this is the first game I have played in a long time in which I was happy to have a part unlock system) but also 4 different races to choose from. Also, while each races has it's own list of parts for every possible ship part, these pieces can still also be put on the ships of other races, opening up even more possible customization options. Additionally as a nice stylistic feature, almost every part of the ships you build have some effect on it's appearance, even internal ones like the power core. There is also a very nice focus on team play, plus features which actually facilitate team cooperation and communication. While the game is set to have other modes in the future, I still love the carrier assault mode that has the center of all available versions of the game so far. Finally, while I would definitely advise that you do the tutorials before playing any matches, GoD Factory is in my opinion very easy to pick up as a new player and be an effective part of your team. This is partially due to the fact that ships in this game do not die quickly. It normally takes quite a lot of effort in order to take down an enemy ship. However I should mention that there is a very good reason for this, in this game once you lose a ship it is replaced for the rest of the match by a weaker species specific drone. The drone can respawn, but every time it does so it gets a longer respawn timer. GoD Factory is a game which rewards cautious gameplay styles, or at the very least play styles that don't try to act like a one man army.", "timestamp_updated": 1428210080, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1409192696, "votes_down": 33}, {"recommendationid": "11512413", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 39, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510965", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1467371645, "steamid": "76561198020650199", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Based on alpha/beta experiances and from what I have seen during Nine Dot's Twitch streams (http://www.twitch.tv/ninedotsstudio). The game is amazing. If you enjoy masses of customisation options, team play orientated play and space sims in general, GoD Factory: Wingmen is a must buy.\n\nGraphically the game is great and the audio is equally as good, and that was even before the new BGM has been put in (and if Dual Dragon's previous work is anything to go by, this will pretty sweet too).\n\nThe gameplay requires good team coordination in order to take down the very durable carrier components which will in turn put a variety of debuffs on the pilots and carrier itself. Games themselves are relatively short, never exceeding 25 minutes, which is great for getting back to spending your hard earned credits on the customisations.\n\nThe community around the game has been great up to now and it will be great to see that grow with a full release. The devs are all very open, helpful and fun to spend time with and it was great to fly along-side of (or against) during the past few months.\n\nIn my opinion, it is definately worth checking out, and is really good value for money at the \u00a315 price tag.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1406930010, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1406930010, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "11953159", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521596", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1451874820, "steamid": "76561198028206815", "num_games_owned": 1614, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 3599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "EDIT: Sadly, while this remains a great game, the lack of players online raises a big red flag for a PvP game such as this, even though it is possible to play with and against Bots. If you pick this game up, be wary that you may not find people online to play it with. This is very sad, it's so good.\n\nThis is a great title, which is saying something coming from me - I am not traditionally a huge fan of PvP games, but this does tick the boxes: solid gameplay; interesting mechanics; rewarding intelligent and strategic teamplay.\n\nDespite playing through the tutorial, it did take me some time to get used to the carrier parts and the controls, especially as I am using keyboard and mouse, but using a controller will also give a good experience. Though it is a punishing game with a high skill cap, I find myself enjoying it, despite my lack of skill. Something to work on, I suppose.\n\nThe idea about the game itself is pretty simple. It's not a deathmatch; matches are up to 4 v 4 (including bots should you wish to do so), and the two teams try to destroy the enemy carrier (base) by destroying components (in the vein of Star Wars Battlefront II). If the two carriers are destroyed at the same time, then the team which has destroyed the most enemy gunships (your fighters) is considered the winner. The race-specific abilities and the purchasable add-ons also make the game quite interesting and refreshing, forcing people to think carefully about their resources and how to use them - the cooldowns can be crippling if something is used at the wrong time.\n\nThe game looks great, with 4 very different races available to choose from. The ship and component designs are all vividly different from one another with clear distinctions and very interesting designs. The weapons are a particular highlight, with a huge variety all looking very nice. The great look is complemented by the maps - as of Galaxy Update 1.1 (15/11/2014) - there are now 4... the two carriers and the surrounding area, including the cover you can find from man-made factories in the area or the immense statue nearby all look great. The 3 new maps all include new unique and interesting mechanics in addition to more stunning visuals. One offers damage dealing locations, one offers healing, and one has teleporters spaced around the map. This is complemented by the game's audio. The soundtrack is absolutely brilliant, I could listen to it for hours on end. The sound design for the space combat is quite good too, disregarding the impossibility of sounds being heard in space... but who cares? Music makes it more awesome.\n\nOne of the things I like most about this game is the customisation available for your ships. You start with two basic ships from two races, but are quickly able to buy more. While you do need to \"grind\" to unlock better parts - keep an eye out on the \"tech tree\" in the shop to see what you want to unlock and work towards those parts - the grind is not excessive like in some other games. The range of options available is incredible, and offers a huge range of options forcing you to make some hard decisions: do you upgrade a lower tier part to it's max level or do you skip it and use a weaker higher tier part until you can level that up? This is supported by something I quite personally like - the fact that achievements unlock further cosmetic options. This makes it interesting and fun to collect achievements if you can, while not rewarding these achievements with OP ship parts. Thus, a failure to be skilled or lucky enough to acquire an achievement will not punish you further by ensuring you will be left with comparatively substandard parts.\n\nFinally, I am pretty happy with the game developers, who are maintaining a strong presence in the community, always on top of launch issues and always happy to talk with the players and keep them up-to-date. Very, very happy with my decision to buy this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1422487900, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1409619080, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "12985164", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516763", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1491689978, "steamid": "76561198037795655", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game has a great community, though not very big.

Then I checked the game's recent statistics and found this:\n\nCurrent players: 4 (@7pm EST)\n30-day Avg: 2.3\n30-day gain: -1.9 \n\nCouple those dismal numbers with a potentially final update mentioning a new project and Wingmen's lack of profitability, and the game really starts looking like a ghost ship. It's a shame, even a short single-player campaign alone might have added enough draw and mitigated the learning curve enough to sustain an online player base. Ultimately, Wingmen shows that a few missteps early on can sink a promising multiplayer title.\n\n[Original Review]\n\nI love this game, and have played it almost every day since release. That said, I can't recommend it, at least not at the current price of $20.\n\nLet's start out with what's good. The game has an excellent engine, runs very smoothly, and has no notable lag issues. Initial match load times can be slow but after that it's generally smooth sailing to the finish. The graphics are good, not exceptional but nothing to complain about either. \n\nShips are varied, and the customization options are deep and satisfying. Taking 2 ships into each battle allows each player to prepare multiple tactics and adjust on the fly. Ships can be shared with comrades in battle. The dogfighting is solid and the carriers offer a variety of targets and strategies. A good match is a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nSo why not buy it?\n\nGFW is an online battle arena with no single player campaign of any kind. That in itself is not a problem, except that there's currently only one multiplayer gametype, with only one map. I think the deficiency here is pretty self-explanatory. I have been assured more are coming by a developer, but until then is now, it's an issue. I believe this game should be properly classified with the \"Early Access\" titles at this point.\n\nGetting a game started, especially at non-peak times, involves a lot of waiting. As of this review, the community averages 30-40 players at midday, and 80-100 peak. A full session is 8 players, and less is not nearly as much fun. The game allows you to substitute bots of varying configuration and difficulty, which would be good except that the bots currently provide better rewards than real opponents, so the lobby list is full of rooms with 1-2 people and 6-7 bots. The developer also assures me that bot rewards will be reduced soon. It can't come soon enough, in my opinion.\n\nCompounding the frustration of the small community are a variety of social features the game is lacking. It does not populate Steam's \"recent players\" list, so you have to manually search for anyone you want to friend, and then sort through the many results. It does not offer in-game voice chat of any kind. It does not offer basic options such as blocking chat from a disruptive player. There is no solution to an idle host, aside from leaving and starting a new lobby. There is no persistent squad chat, as squads are immediately disbanded after each match. Communication mid-game is bolstered by a nice team command broadcast menu, but this can't be assigned to a gamepad like everything else can.\n\nSome final notes: Gamepad support is a plus, but the recommended mappings beg to be reassigned immediately. The music is great at first, but the one extended track rapidly becomes repetitive. The tutorial is helpful and gives you a credit boost to start, but is frustratingly segmented. Notice how everything is \"good, but....\"\n\nBottom line: Unless you are a space combat fanatic, wait for more features and a lower price. You can get a hell of a lot more for $20 out of the Steam catalogue.", "timestamp_updated": 1423785773, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1410372020, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "11935008", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512033", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1409791811, "steamid": "76561197972337331", "num_games_owned": 532, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "GoD Factory: Wingmen is a fun game.

My experience with this game was really positive; it's a polished title that is a unique experience, especially among the space sim revival we're currently experiencing. I'll break particular aspects of the game down below:\n\nControls:\nI'll get this out of the way right now; this game currently does not have my joystick supported (x52) but I've been reassured by the devs that the kinks for this particular model will be worked out by launch. Despite my personal joystick not working too well, the joysticks at PAX East functioned brilliantly; the input felt responsive and smooth. A lot of the gameplay of GoD Factory doesn't rely super heavily on twitch aiming, so it's possible the finer aiming problems weren't evident. The game also allows for some really cool manuevers while still maintaining a high level of accessibility (the ideal easy to learn, difficult to master, which I think is an overarching design decision for this game as a whole). A sort of temporary newtonian mode (almost like drifting) allows for some slick, intense dogfights. \n\nCore Gameplay:\nThe standard gamemode for this is heavily strategic. It allows for teams to asses their strengths, the enemy's weakness, then assault the enemy in a manner that they deem will cripple them the most. Perhaps the enemy has a lot of lock-on missiles; destroying the radar tower would make it more difficult for target acquisition. Things like that. There's a lot of replayability in the core gameplay (carrier v. carrier) alone. In the future however, to maybe avoid things getting a bit stale, consider different carrier ships or even game modes. I don't forsee the core game getting stale for a long time though.\n\nMechanics:\nThis is where this game really shines for me. Finally, the ability to modularly construct your ship without a straight upgrade path. Heavier weapons? Well now your ship is slower. Let's put a bigger engine one...now you need more energy. Slap a bigger power core on; now you're generating more heat. There's a really smart system behind this that really allows for no single 'best build' ship.  I'm very excited to see what kind of weird builds the community comes up with. I was able to swap between mine laying ships to support/snaring ships, to sort of rocket bombers. All within the first tier of gameplay. It's honestly very head spinning, even beyond just the simple weapons. Once you delve into power cores, ship bodies/wings, computers, etc. it can almost become a game in of itself. Particular weapons don't just become more powerful either; the model that the devs have constructed allows for really slim, minimalistic ships to potentially be viable. Combining this crazy individual customization with a 4 man team is a recipe for infinite replayability. Think Dota 2 meets X-wing. \n\nI almost forgot combos: Weapons have damage types that can potentially be combined with other damage types that allow for combos to form. I can't imagine how difficult/awesome it's going to be to pull off some of the higher level tier combos with my friends.\n\nGraphics/Audio:\nPersonally, graphics aren't a major factor for me. Especially with a game like this that has such strategic depth. I will say that the art style is definitely unique, and I'm very happy to report that your customized modular ships actually change appearance with every part. That, to me, means that the graphics definitely do their job. It also allows the game to be a lot more accessible hardware wise, which is great for the potential esport future of this game.\n\nOverall:\nTo summarize my beta/PAX experience, this game looks really solid and I'm furious I can't play it right now. The game is accessible for gamers who aren't 'pilots' but allows for seasoned aces to pull off some awesome stuff. It has an interesting gameplay mode with an incredibly in-depth ship building mechanism that is dizzying in depth.

The gameplay is very fast and it's a lot of fun once you get the hang of flying. I would advise turning the sensitivity up as it's set very low initially and feels a bit difficult to turn.

Its a nice balance of arcady dog fighting action and pseudo simulation space combat.\n\nYou want to feel like Luke Skywalker fighting off the Deathstar? Fly in to the enemy ship take out their shield generator, then hit their core and by the time you finish that off the enemy carrier is about to go up in smoke.\n\nIt has a really interesting hit and run mechanic. It takes time to repair your ship, which can mostly only be done in the docking bay of your own carrier. Also burning through ammo happens pretty frequent. So it really encourages you to go back to the dock and swap out your ships to repair/reload your old one.\n\nThe ship customizing is a lot of fun. There are a lot of variables to take in to account to customize your fighter. Slow ships seem like they'll be better at defending your own carrier. Fast ships with light payloads seem better for hit and run tactics on the enemy carrier. But if you're to slow at hit and running the enemy carrier parts may heal up your damage. So, maybe its better to take more ammo or higher damaging weapons, but then it'll slow you down and make it harder to run away in a dog fight. So many things to consider, and so much fun to be had.\n\nIts also nice that fighter parts aren't 100% better upgrades. You can level up parts to make them stronger, but they come at the cost of requiring more energy, heat, or weight. So sometimes it is better to go with a lower level part just so you don't weigh yourself down and can boost for longer and faster. This also means that low level ships when you first start do have some small advantages over higher level ships. While you don't be able to stand toe to toe with the highest level guys, you still won't be completely screwed either.\n\nAlso, unlocking and leveling up parts is at a very steady progression. When you first start the game you'll have more credits then you know what to do with. But after that you won't have enough credits to get what you really want, but it only takes about 2 games to get enough credits to unlock what you want. So it never feels too grindy.\n\nThe current game community is really small. But I personally have been having a lot of fun still just playing against Bots. I've been in one game with 4v4 and the game completely changes. Suddenly those hit and run tactics aren't so effective against players (because bots are stupid).  But I assume its still viable, just need to rethink it a bit.\n\nI feel this game is the perfect level of space sim and arcade dog fighting action. For example, it's really satisfying to fly past an enemy fighter, do a quick 180 degree maneuver, cut out the engines for a sec to continue to drift forwards and blow your enemy to ribbons as they attempt to do the same thing. Some real epic space combat there.\n\nI highly recommend this game. Its awesome.

However all of this simply makes the game somewhat more bittersweet in its failures. As is so often the case with these sorts of beautiful battle arena type games, Two factors in particular have led to the writing of this review. Either by itself would probably not be an issue, but combined they have made the game an exercise in frustration.\n\nFirstly is the slow matchmaking. Matches take a full 8 players every time, and will not start with less. One person sitting Afk in a lobby can completely stall up an entire match and force you to go looking for another one. The host can kick them, but as half the time the host is the one AFK, this does not help much. Half the time quickmatch will que you back with the same said afk person for several minutes before finding you a new lobby. Admittedly however, dev's do seem to be working on this.\n\nSecondly is imbalance. Matches will quite often throw you as a rank amateur against teams of entirely seasoned vets/aces. This might not be an issue if the game autobalanced to give lowbies a better chance, but sadly it does not. And where as you would hope most of the community would want a fair fight, it is more often than not that you will enter a lobby only to find a team of max rank individuals fighting a team of complete rank 1/2 newbies. With very few people willing to give up said obvious highground it is often about as fruitless as being with the afk people because no lowbie dares want to hit ready and start up that obvious loss. Like with the AFK hosts, you will often find yourself thrown back up against the same team of all max ranks 3-4 times till hopefully another match pops up, or like I did, you stop playing. Once again, according to a response by devteam, this is an issue they are working on, but at the moment it is still an issue on nonetheless. Hopefully as the game progreses these things will become nonissues, and we can all enjoy some dogfighting. \n\nEdited~ A swift response from Dev's informed me I was incorrect about slates not being wiped before official launch and I have redacted my complaint on the matter.", "timestamp_updated": 1409518921, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1409481175, "votes_down": 6, "developer_response": "Hello there,\nfirst thing I want to say is that every account has been wiped out just before the launch and no one that played the Beta had still their unlock. What you saw was people that played the game and unlock their things hard and fair.\n\nAs for the matchmaking, we could not have it ready for launch as there was still some major issues with it and could not get it to work in time. It's something we are going to add in a patch in the next few weeks.\n\nWith the matchmaking system, people will be able to be matched with other player their skills and more likely with balanced ships. Until then, what we can do to help people finding other player's their level would be to add the average ship class as a game option or something like that.

I'm certainly not the first and definitely not the last person to say this, but this is the first game in quite a while that has given me a legitimate reason to want to buy a joystick.\n\nFirstly if money is a factor that makes you hesitate then at the time I'm writing this I would hold off for a bit, as the game is majorly PvP centric and getting a good match going can be difficult at the moment due mainly to a low population. You can play against bots but players are always the better choice, and the bots don't exactly go easy on new players even at low ranks. There is a major update incoming as well as a free weekend so if this interests you keep and eye and give it a shot while its free.\n\nThe game itself has a lot of depth, which is both good and bad. I personally really enjoy the detail that goes into building your own personal ship as well as the great deal of options in game of both tactics and maneuvers, however there is a LOT to learn, which can certainly get in the way of getting comfortable playing the game. It can be rather daunting starting out but I found that it gets better and better the more you learn. One mistake thats easy to make is getting too hung up on ship setups and equipment. Most weapons and such handle similarly enough (there are of course exceptions) that a player whos got good control skills will do well and one without will almost always do poorly, so I would focus more on getting the gameplay control down before worrying too much about trying to make a super flying deathmachine.\n\nMost of the regular players are quite friendly and can give some pretty good advice.\n\n\nShip Customization:\n\nThere are tiers of ship parts, for the core frame parts (wings, body, cockpit) the higher tiers are generally higher stats but higher requirements as well, so higher end is generally stronger if you can fit it in.\n\nSome special parts such as abilities and special equipment often have radically different effects with a same basic idea behind them per tier, so while higher may cost more it will not always be better performance wise depending on what you want to use it for.\n\nweapons work similarly to the core parts but with the damage types and constraint limits with many high end parts, as well as the flexibility of having two wing weapons, maximum tier versions of the weapon are not always the best choice.\n\nShip constraints are determined by parts such as the body, and generator and such, however the constraints themselves are not hard capped, you can exceed the constraints and take a penalty based on what category you're exceeding, which scale based on how much you exceed by. It is quite possible to make and exceptional ship that goes over its constraint limits but is generally something you'll want to avoid.\n\noverall - lots and lots of details, this can be very overwhelming but a solid basic setup will still perform well and doesn't need to be overanalyzed when starting out. I personally love the level of detail that can go into ship building but this can be a negative as well for some players\n\n\nControls: \n\nPersonally I found the default mouse and keyboard controls to be a bit awkward at first, after getting used to them a bit it worked very well, but I did end up changing them so I would conflict too much with other games I play as switching back and forth between control schemes with some similarities was more trouble then it was worth to me, but with a few minor adjustments it works great. Also there's word that the new version (incoming fairly soon) will have altered default controls to match up more closely with more commong Mouse+keyboard schemes players may be familiar with. And although I don't have access to a setup regularly the game is a blast with a good joystick.\n\nThere are a wide variety of built in maneuvers available to the player and they're flexible enough to be used in a very wide variety of ways to create some pretty crazy maneuvers.\n\noverall - Has a significant learning curve but I feel the controls are solid, and offer enough options and flexibility to create a good non-restrictive experience\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game itself currently consists of two teams fighting to destroy eachothers carriers, it has Moba style objectives where killing the oposing team players does offer and advantage but if not capitalized on doesn't garuntee anything.\n\nCurrently there is one map with several new ones reportedly coming in the next update, however I'd also like to add that the map is varied and balanced enough that with the way the game plays I would say that this is not a problem.\n\nDogfighting is important but as above with kills is not anywhere near the end all of how to win or even play. Ultimately the carrier is what matters and your ability to either stop the enemies attack force or simply outdo their offense with your own will determine the match. Additionally carriers have a main cannon that will periodically fire at eachother creating a limit to how long a match can last, with a draw being determined by either most gunship kills (a players main ship) or additionally the teams overall score if kills were even as well.\n\nThe carrier has several destroyable parts such as a radar, repair station, shield generator, which when destroyed inflicts a different penalty on the opposing team as well as suffering damage to their overall carrier integrity. This allows for many different approaches on how to take out the carrier, from going for surprise attacks on undefended parts, crippling the enemies ability to resupply and radar range, or even going for maximum carrier damage by stripping its defenses.\n\nIt's also important to note that players themselves can be harder to destroy than might be expected, often requiring at least two players to garuntee a kill before an experienced player can escape to relative safety, however losing a ship can be a major loss to a team or individual, as a lost gunship is permanently out for the rest of the match. A player is allowed to bring two seperate gunships into a match and they may not have any overlapping parts (with 4 different races to pick from even building two ships for similar roles and performance is quite doable), and a lost ship is replaced with a standard drong ship for that race, which are generally weak stat wise but cannot be ignored as they can still turn the tide of a battle as well as not costing the team any points towars a tiebreaker if the drone is destroyed as it will respawn. Also players are allowed to request to share ships with another of their teammates giving both players free access to eachothers ships for the rest of the match, altho the rules for losing ships remain even if another player is piloting one of your ships.\n\noverall - a unique game with a focus more on team objectives than a straight forwards deathmatch. There is as much place on a team for a player who wants only to shoot down enemy fighters as well as a player who wants to focus solely on bombing the carrier. Survival is also quite important as you may lose an edge with too many gunships lost, but kills alone don't decide the match and a team can lose many more ships than the opponent and still come out significantly on top.\n\n\n\nFinal notes, again at the time of writing this there is an update incoming and reportedly shortly after this game will be available for a free weekend so if this interests you at all, keep an eye out.", "timestamp_updated": 1413568605, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413568605, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 106, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 49, "total_reviews": 155}}
