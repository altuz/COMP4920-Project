I've played it off and on since it was first released thru Reflexive Arcade back in '03. Which is also the source of the \"reflex boosted\" powerup icon, if anyone didn't know =) I've bought this game a number of times on a number of platforms since then, and will happily buy it again if it comes out on some other thing I own! Where do I even start...\n\nGraphics - 3/5 No, they aren't spectacular compared to many...or any...of the AAA titles that have come out in the last few years. It is a top down, twin stick shooter, what are you really expecting here? Everything can be clearly and easily identified, and doesn't hurt to look at. Nothing spectacular, but then...I doubt that's what anyone was going for. Good enough really is good enough!\n\nStory - lol/wtf Once upon a time, there was a guy standing in the middle of a field for no reason. For no reason, aliens and spiders and beetles and zombies all started running at him. For equally no reason, all sorts of guns and powerups appear from the corpses of these things. Guy kills things until the reaper gets him. That's it, that's a summary of the story, narrative, and all the characters. What, were you expecting some Dickensian struggle? Some moral dilemma? Nope. Top down. Twin stick. Shooter. Kill things until you die. That's it, that's all there really needs to be for the genre.\n\nSound - 4/5 Both at home and at work, for varying reasons, I play without sound usually. However, I do really like the soundtrack for Crimsonland! Best described with *slow heavy metal music plays*. It fits the rest of the game experience, without being too repetitive or irritating. My wife dislikes all the gunfire...sorry, can't be helped lol! The death sound is great for laughs tho!\n\nControls - 5/5 It is, as stated, a top down twin stick shooter. The controls are intuitive and responsive, simple and complete, easy to change. I see no way this could have been better.\n\nBalance - 3/5 Good difficulty curve, except for any level involving spideroids. Seriously, fuck those things.\n\nGameplay - 5/5 Over the years, me and my employees have sunk literally thousands of combined hours into this game, between survival, and some of the hidden minigames. There is the right combination of luck and skill and planning involved to make different playthrus feel actually different and not repetitive. Hell, the monster spawns are more or less \"procedural\" and random in survival, maybe they can cash in on the \"roguelike\" tag that has become so abused and misused lately ;)\n\nOverall - 4/5 Balance in the campaign mode gets a bit rough in places, but overall, this is a very solid offering for the genre. Price is right. A great buy for any fan of the genre!", "timestamp_updated": 1503302052, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503302052, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33417625", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503546", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1491695122, "steamid": "76561197977375908", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Simple and fantastic.
