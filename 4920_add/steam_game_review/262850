There are more set pieces, with even better subtle animation highlights, more cutscenes and the cast has grown. The on point writing with super cheesy jokes remains top notch and this time around the puzzles involve a lot less backtracking. The price is still a slight bit of contention, about 3 hours of content for $11. SkyGoblin was smart however and both Chapters 1&2 can be had for $15 which seems a lot more reasonable a price for what you get in both games combined. I think that if they continue to be smart they will bundle the upcoming third chapter with the first two for an even $20 and it will be a perfect package.", "timestamp_updated": 1504301062, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504300992, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 119, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 124}}
