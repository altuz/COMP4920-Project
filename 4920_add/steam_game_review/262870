Apart from the epic title music, there's no other music in the game. The sound effects are minimal. The interface is unhelpful and the mission progress is baffling. The game is nearly unplayable.\n\nThe most frustrating element is that the tasks are incredibly vague and difficult to locate. This game is mostly about finding small things like watches or footprints, but the graphics are so poor that these are nearly impossible to locate and the game does not make it any easier to identify. To make things worse, the game doesn't even tell you what to look for. Mission 5 involves searching for a red hat, but when you get to the area you waste time looking for a hat, but you're actually meant to find footprints that lead to the next clue area.\n\nThe stamina system is unworkable. You get tired from running or riding the bike - which is fair - but there are only two ways to regain stamina: either wait, or buy energy bars. Waiting is unfeasible because you only have a few minutes to complete each mission. Energy bars cost points, which are earned by completing missions. However, EVERYTHING you buy and use is persistent. If you use an energy bar and then abort the mission, the game saves that, which means you lose both your points and your item even though you left the mission. You could literally make the campaign unbeatable and you have to start another one from scratch.\n\nThe game is also buggy. On mission failures (very common when you're not told what to look for), the game may not take you back to the menu and you cannot quit the game, forcing you to force-quit the game.\n\nPresentation is mystifyingly poor. There is NO ambient noise. No birds, no animals, no wind, no water. The visuals are downright lazy. There are perhaps five tree models and the same tree has clearly copy/pasted into an area to save time. The items are often plain models without any skins rendered. Then there are invisible walls everywhere. Don't touch water by the way: water is death!\n\nThe worst thing is that the title is an outright lie. Except perhaps \"Recovery\", since you spend most of your time finding lost hats and mp3 players. This is certainly no simulation. You go to this vague waypoint, look for something undefined, click on it, and done. There's no rescue or first-aid or any interactivity AT ALL.\n\nThe game basically allows you to cheat in order to get through the levels. You can call in a helicopter to take you ANYWHERE on the map at the cost of points, which is desirable and less expensive than having to ride there and consume energy bars. And if that doesn't excite you, by aborting the mission, you unlock the next mission anyway.\n\nThere are 40 something missions and they are literally all the same.\n\nI'm a sucker for these cheesy little buys, but this isn't even worth the low cost. You are buying a headache. Playing this will necessitate a search & rescue for your sanity.\n\nVideo review here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM3u3X-iNO4", "timestamp_updated": 1389432901, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1389330798, "votes_down": 18}, {"recommendationid": "8634070", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 237, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693079", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1394539397, "steamid": "76561198027908472", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "You don't play this game free roam.\nYou play missions that are pre determined.\nThe gameplay is not bad....BUT\n\nYou get an objective like \"go find this thing\" and on the map it is supposed \"high-light\" the  location of where to start searching for said thing or person.\n\nI've played about 7 missions so far and was only able to complete 3 - 4 of them because the map location is not showing up.\n\nI really hope this gets updated...gets add-ons etc.\n\nI believe it would be a very fun simulator.\n\n\nAs of now I cannot recommend this game because to me it seems as though it is in \"Alpha\" stage.\nFrom what I see this is supposedly a completed game.\n\nIf this isn't alpha this it has some rather annoying bugs that need to be fixed.\n\nWhat I like:\n\n-Graphics.    --On the fantastic setting they're beautiful.\n-Concept.\n-Gameplay.

Fail? No problem, just keep going. It's not like you'll be doing anything different anyway.\n\nI am absolutely baffled as to why I paid $11 for this - lured in by that epic starting music I suppose. I spent a good thirty minutes repeating mission three trying to find the next set of animal prints after finding the first. They don't seem to exist. Sure, there's a couple stags running around, but nothing within the ridiculous red-circle-of-searchiness you'll be chasing throughout the entirety of the missions at hand. Some woman's pocket watch? Failed. Not enough time because I was too busy riding my bike like a madwoman trying to get to another poorly-designed log cabin. Let's go chase a hat instead, shall we?\n\nAmbient sounds, music, animal design...they're all lacking, with the first two nonexistent. Enjoy the pitter-patter of your own feet, or the vacant emptiness as you zoom along on a bike with your thumbs obviously up your bum because you darn sure aren't holding the handle-bars. \n\nGameplay is laughable when it comes to the graphics at hand. Look to your left, look to your right, and see the same thing, with a few smoothed hills. Try to turn up the draw-distance because you *know* a game like this is something your GeForce GTX 780Ti can handle. Hah! Think again, as you will get constant freezes every 5-10 seconds that last 2 seconds themselves before you can continue. I had to turn the draw so far down it was like I was in the map editor of Deer Hunter on Windows 95 all over again (if memory serves me right...perhaps the editor was superior and I am not doing it justice).\n\nTake it from me, this game is complete and utter rubbish.
