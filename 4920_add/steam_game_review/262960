If you're into chiptune music, you won't be disappointed.\n- Exploring and backtracking is encouraged and rewarding.  There are secrets everywhere, and most of them require a good eye or an upgrade you'll acquire later in the game.  There are plenty of optional bosses, upgrades, and money to be found.  Weapons and armor that are sold are generally affordable if you've been exploring everything.\n- Most bosses are balanced.  While some of them seem brutally difficult at first, after you learn their attack patterns, you'll be kicking yourself for not beating them sooner.\n- Magic is fun and intuitive to use.  Casting magic requires it to be charged similar to Megaman's charged shots, but it has unlimited uses, making it great for tearing up normal monsters as well as bosses that have limited windows of vulnerability.\n- Bonus content for completionists!  I won't spoil anything, but getting 100% ties up a few loose ends in the story.\n\nSounds fun!  So what's wrong with the game?\n- Instant death traps.  Not a big issue early on, but by the second half there's so many instant death spikes, you begin to wonder why the game even gave you a health bar.  There are several instances of spikes dropping from the ceiling that are near impossible to avoid without knowing about them ahead of time.  This kind of platforming can be enjoyable, but it was poorly implemented here, mostly due to the next issue:\n- Save points.  The game is balanced enough for the first half of the game that save points aren't an issue, but as the platforming becomes more difficult, the save points feel further and further apart.  Not only that, but the placement of save points are poorly done as well.  There are a few boss fights where save points are several screens away in either direction, leaving you at risk of instant death before you can even reach them.  Nothing more frustrating than beating a boss and dying before you can even save.\n- Warp points.  For a game that prides itself on exploration and backtracking, there aren't nearly enough warp points.  This game is massive, and even getting to a warp point can take a while.\n- Broken/glitched bosses.  In a single playthrough, I encountered 2 bosses that stopped attacking and moving completely in the middle of the fight, making it an easy win but an empty victory.  Another boss was shifted from its usual movement pattern when it was hit with my magic attack, making the fight nearly impossible to win.  \n- Lack of equipment swapping on the fly.  When you first find new weapons/armor/magic, you have about 2 seconds to decide if you want to equip or not.  After that, you can only change your loadout at save points.  When some bosses are very hard to beat without a particular type of magic, you are practically forced to die over and over while you test each type of magic to see what works.\n- Some secrets are too well hidden.  While most secrets can be found with a good eye (cracks in the wall, etc.), some are just flat out too hard to find.  We're talking illusory walls with absolutely no hints.  Spending hours jumping into every wall in hopes of a secret is not fun.\n- No map.  I don't know what they were thinking with this one.  A Metroidvania platformer of this size with no map is just ridiculous, especially with the amount of secrets that are in the game.\n\nSo would I recommend this game?  It's tough to say.  I loved the music and almost all of the boss fights, but my mind keeps going back to the frustration of cheap instant death traps and having to repeat those areas over and over.  I imagine anyone just doing a casual playthrough would have a pretty good time, but if you plan to go for 100% completion, well, don't say I didn't warn you.", "timestamp_updated": 1505934742, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505844549, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35103940", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506689982, "steamid": "76561197970838644", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 210}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "THE best metrovania game i have ever played. but it is much more than just another metroidvania game. full of secrets little bits that make logical sense.
