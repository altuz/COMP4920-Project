I admit I was disappointed at first  to see no mouse compatibility in-game, it's played entirely with keyboard. Just a preference of mine I always hope to see, but I shouldn't be surprised there isn't one here.\nI only encountered one small bug with the in-game pause menu but this may only be an issue for me.\n\nThere is a huge lack of options under the settings with just fullscreen on/off, difficulty, key bindings and one other which I don't know what it is. This doesn't bother me at all, but is something others might want to take into account.\nThere is no customization for your ship whatsoever that I can see. Powerups are temporary and primarily obtained by destroying enemies, otherwise there is no weapon or ship upgrades. You can flip your ship around for slower, more accurate attacks and dodging. The dodging seems forced in some areas however to get you to actually use your ship on it's side, because it's very easy to just leave your ship flat and spam the two, faster guns.\nAlso I didn't seem to notice a scoreboard, though I did notice something about my score being uploaded. I'm not sure if there's a place online to view leaderboards; it would be nice as that is the game's point.\n\nI'm giving this a thumbs up, why? Because for it's price this game is an amazing grab. The controls are responsive, the game is pleasing to look at; the hit-boxes are forgiving, maybe too forgiving for your enemies, but that can just add to the challenge. So there's only one level? So this is only $2.00 and I think a lot of work went into this for that price despite what it lacks. I'm enjoying this game for what it is, who isn't going to give a game a thumbs up if they're enjoying it?", "timestamp_updated": 1392881432, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1392881432, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "10694364", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502259", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403493082, "steamid": "76561197982644570", "num_games_owned": 1158, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Avoid.\n\nI've been a shmup player for years, and this game is boring and derivative.  The \"feel\" is all wrong, nothing moves with any aggression.  The player's shot type is very strange and oddly small, making precision aiming a requirement.  The combo system sucks because there are huge stretches of time where no enemies appear on screen; you're limited to chaining the very simple groups the trot out onto the screen mindlessly.  Maybe it gets better, I couldn't tell, I can only play the game for a minute at a time before it freezes and I have to kill the runaway process from the Task Manager.\n\nI have no idea what the sound design is like, because all I hear is static.  The developer quickly blames this on codec packs and capture software, and the solution is \"uninstall them\".  Apparently just to presence of these things is enough to cause issues.  Maybe software conflicts made sense in the Win9x days, but there's absolutely no excuse for it today.  The real issue is the audio subsystem he depends on.\n\nSome users report the game boots to a blank screen.  I didn't bother to read the thread on that.\n\nThe game hasn't been updated since it was published.  Considering how the developer is handling feedback on the forums, I wouldn't expect any either.

The is due to a issue with the game. It uses the LAV Audio codec, and it conflicts with people using the K-lite Codec pack or the CCCP codec pack. If you have either one of those installed on your PC, you can't play this game. \n\nIMHO, having to remove a Codec pack which lots of users have today for various things (Video editing being one), and not having ANY way of adjusting the in-game audio (there are ZERO controls for audio adjustment), doesn't justify the price. \n\nI gave this game as much of a chance as my ears could bear, but to no avail.

The first screen looks awesome, and then it stops, moving beehive cells are your background, throughout everywhere, I'm not sure if they really tried to be unique or simply got lazy half ways but same ol enemies bland backgrounds, with really bad powerups make this game very forgetable.

Maybe if you were high on something might you find this game entertaining, the background sort of pulses and you can shoot some of the level away.
