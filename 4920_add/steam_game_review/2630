Single Player has, in my opinion, the most intense WWII gameplay that I've ever played. I remember playing the demo back when that came out and being in absolute awe with how great the sound effects were. On point. Graphics have aged but still doesn't look half bad. It's a fun, striaghtforward campaign playing through the Russians, British, and last the American armies.\n\nMultiplayer has died since it's popularity in it's days, but this game's MP was maybe the best MP experience I've had the pleasure of having, comes close to memories with Battlefield 2. I was in 2 different clans and played a hell of a lot of matches by myself or with friends. It's simple, it's rewarding in terms of gaining skill to be better at, dedicated servers and mods, and just a lot of fun. Something that the new Call of Duty games and even the future one's will never touch. \n\nCall of Duty WWII won't even come close to this game. And those that disagree, sorry you're too young to appreciate a game that doesn't need to give you handicaps and aids to make you better, or worthless cosmetics, or any of that shit they pull now. If you want to play a real Call of Duty game, definitely give this one a shot."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505436301, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34960881", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198356235394", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1505355248, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 616}, "timestamp_updated": 1505436301, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Call of Duty 2 is a FPS set in World War II, where you play as a soldier from each major Allied power: the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union.

The base game is wonderful, possibly the best CoD in terms of story IMO, and despite the aged graphics it doesn't feel clunky at all; despite its looks, it feels great and is a joy to play.
