In a gaming world where we've stopped complaining about clones and accepted them as the norm, novel gameplay is as rare as hens' teeth.  In this way, Bot Colony is well worth your time, attention, and support.  That alone deserves my thumbs up.\n\nThat said, though it has been getting worked on for quite some time, it looks a bit dated, and the actual gameplay in Bot Colony is really klunky. It could be worse, but the things it does well are the things most players are not going to notice, and the things it does poorly are showstoppers.\n\nIf you have ever played an old school text adventure, you might understand the frustration of trying to wrap your head around the developer's means of communication.  How do you tell a robot to place a shaker of salt exactly how it looks like in a picture?  I have no idea, the AI is smart enough to put it on the table to the left of a coffee maker and that's no minor achievement in programming, but I can't figure out how to tell it to put it down exactly where it needs to be.  I guess that kind of difficulty makes sense when you add 3D space to a text adventure.  Anyway, I have not been able to get past the tutorial.\n\nOne thing they keep trying to add to Bot Colony is voice recognition, but I have yet to see it working particularly well.  Basically, they're thinking it would be really cool if they have an AI you can talk to with your voice and that AI can do things for you, and they've been spending a lot of development time on getting that to work.  As a player, I would have preferred they fix the gameplay problems first, but I guess they develop other products that make use of voice recognition so that's their agenda.  Fortunately, you can also type your commands.\n\nAs for the long development time, behind the scenes there have been some major financial issues, and this has slowed progress on the game quite a bit, to the point where it's fair for a player to wonder who is left to work on it?  Lately, the game seems to somehow be making progress, so that's encouraging.  I hope these guys continue to put out novel game concepts.", "timestamp_updated": 1499488248, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499483383, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33615822", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498853", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500292712, "steamid": "76561198050322529", "num_games_owned": 1097, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "When I first played this I actually wasn't a fan since the controls felt kinda weird (and my computer was kinda shit back then which clearly didn't help :p). I also wasn't too sure on what to do and how to interact with robots.\n\nWhen I started it again though a few days ago, I realized pretty fast that a lot about the game had changed and that the devs had put a sh*tload of work into their game.\nIt \"feels\" pretty good now and interacting with the robots, figuring out how you get the answer you want/need out of them and teaching them new stuff was a lot of fun and I'm already looking forward to play the third episode.\n\nUsually the achievements are what make me play a game in first place but here they were just the cherry on top.
