Despite the simple voxelized graphics, the devs clearly put in effort to make the game ascetically pleasing. Their choice in color scheme was clearly well thought out, and enemy design is attractive.  From an auditory standpoint, the game is honestly lacking.  The music isn't awful, but it's not anything special either.  The narrator is really annoying from an adult point of view - however, I'm pretty sure a kid would be highly amused by both the narration and the narrator.   \n \nThe powerup system is honestly pretty cool, as you get both semi-permanent and one time use powerups that you may equip.  These are dropped by both enemies and treasure chests, as well as available to craft in town.  You also gain experience and level up as you go, which does offer significant performance boosts.\n \nThe gameplay itself is where the game is lacking. Although bug-free and smooth, the gameplay is simply boring.  There is little challenge, and there aren't enough styles of gameplay for my tastes.  Yet, a gaming newcomer or child would probably find this game pretty enjoyable. \n \nIf you're looking for a well-made cheap game with roguelike, dungeon-grinding elements this game is for you.  I'd say it's worth the $0.99, and really does offer value for how much you're paying.", "timestamp_updated": 1495386850, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495386850, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31923372", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1495650822, "steamid": "76561198031124188", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "You know what?

Some what of low polygon graphics, interactive gameplay, beautiful music and the price of one dollar \u2013 sounds like a sick mix to get busy for a few evenings. \n\nI\u2019ve spent quite some time playing this game. I enjoyed it for a bit but then I was triggered. I can\u2019t believe that it\u2019s not in an early access since there are a few bugs and glitches that I\u2019ve encountered. I\u2019ll start with a few things that I liked and I think are awesome.\n\nFirst of all, the best part of the game, in my opinion, is the variety of enemies. There are a lot of them and all of them are different. It feels great when your dungeon has melee and ranged enemies at the same time. Moreover, killing lots of them in a limited space is challenging. Also every time you start a new round mobs are randomly generated via MobMaker 9000 which is great also because if you want to replay a level, the game or whatever it\u2019s not going to be the same experience. \n\nAs for the powerUPs in this game, they are cool too! There are a lot of them and you can combine all of them in one mix and enjoy your play through :J. However, what I didn\u2019t like that they are limited. It makes no sense, frankly, it only creates frustration. There\u2019s no way someone is going to go for the fire rate max build. Also there are a lot of crates and objects on each level which can be destroyed. So, devs, do you expect us to use our really expensive powerUPs to do so?? For me that makes no sense. Thus, after act 2 I stopped buying anything and finished the game without them. Honestly, I came here for the \u2018bullet hell\u2019 kind of experience and I didn\u2019t get it. But still you got a credit for creative powerUPs.\n\nNow I\u2019d like to address some issues that I didn\u2019t like and they actually triggered me.\n\nThe shooting mechanics. OMG, my bullets didn\u2019t go through powerUPs, coins WTF? Excuse me, but this is INSANE. You can be really good at shooting and etc but if your enemy dies all the coins/drops from it they start to follow you that\u2019s why you can\u2019t kill the next enemy because it\u2019s hiding behind the coins. Moreover, if you encounter a large pack of mobs and you start shooting in every direction the closest mobs die and they create some kind of cover for the next enemies. This is a joke seriously! You can be in your tier 5 GREEN RANGE armor and still get hit because of that. \n\nSometimes mobs behave weird. They jump out of the rooms, some of them freeze, and some of them don\u2019t attack. \n\nOkay, let\u2019s also talk about the doorways\u2026 Why aren\u2019t they transparent? I lost a lot of armor because I couldn\u2019t tell if someone\u2019s hiding there. You just can\u2019t tell. That\u2019s bad.\n\nAll of the points above are controversial and you can ask me what did you expect from a one USD$ game? I agree with you but here\u2019s the real reason why I give this game a negative review. \n\n[h1]TRUE STORY HERE. I finished act 4 round 4 and teleported to the final boss. I started the fight but then a pizza delivery guy knocked at my door. So, I stopped the game got my pizza, opened a can of beer and decided to take a break from the game for about 10 mins. I alt-tabbed!!! After I finished my can of beer, I opened the game again and guess what? There was NO BOSS!!! I was walking around the arena for about 2 minutes and decided to restart the game. When I restarted the game it gave me achievement that I finished act 4 but didn\u2019t kill the boss (which is true). So, I decided to restart the game and then go and kill the boss. And here we GO!!!!! The game jumped on ACT 1. Not only it didn\u2019t let me to enter to the arena but also it just jumped to the start of ACT 1. So, I\u2019m not putting any more time in playing this game since I didn\u2019t kill the last boss because of the glitch. And all of this happened after I put quite some time playing this game.[/h1]\n\nI would still recommend this game if it was an early release, but it\u2019s a \u2018finished\u2019 game! So, it\u2019s not even about the price it\u2019s about the quality. And don\u2019t even talk about the price. It is not an excuse. It\u2019s like comparing allegro coffee to a double double from TimHortons! Double double is also tasty.\n\n[spoiler]I'm sorry, I'm a bit mad but I wish devs to fix this game and release a new patch![/spoiler]", "timestamp_updated": 1493432598, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493432131, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 68, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 46, "total_reviews": 114}}
