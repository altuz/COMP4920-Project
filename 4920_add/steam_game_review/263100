This raises a pertinent question. Is Media portrayals of loved ones a more fitting tribute and force that can do good than the simple old granite slabs that we hide in places known as cemeteries where seldom humans dare to tread?\n\n[u]Release Date: 12 Sep, 2013[/u]\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\n20,000 people lost their life to this tsunami off the Japanese coast in 2011. Contrary to popular belief this game does not depict the lives of known victims, nor does it present a solemn list of names on which to pontificate in the end. Instead from a first person perspective your lead across a serene beach following the trail of a glowing butterfly which is a Japanese symbol for the soul. These butterflies will lead you to dark silhouettes that represent lives cut short, their stories being trapped in precious items that have washed ashore. When you find the hidden butterfly trapped in the item in question, the soul moves on and you then follow another butterfly that flutters ahead to the next shadow and soul waiting to be released. Eventually your confronted by the myriads of butterflies and shadowy figures and their stories which the waves/deluge have covered over.\n\nThe problem is that just as a tombstone is too dry and really inadequate to properly commemorate the tumult of any human life lossed, 9.03m is really no better and is pretty shallow in length, meaning and design to be a longlasting force of good. Players interactions with the precious items in question seem fleeting, frivolous, flotsam. Maybe that was the motto? We have no way on Earth that currently really honours the lives lost and our personal memories of those people are a personal symphony mingling beautiful musical notes covering when things fall silent.\n\nAll in All [u]9.03m[/u] is a really nice short Game!\n\n9/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep[/i]", "timestamp_updated": 1503527153, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503527153, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 387, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 62, "total_reviews": 449}}
