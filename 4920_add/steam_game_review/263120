At first everything is hard the controls are really weird and it's just you talking to your spaceship. After about 30 minutes of walking around you kind of get a feel for the game and everything begins to make since......\n\nThe game: You are a robot named Ludwig where you crash land on planet earth, you are a simple robot with a very intelligent spaceship ( that helps you every step of the game). Your goal is to explore and find and discover every element we know......for example we know how to make a fire but Ludwig does not. So you have to go and find parts to make a decoder to read a manual for a BBQ and this allows you to make a fire....but before you get hurt, your spaceship makes a combustion lab which allows you to test all combustibles  ( you get to see when they burn, when there is nothing left and the molecules left behind) \n\nThe good: The game is its weird kind of fun. If interested in science you get to learn a lot of interesting things about our elements. The world is beautiful, mini games are fun.............a little addicting\n\nThe bad: The controls basically suck, The music is repetitive and just sucks ( I had to mute it and play my own music)\na lot of talking between you and your spaceship before you can get going, have to read a lot to fully understand every option in the workshop.\n\nBuy it: If you like science and want a game where you can relax use your intelligence go for it. I know I'll be playing it some more\n\nRating: 7.5/10 \n", "timestamp_updated": 1402047641, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1402047641, "votes_down": 11}, {"recommendationid": "10386458", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554270", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1402168748, "steamid": "76561198016478096", "num_games_owned": 452, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Finished (almost 100%) in 7 hours.  Enjoyable, but I probably won't play it twice, since I didn't see much replay value in it for me.  Relatively stable with only one crash to desktop, and it would have been nice if the game could be played in a window instead of full screen.  Loading screens are longer than I would have liked.  Played one level via Steam Streaming on my Mac without trouble.\n\nGame itself was a fun adventure.  Graphics were nice and controls were fine.  It appeared to be educational, but I certainly didn't learn anything I hadn't already learned in highschool.\n\n[Edit: Registration no longer required with latest update.]", "timestamp_updated": 1407717967, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1402176574, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "11026996", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475138", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1431038002, "steamid": "76561198134902843", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "the game keeps breaking on me please tell me what to do!!!!", "timestamp_updated": 1404332902, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404332902, "votes_down": 14}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 3}}
