While the indie scene isn't immune from uninspired copy and paste designs, there have been a string of recent releases that depart from traditional game design in a major way, challenging what we think of as games. One of the more overlooked releases that fits into this growing segment of games is Postmortem: One Must Die which tries to test players by forcing them to make a single decision that promises to have far reaching consequences. While major releases have tried to accomplish this same goal on a large scale, most have come up short. Does Postmortem's smaller and more focused scope deliver more satisfying results?\n\t\nPlaying as an agent of death, it's your duty to take the life of one person from a fund raising gala in a fictitious turn of the century setting on the cusp of an industrial revolution. The nation is split with conservatives that believe in upholding tradition at the expense of progress for women and greater economic development. Meanwhile progressives are riding a wave of industrial prosperity at the expense of  their workers. Both sides have admirable qualities and some absolutely abhorrent qualities which quickly muddies the line between noble and contemptible. Unbound creations has expertly balanced the qualities of each side of the conflict to tear gamers and make who they choose to snuff out a real struggle. Your potential targets rage from an influential member of the media to a young, idealistic student. Each person leans strongly in one direction and by thoroughly exploring the dialog tree you might find that your conversations with these characters may have quite an impact on them in the future...\n\t\nGameplay in Postmortem simply involves wandering around in an isometric world slathered in Victorian decor, scavenging details from news articles strewn about and talking to the patrons of the gala. Each character has a lengthy dialog tree that will allow you to acquaint yourself with them as well as current events. A wide variety of responses and questions are available and not asking questions can also have an impact on how the events play out. Dialog is generally well written but it can be a bit too purpose driven. Postmortem never creates the illusion that you are just another patron making small conversation, your pointed questions make each interaction feel like an interrogation rather than a conversation. The blatant agenda to your questions never allows the characters to show you who they are, they merely share what they perceive themselves to be. \n\t\nYour interactions with the gala patrons ultimately culminate in your character deciding who should meet their end. Once your decision has been made, a series of newspaper articles show the results of your involvement at the Gala. It's not the most invigorating way to see the consequences of your actions unfold but there may be a few surprises for some players to uncover based on your actions. Also, a link to detailed player stats is viewable upon completing a play through to show how your behavior compares to other Post Mortem players. A thorough playthrough exploring all of the dialog options will take in the neighborhood of an hour and subsequent playthroughs will take less time. It doesn't take long to figure out what dialog has what impact so many players may not want to take the time to explore every possibility. The beauty of Postmortem however is that you are not required to buy it to enjoy the core experience. By purchasing the game, players are given an extra character to chat with as well as wallpapers, concept art and some behind the scenes development materials. \n\t\nLike its triple A predecessors, Postmortem falls short of delivering a wholly satisfying choice based narrative. That is not to say that it isn't a worthwhile experience however, it's morally ambiguous world and intelligent and fresh setting remain engaging and some of the conclusions are engaging and surprising. It's brevity makes it easy to pick up sporadically and enjoy. I for one hope that Postmortem is simply an amuse-bouche, tantalizing our pallets for something a bit larger and scope and more accomplished in execution from Unbound Creations.", "timestamp_updated": 1390407411, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1390407411, "votes_down": 12}, {"recommendationid": "7906279", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 62, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546661", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1386121011, "steamid": "76561198003887214", "num_games_owned": 684, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a nifty adventure game for those that like to read.

You're free to make tough moral decisions. All of the characters are likable and hatable in the same breath. The game doesn't bludgeon you with a preachy message, nor does it bore you with a simple tale of good guy vs. bad guy.\n\nAt its total, this game would look great on the drawing board.

Yes, you play it, but the majority of that game play involves walking around, reading notes and papers, making decisions, referring to your journal, and talking to people.\n\nIn fact, I should point out that you'll be doing a LOT of talking. If you normally dislike lots of dialogue (which is mostly silent, so no voice actors beyond a word or two every so often) then don't get this game. Fortunately, you don't have to remember every little detail as vitally important information is automatically written down in your journal.\n\nThe story is you're a novice reaper (okay, get \"Don't Fear the Reaper\" out of your system before you continue reading) on your first assignment. You're told that ONE person must die at the gala you're attending. Admittedly, it's a very small gala, since there's only about six people there.\n\nWhat happens next is you read various notes and newspapers (and even open some safes and unlock doors, if you manage to get the right keys) and talk to each of the six individuals there. Every single person will have varying views on the shakey political situation going on and have something to say -- both bad and good -- about other people there.\n\nNone of the attendees are \"innocent\" in that each one has their own faults. One man is very sexist and thinks women shouldn't enter the workforce, while at the same time wants more rights for male workers. Likewise, one woman has some very feminist views (as in equality, not male bashing), but is extremely anti-immigrant and wants \"those people\" out of her country.  There's also poor vs rich issues and arguments about whether violence means are justified to change current conditions.\n\nIn other words, everything discussed in the game is a reflection of real life, both past and present. What's interesting about that is you have the chance to agree with them and further encourage their current point of view or argue a counterpoint, sometimes changing their mind.\n\nOnce you make your decision about who to kill, you'll see the reports detailing the aftermath. All of your actions -- who you decided to kill and what you discussed with the survivors -- play a role in shaping the future social and political climate.\n\nThere are some negative points, however. The game uses a somewhat primitive sprite-based 2D isometric graphical style, which for some reason or another, randomly experiences slowdown while walking. The resolutions offered are also limited. \n\nThere's virtually no mouse support other than clicking on menu buttons, so almost everything is controlled via the keyboard. That wouldn't be so bad if the controls didn't feel clunky. \n\nThere are numerous grammar and spelling issues in the dialogue. The font used is also small and the letters appear squished together, which makes reading sometimes a chore. That's a huge black mark against the game considering you'll spend more time reading than not. I will admit that I played this on a laptop with a screen resolution of 1366x768, so the font may be easier to read with larger screens and higher resolutions.\n\nAs far as I know, there's no way to save your game. Granted, the game isn't terribly long, but if you want to see all the outcomes, you'll have to talk to everyone each time you play and some dialogue trees can be very long. So while you could immediately go and kill different people right from the start, you wouldn't have affected anything (other than murdering someone) without talking to everyone first. \n\nPost Mortem: One Must Die (Extended Cut) is  currently $6.99 USD on Steam or offered at varying prices on the developer's website.
