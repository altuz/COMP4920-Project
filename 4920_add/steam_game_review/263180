I'm not sure it was worth the price I paid. It is a little simple, but at times too complicated too. The first level the bubbles come up at a normal speed, and increase as the level(s) progress. My youngest was having a difficult time identifying the objects as the speed picked up. The concept of using the coins to buy stuff is over their heads too, and also not very rewarding. The cost of the items is too high, for something like an eye patch or facial hair for the characters, it seemed a little pointless. The voice/audio track wasn't great either. Not with the words or goofy sayings, but poor quality. Seems like this concept would have been better as an app for the iPad or something.\n\nI don't mean to be discouraging since this appears to be one of the first flat out educational games Steam offers, and I especially don't mean to be negative towards the people that put time and effort into the game, but the price is not worth the end product. Even the sale price is too steep. There are lower priced educational apps out there that offer more and better content.", "timestamp_updated": 1394320161, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1394320161, "votes_down": 10}, {"recommendationid": "10591715", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484103", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403315975, "steamid": "76561197960683375", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Captain Dungee is my spirit animal.", "timestamp_updated": 1403316028, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403316028, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "9436237", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456445", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1404418746, "steamid": "76561197980214908", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 4, "review": "This game kicks ASS.
