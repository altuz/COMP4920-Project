The terrain is well made, challenging and looks realistic to drive in, however I got bored with its repetitive styling quite quickly. \n\nThe camera is horrible, like truly the worst. It's like 3rd person met freelook and they had a zombie for a kid. It's clunky, difficult to see what you want to and really spoiled the overall experience for me.\n\nI'm a simulation fan, I play Farming Sim, Euro Truck Sim2, loads of slow paced, immersive games is my point here, and yet Spintires feels slow, unrewarding and pretty boring once the \"wow factor\" of the mud physics wears off. There was nothing to work towards, just haul more logs, drive around more, get stuck in mud more, use a crane here and there and repeat.\n\nThe developers have been more focussed on internal drama than on development. They've argued publicly alot, the game was broken for a time when one of them went rogue and sabotaged the game code and that's without trying to find information on it, so I wouldn't be surprised if there was more under the rug that has distracted them from making the game Spintires could have been.\n\nLastly I want to mention the graphics. The physics are brilliant, but the graphics look color drained. Everything has a washed out appearance, there's no depth to the colors, it looks very much like a game and that takes away from the immersion.\n\nAll in all I can't really recommend it, it's just pretty bland and boring.", "timestamp_updated": 1505041320, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505041320, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35037954", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503610", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505685814, "steamid": "76561198047559171", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "this game is really good, but they made the same game again with a new name. don't buy any of them. this game lets you drive off-road and thats it.", "timestamp_updated": 1505704918, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505704918, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34876915", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501761", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1495086144, "steamid": "76561198003480586", "num_games_owned": 2219, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Almost 0 updates for this game and the devs expect people to buy their \"new\" game which was suposed to be updates for this game.
