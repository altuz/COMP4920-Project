However if you play it for the story like I did, you'll love this game. It can be a bit confusing because occasionally the story mode requires you to replay characters' story and take a different path or lose certain fights. But all in all it's a great start to an awesome and addictive saga.\n\nEDIT: put co-op instead of multiplayer, also it's definitely worth mentioning that this game comes with a free soundtrack, so if you enjoy the music as much as I do, you'll enjoy having this on your phone/iPod/MP3", "timestamp_updated": 1504808982, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504790087, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 697, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 127, "total_reviews": 824}}
