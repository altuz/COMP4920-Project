Not what is a game, because that is almost too broad to bother trying to put into words. But what is an experience? What is something you enjoy experiencing?\n\nI cannot define this for all of you. An experience changes for each person- it is a variable that makes each person who they are.\n\nContinue?9876543210 (wow that was fun to type out on the keyboard, I slid my finger down the number keys like some sort of badass) is definitely an experience. Whether it is a good one or a bad one is up to you. I personally felt like it made me think a lot about my life and what I take out of it, but I personally do not feel that much of the game other than the thought it provokes lives up to the price I paid for it, even at this discounted price of 8 dollars I paid for it. I personally think thinking should be free. What should be paid for is how the developer makes you think- either through visuals or audio or even story and gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is very basic. You run around and talk to people who usually just jabber on about strange things, but sometimes they open doors for you, and sometimes they sell you things. You are able to choose \"lightning\" or \"prayer\" when you enter these doors, and what these mean are up to the player to interpet, but what they do is either randomly spawn lightning to clear the path ahead or spawn a house in a town that is crucial to survive the later stages of the game. After 45 seconds to a minute though, garbage collection or something similar runs and takes you down to play a combat based minigame. After too many of these though, your game ends- but progressing to the next area resets this. So you are in a battle against time to progress to each area.\n\nThis gameplay sounds fine, but it is very repetitive. I was about to quit and take a break after the third one of these, but then I realized that there is no save feature in the game- the point is to play the game in one sitting it seems. And so I druged on (and how fitting to relate to the plot of the game), hoping the game wouldn't be TOO much of this. While the gameplay is unique and quirky, after the 3rd or 4th time through, it just gets old.\n\nThe music and the graphics are fitting to the theme of the game, but leave much to be desired. I found the graphics and music just plain boring to look at and listen to, and while there are some flashy scenes and very well done graphical choices during cutscenes, the levels look somewhat all the same in exception to a few that look amazing (the level where you're chasing down your reflections in the sea comes to mind) and in the end I just grew tired of it all very quickly.\n\nIt's very ironic that a game where you have to find peace with yourself grows harder and harder to get through. I found myself getting very bored with this game very quickly. But it's not about the game right? It's about the experience!\n\nWell that my friends, I do not think is worth my 8 dollars. While it made me begin to think, I feel the game ITSELF did not make me think but rather the themes of it did. I apologize if that may be a mouthful, but it is hard to describe a game like this into words. In simpler terms, I feel like I could have just poked around the website of continue9876543210.com and gotten the same feelings I did instead of playing the game. And for that, I do not give it my personal reccomendation.\n\nBut experiences change for everyone. Who knows?

You follow your main character's journey on the acceptance of his deletion by traveling and consulting with the inhabitants of other locales moments before their Garbage Collection. You have two primary options when speaking with the villagers, lightning or prayers. Lightning will help you escape the current level, or access secret areas that will aid you achieve your closure. Prayers will create a shelter based in your own town, which will protect the player from the deletion storm - literally lightning that deletes objects. Your ultimate goal is to survive long enough so the main character accepts his fate. The attitude at the time of their deletion depends on which villages you have been to, how many, and any \"secret\" areas you have been to which includes objects from your past and present.\n\nThe combat is fairly varied, but not overly complex. It does require skill, and this is certainly not a game you can skate by on without thinking what you are doing. To receive lightning or prayers from certain people, you might need to remember a fact about the town said by another villager. The combat can vary from side-scrolling challenges, to zelda-esque dungeon crawling, to arena \"kill-house\" style challenges. Depending how well you do can give you bonus lightning or keys which open doors in the villages, which allow you to speak to more villagers. I would advise against those who think the combat itself is the only reason to get the game- you will be dissapointed.\n\nIn addition to the combat and memorization, the skill of time-management is needed as well. Each village only has a certain amount of time before it's expiration. You have to prioritize what you need done. This is indicated by a countdown timer in the upper-right, once it hits zero there is a \"stage\" of degradation (Which varies how many there are by village). You will then enter a random combat scenario. Upon completion, you will return to the village which will have become slightly more hostile. Deletion monsters will roam the village which will delay you in your quest for shelter and closure.\n\nIt's an emotional ride that is open to your own interpretation. It does a grim subject matter well and was emotionally captivating enough to tug me along. And for that I am thankful.\n\nEdit: Just would like to clarify on something some reviewers seem to have missed (Even though it's in the instructions).

So I went into C?9-0 eagerly expecting a deep, affecting experience.  And for the first five or ten minutes, it seemed like it just might deliver on that...\n\nSadly, it very quickly descends into a qurky, poorly designed pile of...bits. Instead of feeling like a solid, well-thought out game, it feels more like an overly ambitious Digipen student project.  The biggest problem is, you're thrust into a bizarre, abstract world without any sort of guidance.  \n\n\"DEAREST FRIEND, YOU WILL BE CONFUSED AT FIRST, BUT BE BRAVE, IN TIME YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.\", the game assures in a large, ubiquitous, fatiguing-to-read typeface.  Part of me wonders if this line was a lampshade put in at the 11th hour of development to assuage confused newcomers.\n\nI've spent more time than I'd care asking myself \"what the hell is going on?!\".  Given the concept, this MAY be a conscious choice by the developer, since you're no longer in a 'game' and you're figuring it out as you go along just like the main character, Maggie.  But as a player here in meatspace, I still need some sort of graceful introduction to the concepts.  \n\nLike, what the hell is 'Foo'?  Apparently it's money.  It says 0/5 RAM on the status bar.  What does that mean?  Oh, now I'm suddenly sucked into a Zelda-like overhead persective and attacking chattering teeth?  Whoa, now I'm in a platform section where I have unexpectedly acquired a jump key, slaying more chattering teeth.  Aaaand now I'm back to the Indian trailer park, talking to Juggalos.  \n\nSeriously.\n\nTo be fair, there IS a clumsy, minimal in-game manual to ham-fistedly explain some of this stuff, if you deicde to \"spoil the mystery\".  And the more you bang your head against the wall, things begin to slowly connect together.  \n\nUnfortunately once you begin to weave together a vague notion of what's going on, you begin to realize that the core gameplay is not nearly as complex or interesting as you'd hoped.  As an outsider, this has been an incredibly frustrating, confusing experience.  Abstract concepts are great, but they need a clean and well-thought out game design to prop it up, more than most.\n\nIt's clear from other reviews that some players got a lot more out of this game, and I'm sure if I magically \"got it\" from the outset like they apparently did, I'd probably like it more, too.  But as it currently stands, I'm confused as hell, and -- the bigger tragedy -- I feel no overwhelming desire to invest more time into understanding it further.  In some ways, that's a worse failure than my benchmark for bitter mediocrity, \"Thirty Flights of Loving\".  At least I was compelled to finish THAT, such as it was.  But also, like that game, reviewers attributed to it a great weight of intellectual complexity that, frankly, I had a hard time giving it credit for.\n\nSave your rupees, gang, and simply enjoy the lovely developer-provided screenshots.

Or something like that. Continue is a very strange game; The basic idea is that you play as a video game character who is at the end of his life. The classic, 'Continue?' screen of arcade games of old has passed, and no quarters were inserted. And so, you have 'died', and enter into a realm where all data from a previous game goes to be erased, wiped clean for the world to start anew again for the new player, and New Game option. In this desolate space, data is assimilated into bytes and data, and you having not made your peace yet struggle to survive in a climate made to delete you. \n\nIn the game, you start on a level that is representative of some gameplay trope, IE town, field, ruins, etc. There are a variety of NPCs and locked doors. You can talk to the people, who will either try to sell you something, give you a hint of some sort in the level you're currently in, say something about the story of the game, or say some rather useless blabber. NPCs phase in and out of existence, however. There's also monsters that spawn on the level, and wander around. Touching them triggers a battle scene, that transitions to a different scene like an RPG game. However, the battles aren't turn-based, but real-time, and work more similarly to a Zelda game. However, what they exactly are changes per encounter. Some are top-down, some are side-scrolling, some make you defend something, or you just have to fight all-out. Winning battles or doing things around the level usually get you a key, which you can use to unlock one of the various locked structures around the level. Inside the structure you'll either find a shop, something to push the story, some sort of side-quest, or a person who will either build structures or cast lightning.\n\nNow building structures and casting lightning is important. The game has a sort of time limit, both in levels and the overall game. The levels you go to are randomized, and each has differences to each other. However, you have a certain number of 'rounds' that will pass before the whole level is eliminated. If you're in a level when it's eliminated, it's game over and you get a bad ending. There is a time period you have to do stuff in the level, and then the round ends and you face some kind of challenge. This can be like a tricky level, a boss fight, some kind of puzzle, etc. They're random. If you win, you get a big benefit to your cause of survival, but if you lose you miss your chance for some aid. Aid for what? To exit the level, you need to get people you encounter to cast lightning, as casting lightning will destroy some of the blocks randomly blocking one of the several exits out of a level. However, you also need to build structures. After every two levels or so, you'll be in a sort of 'storm' you need to survive, or else its game-over. In the storms, you're in a town that is formed of the buildings you have made people build in the normal stages for you. A storm hits, and the buildings are stricken by lightning. You have to hide in a building and wait for the storm to pass, though if your building is hit and destroyed you have a certain time limit to quickly scamper around the town to another building. If there are no other buildings or you run out of time, it's game-over.\n\nYou will always be given a choice of either Lightning or Building Structures. Lightning will clear a path to the next level after a few lightning strikes, while building structures will create buildings to hide in during these 'storm' sections.\n\nBasically the game is all about time management and succeeding in the various challenges that both the monsters, NPCs, and Round End's bring, for doing these allows you to gain chances at either Lightning or Structure Building, to make it past the individual level in time and to build structures for the storms that happen every two levels or so. You'll either like the game or not, it's a bit complicated to understand at first, and won't be fun for everyone.\n\nAlso there are side-quests you can do that effect your story. The game has multiple endings, possible level paths, and more... What you do in levels, what level path you take, and the like effects the ending you work towards. The game is kind of made to be played multiple times, as its not very long and you won't go to many of the levels or see the whole game in a single playthrough.\n\nAnd the game gets weird. The story is told in a very indirect way, and some of the events that can happen are just absolutely bizarre. Honestly the story feels most similar to something that David Lynch might of concocted up if he were to make a video game about video games. Depending on who you are, that might either be a good or bad thing.\n\nThe game's oddness is supplemented perfectly by its audio department. The game has a haunting soundtrack, interesting but odd sound design, but it all fits the weird atmosphere of the game perfectly.\n\nAnd there isn't really much to say. The game is deceptively complicated, but actually rather simple when you get down to it. It strikes me as a huge love it/hate it type of game, and something that'll divide people's opinions on whenever it's good or not.\n\nMy stance is that it's interesting. The game itself is okay, but the atmosphere and some of the surreal elements I enjoyed. Of course, if you're less fond of such things, there will probably be less to enjoy in the game for yourself. Basically said, while there is a game here, the game is more about the experience. And depending on who you are, that experience will either be worth taking, or it won't be.\n\nContinue may be worth it if you like experience-based games with a surreal and strange edge that are open to interpretation. If you don't like that, you probably won't like the game.

As a conseqence, I am almost always willing to overlook bad gameplay provided a game has substance. Contine?9876543210 is the exception to this.\n\nOstensibly the game is a contemplation of death, but the gameplay is so awful that it ruins anyting that the game is trying to communicate. Specifically: \n-The instructions provided are totally inadequate.\n-The controls are unredeemably bad.\n-Most sections of the game have arbitrary time limits. These appear to be included solely out of spite that the developer has for you.\n-A substantial portion of the game is composed of unskippable cutscenes.\n\nIt seems like the total length of the cutscenes for the total game is probably less than 20 minutes, but thanks to the awful controls you will have to replay most of them for hours before you win. Given this situation, it is probably only a matter of time before some masochist posts them online. Since the main point of the game is for you to contemplate the cutscenes, if that happens you will essentially get the substance of the 'game' for nothing.\n\nFinally, do not be fooled by the trailers, they do not accurately represent the game.

The trailer looked wonderful.  An action/platformer that is esentially a deep meditation on the existence of video game characters, with a simplistic yet stylish look, and not to mention, a great track to accompany the whole affair.  \n\nOnce I saw it available in the Steam market, I bought it immediately (this never happens).\n\nWhat I got was a little different than what I expected.\n\nYes, the deep philosophical message was there.  The eerie, ethereal atmosphere was there.  The melodious, calming soundtrack was there.  But gameplay was not.  At least, not what I was expecting exactly.\n\nThe game opens with a very beautiful sequence of death and transcendence into the after life (In terms of a defeated video game character).  As wonderful as this opening is, you will get very sick of it.  You will die quickly from the get go, and you will see this long cut scene each time you restart.  But the first time around, it really sets the tone and feel of what is happening.  Very melancholic and simple with an underlying complexity.  From here on out is where my feelings for this game took a turn.\n\nFrom the trailer, it looked very Zelda-ish (to which I'm a sucker for.  See my review of \"Anodyne\").  This was certainly not the case.  You did not really have freedom to explore.  By freedom, I mean with enough time.  As soon as this starts, you are on a kind of timer for each world.  After a certain amount of time, the world around starts to fall apart and glitch; the system is essentially trying to delete you for good.  You have to do a lot of walking around, talking, while every once in a while being subjected to a rather lackluster battle sequence.  The point is to get out of the area you are in and move to the next area.  Now, there is also a small town in another area of the game.  It is here that you build up buildings which will also be subjected to termination.  At some point in the game (I forget when, as it has been some time since I've played this game) you go into the town.  The program starts systematically deleting the buildings.  If you get hit by a lightning bolt, you are deleted, and this results in a game over.  Then, it is time to start again, from the very beginning.\n\nThe game is rather difficult, and when I played, I found it annoyingly difficult to survive inside of the small town you construct.  No matter where I went or the buildings I had, that bolt found its way to me, resulting in an instant game over.\n\nI might give it another go another time, but it was a big disappointment.  I like how they tried to really do something different, but in the end it wasn't fun.  I give it a perfect ten for style and music, but for gameplay...let's just say I give it a much lower score.  Maybe if it had been more free and open world, then it would have worked well.  I don't expect a Zelda knock-off AGAIN...but Anodyne seemed to manage being Zelda without being Zelda.\n\nSorry creators of Continue?9876543210....Great concept.
