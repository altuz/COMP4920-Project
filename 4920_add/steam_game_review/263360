TL;DR: it's pretty interesting in it's style, if you like open-world games, this REALLY deserves a look, especially if it's on sale for only a couple bucks.\n\n\n\nGee, where do I begin with this game? I suppose the art style.\n\nWhen I first saw this game, I had literally no clue what I was looking at. This game's art style is VERY interesting, and everything from the surreal music to the distorted, robotic voices definitely add to the strange, mesmerizing environment. It's definitely in a good way though, and I think that the art style does nothing but add to the whole thing.\n\nBut of course, you aren't gonna buy this game just to look at it. What about the gameplay?\n\nWell, the action is definitely what it should be. It's about what you'd expect from a good FPS game, and it actually can feel quite exciting at times. It's nothing amazing, but it gets the job done.\n\nThere are 2 basic types of weapons: melee and ranged. Of the melee weapons, you have swords and daggers (not too much different between the two), and on the ranged side of things, you have rifles and pistols (again, not much difference). There are really very few differences between the types of weapons, and the biggest difference is that ranged weapons can either be 'energy' weapons, or normal ones. Energy weapons use up energy to fire, whilst normal ones require ammo.\n\nHowever, the big thing that saves the weapon diversity is the myriad of different abilities each gun can have. See, each individual part of your gun has a number of things it contributes to the gun. Some of them are: Range, damage, explosiveness, how many shots are fired, how much ammo it consumes, burst (how much ammo per 'clip'), accuracy, or bullet speed. You can also change out individual parts to your gun, allowing you to customize it to your heart's content.\n\nIf there's anything the game gets very right about itself, it's that aspect of it. The customization is FANTASTIC, and I know of no other RPG that allows you to do it to that extent. If the game has one great selling point, it is that.\n\nThe quest system is also quite nicely done. The quests are all randomly generated, and each one rewards you with a differing amount and skill points and money (which makes you just cherry pick the ones that give you the most of both unfortunately). If there's one complaint I have about it, it's that a couple of the task types can be kind of...tedious (retrieving objects from places, or escorting people around).\n\nWhat about the story? Well, it's classic red vs blue (no, really, it's red robots vs blue ones). You start out in a friendly red base, and are supposed to be an experimental new battle robot going in for testing. I won't give away the story, but it's fairly intruiging, and you'll be wondering a few things throughout the game. All the endings, however, are rather...unsatisfying. [spoiler] You die. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, this game is rather nice, especially for a game made by 1 person. To be honest though it feels incomplete. It doesn't seem like it has all the content it needs. This game has a successor, 5089, which is VERY, very similar, and so might have more fleshed out ideas, but this one feels incomplete. Still, the feel of this game is very satisfying, as well as quite relaxing. Going out into the no-man's land, with all the robots from both sides fighting it out to the death, and all the hypnotizing landscape is an experience no other game can recreate.\n\nShould you get this game? If you like open world games, then absolutely. Keep in mind, though, that it's retailing at the price it is for a reason...", "timestamp_updated": 1499926603, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499926603, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34719977", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498857", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504628991, "steamid": "76561198022450142", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Cool game to play with friends like my friend Jumento das trevas Pietro", "timestamp_updated": 1504467607, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504467607, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 203, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 45, "total_reviews": 248}}
