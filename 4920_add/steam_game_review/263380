It's definitely geared toward kids and if there were no combat it would be perfect for extremely sheltered young'uns -- though maddeningly twee and boring for adults. Without combat it would be mind-numbingly dull. \n\nCombat is very simple, you choose your weapon and click on the enemy and it auto-fights for you. It has a very basic skill tree where you are able to choose if you want to put xp points into weapons, or into passive skills or into other benefits.  \n \nThere is no voice acting, but there's reams of reading between conversations you have with other characters and in books you find.  If there had been voice acting I would either have been telling the screen to shut-up or skipped all dialogue options about half way through, so no voice is a positive rather than a complaint. \n\nThere are a number of different puzzles you have to solve to advance, and if you play a lot of puzzle games you would probably find them easy.  If you don't, then a couple of them will be frustratingly difficult.  Kids will probably need help with several of them.\n\nMost of your time in the game is spent looking for plants to pick and objects to pick up, many of the latter are hidden under or behind furniture which you are able to drag out of the way.  You can craft simple potions and a few weapons once you find or buy 'blueprints', as well as being able to buy what you need from several vendors.  Overall, the game is a really good training RPG.\n\nI have one big complaint about the game though, enough of one that I can't recommend it.  The game makers want to share their love of God with you.  One of the hidden books you find in the middle of the game, if you are a diligent searcher, has the entire Old Testament in it with the disclaimer that you aren't expected to read it if you don't want to but the Devs need to share their belief.  After that, the amount of times your character is told to pray because of danger is infuriating.  When I buy a game, especially a fantasy game, I am not paying for the Devs to evangelize at me.", "timestamp_updated": 1419864549, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "8", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1419863665, "votes_down": 42}, {"recommendationid": "13968658", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 43, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546145", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1422584127, "steamid": "76561198123322860", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "There are some things I like about this game - it's a fairly user-friendly explore and dungeon-crawl thing, but as I got more into it and more used to it, it really had limitations. There are only a couple dozen different loot items, a bare handful of potions you can create, you can only play as a male character, and the religious undertones get more and more annoying - it starts off as a couple of monks and quotes (mostly harmless, but then there are a few about intellect being bad and faith being good). And then you find a copy of the entire new testament of the bible under a bookshelf. Games really shouldn't be a showcase for the developers' religious inclinations. Bad move.\n\nAdditionally, there are many plagiarised quotes where the author has not been noted, as well as the entire Black Knight sketch from Monty Python, again, with no credit.\n\nI'm glad I only paid $2.50 for it.

I really liked how it's a reminder of the friends you've made in the game.[/spoiler]\n- Interesting NPCs, all of whom have their own personality.\n- The game automatically pauses right before you're about to die, giving you time to take a health potion.\n- Multiple endings depending on your actions near the end of the game!\n\n\nCons:\n- Lots and lots of dialogue.  They can be funny and helps to imbue the NPC with personality, but sometimes I just get bored and click through it rapidly.
