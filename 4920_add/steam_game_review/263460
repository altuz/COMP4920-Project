Now receive 4 sun squares, 6 beer squares 2 boy squares and 4 girl squares and 4 ice squares and make it so they all are happy about where they are on the grid... this is the idea here, except it uses nerds robots and a schoolbus instead \n\nFrustratingly difficult game with clear mobile optimized graphics and controls. Difficulty mostly comes from the cryptic rules that dictate how the multiple blocks interact with each other.
