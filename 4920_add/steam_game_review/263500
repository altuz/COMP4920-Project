In act 1 you \ncan get a free dragon after beating and theres up to act 3 right now \nand it involves a really cool story line sounds cool right, guess again. \n\nyou have to pay for the other act's and a lot of the things you can buy \nwith real money and or game money is kind of overpriced in my opinion \nbecause you only get 100 money per victory and it cost's 5000 for three \nrandom dragon eggs and 2500 for a new weapon, there is interesting runes\ntoo and you can upgrade your weapens at the forge with stuff you find in\nbattle or pay for wich is the only cheap thing in my opinion. \n\nOther than that this game is amazing you really have to work with your team \nin battle to cover everything and it's still preatty difficult ven if you\nhave 5 ppeople in skype. you also get this portrait of a dragon and when\nyou level up it fills up by that much more with i like to level up in for\nthat reason. So in conclusion i think it's an awesome game and can't wait\nfor future updates.", "timestamp_updated": 1487736816, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487736784, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "29922434", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499237", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1422358844, "steamid": "76561198156600235", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "this is cool game i like this its like dota 2 but its more to play dota 2 to have fun!!!", "timestamp_updated": 1487085006, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487085006, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "30096740", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492968", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1487833370, "steamid": "76561198139462298", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "not addicting but easy & quick entertainment XD", "timestamp_updated": 1487760158, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487760158, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "30128715", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479213", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1473125335, "steamid": "76561198319670438", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "1/10 parecido como lol", "timestamp_updated": 1487888924, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487888887, "votes_down": 11}, {"recommendationid": "30224433", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1488307862, "steamid": "76561198094608540", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Almost kinda fun.

Each dragon/weapons has its own unique attacks, however, I will complain that I don't feel certain dragons/weapons are balanced out in a fair way. The game has 4 different maps, and a voting system for which map you would like next after a 25-30 minutes time period. Some maps seems to be a bit laggy, and the servers are down (for multiplayer) sometimes, which can be frustrating, but it's a pleasure to play versus your friends, rivals, and even enemies. Runes also make this game interesting, allowing your dragon to gain small buffs that overall make a huge impact the more you level up in battle. This adds a nice complexity to the game, allowing you to easily twist and turn past a few of your dragon's/weapon's weaknesses, or to allow you to try and make it slightly less of a weakness. The rating system is a nice feature, making so you don't play against newer players, adding challenge, but also making it so that they don't get creamed and can learn a few steps at a time of how the game works. \n\nWhile the game is no longer in developement, I think it'd be nice if it was. \n\nOne last thing, it would be nice to have a way to gain more crystals (the currency in the game) other than buying the titan pass, which gives you 4x crystals, but only for 1 year. I think making it so you can gain crystals in a faster manner (with either the titan pass's 4x crystals no longer working or if you can't/haven't gotten the titan pass). I've heard complaints about not getting very many crystals after a match, making it so you must grind (which is very annoying) Singleplayer or Multiplayer. With the game no longer in developement and the fact it has \"died\" a quite a bit, people think the $25 for the titan pass is no longer worth it.\n\nI do really enjoy this game though, and I myself don't want to give up on it. Hope the devs decide to go back to it and give it a little more love  <3\n\n~DragonFire", "timestamp_updated": 1486499385, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486499385, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "29813413", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505825350, "steamid": "76561198361650083", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "For those that can't take the complexity and seriousness of games like Dota 2, Smite, or LOL, this is a game for you.
