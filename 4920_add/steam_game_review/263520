It is purposefully cruel in that it exploits the inherent darkness of love, trauma, redemption and revenge. Ultimately though, the narrative is pure and delivers a positive message on loving relationships dealing with trauma. This review may contain spoilers.\n\nEnola is a story-driven game with an intricate plot that needs to be pieced together in a non-linear fashion by navigating a dark, tense atmosphere reflecting psychological despair. You play as Enola, the female protagonist, who has to survive a macabre world conjured by the tortured memories of her lover, Angelica. This world has fragments reminiscent of Silent Hill, but in a different way. This game pushes the emotional boundaries of the player to make them feel desolated and isolated in an already surreal and tormented world. The gameplay is mainly driven through first-person exploration and puzzle solving. I must reiterate that this game is not easy, especially for players who have experienced trauma. You will learn about disgusting acts of violence committed to your lover as you try to navigate a nightmarish landscape.\n\nMost of the obstacles you face in the game are hellish mechanical contraptions designed by the most disturbed minds. In addition, there are a few enemies, dubbed \u2018Shadow Man\u2019 or \u2018Monsters\u2019 that will attempt to sexually assault you, and you must fight back and escape. Enola is also a thematically driven game. Your morality, your thoughts on justice, redemption, revenge and forgiveness will be put to the test. At one point, you will be tasked with deciding whether to \u2018spare\u2019 or \u2018kill\u2019 people who have committed a series of crimes of varying degrees. These choices are incredibly crucial, and will determine the sort of ending you obtain. Moreover, at least in my personal experience, they made me reflect on my opinions regarding punishment and to what extent I will become a \u2018monster\u2019, or kill, in order to save the life of my partner. Enola is also beautifully designed through the Unreal Engine. Mansions reminiscent of Victorian-era architecture, underworld cavern levels that transition into industrial hellscapes and red skies brewing an apocalyptic storm are but few examples of a unique and interesting creative design. \n\n[b]Lastly, although I enjoyed this game a lot, I feel I need to mention some bugs that I encountered. [b]. For instance, sometimes you will obtain a key that is supposed to unlock a gate but the game will not register it. Fortunately, the solution is easy and just involves quitting and restarting, so save often! Another minor bug is that occasionally if you run the game, it will seem as if the world and your character are constantly vibrating for some reason \u2013 luckily it goes away after a few seconds, but it can be annoying if you are playing a crucial part of the game. If you notice any other bugs, or these solutions do not work or you are stuck in any sense, go to the Community Hub. The developers are well aware of these slight issues and not only has he developed a guide for the game to comment and address the community\u2019s concerns. \n\n[h1]If you enjoy the way I review games, join and follow my curator group!

You will come across desolate beaches, majestic waterfalls and strange trees that seem to drop lumincent leaves and much more. Exploration is fun especially in more open areas. There is a subtle but noticeable steam punk infleunce that shows up in machinery and dress.My favorite areas of Enola are those that are very dark, shrouded in a sort of purple fog and allow you to explore various buildings and attractions. \n\nGameplay amounts to exploration, solving puzzles,very minor platforming,and a little bit of hiding/dogeing enemies. Surprising to say there is no combat in this game, but I felt so engaged I almost forget. When and if you do get caught by an enemy you can smash the WASD keys to voilently escape your enemies which is as close to combat as you will get.\n\nStory is ify. I didnt particularly enjoy it but its not terrible I guess. There are multiple endings you can get so replay value is pretty good . I spent 7 hours on nightmare mode to finish it so maybe you can push it and finish it in 4-5 hours since you will wont get stuck anywhere. \n\nOverall Enola gave a good lasting impression. It was good enough to hold my attention for 7 hours straight. I would rate it at a 7.5/10\n", "timestamp_updated": 1492311963, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492311963, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 24, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 12, "total_reviews": 36}}
