So naturally, whenever a new platform/smash-esque fighter pops up, my first instinct is to try it. I've dabbled in Brawhalla (though not on this account) and I've played a fair bit of Rivals of Aether. I've played every type of spinoff, Playstation All Stars, Shrek Super Slam, etc. I have a passion for these sorts of games. So it surprised me when Brawlout was unbearably disappointing. Characters didn't have a strong \"pop\" to them (other than Paco, he's cool asf), stages were designed seemingly with no attention to competitive play or casual play (not enough hazards for casuals, not enough balanced stages for competitive. Really? Half of Smash's battlefield?). Every move has the sound effects of a light slap, yet sends opponents flying off screen. There really isn't much depth here either. Whereas a game like Rivals introduce Parrying, multiple types of cancels, walljump integration, and a quick tutorial to communicate it all, Brawlout has little to nothing. It removes grabs and shielding. \"Fair enough,\" I thought, \"Rivals did the same thing and I love that game\". But there was nothing to replace it. Nothing was added, things were only taken away. The inclusion of wavedashing seems completely pointless, as if just having such a mechanic in the game will attract players. Melee players don't like wavedashing just because \"WE CAN WAVEDASH\". We like it because it expands on movement options and how the neutral is played. In Brawlout, it just seems like a weaker version of regular movement, as it is not only laggy, but has similar options as the stock dash (because dashes and dash momentum have little to no endlag). The combo system feels ripped from traditional fighters, but with how far characters are launched, the combos don't last long either. Again, this would be fine if characters died quickly. But every character has an almost ludicrous recovery. When you see the aforementioned Paco, with arguably one of the weaker recoveries, get back from offscreen bottom right/left, you know something is wrong. \nNow to be fair, this is the only truly 3D Smashlike I've seen on Steam. It looks pretty standard issue for an early access game. Why then, do my GPU and CPU fans spin up as if my PC is about to take off? I'm running a fairly modern system (4GB GTX970, an i5-4690k, pretty bog standard \"VR-Ready\") and despite the game looking mediocre at best, it stresses my whole PC. I almost can't hear the generic music and the characters that make little to no noise (Which again, lends to that whole \"pop\" factor they lack). I know some will defend it, saying, \"pretty good for early access\". Well with a 20 Dollar price tag, \"Pretty Good FOR EARLY ACCESS\" doesn't cut it. Premium Price, Premium Product. Similar early access games (Distance, Rivals, hell even Sword With Sauce) have massive jumps in both quality and perfomance efficiency. To my knowledge, they have even SMALLER development teams. It's a shame, because some of the ideas here are really cool. Characters like Paco, Hyper Light Drifter, and (I don't know, I'll just call him Bristleback) have movesets that, set in any other Smashlike, would be incredibly fun to use. But it's Brawlout. So they aren't. Wavedash games is cooking up their new game, \"Icons: Combat Arena\". The footage from that game's PRE-ALPHA/ALPHA stages looks far more interesting than this game's MID BETA. Sure it may lack the \"polish\", but that can come with time. A game that is not good from the foundation will not become good. To adapt a rather crude saying,  \"You can polish a turd, but you cannot make it gold.\"\nPros:\n+Fun character mechanics (in concept)\n+A couple stage backgrounds look nice\nCons:\n-Weak movement options\n-Poor competition to other games in the genre, better alternatives out there.\n-Price is too high\n-Characters lack personality\n-Poor Optimization\n-Weak overall presentation\n-Lack of depth", "timestamp_updated": 1502260900, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502260900, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "34158553", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512464", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502413544, "steamid": "76561197961437646", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "I was suckered into buying this game because I saw a Kotaku article showing it added the Drifter from Hyper Light Drifter.

If you think you're gonna play this like Smash Bros (Melee as it's advertised or Brawl / 4 if it's what you're used to), this game is nothing like them. The only similarity is that you have a % bar that launches you further.. But even that is fucked up. I've \"smashed\" other characters at 200% and they did not die. They barely even moved. There's a super meter that builds and they literally give you 15 seconds of invincibility. I have no idea how they plan on fixing all the glaring issues with this title. You have to play it for around an hour to truly understand everything that's wrong with it. The controls are sluggish and sloppy, the moves are cheap and make no sense. The hitboxes are terrible.

There are a few things I thought were pretty cool about the game, the graphics look really nice and seem to be really well optimized as my pc could run the game on max setting at about 400-600 fps the whole time. The character design is pretty interesting too with strongly cohesive kits that fit stick to and make use of the characters look to create an imersive fighter. \n\nHowever there are many more things about this game that just didnt make it stick for me and made me want to stop playing. First the player base is very small taking around 5 to 10 minutes just to find a short 3ish minute match, this is not something that is really the developers fault and may improve over time but as of now online play just doesnt seem that fun because it takes twice as long to find a match as it does to play one. Next in single player vs cpu there are no differences in difficulties to my knowledge making it so once you've mastered beating the cpus it is no longer challenging and as I said with the queue times earlier its not even very worth it to switch to online multiplayer. Third, their are very few character (which is expected mostly of early access) but they claim that they plan to add two or three more by release, that will total in around 10 characters. Arguably that could be enough for I fighting game since games like lethal league thrive with only 6, but the magnitude of competetive play this strives for versus lethal league is very different as lethal league is meant to be a much simpler game at its core. The amount of characters put into this game doesnt even take much time to learn them all. Once again without higher cpu difficulty levels and with sluggish online play I believe this game would benefit greatly from at least having more characters game like smash start you out with around 30 characters to play allowing for much better replayability as you learn to master all of the different character and playstyles. Further more and this may be purely my personal opinion but the movement in this game feels a little clunky whether with controller or keyboard the characters feel rather unresponsive often resulting in a move executing to late, not at all, or the wrong move happening. Lastly another personal opinion is I dont care for the way abilities chain, it feels like there are to many true combos in this game with no frames for recovery in between with these inescapable combos and nearly map wide moves like those seen on king apu and gancho puncho the gameplay seems kindof broken and slightly unfit for competitve play.\n\nI very well might try this game again in the future once its out of early access but as for now I do not think this game is worth playing as what it does games like smash and brawlhalla still do better and with higher player bases.\n\nGood luck to the development team, I'll be back.\n\nTLDR:\nCharacter design and game optimization are solid, but between clunky gameplay, broken abilities and combos, lack of depth to cpu fights, and low playerbase game is not worth in its current state.", "timestamp_updated": 1503614513, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503614513, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34380677", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505247742, "steamid": "76561198150675327", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "So far, a really great fighting game!
