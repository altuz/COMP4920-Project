Nobody Plays Multiplayer - While there is a structure for having MP games, there is no one to play with online. The most people I have seen online at one time were three, including myself. \n\n2.  AI Games are just bad - There is really no other way to say this, but in the two hours that I have played this game, it has only been against AI. These games typically amount to me pushing forward and finding the \"battle-line\" and then holding that until I can make enough units to move forward. Now one might think that to be the appropriate way to wage war in this setting, but the games eventually become a grind of fighting off waves of enemies that are too small to do any serious damage to your fleet and that just hurl themselves at you using no particular strategy. This is further more exasperated by the fact that the MP community is dead. \n\n[h1]More Serious Issues:[/h1] \n\n1. AI - FIX IT\n\n2. Concept - While the concept is what drew me in at first, it soon became clear that it was a lot harder to execute than planned. In game, there are only 3 types of ships, Invading ships (for taking over planets), frigates (for fighting other starships), and the destroyers (they just destroy planets so enemies cannot use resouces).

Oftentimes my shipyards are at least a couple hops away from where I want my forces to end up.\n- Another player on the forum suggested the ability to see \"at-a-glance\" how well I'm performing in a battle without having to click on the battle itself. This would be extremely helpful in hectic situations where multiple battles are occurring simultaneously.\n- An at-a-glance display of the number of units of each type currently occupying a system. Instead of having the one icon indicating just the types of units present, there might be two icons if you had for example both a battle fleet and an invasion fleet. Both icons would have their corresponding fleet counts listed. (Or maybe just three counts next to the single icon?)
