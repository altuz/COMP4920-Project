With the game very much under develop, early access allows us to maintain the status of a game and the playability of a demo. Hope that we would ever do the  wide-scale changes that almost every small team indie early access \"game\" promises. This amount of fuckery would not be reasonable if games on steam were required to be completed to be release. This allows the game to continually pump in that moneeeey!!! This game will never evolve with responses to user feedback.\u201d\n\n\nThe reason for the early access triggers me,\n", "timestamp_updated": 1501967061, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501967061, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 97, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 37, "total_reviews": 134}}
