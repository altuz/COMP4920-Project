So I can't speak for the later parts of the game.\n\nI played this the only right way. Which is in couch co-op. The levels has a easy-normal challenge to them but they\u2019ve added the challenge to get all the treasure in the levels. This gives you an extra difficulty if you want it. Perfect. the controls work just as you expect them to and except for being puzzling the game is fun. \n\nThe graphic is great, the music on par and the humor childish but fitting.
