One of them is the lack of attention Full Bore has gotten, since it\u2019s such a great Metroidvania puzzle game.\n\nYou play as a boar in a mine populated by talking boars. You\u2019re in debt and you need to repay it by finding blue gems hidden all over the map. There\u2019s also lore to find that will tell why the boars closed off an area of the mines, and who left all these computers and junk everywhere.\n\nThe puzzles are all block pushing puzzles. There are blocks that do different things and you are going to hate the ones that disintegrate after you climb on top of them. Some puzzles are optional, which is a good thing since these puzzles are not of the easy, obvious sort. You will get frustrated and will probably look up a guide to solve them, and then you will slap yourself in the head because now it feels obvious(which is the mark of a good puzzle game). Don\u2019t expect powerups of any sort. There aren\u2019t any. However, you can go faster by digging into the same type of block multiple times. There\u2019s a rewind function where you go back into the past so you can redo your moves. This is extremely helpful.\n\nThe game has good controls. You can climb, stomp, push things, and there\u2019s a delay when you go over a block since you might not want to change your position just yet. \n\nThe music for this game is very good too, and I came back to the ost multiple times and looked up Adjective Plural Noun, the band that made it. At some point I\u2019ll buy the ost. \n\nThe art\u2019s pleasing. It\u2019s pixel art, but it\u2019s got it\u2019s own style and isn\u2019t trying to look like other games.\n\nI don\u2019t have any problems with the game, but I\u2019m not a nitpicker. \nThe 40 hours I've spent on this game should also be a testament to its worth.", "timestamp_updated": 1500518635, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500518346, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33737844", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503628", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1486365831, "steamid": "76561198042757315", "num_games_owned": 626, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I'll be straight forward :\n\nPros:\n- Cool artstyle as seen in video and screenshot - retro pixelart. Cute but nothing amazing.\n- Lotsa exploration to do, if that's your thing. The world is pretty massive and its not linear. Many roadblocks though.\n- Many, decent puzzles. Makes up the bulk of the gameplay, so puzzles fans will be happy.\n- Relaxing ambience and atmosphere. The lighting effects are really good and make a nice mood.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of direction. I would often get lost or stuck and unsure where/what to do. A lot of backtracking. Not so fun.\n- Story is incoherent and did nothing to really engage me. Characters spout a lot of unimportant dialog. Player character (a hog) has no personality (blank slate)\n- No voice acting. Seeing as there are many NPCs and they have several lines, its a real shame.\n- Many puzzles are frustrating and block progress. Could not be bothered to finish some the harder ones after many tries.\n- Too many dead-ends and empty rooms. No powerups. No special collectibles to mention. Lacks rewards in general.\n- Lacks combat or action. Only a con if you like that to be part of your game, which I do, at least a little bit.\n\nI personnaly regret my purchase, but only because I got frustrated by the puzzles and unrewarding exploration, and backtracking. If you love puzzles, especially hard ones, and don't need a relevant story, nor combat/action, then you'll like it. It's casual.\n\nFor a similar experience, one which I personnally prefered, see Steamworld Dig.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1500792837, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500792837, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 21, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 26}}
