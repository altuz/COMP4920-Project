This game was available for free through amazon. When I first found it on amazon, it was a free to play game. that's all well and good, but when I found it for $15 on steam, that got me kind of iffy on the whole thing. it basically told me that they're charging for something they were willing to give out for free. But, I can get past that.\n\nWhat this game does well is customization and gameplay. the controls are solid, the cars feel weighty and there's a fair bit of options available to customize your car right off the bat. all plusses in my book. So, The reason I don't recommend this is because there was no offline modes to be found. every single race was online. on top of that, there really aren't enough people playing to fill a race. personally, I had a hard time finding just one more person so I could actually race. That's because the race won't start if you're by yourself. the only time it does is if you're in hotlap mode. but the thing about that is this: you don't get credit for hotlaps. Nope. no rewards for that. none.\n\nAll in all, Age of Racing is a story of high potential with all the resources already there. but the game was let down by always online gameplay that's even brought triple-A games to their knees. if they ever add offline, I'll recommend it. but as long as it stays online only, I can't bring myself to do it.", "timestamp_updated": 1415292864, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415292664, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "13381410", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 45, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549751", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1418670000, "steamid": "76561198044115669", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "[b]tl;dr This game is fun, but overwhelming and dead. Developers have abandoned this game and left to work on the next one.[/b]\n\n[i]Victory: The Age of Racing[/i] is a racing simulator akin to stuff like Formula 1, but with arcade gameplay controls in the vehicles. I'm much more of an arcade racer (hence my repeated Black Flags when I play anything in here), so Victory does cater to my tastes as well as the average sim fan. The cars are very well modeled, and the tracks are pleasing enough.\n\nHowever, the UI is incredibly overwhelming to me, and it's not intuitive for me to get around at all. I'm sure I haven't even discovered half of the menus because of how much there is to take in. Additionally, the multiplayer is dead and you'd be lucky to find anyone who plays this.\n\nMost importantly, as other reviews have pointed out, the developers - Vae Victis Games - have fully abandoned Victory. [b]The game has not been updated in (edit:) over three years, since April 2014.[/b] They're working a new game called Racecraft, and they have given free copies of Racecraft to everyone who purchased Victory before they made it free-to-play.

I highly recommend this game. Granted only for certain people, I understand not everyone likes racing games, especially ones that have some simulation aspects to it. This is more of a simcade, and as people have said about this before, it's easy to get into, hard to master.\n\nI do call it how I see it though, even though one of the devs asked for me to review, I have no issue with that, and no, I'm not getting any kind of reward for it nor do I care for one, I just want to see the game succeed and get more players. Starting on developers, they are awesome. I had one personally work with me to troubleshoot an issue I had with the game crashing, and come up with a fix for it, and provided me with a modified .dll file to get the game working until the patch was released the next morning. (this was LATE at night, almost morning when it happened)\nThe game doesn't have many issues for me, but whatever issues it does have are being worked on by the devs atm. They listen to feedback and issues that the community encounters. Like the FPS problems some people are having. I was talking to a dev last night and they have acknowledged the issue and are working to fix it. In that process though they broke cockpit view online, once they quickly found out about that from players, they fixed it the same day. This is what more games need, devs that listen and actually work to change/fix things. I can forgive games that are broken if the devs ACTUALLY TRY. (I'm not saying this game is broken by the way, it is far from it) If you can't at least respect a developer for that, I've got nothing for you.\n\nThe community of this game, so far, is all friendly. This can of course change, as people are people and the more people that play, the higher chance for bad people to show up, that's just life, don't fault a game for that. There's a MMO like chat ingame, you have a public chat for anyone to talk in, a race chat for a race you're in, and a friends list separate from Steam and a racers tab to show EVERYONE online. You can check out their rank, nationality, and private chat from there. Quite simple and functional.\n\nThe driving mechanics ingame are quite nice in my opinion. It's definitely not a sim like Assetto Corsa, but it's not super arcadey like Need for Speed games. There's a good balance of fun and realism, combined with the options of automatic gear changing, semi auto, and manual, and various assists you can enable and disable on the fly. The cars all feel nice to drive too, they have good weight to them, you can feel the cars grip (or lack thereof), the cars respond to different surfaces, and changing car setup makes thing vary quite a bit. Running the default setup will work fine but you certainly get an advantage if you take the time to set up your car properly for a certain track, be it the under/oversteer of the car, the suspension stiffness to help cornering, the downforce levels, front/rear brake bias, and even gear ratios, and it does it in a fairly simplified but useful way. Their are descriptions for the settings on the side to help explain, and instead of some settings like camber levels and toe, and ARB settings and spoiler and wing angles, it's simple clicks left and right toward a different setting. I'm a huge fan of racing games in general, arcadey and sim. My main issue with sims is a lot are just plain better when using a racing wheel, which makes me happy to say this works EXTREMELY well with a gamepad. This itself makes it more accessible, which isn't always a bad thing.\n\nThe amount of content ingame is something I can't comment on too well right now, as I haven't played for that long. The game is only about 500mb though, so keep that in mind. There's a decent amount of tracks from what I've seen, and they're all fun, for me at least. There are preset cars ingame to buy, quite a few for each career and team, and some on the market (using ingame money).\nBut then we get to the car creator. You can choose between the 3 car types, and the different performance groups, then mix and match between different front, middle, and rear pieces of the car, and then change the paint and decals, and choose between a lot of different cosmetics like exhausts, brakes, rims, mudguards, steering wheels, etc. And depending on the car chosen, you get a different amount of PI to spend on your car. These are basically skill points in an MMO, you put points into things like braking, power, grip, etc. And in the same area you can select different engines and tires that will also change the PI settings of your car a bit. This adds a lot of personalization to the game and makes everyones car feel different. So in that aspect, there's a lot of content, and I'm sure there's more to be added.\nA thing I forgot to put in somewhere about the car types: They're all F1 cars. There are the older ones running V6's if I remember, the Classics. Then you have the Legendary cars, I think these are using V8's ingame, I forget. They are based off more modern looking F1 cars though. Then you have the Formula class, these are using V12's ingame, and are the most modern looking cars.\n\nWhen it comes to graphics, not too much to say. They aren't bad, certainly not the worst. If you really judge a game based on that, well, I don't know what to tell you. The gameplay is very good, the graphics work well and don't detract from the game. Fairly straightforward here. The only thing negative I have to say about that is with the graphics quality, there shouldn't be performance issues, but there are. BUT, like I said earlier, the developers are working on this right now. Like literally now.\n\nRegarding peoples butthurtness towards \"in app purchases\". Yes, there are some. You can pay real money to get ingame money from what I understand. But it's optional. There's literally nothing you can get from that, that you can't get ingame by just playing normally, and it DOES NOT make up for lack of skill.\n\nAny of these things are subject to change, as this game is still in Early Access and is being worked on still. This was put up on 2-14-2014. If anything changes that makes any of my points irrelevant or outdated, I'll try to remember and edit this.\nI'll say again, I highly recommend this game for just about every kind of racing fan, and definitely for people that like F1 cars.\nIt's quite accessible too, so not being the best isn't a reason to pass this by.", "timestamp_updated": 1392412693, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1392412693, "votes_down": 22}, {"timestamp_dev_responded": 1392631562, "recommendationid": "9057638", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 73, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529948", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1395162935, "steamid": "76561197970673476", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A few things so far about Victory: The Age of Racing:\n(This is not an actual review)\n\n- The game menu looks quite satisfying and is clearly arranged.\n- This game is definitely pay to win. Proof? The developers are presenting the \"build your own car\" thing as one of the main features. At the beginning you have already one car of each class so you can start right of racing. so far so good. to build your own car, you need at last (probably with extra parts and stuff a few 100 more) 5200 Gears Credits (the only ingame currency). If you win one of these early multiplayer races (don't know if its getting noticeably more when you progress) you get ~100 GC. So, to build your own the cheapest car of any class, without spending real money, wou have to win like 50 races. Races i've driven were appr. 4 - 6 minutes. In comparison: You can buy one of these predefined cars for the half of the price, which might be even a bit faster. So i think that the real money thing ones again ruins a game by slowing it down horribly, which equals pay to win to me. \n- Gameplay is (after years of developement of this former-free-to-play game) like Mario Kart without Toads and bananas, but more buggy and erratic. But still quite fun to drive, a bit like trackmania. In conclusion this game is very arcadish, while it is published to have \"realistic car physics\".\n\nOne of the game developers once said in an interview with insidesimracing on Youtube (2012), that at the beginning, when they startet the title as free-to-play, they thought about not making one of these ptw games. Now the game is still in developement, is ptp and even ptw, too. I kind of regret buying it.\n\nAt the moment i have, to be honest, no MASSIVE complaint about the game how it is. It's okay, not more or less. But if you make the \"mistake\" to judge this game by what it pretends to be, it's absolutely not enough and seems like a bit of a hoax.\n\nAt the end i have to put a careful \"YET\", as the developers have time to and possibilities to fix these points, hopefully.", "timestamp_updated": 1392154977, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "14", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1392152771, "votes_down": 50, "developer_response": "Hey there! following player's concerns and suggestions on the official forums we decided today to release this official announcement:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/games/victory/announcements/detail/1261309464223430251\n\nPlease take a look at it: we think that this addresses your concerns about our humble game, if not, please partecipate to the forums discussion and give us your opinion on the \"pay to win\" matter.\n\nIf our response it's enough to address your concerns about the game please consider to modify your review accordingly. \n\nThank you so much for your feedback and suggestions, we really want to listen to what our players are saying about the game."}, {"recommendationid": "14330757", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503542", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1455996415, "steamid": "76561198087732357", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game always has to be online.

While this is true MOST of the time, (just recently raced against 6 other racers in a major event) those leaning on this one flaw in the game are missing out on alot of what Victory has to offer. \n\nVictory: The Age of Racing is simply the best racing game I've played on Steam. Hands down. The blistering sense of speed is better than all but one of the many racing games I've experienced, F-Zero GX being the best in that category. The three classes of cars: Legend, Classic, and Formula, each have thier own handling characteristics and quirks, and each reqiring a different skillset to be brought to thier fullest racing potential. Combine that with probably some of the most fun and frustrating original tracks in a racing game (Mario Kart notwithstanding) and you have one hell of a racing experience. That, quite honestly, only gets better with the addition of rival racers. When they're on of course.\n\nCar customization is another thing Victory has down. The paint room is very Forza-esque in it's function, but one thing I like about it better than Forza is the fact your graphics don't get warped on curved sections of your car. The decals curve with your cars curves, which makes painting replicas pretty satisfying. Plus the fact you can MAKE YOUR CAR LOOK HOWEVER YOU WANT IT TO. You want a crazy front wing that looks like it wont even work aerodynamically? Slap it on there! You want a two story tall rear wing on that Classic car? Go for it! Dont want wings at all? Who da heck needs downforce!? The styles of car are endless, and it's very interesting to see all the custom cars drivers make. From F1 replicas to \"How is that even working?\"\n\nAlso, well, going back to the point that there arent alot of people playing this game. The few who do, at least the ones that I know, are all really friendly. If you come in and see some one on, dont be afraid to ask questions. From what I know, the community in Victory recognize the lack in number of players and will help any newbie who needs help in anything. I will definitely answer any questions asked to me if im on. As you can see with my hours on record, I'm on quite a bit. \n\nSo dont let the \"Mixed\" reviews on this game turn you off to it. Ive had so much fun with this game in the near 10 months I've owned it, even made a few really good friends. If you see video games as an investment and not as an opportunity to have some fun, I can't help you there. But if you're looking for a well made racing experience in a fantasy setting, look no further. Come on in, theres a car with your name on it waiting to be driven.\n\n\nNo seriously, the cars have your name on them. It's pretty cool.\n\n\n-------------------------\n\n\nP.S. Forgot to mention. It's small, but probably one of the coolest features in this game is the fact that you are still in control of your car after you cross the finish line.

Nice twist that gives you the ability to put together your own personal ride, just choose from one of three base classes of car types and then choose front/mid and rear end combos and customise with paints and decals.\n\nThe driving model has a real pedigree ( based on the Kunos NetKar Pro engine ) and is very rewarding, you have to work with it a bit but then you get good feedback and with that control with the legend cars four wheel drifting and the classics snapping back from oversteer nicely.\n\nThe tracks are coloutful! with fantasy swooping tracks offering various surfaces adding to the fun and there is promise of procedural tracks adding a huge number of layouts in the future.\n\nThe racing is online already! with races and live hotlap parties, you earn level up race points, widgets to add boosts to and Gears to spend on improving your current ride.\n\nNow it is early access, so there are some minor issues and it is developing, but the Devs are very much active on the forums ( that was a major factor in my purchase ) and the community is small but very encouraging.\n\nAs I said short review there is more in this game to discover and enjoy,", "timestamp_updated": 1396014195, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1396014195, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "9005271", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506191", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1474280992, "steamid": "76561197985958430", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 8422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Facts: I'm a game moderator (voluntary user); I can be biased, but I know this game really well; also, remember that this is Early Access, so still a beta phase.\n\nTalking about the game: first of all, despite the tags, this is NOT a simulator; it's more like an arcade racing game with realistic features (don't expect to drift on every corner or have random racing lines); still, the model is really satisfying: the racing experience and setup know-how is rewarded, while beginners won't have many problems driving their first cars. With the inclusions of new events, career mode and other stuff there's plenty to do, and car customization is one of the best ever seen in a racing game, both on visual stuff like paint and development. Good races are real fun, and the tracks are inspired and good to drive in. The devs also are very active, and try to fix bugs in a quickly way (also are active in the forums, which is nice).\n\nBad things: excluding random bugs (which I'm not experiencing at the moment, save for some really minor stuff) the worst part is the performance of the game in this phase. We know that graphic optimization and new shaders are coming very soon, but at the moment on many computers a race with full roster will make the fps drop. There's also the minor issue of a little population, but hopefully this will change in the next weeks (it's still early - early access), and the races and events still flow very nicely, so it's not really a problem.\n\nWhat will come next: full Steam integration, procedural race tracks, track editor and Steam Workshop support. Probably some of the best features to have in a game like this.\n\nFor old users: the payment model has changed. This is now a buy-to-play; so you will need to buy the game if you want to play (it's not going free to play after the beta) but THERE ARE NO MORE MICROTRANSACTIONS in the game. Also, the reward were raised quite a lot, so buying new cars is much faster.\n\nConclusions: in my opinion, if you like racing games, you are curious or look for a relaxed fun game go for it. There's plenty to do, the game has some good depth, the class are really different one from each other and at this low price it's worth the entry, also because new features will flow in and make the game even better. Still, if you like only Simulators, beware that this game is not one; don't expect an Assetto Corsa or rFactor or iRacing here, because it's not (and it does not pretend to be one).", "timestamp_updated": 1393178787, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1391778056, "votes_down": 25}, {"recommendationid": "9225913", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500268", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1412379556, "steamid": "76561198057194824", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Its fun, however, i get some serious frame rate issues.

Force feedback on a G27 wheel feels better than in many expensive games by big studios. The developers listen to the players and the game has already gotten better in the few days I've played it when they changed the amount of gear credits you get from good lap times. I only wish it will get many more players in the future. I've tried to get my friends to play it but many seem to be put off by the arcadey look which I don't mind at all even if I prefer realistic simulation games, as the car's handling is just so fun in this.
