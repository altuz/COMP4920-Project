Build your ship, be a pirate around a world, recruit new people, board other ships and concur.\n\n- Yep... that is the only plus. The game is buggy. Some skills (such as cleaning) don't activate at the same time as other skills (such as fishing), despite multiple crew members having both abilities. This shouldn't be an issue. Pointless to repair the hull on cannon attacks because the destroyed hulls still block cannon shots. Your crew will commit suicide if you click too fast between grappling from an island/ship back to your ship because they will just fall into the water. If they don't have swimming, they're dead.\n\n- Honestly, just get rid of swimming entirely. I see sharks in the water. Should've either been a (fairly forgiving, 25%?) random multiplier of a shark eating your crew if one is in the water.\n\n- Stat system, despite apparently being heavily patched up to the current build, is broken. Some stats are useless while others are OP (vitality). Poor balancing.\n\n- Extremely repetitve\n\n- Long load times between each transition that shouldn't be long. Why? This game is not that intensive on a computer system. \n\n- Lots of time will be wasted looting a ship. If the morale and hunger \"froze\" during the loot phase, this wouldn't be an issue. Seeing as it doesn't, it's almost pointless to loot everything due to the time wasted doing so. Or rather, it should just auto loot once the ship is plundered. Problem solved.\n\n\n\nFor a game that has so much potential behind it, it saddens me how much this one falls flat.
