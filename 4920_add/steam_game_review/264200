You have two buttons. And neither does it get boring, nor does it get too easy, because of its adaptive game speed. There are unlockable skills that really impact the gameplay. Also the different enemy types and stage modes like retro film or lightsword make it impressively diverse. Visuals and sound are awesome and add perfectly to the experience. It is hectic and adrenaline inducing, and Top20 material.
