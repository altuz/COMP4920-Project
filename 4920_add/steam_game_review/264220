The levels become ever more devious as you progress but are never hard for the wrong reasons. One cool mechanic is the scenery/mood change after you die alot. And you will be dying alot. One tip, look carefully ahead of you for any traps that might not be easily apparent. The music is very good and sets the mood nicely for each set of levels. The scenery and backgrounds for each level are beautifully done and are pleasant on the eyes. The hero moves at a slow pace to begin with but before long you are running for your life from traps and ducking and dodging with the best of em. In each level a collectible can be found and in alot of cases, a new power is needed so collecting it must be done later. All in all the game offers value at and above the current price. It has its charm and challenges and will have you cursing every god you can name at times but as always, overcoming the challenges is its own reward. For what the game is and offers, it executes perfectly in every aspect and any platformer fan out there should rise to the challenge.", "timestamp_updated": 1399006218, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1399006218, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "9996285", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516592", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1430690000, "steamid": "76561198025235725", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Reminiscent of Super Meat Boy in its ambience and brutal traps, this little platformer proves itself worthy of those who enjoy a short but fun challenge.

I've actually beaten the original Flash incarnation of this game before, so this is less a review and more of a comparison/series of general thoughts.\n\nMr. Bree was, and still is, an enjoyable cartoon platformer. Through a series of 60 levels, you'll control the titular pig as he runs and jumps through a series of increasingly-difficult locations, ranging from simple forests to abattoirs and everything in-between.\n\nI never got the sense that this was as difficult as any of the Meat Boy games, as there seemed to be a lot of leeway in difficulty - I never felt it was impossible to complete a stage, and the levels feel like they were designed to reward people who practiced the wall-jumping/double-jumping and wanted to speedrun them.\n\nMuch like Meat Boy, though, the story is near-irrelevant fluff meant to tie certain worlds together. The whole pretext of the story is a pig waking up with amnesia after escaping from a slaver, and he has forgotten most of his basic skills. I felt that this concept (of having to learn your abilities) could have been taken a lot further. While there are opportunities to go back to earlier levels and get items with unlocked abilities, the levels themselves never really play up the fact that you're limited in mobility for a certain stretch of time. Contrast that to something like Don't Move, which rewards you based on trying and/or failing to increase your mobility or set of abilities. Once you unlock double-jumping, most of the levels become a breeze and there's no real threat to any of the obstacles.\n\nStill, I found it to be an enjoyable romp, and for the price point (usually around $3, but less during sales), you could do a whole lot worse.", "timestamp_updated": 1404018427, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404018427, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "9994892", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497367", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1399005351, "steamid": "76561197990471756", "num_games_owned": 541, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I absolutely adore this game.

Highly recommended for fans of platformers.\n\nThe story is decent though I felt that it lacked something. Can't quite put my finger on what exactly it lacked but it kept me interested long enough to actually complete it. At first I tried to play using just the keyboard but quickly switched to my gamepad.\n[b]NOTE: I recommend using a gamepad as it makes some of the tighter places in the game much easier to reach.[/b]\nOne complaint I have is that you can't change the controls. I would rather have used the triggers for the run ability and whenever I pushed the thumbstick in, the game paused causing me to die after I resumed the game. A couple of places in the game I glitched out and had to restart the level which was a little annoying. Luckily the levels are not that big so not much progress was lost.\n\nThe game is fairly short but enjoyable. Can't say it has much replayability but I only paid $2.00 for it so I'm not complaining. I like the allusion to a sequel at the end. If you buy it and play it you'll see what I mean. I do hope there will be a sequel but this time around a little more focus on the overall story would be very nice. One annoying feature of the game, when you die a number of times the background changes color and throws shadows on the game which sometimes makes it harder to play. Sometimes it's raining, which doesn't make much difference to the way the character interacts with the world but is annoying. Key solution? DON'T DIE! \n\n[b]Spoiler[/b]\n[spoiler]If you do buy this game and play it, note that the Wild Boar boss at the end is a Bastard!
