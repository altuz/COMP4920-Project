The caracters seemed to be suitably dynamic and reacted reasonably to things that I did.  It was especially interesting to eavesdrop on conversations.  I have only done one play through, but will plan on doing more in the future!\n\nThe combat is fairly difficult to get used to, but fortunately you don't have to use it :)\n\nIf you aren't in the TL;DR, low patience, anti-reading crowd.  The console and the alternate reality game documents you can find online make for a fascinating read.
