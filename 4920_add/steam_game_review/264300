I pushed forward, however, hoping to find some satisfaction from leveling and purchasing new guns, but the game's premise, though somewhat fun-sounding, just gets old. It's top-down, twin-stick-shooter-style running around, shooting swarms of zombies (and later, aliens) coming at you endlessly until you complete an objective, or until you hold out until they're all dead (depending on if it's an offense or defense mission). It's never really anything more than that. Sometimes, simplicity in a game can be fun and invigorating, but that wasn't the case with this game for me. Even the different character classes and drone summons, etc. just didn't make the game fun for more than an hour.", "timestamp_updated": 1505711444, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505711444, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 146, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 96, "total_reviews": 242}}
