Overall, I would give this game a 8/10.", "timestamp_updated": 1485705864, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485705864, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29951519", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498578546, "steamid": "76561198352663139", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 87626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I always wanted to play an MMORPG I enjoy talking with other players doing quests and getting new gear. I noticed that in some reviews people say the game is laggy, and at times it can be bad...did get me killed once -_-\" but over all the lag is usually not that bad unless you decide to take part in events where there will sometimes be 100 players spamming their skills because it seems they have nothing better to do. All in all the game is really good and fun. If you want to play a free MMO then this is possibly the one for you.\n\nRatings:\n\nStory: 5/10\nIt is an MMO let us face it, story is never too big in them. That is not to say it is bad just that it is not too important. I actually skip all the dialogue. No need to read all that.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nThe game is very fun, but at some point it tends to get a bit dull. By level 140~170 you just get tired of doing the same kind of quest.\n\nSoundtrack: 9/10\nThe music in the game is really well done, like... you feel you are in the world of La Tale.\n\nSetting: 10/10\nI have to say I was amazed at how many different areas there are. They are all different. You got your fantasy world mixed with Japanese, Chinese, and medieval Europe. Other areas that are sci-themed and much more. Honestly, I was really impressed with how many different settings there are.\n\nOverall: 8/10\nIf you want a free MMO that does not take up a lot of your space then La Tale is perfect. When you first start up the game, you may be afraid of all the higher level players or may not understand what to do or how to play, but once you understand the basics you will become good at it. Plus there are many people out there to help you if you just ask. :D", "timestamp_updated": 1487200960, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487200960, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29610289", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498426333, "steamid": "76561198076067972", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "As someone that has played this game in the past I love all the new content.
