I couldn't find a single review or opinion on the internet or user review in here, but after reading the Community Hub I decided to give it a try, and here what I think about it:\n\nPros:\n- Weight: It's quite a lightweight program, so older computers can run it.\n- Perspective tool: It helps a LOT when working on sceneries. You can use up to 3 vanishing points, and it's easy to adjust the angle.\n- Pose Tool: I was really curious about it, specially since it's something I always missed in other drawing programs and how it would work with angles and perspective, and it work quite nicely.\n- Panels: They may feel a bit odd at first, but they really help a lot. You draw inside them, and then you can position and adjust them in your comic.\n- The Developers: Not only they've been helping newbies to the program, giving tips and instructions and making guides on how to use it, they also been listening to the users.\n- Price: A good program for a fair price, what not like about it?\n\nContras:\n- The UI: It can be a bit hard to understand on how to use for begginers, but it's not hard once you learn on how to use it (which for me didn't take long, around three to five minutes poking around the program).\n- Lack of Guides and Tutorials: It's a fairly new program so, which means it's hard to find tutorials and guides on the internet, but as I said earlier, the developers have been of great help with guides and answering users questions.\n- Tablet - It's highly recommended to have a graphic tablet to use the program, and sadly not everyone have or can afford one.\n\nSo yeah, I do recommend this program.", "timestamp_updated": 1393019750, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1393019750, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "10020289", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524961", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1401294530, "steamid": "76561198013494178", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great program.

Lets you adjust and move a skeleton for characters. \nRulers! Adjustable straight lines, curved lines and circles. \nCustomizable brushes\n\nCons: \nFeels a little clunky compared to SAI. \nSmoothing on the cursor/pen is responsive at 0, but when you draw curves they come out blocky.

It has a lot of interesting tools, and it has enough going for it to satisfy any comic or manga artist. And worse case scenario if it doesn't suit your needs, there's no reason you can't start each page on this program then add finishing touches with a more advanced one if you have it. \n\nIn summation, this isn't photoshop.

So be honest with yourself, with your level and your degree of knowledge of scenes and characters.  If you're clueless on the scenes, but know your characters, Mangalabo might be the right tool.

You want to draw pictures, or more specifically, a comic.\n\nWell, this software is built around this particular use case. It can also do illistrations, but it's not built around that use case quite as much as it is comics.\n\nYou have the vitual 'paper' of the page to be drawn. You don't draw directly on this, like in MS paint. You have panels. For an illistration, a panel can be the entire page. When you're making a comic, you'll have more then one, and you can easily resize and move them around  a bit after drawing them. It also allows you to distort the whole panel if you want. There's lots of options there. Inside these panels, you have your standard layers, like in everything that's not MS paint.\n\nIt will take mouse input, so you don't need to buy a $100 tablet (or $250 tablet-equipped laptop) but if you have one, that also works. It has drawing guides, like French Curves for us Drafting people, that let you draw smoothly with either method.\n\nPros:\nIt's cheap, Buy it once and you're done\n\nHas some tools very useful for it's inteded application.\n\nhas figures you can pose to get a sense of scale, this is REALLY nice if you're like me and utterly stink at drawing characters.\n\nHas nice export functions, and some limited vector graphics capibility (it's a raster program, so no exporting)\n\nDoesn't chew up too much memory, while you're running.\n\nA fair decent selection of  brushes and the like.\n\nHas guides, even mouse drawn stuff can look good. \n\nPerspective grid <3 so much less involved for basic outlining of that sort of scene.\n\nCons:\nThe pressure sensitivity for tablets isn't there (at least on the t730 it's not) it also doens't change the cursor to tell you it's getting it's cues from the pen, it's nice for me to have that visual feedback so I know when I can let my palm rest.\n\nEditing spines is TEDIOUS. Avoid using them when you can.\n\nThe toolbars on the sides don't stay inside the window, so it can cover the start bar or end up half offscreen when I rotate the tablet..\n\nIt lacks a classical 'ruler' with mm/pixels/inch measurement, it IS nice to have that now and again. Not so much a con as a feature I miss dearly.\n\nCould use more figures. A hand is one example I'd love to see added. I tied to add one myself (You can do that!) but it failed miserably.\n\nIt could use some tutorials, but I know those are slowly coming.\n\nLacks a plugin API that I know about (if it has one, I can think of at least one handy plugin to add, I'd make it myself if need be)\n\n\nAll in all, it's not a bad program.

Develop your drawing skills first. Even with the pose options you will not be able to draw good if you are not familiar with the anatomy of the drawing. \nSo if you are buying this software thinking your comics are going to look any better most likely they wont.\n\n2-If you don't like to explore the software yourself stay away from it most of the help you will be scavenging through the discussions.

Pose creation does not have pose delete or rename - you have to go through the preset manager.\n\nAlso the smoothing option is wonky you will have to play around till you find the sweet spot - which might not exactly be what you need.\n\n\nAll said and done - for the discounted price I can recommend it. Its not Manga studio but than for the discounted price its worth it - which I recommend the developer to reduce to that permanently.\n\nI highly recommend checking out the guides posted by the developer - they will answer most of your questions.\n\nThe lack of proper pictorial manual is simply unacceptable - seems like the dev is highly dependent on having the user already used and being familiar with other photo / illustrative tools.\n\nAlso if you plan to draw with a mouse - please don't buy this software.\n\nLink to tutorial: \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=215951642", "timestamp_updated": 1451439932, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451439794, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "26252862", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1481582776, "steamid": "76561198088046171", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 9284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Iv'e used this software for a while, and honestly, it's great!\nFor the price you get alot, and you can do alot with it. \n\nJust a reliable Software to make cool artwork. \n\nBuy.", "timestamp_updated": 1477610305, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477610305, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "29230226", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1488231314, "steamid": "76561198206075107", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 3044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It takes some getting used to, and I'll be honest, the splines don't work very well for me, but otherwise it's a good little program.
