I currently found the best way to play the game is in cinematic view in the traditional fixed camera Resident Evil style and am more than pleased to see this in another horror game rather than the over the shoulder action cam. so that's a gold star there ! well done !\n\nOn a further sidenote, the scenery and settings for the game have been rendered beautifully and really lend to the atmosphere !\n\nHowever the cons still out weigh the pros but not by the largest stretch I originally thought when the game wouldn't work. With some performance tweaks to reduce the frequency of loading screens, re-designing of the Inventory UI to a better standard, control scheme to possibly allow controller support and finally some extended hardware supprt to prevent further problems that I originally faced, the game has alot of potential, but at present I would say it feels more like an early access game with its issues rather than a finished product (no offense intended by saying that) and would benefit from further developement.\n\nAs stated before, it does have potential and I hope the developer will have continued support and updates for this title, I am more than hopeful for further updates and will look forward to changing my opinion to \"recommended\" in the near future.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nSound: 8/10\nGameplay: 6/10\nControl: 7/10\n\nOverall 67%", "timestamp_updated": 1393545118, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "13", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1393461674, "votes_down": 44, "developer_response": "We found the problem.\n\nWith the newest NVidia drivers ( \"GeForce 334.89\" and \"GeForce 334.67 BETA\" ) the game stops running.\n\nPlease donwgrade to the \"GeForce 332.21\" ( Jan 07, 2014 )."}, {"recommendationid": "9281311", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 50, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540785", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1393605672, "steamid": "76561197995080618", "num_games_owned": 1026, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "(!!!DO NOT BUY!!!)\nThe game tries to recreate the original resident evil games, but fails in almost every way.\n\nPoor texture, model and animation quality while also being very dark and almost all black and white.\nControls are limiting only back, forward, aim, action, inventory and reload make's it painful walking around without being able to look around while you move.

It is absolutely riddled with flaws but it manages to be a great game regardless of them.  If you can get used to them and treat them as 'rules' the flaws don't overcome all the love with which this game was designed, and the more work they do on the game, the more easily recommended it becomes.  The awful load times are *gone* now.  I imagine they contributed hugely to the low score on this one, but they've been fixed.\n\nNo official controller support.  That's mandatory in a game like this.  I played with Xpadder but there should be integrated support already.  Xpadder needs to be run as administrator and it can still be a bit wonky.\n\nNow, who's the game meant for is people that are fans of the original Resident Evil games.  I see some Silent Hill in here as well but mainly Resident Evil.  If you're familiar with them you can tell by my Steam avatar that I'm fond of Resident Evil.  My favourites in fact.  What that means for thi game is something similar to fixed cameras, and it operates with tank controls.  Many people have criticised the controls of Resident Evil for being poor, but they're very finely tuned (besides the very first game in 1996) and carefully designed; they just take a whole lot of getting used to.  Unfortunately, Black Soul's are not a good.  The truth is it's the camera.  People are mainly thrown by the camera in Resident Evil and that's the case here.  The trouble is Resident Evil's cameras are perfectly designed (from Resident Evil 2 on; the 1996 game had abysmal cameras), so it's really a matter of getting used to them.  Black Soul's camera is not well designed.  But I got used to it.  There's an over-the-shoulder camera as well but don't play it that way, please.  Makes it boring.  Live a little and get acclimated to the regular camera.\n\nThe mystery is compelling, both in gameplay and story.  Unfortunately, though the story is generally well done (despite being done nigh entirely in documents) the finale doesn't quite deliver.  Worth playing to the end, though.\n\nA huge difference between this and Resident Evil is the lack of auto-aim.  *Usually* it's not a problem, per se, but I'd have preferred a different sort of combat.  This takes far more getting used to for people not accustomed to fixed cameras, although I wish there were a lot more properly fixed camera angles, supplemented by the auto-aim of Resident Evil.  The way it's done now is a 'cinematographic' camera that follows you from a sort of weird (but workable) angle for nearly all areas where there's combat, and the fixed angles are largely reserved for non-combat areas.\n\nCombat system is lacking but combat is clearly not the focus of the game.  It works well enough, but I prefer classic Resident Evil.  A chief problem I do have with it is that if you run past a bunch of enemies, so long as they're aware of you you can't interact with any thing but doors (actually, I think you can pick up health and ammo).  This makes combat essentially necessary in many cases where I'd have just called the lift and left.\n\nMy other main problem is I wish saving were a bit less exploitable.  Game's a bit too easy this way.\n\nAnd last is the map.  I appreciate what they were trying to do, and if you follow the map from the beginning of an area it's grand, but if you try to pick up in the middle of one of these maze-like sections you'll have some trouble.  I'm conflicted on this.\n\nIf you like classic Resident Evil, get this game.

Unfortunately, Blacksoul resurrects many of the flaws from that era, while leaving most of the enjoyable elements of those classics [i]dead and buried[/i].\n\nThe negatives? Loading screens between each... and... every... single... room... transition. Any amount of horror atmosphere BlackSoul might have otherwise had is completely ruined by the immersion-breaking load screens. The only dread I experienced while playing this game resulted from the knowledge that I'd have to stare at that loading screen again when I moved to the next room.\n\nThen we have the clunky character/camera control. The ridiculously simplistic and boring combat. The inability to 'Esc' out of various menus. The terrible sound effects, animations, lighting, and textures. The awful character models.\n\nNow, I'm generally of the opinion that good art design is more important than the latest whiz-bang graphical effects - but even in that sense, BlackSoul looks dull, flat, cheap, and uninspired. \n\nAs for positives, BlackSoul does have a decently suspenseful soundtrack; music is very important in maintaining proper atmosphere in these sorts of games, and they did manage to get that right. Puzzle design, while not brilliant or innovative, is at least logical (mostly), and the game generally provides all the clues necessary to solves its puzzles without resorting to pure guesswork.\n\nSadly, it takes much more than 'decent' music and 'okay' puzzles to make a [i]good[/i] survival horror game. I wouldn't recommend BlackSoul to even the most die-hard fan of classic survival horror.\n\n\n******** EDIT: 5/12/2016 ********\n\nOkay, I gave it another shot.\n\nAt some point during the past year the devs patched out most of those infuriating loading screens. After giving Blacksoul another try, however, I still cannot recommend this game. While the super annoying load screens are mostly gone, Blacksoul's actual gameplay simply is not fun. At all.\n\nNow, of course, many games revolve around key collecting as a way to advance from one area to the next. But Blacksoul doesn't even try to put your key collecting activities into any sort of context. You are collecting keys and opening doors for no reason other than to find more keys and open more doors. No attempt is made to give the player any sense of urgency or purpose in any of this, and the few diaries you find here and there do very little to help in that regard. \n\nAside from all the pointless key collecting, you'll also spend a great amount of time backtracking...and backtracking...and backtracking. Did I mention backtracking?\n\nHonestly, I kinda wish the devs had left the loading screens in.

It isn't without its minor flaws and frustrations you'd expect from such a game. I personally enjoyed the 10+ hours I spent playing through it. You can tell the game developers are huge fans of genre, as a result the game plays out as a sort of love-letter to the games of that era. Black Soul had a few genuine thrills, a couple of cheap scares, an interesting epistolary story, a stellar cinematographic camera mode, and a killer soundtrack.

Remapping keys is tricky, since I have found options to remap forward\\backward movement, but not left\\right, but as long as you don't hate WSAD you'll feel comfortable. Cinematic screen has been said to be a pain, but tracking mode makes it close to RE 4\\5\\6 games.

Puzzles are very appealing, require imagination but not designed to keep you at one place for ages. \n\nVisuals\\style gets very high grade from me. If you price high-res textures and modern visual effects, this definitely won't work for you since technically the graphics is somewhere at resident evil 2 level. On the other hand, if you can bear that, I think overall level design is catchy and stylish, pretty well made (you don't expect to see things like lens flares in a game like this, but they are there).\n\nSound\\atmosphere is overall haunting and much better than were my expectations for it.

Whilst the graphics seem dated, there is a tense atmosphere throughout aided by a great soundscape and musical score.  Some of the more subtle sound effects in the indoor locations had me listening with one ear of my headphones as I thought the sound was coming from somewhere in my room.\n\nSure the gameplay is repetitive with a very long level early on in the game that I'm sure would have put a lot of people off only for them to miss out on the more atmospheric areas.  Yes the storyline is a little samey but there are only so many stories survival horror can tell without repetition (it's not as bad story-wise as some of the more ludicrous RE plotlines recently).\n\nThis is by no means a masterpiece, but considering it is a two-person team of developers this is also by no means a terrible game.  For the price it is selling at I have played much worse.
