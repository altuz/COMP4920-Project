Look no further. With elements of Steamworld Dig (randomised mines, collect minerals of ever-increasing value the deeper you go, locate portals for quick returns in trickier parts of the map) this offers plenty of replayability, even though the shooting and platforming elements start to get a little repetitive over what seems to be a single enormous level. Similar to the level creation in Cargo Commander, you give your new level a name and the game randomises it based on that name...somehow.\n\nThe deeper you go into the mines, the more chance you have of scoring better guns, although the loot system is a little disappointing. There aren't randomised gun effects, only % stats (higher damage, firing rate, etc) and there are precious few different hats you can wear to give you extra stuff, like 2 additional jumps (yes, you can jump 5, 6 or even 7 times in the air).\n\nJumping feels a little floaty, and your gun has the annoying tendancy to point upwards when you're jumping up to a higher platform, meaning you inadvertently fire vertically rather than horizontally like you were expecting. However once you get used to how your character moves, you'll be zipping around levels in no time (an XBox 360 controller is recommended).\n\nYour character can only see a limited distance around him/her, and when you get damaged this cone of vision starts to shrink, meaning you can get into some really nasty spots with extremely limited vision - you may find this a welcome addition or an annoyance.\n\nStill, those quibbles aside, Platformines offers a ton of platforming content and that addictive, often elusive \"just one more play until I get to the next portal/find a better gun/grab that sparkly bit of ore over there\" feel.

The Robodig is destroyed and you must fix it! Or something! So let's just shoot the story and go for a little platforming and shooting and loot collecting... in a mine!\n\nPlatformines is a nice package indeed, combining features from several genres to create a fun game that does nothing really new but still feels fresh. \n\nYou start by creating a male or female character from a couple of visual options, and are then brought into a randomly generated mine (where your ship, the Robodog, totally crashed). Your job is to explore the mine and relocate several building blocks to restore the ship- and to do so you need to fight masses of enemies, collect coins and loot, upgrade your equipment and be an all-round badass.\n\nYou also get to listen to a chiptune rendition of \"Hall of the Mountain King.\"\n\nPlatforming is nice and precise even with a keyboard, though a pad is clearly better. From the get-go you have quintuple jumps, and there is almost no momentum, so you'll quickly put Mario to shame by staying airborne and shooting things easily. Vanity items you collect can give you even more jumps and also change armour rating, weapon damage, and other attributes.\n\nShooting feels old-school and satisfying. You can equip up to four weapons (pistol, shotgun, machine gun and launcher) and just like the Borderlands games every weapon is procedurally generated, so you'll often find something surprising. There's no ammo limit either; while weapons have magazines and reload times you always have \"infinite bullets\".\n\nAnd there's more equipment, most notably energy belts that increase the amount of damage you can take but also larger backpacks: You'll collect gems on your way to sell in your homebase OR, and this is interesting, to replenish your shield belts. Do you dare to try and secure that teleporter over there and chash in on the gems, or would you rather play it save and spend them to make it further down the mine?\n\nAll in all, this really feels like an over the top \"roguelike\" without permadeath. Your home base is a safe haven where you can store loot, shop a little, and save your progess. The mine is constantly repopulated with enemies so if you need to grind for money you'll soon have some \"easy places\" to get some cash. It's NOT a metroidvania game- from the get-go you're able to explore as you see fit, only limited by your firepower and skill.\n\nAnd is it fun? That's the most important question after all! And yes, it is. It's a fun little platform shooter with charming retro graphics and a lot of replayability.

Launching in late March without much, or really close to any fanfare, I decided to install it one rainy Saturday afternoon and it was like finding a box of brightly colored toys in a dusty, spidery attic. A lot of the gameplay elements here are very familiar -- precision platforming, gobs of randomized loot, a never-ending cycle of weapon upgrades -- but it feels fresh, these elements were never combined in quite this way before.\n\nIt reminds me most of the lauded roguelike platformer Spelunky, except where Spelunky is all about survival, Platformines is more about exploration and aggression. There is a very large overworld to explore, and the further you move away from your base in the middle(ish) of the map in any direction, the more difficult the enemies are, enemies you can eliminate with one of four different types of gun. After finishing the game on the default difficultly level (5-6 hours) I uncovered about 25% of the map, so there's a lot of map here to explore if you're willing. There's also a fun, punk-pixel sense of style from outlandish costumes and hair-dos to five-eyed blob monsters to platforms filled with whirring blades of bloody death.\n\nOn the downside, the game is a tad on the short side, but for the price and the type of game, I'm really not sure a 10-20 hour epic would have worked. I would have liked to have seen more enemy and area variety, plus a better reward for finishing the game rather than \"the same thing, only harder,\" but I certainly don't feel cheated in any way.

A highly addictive time killer that gets you running aroung a randomized dungeon looking for gems and loot. RPG element involves geting stronger guns so you do more damage. THe game starts off slow and you may die frequently. The goal early on is to get cash so you can upgrade your shield and bag size. Later you can decide how difficult you want your run to be, either stay in teh easy areas and get loot or challenge yourself by going deeper into the dungeon. Highly recommend this to anyone who likes these type of games. The controller is setup a little differently but you will get used to it really quickly. I am an old time gamer and I was comfortable with the controls shortly after starting the game.", "timestamp_updated": 1402892175, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1402892175, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 61, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 22, "total_reviews": 83}}
