It's got a lot of the great elements from the series (particularly my favorite 'so you want to be a hero?'). The story is fun and the gameplay solves a lot of the bugs from the Glory series. The additional character dev and scripting is a nice, slightly corny touch :). My main criticism is that the game lacks a lot of the depth/length for the genre. It's fun and has replay value, but there are not as many options and the track is a bit too fixed for my taste. I still enjoyed it and would recommend getting it on sale for a good time. \n\nPros:\n-Nostalgia overload\n-Improvement on gameplay/visuals/audio of genre\n-Fun twist on the 'Glory' good-guy\n-Replay value\n\nCons:\n-Limited branching/complexity \n-A bit short", "timestamp_updated": 1491848746, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491848746, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31748853", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503250", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1495363480, "steamid": "76561198053422391", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I just wanted to say how much I loved this game. It plays like Hero's quest but with a heap of creativity and rogueish fun. I just completed the game with the Magician and want to go through again with the other two hero options.

I bought on sale because I love old adventure games like Quest for Glory, King's Quest etc. I generally think this is a poor substitute, I would only recommend buying on a significant discount. I liked the 'infamy' aspect of the game. \n\n1) The combat sucks. It is easy, sluggish and boring. Unlike in so many adventures games that require clever solutions, most of the story in this is advanced by beating a boss, but I killed them all on my first try with little effort. \n\n2) The map is overly large and annoying to walk through, especially the dwarven mines. \n\n3) Despite the fact it is years from original release, the game is still super buggy. The triggers for interacting with objects are not properly set to the image, and you end up just randomly clicking around a thing to get the right interaction triggered. Same issue entering/exiting scenes in the game. A few puzzles can be bypassed (e.g. jello cube thing). \n\n4) The voice acting sucks, it is too loud and echoes, I played the whole game with it off. \n\n5) You tend to accumulate a large number of items that you have no use for and clutter up your inventory. It would be nice to have a chest in your room. Even QFG had the sense to include that....\n\nSo buy it for cheap and play through if you like adventure games, but it isn't worth full price.", "timestamp_updated": 1495383476, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495383476, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "32929142", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1449660412, "steamid": "76561197984467439", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Highly recommended for the fans of old Sierra games.", "timestamp_updated": 1498649623, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498649623, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 34, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 37}}
