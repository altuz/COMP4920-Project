This will be accomplished by lying to, stealing from, and in one case, actually poisoning the innocent bystanders who stand in her way. Adventure games with jerk protagonists are nothing new, but Suzanne is a special kind of self-centered a-hole. I understand that her cause is essentially just, but wow, is it strange how quick she is to deceive and inconvenience people to suit her own interests. Also, there's a part where she uses firecrackers to scare of some pigeons, presumably deafening them, when the same end could have been accomplished by simply walking up to them, waving her arms and going 'shoo'. So yes, I was a little uncomfortable with her as a main character.\n\nAlso, the game takes weird liberties with the hidden object formula, which I'll get into in the Hidden Object Criteria!\n\nCriteria 1: To what degree do the puzzle screens look like a thrift store vomited on my monitor?\n\nThe game's developers obviously knew this was an issue, so they largely force Suzanne to find items in piles of garbage. This happens so often that it's actually kind of a theme in the game - there's a recycling station that people haven't been respecting very well, two dumpsters, a river that people use as a dump, even a net full of random items that have been dredged out of the ocean. It's nice to see developers putting in the effort of trying to come up with places which would have items to pick over, but sad to see that all they could come up with is trash heap after trash heap after trash heap.\n\nCriteria 2: Are the searches justified by the premise/story?\n\nNot in the least - and in a very strange way. While most games ask players to remove a variety of items from a pile of nonsense in order to find the item they need to proceed, Lost Civilization tasks them primarily with filling trash heaps with even more garbage. Sure, from time to time there's a classic 15-1 item search, but about as often the player will be handed an inventory full of random items, and match them with something on the screen that they're related to. Not only is this less entertaining than making items disappear, it makes considerably less narrative sense. Where are these extra items coming from? What is accomplished by adding them to the pile? At least in traditional HOSs there's a narrative figleaf in which we can imagine removing three armloads worth of items helps us locate the thing we're really looking for - even if it was right there in the middle of the screen all along. These 'Added Object Sceens' don't track in any way, shape, or form.\n\nCriteria 3: How well do the various puzzles and object searches meld together to form a coherent whole?\n\nThe developers do a decent enough job here. While adding garbage to scenes never makes any kind of sense, it's always in service of perfectly logical, if slightly dickish, goals. The game also moves along at very brisk pace. It's only two hours long, but in that time Suzanne will explore two major and three minor locations, go through more than a dozen HOSs and AOSs, as well as deal with puzzles that fit right in with the world in which the game takes place. As a narrative it has more than a few holes - no one ever really explains what Nibiru has to do with anything, and Suzanne is perhaps the most incurious archaeologist in the history of fiction, but by and large the story works as a frame to hang the various activities on.\n\nWhile Lost Civilization is nowhere near the top of my list of Hidden Object Games, it's extremely professionally produced and never gets frustrating. This is largely due to something that I feel like the game should have singled out in its marketing - it has perhaps the fastest-recharging hint button I've ever encountered! I don't imagine players will need it that often, what with the HOSs being fairly large and easy to navigate, but it's nice to see the game letting players opt out of frustrating puzzles if they just want to get to the end. With its strange, wrongheaded innovations Lost Civilization isn't setting the world on fire, but there's much worse out there.\n\nAlso, the game features no Lost Civilization.

There is a lot of variety in the puzzles and I did not notice any bugs or major problems while playing.  Some of the hidden object scenes are a little jarring and make no sense to the game's story, but personally I feel that is a minor inconvenience.  A more wordy review follows below, but here is the tl;dr version of my opinion:\n\nGameplay: 8/10. Good variety in puzzles and very little sense of repetition aside from a few hidden object scenes that show up more than once.\n\nStory: 1/10. I give it one point for being interesting and coherent enough to follow. Unfortunately, it is completely stolen from an older game called NiBiRu: Age of Secrets.  Once I realized that (it took about half an hour at most), I lost a lot of the anticipation and enjoyment I might otherwise have gotten from the story because I always knew what was coming next.\n\nGraphics: 6/10. Perfectly acceptable but nothing spectacular, about what I would expect from a casual game like this. I  deducted an extra point because some (many) of the scenes are clearly stolen from NiBiRu and I cannot treat them as original ideas when they are not.\n\nSound: 6/10. The voice acting is not bad, with only one or two lines delivered poorly, but only 20-25% of the lines are voiced and there seems to be no consistency as to which lines are spoken and which are only shown on the screen.  Apart from that, the sound effects are decent, and the music is generally atmospheric without being overly repetitive or getting in the way.\n\nTotal: 21/40.\n\n\nFull review:\n\nLost Civilization is a pretty decent example of the casual hidden object genre. What I really like about it is that the standard hidden object scenes are broken up by a pretty wide variety of other types of puzzles. It is much closer to an old-school point and click adventure game than it is pure hidden object game.  That said, Lost Civilization still falls firmly into the casual game category.  At roughly three to four hours to play start to finish (and that is taking time to enjoy the journey, explore all the locations more than strictly necessary and read the in-game diary that updates with your progress), it is not nearly as long as it could have been.  Additionally, the puzzles were by and large pretty easy. If you are a veteran of standard adventure games like King's Quest, Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island and/or The Longest Journey, you will not find much to challenge you here.  However, as I said before, the different puzzles are a very nice departure from pure hidden object gameplay with a story attached.\n\nWhich brings us to the story. The story is the biggest problem I have with this game.  Lost Civilization is essentially a remake of the game NiBiRu: Age of Secrets, published in 2005 by The Adventure Company. The plot points, some of the puzzles, and even a fair bit of the setting and art are shamelessly, blatantly stolen from NiBiRu.  This game should not have been marketed as an original game, and I am very disappointed in the developers for not coming up with their own story.  If it were marketed as a remake or an homage I would have less of a problem with this, but this is presented as an original game and it is absolutely not.\n\nAll in all, I suppose I would still recommend this game for hidden object fanatics looking for a bit of variety or people looking for an easy introduction to point-and-click style puzzles that won't make you think too hard.  At $5 it was an acceptable value for the money, but I cannot give this game a thumbs up because it is such a blatant copy of another game.", "timestamp_updated": 1417245709, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417245709, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "25743787", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1475086230, "steamid": "76561197988839076", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A visually nice game but I have to agree with the comments about it being \"empty\" and too guided.
