I swam in the shallows, taking in the vividly colourful landscape which was just teeming with ocean life. I lifted my head out of the water for a few minutes to talk to a friend, and when I looked back down I found myself gazing at emptiness. I had drifted over the edge of the reef, and the vastness, the sheer overpowering mysteriousness of it all hit me like a megaton of bricks. I froze, waiting for some unknown sea-beast to rise up from the murky darkness and claim my frail form as its prize (or lunch). It did not, of course, and I was able to splash and sputter my way back to the safety of the shallows. \n\nThis game makes me relive that gut-wrenching moment time and time again, and I am absolutely cherishing every moment of it.

(I have a DEEP fear of the ocean so it has been hilarious for my son to watch me try to get through this game).  \n\n-Story/Setting-\nWe are absolutely in love with the mystery in this game!  I have a fear of the deep ocean so all of the dark caves, mysterious sea creatures, and horrifying sounds from the depths will haunt my nightmares forever.  The sound and music of this game does an excellent job of drawing you into the world.  We are eager to discover the many mysteries that surround this ocean and I can't help but shake the feeling that something lurks the deep water only at night.\n\n-Gameplay-\nThis game does an amazing job of not telling you directly what to do but still guides you toward progression points through the communications you get throughout the game.  It reminds me of gaming back before the developers had to hold your hand with waypoints and tutorials for every new tiny feature.  We are continually discovering new ways to get around this alien world and with each discovery the world gets that much more vast!  \n\n-Controls- \nControls are usually one of the first things I research about a game before I purchase it.  The game is easy enough for my 5 year old son to pick up on the basics so that means this is a game theoretically anyone could handle learning.  My son plays on an Xbox controller because he does not quite have mouse/keyboard gameplay down yet.  I play both and the controls translate wonderfully on each! \n\n\nHere is a video sample of some Father/Son Subnautica if anyone would like to see more without any major story spoilers. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXFguzZ-vb4", "timestamp_updated": 1505275626, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505275626, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "35041761", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524693", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506287268, "steamid": "76561198018592950", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1729}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Bought this game mostly as a challenge to myself, I am terrified of the deep dark ocean and all the unknown dangerous creatures and terrors that lurk there. Let me tell you I was not disappointed.\n\nHowever I speak of horror and yet the game is at the same time, very relaxing. As you swim around and get your bearings for the first few hours there's this thrilling awe and excitement while you take in the sights, discover the creatures that live in the safe shallows and the resources that are there. It is not without dangers though because while there are creatures that swim away in fear as you come closer, there are some that are equally as curious about you and potentially... how you taste.\n\nEventually you begin to explore, searching for other survivors, looking for resources in shipwrecks. You start to unveil the story, discovering new biomes and creatures that live there. You begin to look for parts for bigger and better vessels to carry you on your journey and while you're used to the relative safety of where your pod landed, you're also aware that not everything is friendly and peacefull. So while you carefully observe the piece of a ship you're scanning, keeping your eyes on your oxygen levels and the local fauna, you're suddenly reminded of just how tiny and how alone you are. What was that roar?! Whatever made it sounded huge!\n\nThere's just such a wild array of emotions that this game can make you feel! It can be relaxing and awe inducing, then intriguing and suspensefull, yet absolutely terrifying. \n\nWhile this is a game that is currently in development it is highly recommended, the developers are working hard and pushing updates frequently with no tell of stopping. It is one of the few if not possibly the only early access games that I know of that actually appear to be fulfilling their promise or even just reaching completion.
