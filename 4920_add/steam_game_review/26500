If you like sliding-puzzles, and the price sounds right for 50 of them, I'd definitely reccomend Cogs.\n\n[b]Liked:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*] Good sliding-puzzles with interesting tweeks.\n    [*] Stars are awarded for compelting the puzzle, using less moves (bronze, silver, gold), and fast compleition times (bronze, silver, gold) which stretches replayability, albeit basic memorization.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Disliked:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*] \"3 gameplay modes\" is misleading. It simply offers alternate starting configurations for moves and time challenges to the same puzzles, where the bronze, sliver, and gold awards already succeeded.\n[/list]"}]}
