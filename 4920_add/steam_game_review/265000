I want to experiment with awesome cards, make fun builds, and instead, I am beating same mobs in same arenas again and again. About 1.5 hours of farm unlock 5-7 random cards. And there are 100+ locked cards. Some are rare, some are supreme. Of course, the latter will require more time. I don't want to prove it - I'm done.\n\nI used to admire this concept, but no matter how interesting it looks, for now it's just a waste of time.\n\nP.S.: Loved previous FORCED. There were ridiculous amounts of fun and rage as opposed to Showdown, which is pretty much boring.", "timestamp_updated": 1505335543, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505335326, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 201, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 33, "total_reviews": 234}}
