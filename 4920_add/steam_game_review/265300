A tentative thumbs up; sale recommended.\n\nThere is a lot to like about this game but at the same time it's high levels of frustration and rage inducing mechanics and gameplay design will often leave one wondering whether they're having fun or simply needing the justification of finally passing which ever section is currently blocking their progress.\n\nThe first boss teaches one everythig they need to know about this game. Things like taget lock will result in reload, getting hit will either result in stun or death and enevitable reload. Attacking sequentially will often result in overextension, loss of stamina and reload. Not learning the several phases of each enemies attack patterns will prevent game progression. But most importantly one must not make mistakes, learn the pattern exploit the weakness execute a flawless routine and skill will prevail.\n\nOverleveling will ease the experience and provide enough margin of error to make the game more enjoyable but this also requires more gambling of ones xp through grinding which isn't always possible and game design sometimes prevents back tracking to easier areas especilly if one triggers a boss that blocks a zone until defeated.\n\nThe graphics are decent, the story is fully fleshed out via player found notes, audio logs and cutscenes (but not to everyones liking) and each succesive completion expands on it changing the cinematic ending. The voice acting is average but also down to personnal preference. There are plenty of player incentives in the form of loot, collectables and challanges.\n\nThe controls are simple enough, sometimes they're not as responsive as one might desire. The stamina mechanic is there and harsh for players who haven't experienced it before but managable through character build and concise actions. Character development is lite rpg, and each main class does play different on the inital playthrough. New game + is really where this game starts to shine in character game design, but it also the point when one really needs to consider if they can be bothered to continue playing again, and again...\n\nCheckpoint saves, loss of xp on death but with a chance to regain it if they can collect there ghost before there next death. The ability to bank ones XP or stack it for improved gains. Respawning enemy on zone loads for grinding and the ability to avoid most boss fights in preference of earlier levels and restricted progression. Multiple uses of same maps with incentives for re-exploring beyond grinding but also tedious as one must backtrack through design. Boss fights are in restricted arenas once entered one can only leave victorious or dead. Loading screens between zones. Most zones are linear or circular with varying number of access points to other zones. Zones are mostly locked to game progression preventing accidental or inquisitve exploration.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1505834813, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505834813, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35193374", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504429", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506548046, "steamid": "76561198047738727", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 462}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's hard to describe this game.

Other enemies constantly attack with only a few moments in between. \n\nBack stabs on this game are atrocious. Many of the enemies are far too big and have long lasting complex animations that make it close to impossible to backstab. And some enemies are actually impossible to backstab making the mechanic seem almost useless. \n\nWeapons seem very clunky just like every thing else. Many weapons are very slow and near impossible to use while other weapons of the same exact class and weight are light as a feather by comparison.
