It's so fundamentally mediocre that I don't feel anything towards it either way. It's entirely lacking in fun but there's not really much frustration to be had either. The enemies are a bit unfair since any hit is basically instant death. The puzzles are often anti-puzzles or otherwise pointlessly obscure. The game's not too terribly long (~4 hours the first time through for me) and it does a lot of different things, I guess. The art style's alright, kind of reminds me of Knytt Underground to some extent. The game wants to be LIMBO, also, with the atmosphere. The problem is that the narration... uhh... is unnecessary, and on top of that badly translated. Kind of ruins the plot, it's supposed to be dark and depressing but I'm giggling too much at the bad grammar. Also the ending is pretty stupid, you die, the end, you can't not die, so yay.

It is an Indie game, and I will treat it as such.\nThe developer markets Grimind as a horror/physics puzzle game, and that is about as descriptive as it gets. The gameplay is centered around completing the puzzles without any instruction or hand-holding. Not to say the puzzles are unsolvably difficult, but there are a few moments in which I scratched my  head in frustration and uttered a soft \"what the hell do I do?\" to my computer monitor. Once you get the feel of how the game operates, the puzzles start to become clear. The physics are also quite well done. I understand the developer reworked the inertia of objects and some other parameters for the game's Steam release, and the attention to detail shows. It seems more polished compared to early alpha footage (as one would expect). Objects can be picked up and thrown, liquids respond to disturbances, and soft-bodied pieces like vines move as they should.\nThe strong point of the game is the lighting. Beautifully done point lights and both \"baked\" and active shadow casting as well as ambient gloom in certain points lends to a strong setting for a horror scenario. Many levels throw the character into the darkness with nothing but a lit torch, and as everything in the environment is opaque black, one understands that death may be around every turn.\nAs for the \"scare factor?\" Some reviewers have thought the game is as frightening as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That is not necessarily true. The scariest part of the game is the environment itself. The player is pursued by malevolent little--welll--boxes (with no animation) that may only be vanquished with bright light. The enemy design is unbecomingly bland for a game that seems so well-put-together in every other regard. The chase sequences get one's heart pounding, but it is not fear. The character animation is perhaps a little poor as well.\nThe sound work in the game is mixed. The background music/ambient noise are very impressive, and those elements are quite unsettling for the game. They chant at the player like spectral moans from an unknown source and never failed to cause my hair to stand on end. All other noises sound as though they were recorded by a desk mic in Audacity, like the growls of the monsters, drowning noises when underwater, and thunder of fallign boulders or objects. Their lack of quality just doesn't seem to fit, and they certainly didn't scare me.\nLastly, the game's story and dialogue were originally written in Polish. (I believe?) The English translation is rough around the edges, but I could understand what was being conveyed with a little bit of pidgin translation. The story begins with no scenario, and ends with little more. It was more depressing of an end than a satisfying resolution. Perhaps there is a metaphorical message to it all? Nonetheless, I would have preferred to see a more complete story. Maybe in the sequel we can see more character development.\nI give this game 7.5/10.

I'm pretty sure that the ending is intentional since the game has \"Grim\" in its name though.\n\nOtherwise as far as gameplay goes I'm in love with it for similar reasons I was in love with Amnesia and Penumbra.
