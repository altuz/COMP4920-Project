It's not bad by any stretch, but it's rough around the edges and can be frustrating for a variety of reasons. I try to enjoy a game independent of its 'message', but Even the Ocean really bashes you in the face with it. The writing is really the weakest part.\n\nPositive:\nThe art is nice. The 'Mode 7' style overworld feels nostalgic.\nA nice variety of mechanics in the platforming sections.\n\nNeutral:\nThe dark/light balance is a mechanic you may have seen a dozen times before in simple browser games.\nThe majority of 'puzzles' in the platforming sections are not very challenging.\nCliched story about the environment and the evils of man that you've heard a thousand times.\n\nNegative:\nBugs. Had to restart a few times when my character glitched out on respawn.\nPoor pacing. After each level the main character insists on taking a nap so that we can hear her nightly monologue. Kind of odd when there are giant monsters stomping on a town.\nOver-tutorialized/easy/savepoint every few feet. Feels like baby's first video game sometimes.\nNPCs are overly verbose. You'll often be treated to several paragraphs when a single sentence would do. And you you talk to the again you're treated to the same never ending monologue again. \nOverused trope: [url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsGay]Everyone is gay[/url]. Seriously. They show up, tell you that they're gay and nothing else. It's just poorly done and calls attention to itself.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506624333, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506624333, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "35304386", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501813", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498427835, "steamid": "76561197984067417", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The gameplay is super clean and focused, has a gorgeous and unique art style, and the music is great.

But with that said, i have to say i cant recommend this game because of the blatent SJW elements i see in it. for example, the main character is a girl, which i dont care, but then shes got multicolor hair, is black? asian? im not sure, again i dont care, but then she ends up dating anouther girl, and if it was writen well then it would be a nice change of pace, but instead it seriously feel so forced that it pulled me out of the story. the only white people are evil ish, like the mayor is arrogent, greedy, and the only other white guy i saw was the librarian and he even talks about making a disaster in hopes more people would come to his library to read up on it. \nhonestly i tried to play though this game. i really did, but the story is just such a fluster cuck of \"inclusiveness\" that it seriously hurts the story instead of adding anything to it. it would have been better if all the people were something other than humans at this point. anyways, if you can get past that then you might like the game, it just killed it for me. \nif a game has a crap story, but good game play, is it still a good game? sorry but not this time.", "timestamp_updated": 1506539474, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506539474, "votes_down": 73}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 45, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 51}}
