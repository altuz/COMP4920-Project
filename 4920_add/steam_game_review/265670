Sometimes you need to unlock a door by collecting a key first, and sometimes you traverse portals. Spikes and scowling, flaming enemies are to be avoided. The levels are also sparsely populated with crates, random physics objects for which I could find no real purpose.\n\nAs of this review, this game is a decent foundation for a much better game, but for now, it's only a handful of levels that provide a very low level of challenge. I like the idea of being able to craft levels for others, and being able to find out more about the game's protagonist by collecting snapshots is interesting, but it's all over so soon and you're left wanting more.

If you\u2019re wondering what this game has in store, let me sum it up. A story mode that is mostly randomized levels rather than story and a \u201cchallenge mode\u201d that is in no way challenging and takes 30 min. The game feels like it was made for one of those \u201c24 hours to make a game\u201d except this was the dev\u2019s first game and he gave up half way.\nStory mode is what I spent the most time playing and I\u2019ll spend the most time talking about it. The story of imagine me is so boring, I got about 70% of the way and just gave up. The bad levels outweighed my interest in the story. From what I can tell it\u2019s about a shy kid who you play as who is often bullied by other kids. I assume something terrible happens in the late story but as I said, the story is just too boring and the levels are just too bad that it discouraged me from finishing the game. The story is told in the stupidest way as well. After every level, you\u2019ll get two or three sentences and that\u2019s about it. There\u2019s no animation, just words scrolling for about 15 seconds which is in no way worth the levels, which I will talk about next. My next point is the level design of story mode. There are two types of levels, boss fight\u2019s, and the normal levels. Between each boss fight, there are what I\u2019m pretty sure are 15 or so levels, which are the same thing over and over again, not to say they play similar, but to say they are literally the same exact level. The best way to describe the level generation is the game has 10x10 preset levels that are mix and matched to create one big level. This means that by the fifth room, you\u2019ll start to say, \u201chaven\u2019t I seen this part of the level before?\u201d and by the 20th, you\u2019ll have a higher chance of having an exact copy of a previous room than not see one of the templates. This leads to the levels becoming boring, stagnant and just the same, but more importantly, the difficulty is non linear as the rooms are random and no new templates are added.  One level might be disgustingly hard, one that might take a few minutes but to the spike hell and complex maze that you got simply by the roll of the dice and the next could be a straight forward line to the finish with only a few, basic obstacles. The boss fights are better than the basic levels in that they aren\u2019t randomized, but that doesn\u2019t mean good. Often, parts of the level are left open with nothing but blank space. Each fight is different, yet easy, and unmemorable. Overall, when it comes to level design, I honestly think the game dev. put zero effort into programing and when it comes to story, he spent an hour writing it and then programed a shitty game for it and sold it for 3$\nMy next issue is how the game plays. The controls are comprised of basic wasd movement, and a system of arrows which you can shoot using the arrow keys. My big issue is with these arrows when it comes to playing a level. Arrows can be used for two things in this game, shooting blocks which will break if they have cracks and killing enemies. Arrows can be collected by finding them laying around levels or by killing enemies. My issue is that this may be the most interesting mechanic of the game which speaks volumes in that it\u2019s simply an attack. If a single stagnate attack system which is still terrible, turns out to be the most interesting thing in your game, there\u2019s an issue. \nAnother huge issue is that it is basically incomplete. The audio of the game is comprised of; jump sound, monster death, occasional sound from boss. These sounds probably took about 5 minutes to produce and record. The sprites are basic and look like they were made in photoshop. Hitboxes are so bad it\u2019s hard to tell how far you need to be to avoid something. Overall most of the game feels incomplete and like no effort was put into it.\nThe challenge more was probably the best part of the game, but that doesn\u2019t say much. I takes about 30 minutes to complete and is mostly just a smaller, slightly more well designed version of story mode.\n[b] overall, story mode has not interesting story and the levels that come with it are random(sometimes lead to softlocks). Challenge mode is made up of very few levels that take a minute each and are overall boring( but at least not random bullshit like story mode). The game is incomplete with little to no sound design, enemies, animation, sprites, and diverse level design. The game feels like there was no effort put into it. To be brutally honest, it feels like the dev made this game as a joke. To anyone who remotely likes this game, please explain to me how that\u2019s humanly possible?[/b]\n", "timestamp_updated": 1501133575, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501133575, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 17, "total_negative": 12, "total_reviews": 17}}
