An experience of anxiety, isolation, bewilderness and amazement. It is also an explorational adventure in a beautifully built up abstract world. The world is a perfect blend of magical realism, sci-fi horror and the staircase scene from labyrinth. Although the game is linear it will keep on popping up surprises and little twists until the very end. \n\nYou are alone -mostly- but the sense of tension and being haunted is always there. The architecture, the lighting, the music, the sounds, the fitting awkwardness of the level design at times. Everything sucks you in and you won't get out until about four hours later, depending on how much time you spend gaping around at how awesome the scenery looks. Just look at the screenshots to define if it's your style or not, it was totally up my ally anyway.\n\nThere's not just walking and staring, there are some not too difficult puzzle sections and some mildly annoying platforming sections. Some of them held me back a little bit too long, but they are far from impossible. Also I don't really understand why the breathing mechanism was there at all. You can run, but you have to press the mousebutton every four seconds or so to keep running. I guess it's supposed to add up to a sense of anxiety and vulnerability, but it got annoying pretty soon as far as I'm concerned. But nothing gamebreaking, it might work out for you.\n\nIf you're like me and love creative artsy gaming worlds in a first person walking simulator style this is a must play, no need to hesitate (I did, I don't know why).

He said, \"When your game is about jumping, you make sure the basic act of jumping feels great.\"\n\nNaissance is a walking simulator. And I **love** Walking Simulators. Gone Home, Firewatch, all the minimal-input Telltale Games you can find - sign me up! But they failed to learn the lesson Miyamoto was teaching.\n\nYou're dumped into a dark hallway after a spooky techno-smoke-monster makes you fall. OK, this is great. I can work with this. Then you do a little traversal following a glowing orb. Alright, that's a fine tutorial, we're 10 minutes in, I'm on board. Then we get to \"jumping in the dark.\"\n\nOh boy. Does this game ever go off the rails once you have to navigate first-person jumping puzzles with an anemic midget apparently unable to clear, climb or navigate anything. Just moving around feels miserable, glacial, and boring. Then you miss a jump. So now you get to do EVERYTHING over again. Once you make it to the end of a hallway that requires you either \n\na) guess you need to turn left, duck, walk straight for [b]some distance[/b], then turn right to see your glowing floating breadcrumb and walk into the next room\n\nor b) turn your Gamma up to 4 so you can see what the hell is going on\n\nOh, and the next room has a light-pulse that is literally blinding (like a flashbang that lasts five+ seconds) that you need to hustle out of the room while the door (that you can't see because of the flashbang) is open.\n\nOnce you're out, you get a long hallway. At one end: nothing at all! At the other: a cryptic unclimbable puzzle that you're supposed to just walk around.\n\nThere's more climbing and jumping, all with impossible-to-see darkness or edge-obliterating light, none of it fun or interesting. Smoke monster shows up? Any sort of environmental world-building? NOPE. Just Na'vi taking some midnigh shifts at the world's worst Xen level manufacturing plant.\n\nI hate hate hate hate hate this game.
