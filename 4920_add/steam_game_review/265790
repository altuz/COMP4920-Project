Really was unsatisfying to play and had nothing going for it. \n\nBut their second effort makes up for it very well. A concise, reasonably well told story, EXCELLENT soundtrack and actually for me quite unique 'gameplay' of basic platform work and aiming. Not quite sure about the unbelievable breath holds each character is able to make... nor exactly what the meaning is of a man in a suit with a hookshot... but I loved it all the same.\n\nAtmosphere, brevity, story telling.
