Well, go buy those because this one is just another failed doppelganger: controls are clunky, pacing is atrocious, platforms hitbox is fuzzy, therefore pretty frustrating. Character jumping consists of 90% of the game and it's a total failure. Turns an interesting dystopian world into a bad platformer. Bottom line: it's boring.
