It has great graphics and a superb battle system, but as an RPG, it story falls too flat and the characters are too one dimensional.\nFirst of all this is a well made game, most of the times. It really feels like the developers took their time to craft a great battle system. This is the shiny moment in this game, the enemies become cannon fodder and the games go no further than medium difficulty. The songs at the beginning and end are great, in my opinion. This is a great game for beginners and those who want to have fun.\nAlas an RPG is only as good as its story and characters, and this is where the game makes its greatest mistake. The story is not bad, but it is mediocre. Don\u2019t worry when the game finally lets you run around you are going to figure out the plot in minutes. Just talk to everyone in town.  You also only get one weapon upgrade which you get from the characters automatically just buy shields and maybe some armor. By the way save all your items for the final battle and it will be easy.  I could go on with the list of problems, but I feel as if this is one of the better RPG Maker games.\nI hope this developer puts all three episodes together for 15 dollars.

RPG Maker has a seedy reputation due to some people abusing it but it\u2019s far from a bad piece of software, and in the right hands can be used to everyone\u2019s benefit. Alpha Kimori is one such product that stands as testament to this.\n\nThat said the game doesn\u2019t try to be anything more than it appears to be, a very traditional RPG in the style of old SNES classics. Characters have HP/MP that you use in the usual turn-based format to launch your staple attack/magic/healing commands (given different names in this case, but still the same), and you run around from place-to-place viewing events. So if you\u2019re looking for something that stretches boundaries you\u2019ll be disappointed. But, if you can enjoy that style of old-school gameplay then Alpha Kimori is a very polished version of those styles. I should mention here that battles are not random but instead initiated by contacting enemy sprites on the field.\n\nStory-wise things are interesting but feel a little scatter-brained, as if not all the dialogue is in the correct order. For instance our main characters occasionally have drastic shifts in their points of view within the very same discussion, rather than seeming like a solid progression from one view to the next over the course of several discussions. Still the story it\u2019s trying to tell is interesting enough, there are plenty of tropes but it\u2019s still trying to be its own property despite that. Similarly most of the characters are likable, the above mentioned shifting back-and-forth on positions sometimes detracts from them but in the end they\u2019re mostly solid.\n\nSome blatantly not so great points include there being a little too much backtracking for its own good as you revisit a small set of locations many times, it could have stood to have a few more songs for world locations and events (for instance it continues playing the bubbly, upbeat city theme even when events get serious which detracts from the scene taking place), and it\u2019s very easy to begin with and even simpler if you spend more than a few minutes grinding with nothing coming close to beating you. \n\nSo make no mistake, if you don\u2019t like this style of game then Alpha Kimori will NOT change your opinion on them. But if you do then this is a well-polished game that clearly has intent to go somewhere and should keep you content for the 5-7 hour playtime the first episode purports. \n", "timestamp_updated": 1404455130, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404455130, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "11621371", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502560", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1422009613, "steamid": "76561198051639484", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Been a long time Jrpg player and i must say this game gives the right amount of story/action that a good Jrpg needs it slowly introduces the characters so you get a chance to get use to each ones abilties.\nTook me around 4 and a half hours to beat this episode and thats only cause i rushed thru the final part cause i wanted to know  what happened and didn't know i was at the end already.\ni look forward to playing episode 2 when you release it on Steam i look forward to seeing where the story goes and i look forward to traveling around more of your world setting i give this game an 8/10 maily off potental i'm really looking forward to seeing where the love triangle leads", "timestamp_updated": 1407626097, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1407626097, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "15038050", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497127", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1402607303, "steamid": "76561198083920043", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I feel Alpha Kimori is a good game, i enjoyed it as i have done many rpg's in the past, i feel it would be perfect to see an episode 2 and further on from their, SO here's to hoping that more episodes do get released. *Crosses Fingers*", "timestamp_updated": 1427226274, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427226274, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "10897355", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503070", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1422965856, "steamid": "76561198114722976", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is good although there are a few problems the music has three tracks that are looped over and over, the combat in my opinion is unbalanced i hit more critical hits than regular ones it take a bit of the challenge out of it i died once in the whole game and that was at the last fight of the game, On to the good it is fun a throwback to the nes days of old and i enjoyed it as a whole.\nIn conclusion if you like games like chrono trigger the early final fantasy's you will find something to enjoy here", "timestamp_updated": 1403939429, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403939429, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "15793958", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499504", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1428716858, "steamid": "76561198055871273", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I found Alpha Kimori to be a better choice than some other games due to the fact that Alpha kimori has a nice Immersive Storyline.
