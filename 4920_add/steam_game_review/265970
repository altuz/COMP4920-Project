Worlds of magic suffered from a lot of bugs and had a rough kickstart to steam transfer, many were anyoyed at not having recived kickstarter promises. Then on Steam it was revamped, after a few months, to this title, thankfully the update was free, as it rightfully should be. I cant say im impressed by the speed at the development of the game, the whole process has taken around 7 years, but I am almost certain they are dedicated to make it work. Updates used to be fairly frequient but now it takes 1-3 months for a patch. I can say that even though this game suffers from poor development it is the best spirtual successor to the good old orgional. I havent played it in awhile due to the anoying bugs i kept encountering but will update my review to reflect how much it has improved over the past year since I have quit playing. Only reason i do not recomend is because i know most players will have buyers remorse in it's current state, it honestly should be polished off a bit more for the price. a sugestion to the devs, try to focus on a single platform; get it to work and know why it works, then continue the dev on others. and please dont abandon mutilplayer it was the most exciting aspects of your remake.", "timestamp_updated": 1505775952, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505769126, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 98, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 111, "total_reviews": 209}}
