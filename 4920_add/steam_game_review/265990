It uses simultaneous movement system, so it's always paused for you to take your time & strategize, but there's no turning back after you hit a key. A lightning-fast strikes exchange may leave you with your jaw dropped, numb & morally destroyed after a day-long sneaky work of cave clearing, after a series of lucky duels we always tend to overestimate our fortune.\n\nIt's built on Java (hence the clunky UI, push Ctrl+ for modest scaling up) & hasn't got animations, still a super-realistic dungeoneering experience, since there are lots of objects to interact with, combine & construct techniques, also it's easy to predict interaction outcomes from the common sense point. The common sense tells us that a usual guy can't stand against 3 demons in 1 room - ..and he surely dies, it tells that with a fire-ward amulet & health regeneration you can swim in lava like in water - yes, it lets you escape through a fiery river.\n\nDespite the well-known underground setting all your tactics learnt from RPG's should be abandoned at the entrance to these caves - no item hoarding allowed (traders have limited inventories), the coins are scarce (have to identify an item before selling, so no item cheaper than 20 gold is profitable), levelling up quickly is strictly not recommended (enemies spawn accordingly stronger on the new floors), in fact players try to make less actions that might give XP, etc. What really keeps me going is the chance to get LEGACIES (like in \"Rogue Legacy\") for all the future playthroughs, like bow & arrows from the start, which make early game significantly easier.\n\nI've been playing it all spring, yet *reach lvl 20* achievement stays a dream for me. Every second playthrough attempt ended in a brutal ragequit (darn java windows ain't so easy to close down), but very soon the addiction whispered to my ear: \"What if you get EXTEREMLY lucky THIS time around?\" - and I jumped back to the screen. It feels like hunting for the jackpot - you know you can win every single encounter if you have the proper set of skills & tools, but you can't develop a 100% universal hero (only 6 skills could be picked normally), so the dungeon will probably find its remedy against you sooner or later.\n\nThe priceless feeling is the tension at the finger point when you stand ready to take your chance before a bunch of baddies - you are bold, you are strong & fully equipped, you are almost sure you will kick their asses.. if only fortune smiles at you a little! Or you may suddenly think to yourself: \"It's a long time there were no traps seen..\" - and make the next step to the side.. and get into a trap immidiately. Hilarious game.\n\nFor rogue-like fanatics who get aroused by risk, 10/10 realistic very-careful-person simulator", "timestamp_updated": 1499182800, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499182800, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "31372936", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499752", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504615027, "steamid": "76561198104425330", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's a pretty great game, but it does take a while to really get into.
