Each stage is like an abstract representation of a sensitive social topic, which you, the candidate had to satisfy and solve. By navigating the treacherous waters of political intricacy, you have to meet the demands of various interest groups, whether they are reasonable or not, while avoiding to contradict yourself in logic.\n\nOnce you have completed the first leg of your tour, fulfilling the easy ball questions, you will advance gradually to the national theatre. Now, not only are there more interest groups per subject, but their demands ever more outrageous than the last. You will have to employ every deceitful tactic to advance, double talking to your audience, introducing false equivalency into every debate to confuse the masses, making sure your support base are all too occupied with double think to see your wacky logic. All eyes on you as the media broadcast your every road trip and every \u201cachievement\u201d.\n\nWhen you have sneaked and snided your way to presidency, gaining the support of 26 states (chapters) and obtaing the votes of 650 territorial delegates (stages), you will have the pleasure of tackling the day to day operation of the country, taxing your mind evermore with the daily happenings of the world (daily puzzles).\n\nSuch a campaign by the political veterans should take around 10 hours to complete, though if you are willing to cheat like a real politician, it can take as little as 2 hours. As for the uninitiated, without the help from aids (guides), it can take around 30.\n\nBuy the game, make the puzzle genre great again.", "timestamp_updated": 1506001246, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506000200, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35230825", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1497621955, "steamid": "76561198136585892", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Achievements are just beautiful, a great pick for your achievement showcase if it needs letters\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506462062, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506462062, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35461741", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504030", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507187708, "steamid": "76561198029656416", "num_games_owned": 973, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e0b\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e34\u0e25 \u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e08\u0e38\u0e14\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e01\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e14\u0e44\u0e27\u0e49\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e04\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e43\u0e19\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e25\u0e30\u0e14\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19 \u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e16\u0e49\u0e32\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e08\u0e23\u0e34\u0e07\u0e46\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e04\u0e33\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e39\u0e43\u0e19\u0e40\u0e19\u0e47\u0e15\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\n\n\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e04\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e04\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e32\u0e07\u0e27\u0e31\u0e25\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e40\u0e23\u0e47\u0e08 (Achievement) \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e22\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e21\u0e32\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e07\u0e42\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e25\u0e4c\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49 \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e23 A \u0e16\u0e36\u0e07 Z\n\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e14\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e23\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e04\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e02\u0e32\u0e22\u0e04\u0e37\u0e19\u0e17\u0e38\u0e19\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\n\n\u0e41\u0e19\u0e30\u0e19\u0e33\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e0b\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e25\u0e14\u0e23\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e04\u0e39\u0e1b\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e04\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e21\u0e32\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e14\u0e23\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a", "timestamp_updated": 1507086849, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507086786, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35026937", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506909900, "steamid": "76561198117764626", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 191}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A really nice puzzle game that works in an intuitive way.\nMost definitely worth a buy.", "timestamp_updated": 1505664017, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505664017, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35243146", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505553223, "steamid": "76561198260989503", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Just buy it!
