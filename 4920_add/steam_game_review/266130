Customization - You can pick your loadout for all your soldiers along with their class. \n\n==The Bad==\n1. Bugs - I had a few times where enemies wouldn't die or get stuck in furniture. I also had teammates just randomly die from nothing. Again there is a few bugs here and there but most of the time it works. \n\n2. Balancing - I found some missions extremely unbalanced. For example one mission has you start in the open taking on well armed and equiped enemies that also have numbers on their side. If your not really you can end up getting killed right off the bat. So expect a few missions where you need to run for cover right off the bat before doing anything else. \n\n3. A.I - I found the enemy A.I breaking a few times. A few times I had them rush for my team and just get destroyed by my forces and other times they just sit in a room waiting for the first guy to open the door and get blasted then sit there waiting for the grenade to kill them.
