Everything you add to your airship in Windforge affects its performance: propellers determine its speed, balloons help the airship stay afloat and rise, turrets are used in combat, engines are required to power other devices, and even blocks and cosmetic furniture matter in that they weight your ship down. \n\nUnlike games like Terraria or Starbound, Windforge's focus is almost entirely on exploration and fighting rather than building: in fact, you will likely only build your airship, as there\u2019s no point of building a house. Windforge also has almost no decorative items, and most of decorations it does have are not actually available for player to make or collect and place on their airship or house.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, the challenge is average at best. While enemies can be dangerous during early to early-mid game, the AI is terrible, which is particularly noticeable in ship combat: it is too easy to outmaneuver and destroy even much stronger AI ship. But certain enemies, like krakens or large dragons can still present a danger to you or your ship through mid-game. Bosses are also a disappointment: they generally have similar attacks and attack patterns, and like most enemies suffer from terrible AI.\n\nAside from poor AI, another glaring negative is that the world design is rather bland. Random locations are very similar: they are all just collections of floating islands, occasionally with ruins on them. The only reason to visit them is to mine ore or collect recipes from the ruins: you won\u2019t be visiting a new location wondering what you might find there. And it doesn\u2019t help that you spend much of the game travelling through these similar locations, typically having to travel through over 10 locations to get from one quest location to another.\n\nAlso, unfortunately, there are a lot of bugs and glitches. Officially Windforge isn\u2019t in Early Access, but it certainly feels like it is \u2013 with exception that the work on it has stopped. Most notable is that blocks can glitch through each other during collision, like when airship falls atop another, or to the ground, making it hard to dismantle fallen airship. Physical model is also glitches sometimes, making an airship or whale\u2019s body suddenly fly up or sideward, or bounce on spot. And game\u2019s save/load system also has a number of bugs and exploits, like player\u2019s ability to replenish breathing air by saving and then loading game, or how freshly killed enemies revive after loading (with minimal HP, that allows easy double kill), though these can mostly be avoided by the player.\n\nBut overall, I\u2019d say that Windforge is quite an interesting game, despite its bugs and other shortcomings.
