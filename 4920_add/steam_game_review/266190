I like it but I'm also easy to please. No crashes on my PC or laptop though the FPS on laptop is low(I expected this though). I like some of the building and RPG features but the game still lacks in the content area. Some controls are pretty standard while others take some time getting used to. There is a little tip UI on the tools so that helped. Get it on sale if interested, probably not enough game here for the full $15 but $10 might be fair. I wish they would take some of the mechanics from Creativerse - if they could make the control more smooth and add more content I think that would be good. I like the look of the game, hopefully they can spend some more time on the mechanics.", "timestamp_updated": 1497903811, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497903811, "votes_down": 11}, {"recommendationid": "33051584", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498293", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498709193, "steamid": "76561198346951579", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "ok so this game has come a long way, really enjoying it so far. there's plenty of worlds to explore (haven't explored them all yet) and the race customization is pretty diverse.\n\noh and terraforming is awesome! :D", "timestamp_updated": 1498849622, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498849622, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 27, "total_reviews": 40}}
