I absolutely hate them. They usually seem like a lazy attempt at telling a story. Often using only stock graphics/sounds/music/mechanics... Usually telling original stories of varying quality.\n\nBut this one... hmm... I got Last Dream near it's release a few years back. Started playing, it seemed decent, had a fun twist in the mechanic (leveling up and point distribution - ... I love leveling up in RPGs). Played it for 12h back then, it felt nice, but then I stopped playing...\n\nRecently I got a hint of the expansion, so I decided to replay the game... And whoa... this time it wasn't decent, it was great!\nRecent years were very disappointing to me as a JRPG fan, all the big titles that I was expecting turned out to be awful. LD gave me what I needed, a good solid JRPG experience that was neither overcomplicated (both in mechanics and story) nor was it too shallow. It hit exactly that sweet spot.\n\nPros:\n- the main story is simple, yet solid and satisfying, the backstory in flashbacks is very amusing (also fun to see the main character do things that seem chaotic or just irresponsible)\n- skill and stat system - also simple, but gives you quite a few possibilities to build up your characters\n- speed up button is something I now want in every single game (takes a lot of tediousness out of JRPGs) (skipping things also rocks)\n- all those options to make the game a bit more casual (like saving game anywhere) are very comfortable\n- nice to see original graphics and music (even though some gfx isn't of the highest quality and I'm not a fan of using classical music in games), at least it shows the authors did try to make the most of the game\n- it tickles my OCD (collections, checklists and great guide to help with it)\n\nCons (theres always a few)\n- it tickles my OCD way too much...\n- RPGMaker\n- a few minor problems with controls (button matching/mashing shows default button icons, not a part of the main game, and rarely used in additional quests, easily solvedby using a gamepad or defaults)\n- Snow Slug - I'm not doing it... no sir...\n- played it on normal only, but the enemies don't seem too diverse, but the same goes for pretty much every JRPG out there\n\nOverall I'll give it something between 6/10 and 7/10 for the pleasure it gave me (mind you, my top 2 fav games of all times are Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VII, so I am very critical when it comes to JRPGs). Would love to see the team make a game on their own engine, with no limits whatsoever to the mechanics.\n\nNow... on to the expansion!", "timestamp_updated": 1496307064, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496307064, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "31571385", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502280", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1495144622, "steamid": "76561197983680095", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "So I got this game a long time ago, and I loved it, but I never got very far. I recently returned to it as I've been on an RPG kick and I wanted some classic style RPG stuff. This game is fantastic in that regard. It might not be innovative, but it hits that nostalgia center of my brain in just about everything. So now I'm playing the CRAP out of it. I'm on my second playthrough, going towards that compleationist goal, and this game is so deep and complex, yet at the same time simple and relaxing.\n\nPros:\n+ Classic JRPG style. Turn-baased combat, black magic, white magic, weapons, armor, the works.\n+ Beautiful but simple graphics. The enemy sprites are really well detailed.\n+ THE MUSIC! My god, the music is all over the place. From relaxing to classical to metal.\n+ Highly custimzable party. Both the party you choose, and how you grow them is up to YOU!\n+ Deep yet easy crafting system. It's nice to include the this more modern mechanic into a classic game.\n+ FISHING! Okay, this one is more a personal thing, but I love games that let you fish. The fishing is simple, but fun, and the fish you catch are more than basic healing or shop-fodder. early fish heal hp or mp, and some do it to the whole party. Later fish can buff the party, or even be used as attacks like they were bombs. And the higher-level healing fish are AMAZING, especially if paired with an Engineer's 2x item power ability (x3 after the class upgrade).\n\n+ HIGH amount of replayablilty. The big one of the positives. Both with the class choices and the way to level them, and some key choices in game, there is a lot of replayability. While there isn't multiple endings really, there are a LOT of variations to that ending depending on what you did during your play through the game. Didn't help that one NPC? They'll have a scene where something bad happens. Didn't finish the hunter's guild quest? High level monsters are still terrorizing places. This attention to detail is amazing here. Each little thing has meaning at the end of the game, even if it doesn't effect the main story line itself. Your quest effected dozens of lives, and you see the result, for better or ill.\n\nCons:\n- The story is a little lack luster. Nothing fancy, though it wasn't fully predictable until the end.\n- The player characters are bland. Other than the very beginning and the very end, no time is spent developing a single playable character, and even then it's only the first character in your party. He changes lives of many, yet nothing is spent on his motivation or feelings or personality. A little TOO genetic, and it can hurt the already fairly average story as a result.\n- Difficulty can spike a little from time to time without much warning.\n- While you can build any character out how you want, there isn't much explination as to what stat does what without reading the 700 page guide (thankfully free on their website). A daunting task, but a rewarding one if you take the time. But it does take TIME. And a lot of grinding.\n- Battles can get repetitive. An old issue for most JRPGs, so this is to be expected.\n- Low-res graphics might turn some people off. I liked it, but most NPC sprites are a little forgettable, and some towns are a little boring looking.\n\n- Party composition matters TOO much. So this is the big one of the cons. Too many things are impossible to do without the right speciffic class in your party. For example, you can't ever ride a Moa (game's kind of chocobo) without a Hunter in your party. This might not seem big, but that's an entire mode of travel locked if you don't have one class. And there's no way around it. You can't use tunnels for easy travel on the main world without an engineer. If you try to open chests in towns without a thief, you have an escilating chance of fighting powerful guards that can one-shot you early game. There is no way to do any of these things without specific classes, and other than Thief, those classes are TERRIBLE in a fight. So if you don't have an engineer OR a hunter, you're forced to walk EVERYWHERE until you get the airship, and that's not until VERY late in the game. There should have been a way, mid or late game, to unlock these highly helpful abilities for any party, instead of limiting them to just one class and screwing you if you want a party of fighters instead of support.\n\nOverall: 8/10\nAbove average nostalgic feeling game that harkens back to the classic Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games of yore. Deep mechanics but a fairly simple level of entry, with a lot of customization and replayablilty, and a fantastic (if eclectic) selection of music. However, the story won't be winning any awards, and the personalities of the player characters are non-existant. Literally. The player-choice leveling system might be a little too complex for someone that just wants a casual JRPG experience.\n\nIf you're a fan of classic JRPGs from the 80's and early 90's, then this is a must-have game. There are some issues here and there that I hope are addressed in the upcoming sequel, but overall, a fun experience.\n\nAnd now back to fishing!\n\nEDIT: As much as I love the music to this game, don't waste your money on buying the soundtrack unless you want to throw a few extra bucks at the devs. All the music is in the game files (.../steam/steamaps/common/last dream/audio/bgm) in .ogg format.
