Match enough and you'll have the forward motion you need for a first down on offense.  On defense, you'll stop the opposing player's advance.\n\nHaving to draw a card carries the possibility of a \"Big Play\", a short text event that can end the play or change it significantly.  And it might not end in your favor!  Your draws are unlimited on offense, with a high possibility of a Big Play, but on defense you have a limited number, with a lower possibility of the play ending suddenly.  This makes for an interesting dynamic, with poor play leading to even good defenses collapsing.  The mechanic forces you to allow your opponent some gains, and hopefully you can hold them to less than they need for a first down without drawing.\n\nAnother mechanic has you attempting to guess your opponent's play call (run or pass, it's not complicated) before each play.  Each team has stats for running, passing, special teams and the like, so you can predict somewhat how they will play.  If you guess correctly, you get an extra card slot for the play, which is a big advantage.\n\nTeams are tracked through a season and rated relative to each other.  Don't pick a weak team hoping to play it up, at least not to start with.  That's a sure path to disappointment.  \n\nThere are three difficulty levels, which affect the basic yard totals for plays based on your play guessing, and this is a solitaire game, so no multiplayer.\n\nThe football mechanics are notional - you need forty yards to complete a first down.  Why?  Because this helps shorten the game so that a hand of solitaire is not an hour long.  :-)  There are still halves and quarters, and punts and field goal attempts.\n\nThis is a fun game of football and cards, enjoyable whether you understand football or not.

On defense it is supposed to be the same. But it doesn't work that way. When on defense, and you guess wrong, the computer opponent STARTS OUT with a 25 yard gain, and it takes solitaire matches to reduce it. But there are very few matches. Even when you guess right against the computer opponent, it STILL starts off with a 12 yard gain that you have to whittle down, again with very few matches available.\n\nNow when YOU are on offense and the computer guesses wrong against you, for a pass, you start at zero yards, and MUST get THREE matches in a row before you gain a paltry 8 yards. Subsequent matches add yardage, but again they are few and far between. When you run the football, and the computer guesses wrong, once again you start at zero yards, and add 4 yards for subsequent matches. Now if the computer guesses right, it is that much harder to gain any yards.\n\nAnd the computer sneaks a peak at what you choose as well, I purposely ran nothing but pass plays for three possessions, gaining some yards, and figured now I'd start off witha run. Of course the computer 'guessed' right on run, when there is absokutely no possible way it could have, based on previous play calls.\n\nIf this game sounds interesting to you, wait until it is at least 75% off, and be prepared for a mountain of frustration. Even at 75% off you may very well regret your purchase.\n\nNOTE: A new update to the game was applied on July 4. It added kickoff and punt returns, plus penalties. Penalties reduced your chances even more of getting matches, and running plays now only gain 3 yards per match, instead of 4. Also, when you guess right on defense, the computer opponent starts off with a 15 yard gain now, rather than the original 12.\n\nI also noticed special teams plays result in TDs (for the computer opponent, of course) more often, plus more turnovers (again, for the computer opponent) when the player uses a Big Play, regardless of weather.\n\nBottom line: Made an already extremely frustrating game even more so.

Whatever the case, when a football game like Gridiron Solitaire appears here, it's a rare sight to behold. What's even more unusual is that the gameplay in this title is via a card game.\n\nIf you've ever played Fairway Solitaire (or any of the million similar games out there), you know how this version of Solitaire works. Suit doesn't matter (in fact, I don't think it even exists in GS), but color does matter. You need to alternate between black and red cards, as well as choosing a number above or below the face-up card on the deck itself. \n\nWhat happens if nothing works? Well, it depends if you're on defense or offense. \n\nWhen you're defense, you can hit the \"Big Play\" button to bring up a new card (or in rare cases, an event), but you have limited use of this. A finite number of uses, denoted by green dots, are supplied each half, not quarter. So use them sparingly. \n\nOn offense, the \"Big Play\" button appears again, but this time it's infinite in its uses. While that sounds good, in practice you'll get an event that somehow harms you roughly 99.9% of the time. In most cases, this involves your runner being blocked or knocked down, or your quarterback being sacked. Sometimes, however, you can also fumble or be intercepted, both of which are terrible, especially if near your own end zone. \n\nYou don't get to choose actual running or passing plays. Instead, you pick which you'll attempt (run vs pass), and if the AI guesses your action, you'll lose a card, plus it'll reduce and limit any gains in yardage you might acquire in that round. That doesn't mean it's impossible to get anywhere \u2014 I have made a running a play that eventually turned into a touchdown, even though the AI figured out my play ahead of time \u2014 just that it's generally more difficult. \n\nWhen you're on defense, you do the same to the AI. In this case, you'll simply limit and reduce their gains, since the AI doesn't use cards. \n\nAll the teams are fictional, but you can edit their cities, names, and colors. This means if you want real teams, the only thing stopping you is a little effort on your part to rename and recolor them. That said, I don't believe you can rename players, but it doesn't really seem to matter anyway. \n\nEvery team has stats (ex: run offense, pass offense, run defense, pass defense, and special teams) that dictate your chances in a game. These stats can and do change, and will be affected by draft choices. \n\nIn my own experience, whatever stats your team or the opposing team has produces a minimal effect. What mostly matters is chance and whatever strategy you employ.\n\nYou can have five seasons saved before you need to delete one to open a slot. Saving the game only occurs before and after a game, as well as during half-time. Given that GS is turn-based, this shouldn't be too much of a problem for most people, but if you find yourself needing to shut down your computer or close Steam, you might lose your progress up to that point. To tell you the truth, I don't know for sure because that's never happened to me yet. \n\nWould I recommend Gridiron Solitaire? I'd say \"cautiously yes.\" \n\nIt's very irritating how much chance (especially when using the \"Big Play\" button on offense) affects the outcome of any play or game, but in real life, sports have always had a \"luck\" factor to them that's difficult to emulate in a computer game. \n\nRegardless, I wish that using the \"Big Play\" button would actually result in a positive outcome every once in a while. Whenever I use it now, I cringe and turn away, not surprised in the least when there's a negative result. \n\nHaving said all of that, it's a very entertaining Solitaire title and introduces several game mechanics not seen in other similar games. I don't know if this will truly satisfy anyone who's been longing for an American Football game on the PC or who's a die-hard Pro/College fan, but for most gamers who either have a passing interest in American Football, Solitaire (or both), I feel that Gridiron Solitaire works nicely.", "timestamp_updated": 1466629762, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466629762, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "12470665", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502441", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506912657, "steamid": "76561198011680020", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Needed to +1 this game for a while.
