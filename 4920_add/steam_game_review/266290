I saw people asking in the discussions about things like trackIR, pedals and joysticks. This really isn't that sort of game so definitely don't buy it if that's what you're looking for. This is a search and rescue game that basically gives you a helicopter with basic controls (which are okay to handle but I found it a bit difficult on the landing) and gives you a number of missions where you must go and save people in various conditions. \n\nThe gameplay is very basic, and really feels quite dated. In the first mission I played it had strange requirements that made no sense. Why do I have to be at a certain height for a man to go down a rope to pick someone up? It's like artificial difficulty because the game would otherwise be rather mundane. Sadly it had the opposite effect as it just made it needlessly annoying.\n\nThe draw distance for detail on the ground is very poor so you have to be pretty much crashing into the trees below to see them appear at the same detail you'd have when you were on the helipad. The models are simple and textures are relatively low quality. The cockpit view was a definite disappointment. It didn't run all that well either, and didn't feel at all optimized. The loading screens were also abnormally long.\n\nIn comparison to the detailed and thoughtful \"Car Mechanic Simulator\" title they released recently, this is a huge drop in quality. I'm not saying you should steer well clear of this game, but I wouldn't recommend it either.", "timestamp_updated": 1393966421, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "6", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1393627506, "votes_down": 65}, {"recommendationid": "9300129", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 136, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587040", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1393652745, "steamid": "76561198012331625", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "The flying in this game is completely absurd, the physics are horrible, and even at max settings the graphics are sub-par.

I suppose it was easier to cal for a rescue helicopter than, say, drive an ambulnce across flat green field... Or mission to rescue people from an oil platform after a ship crashed into it.

I've been waiting for a game like this. This game is lots of fun, entertaining and you can spend many hours of interesting tasks to solve. Helicopter Simulator 2014 Search and Rescue is entertainment, fun and excitement for everyone, but not for the hardcore flight simulation player. You can not save during the play, but that is not negative, because the missions get thereby a higher voltage and you have to stay on task. You can pause at any time by pressing the ESC key. The maps are freely accessible, you can fly around everywhere or walk around. It has many different camera views, from inside cockpit and from outside and zoomable. First Person and Third Person. The missions and objectives are imaginative and exciting. While it is not a simulation in burlap sense, nevertheless one must always be careful how and where you fly. Transport rack system can alter the flight characteristics. You have sent the helicopter control as obstacles such as houses, trees, cranes, etc. are available.\n\nI can recommend this game each of you with helicopters performing work orders such as search, rescue, transport etc. Most Helicopter simulations are either primitive and boring or have a very complicated and complex mechanism in the control. In this game, you have to not torment with complicated skilled technical details. The keyboard is completely configurable. I like to play with mouse and keyboard but you can also use the joystick. With the latest update, many problems have been solved and I have found no more bugs. The sound of the helicopter is acceptable. The graphics quality is not comparable to modern expensive high-end games, but for the pure helicopter jobs, it is sufficient. An increase of the development potential in the graphic quality would be desirable, because who does not fly like a beautifully designed landscape. ;-) I play with a resolution of 2560x1440 and the game runs very smoothly. For this game, I would have gladly paid more. Compared to other helicopter games it is more than worth the money.\n\nMy personal opinion, the negative reviews of the hardcore simulation players, the game does not do justice. it's not a arcade game but also no real simulation. It is for those players who want to play the exciting helicopter missions like, who like to carry out support orders and a challenge in solving complex and tricky requirements with the atmosphere and the thrill of a helicopter, but their playing time do not want to invest in complicated technical manuals and control.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1394360550, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1394360550, "votes_down": 10}, {"recommendationid": "9331148", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507164", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1411736895, "steamid": "76561198043469576", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Search and Rescue may not be for the hardcore flight simulaton gamer. It is not fully realistic, but still you'd better have a Joystick with some axles for it. It is somewhere in between of Simulation and Arcade.\nCompared to Sim copter this title is more simulation and more serious. Where in Sim copter you flew around in a city and things happened which you had to clear, in this game you can fly around on different Island maps and things only happen, when you start a mission with a specific objective each. For each mission you can choose one of the helicopters that can do the job (not every Helicopter is available in every mission). There is no career mode where you get better Helicopters after some time of playing. At least there is no career mode, yet.\n\nWhat makes it absolutely worth it's money is the feedback of the devs and the overall communication between customers and developers. Main Problems that people had with the release version already are solved a few days after release. Other things are going to be implemented soon to improve the game experience.\n\nThere's a lot of crappy simulators out there, but it seems like the devs of SaR do everything for this game not to be one of them. And so far, they're doing a good job.\nA few improvements here and there, and in my oppinion this game could be worth more money.\nGraphic junkies might be a little bit diasppointed, but for everyone else the graphics are absolutely appropriate.\nThe music is annoying after a while, so I already set it off.\n\nAll in all, If you want to extinguish fires, carry stuff around and rescue people with a helicopter, this game is for you.\nCould it be better ?

I have been lucky so far with reliability. \nFPS were a serious issue on start up, until major alterations were done to the scenery/video options. \nThe absence of choosing \"simple clouds\" in the menu, must be offered without a doubt. \nIt sure does not contribute to some flexibility towards better frame rates. \nThis important option is offered on MSFS and Take On Helicopters for example. \nMissions with heavy rain, combined with beautiful stormy clouds and ocean swells, are a real frame rate killer.\nAgain, my set up (OS) has many \"wrinkles\", and needs all the help it can get.\n\nIn conclusion, for people not plagued with technical problems, and open minded to plain fun, challenges, and precision flying inputs, will conclude that this game is not bad after all. \nVery far from it, in my modest opinion. \nCome to think of it, this purchase was cheaper than the majority of my scenery addons on DVD's for MSFS. \nI might add that Aerosoft's Nice Airport for FS9 and FSX (DVD), is absolutely stunning. \nThat software is more expensive of course, and readers know very well, that it is in a completely different category.\nThe developers of HSRS must be fully credited for their availability to improve and listen, in regards to customers issues and requests. \nThe proof of these efforts are in the discussions section of Steam, and in updates (actual version 1.068) since it's release in 2014. \n\nMore impressions will follow in the very near future. \n\nSo long fellow virtual pilots. \n\nA.\n\nLatest update from hell: Completely stuck on mission 6. \nRead all the tips on this site and watched videos on you tube to no avail. \n\nSecond update: I seriously think that this mission is bugged, meaning that by pure coincidence it worked. \nAfter a long rest of the game I gave it another shot, doing the exact things as before and somehow it worked. I still wonder at what worked? \nHere are a few tips that don't garantee you anything at all... \n1- Forget the red circle on the map, it is misleading. \n2- Use auto-hover directly over the flames.\n 3- Fly between 50-80 feet in the thick of it. \n4- Girate and do slow back and forth motions, all the while using the E button 2 or 3 times. \nBe careful not to disengage Auto-Hover, by being too rough on the controls.\nOn this miraculous event, only 2 buckets of water were needed. Go figure.\nI will say again that all these steps were tried before, and without results. \nCuriously on fhis last attempt right after climbing on board the chopper, the game advised of an error. \nClosed everything and got back on Steam, went on the mission, and by pure coincidence I made it. Was this a factor that played a role in the previous fails? \nI had done a cache integrity of the game in the past. \nAt the end of this mission you have to release your empty container of water at your base, and if your forgot that the \"G\" key lets it go, you will not be able to finish this \"lovely\" mission...  \nI had tried this mission way too many times, and something is terribly wrong here. \nTrust me on that one. \nA cheat code \"Skip Mission\" is needed badly, when a software glitch is obviously the culprit here.\nWas this a random event, that the software \"decided\" to make me finally stop the forest fire? \nI will never replay that mission. Ever.\nEpilogue: European theater mission #4.

Heavier chopper mitigates it but reduces room to manoeuver.\n\n[u]Difficulty[/u] - Hard when landing spots are located in tight spaces although plenty of space is available nearby. Easy when trees aren't solid.\n\n[b]Update 2 - Sep 19, 2016 - editing and some additional info[/b]\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\nIMO this game is awesome! BUT mission design shows lack of careful planning. Maps have interesting landmarks worthy of some sighseeing trips.\n\n[b]Update 1 - Sep 14, 2016 [/b]\n\n[u]Mouse control:[/u] \nMouse works in 2 modes but it doesn't turn like an FPS shooter; left/right banks and up/down pitches the copter. Turning left or right requires pressing left or right button and the response is identical to pressing the keys A or D; they both seem to rely on repeat rate. \n\n[u]Graphics[/u]\nPerformance drops in the vicinity of buildings and/or when weather effects are on. This is normal, no cause for disappointment here. Turning off some options or lowering them improves frame rate; 60 fps is achievable except during heavy rain but that may be due to my rig running on potato chips.\n\nSearch light has no blend or dispersion, it has hard edge.\n\n[u]Glitches[/u]\n1) When returning the water bucket to it's original location, if it wasn't dropped from the correct height it stays put in mid-air.\n2) Western Europe map, mission 4. Stuck truck doesn't appear 2b lifted but mission can still be completed.\n3) Exiting chopper too soon b4 mission is declared successful prevents completion of mission.\nhttps://youtu.be/VrxMEOyAfbE\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nThere is no campaign or career mode hence no economic aspect of simulation like costs of purchase, repair, fuel or salaries. No worries about resources needed for operations. Incidentally fuel is either unlimited or a non-issue and no mission is time limited which means great stress free flying experience. You only need to master flying the different types of choppers and skillful handling of tasks. By now you might realize that proficiency at different tasks is directly proportional to flying skills and requires fine control. Auto hover is very helpful in this regard but there are achievements which can only be attained by non-reliance on auto hover.\n\nThe same mission may take place at different time and weather conditions. Time and weather conditions change from mission to mission presumably calculated based on time taken per mission and free-flight mode. There is a manual override feature where you can set your preferred conditions however certain missions may have preset conditions.\n\n[u]Physics[/u]\nDifferences in helicopters' handling and engine sound are noticeable. Heavier choppers handle predictably like a fat cow if cows can fly that is. Physics has 2 modes; accelerated collective means double tap of ascend or descend keys causes max rate of climb or descend respectively. Non-accelerated means more gradual and natural elevation changes.\n\n[u]Flight control[/u] is understandably difficult for many people because auto-centering / levelling is too slow except when auto-hover is used but auto-hover degrades flying into a stop and go motion unless the keyboard is repeatedly and rapidly pressed. Perhaps using a mouse or other controller could smoothen movement.\n\n\n[b][u]Music and sound[/u][/b]\nOMG music is grating and annoying; frequent use of brass crescendos give the impression of flying in a warzone. There are several tracks but all sound samey. Fortunately music level can be turned down to zero.\n\nThe seemingly random radio chatter though is quite interesting. It seems to be aware of what you're doing or seeing and respond accordingly or it may just be coincidental i'm not sure which. Perhaps it's just a collection of com chatter / phrases played at random. Additional feature like some direct communications with Control Tower would be awesome but i don't think it's essential since this game is about tasks rather procedures.  The inclusion of com chatter add  to the atmosphere of piloting.\n\nAll in all, i'm still pleased with this game as it provides a wide selection of helicopters to fly and a variety of tasks requiring various degrees of precision and technique to perform. Still recommended, especially for SimCopter fans.\n\n[h1] First basic review below[/h1]\n\nBought this in a PlayWay Sim Bundle when it was on sale. Great deal, every other game in the bundle works but this, won't even run. It CTD as soon as it's launched. So i shelved it and hoped to play it later after i could upgrade to a new desktop PC. The game's system requirement give no assurance that it would work on laptop GPU. Needless to say i was a little disappointed but i already got my money's worth due to the bundle discount.\n\nThat was some time ago. Today i had the inexplicable feeling of being lucky so i installed it again and voila! it worked! Frankly i'm not sure what gives, i tried every trick or tweak i know prior to this and it didn't work. My best guess is that it may have something to do with either the fact that it's installed to C drive or that i had to manually assign High Performance mode to AMD Catalyst app or both but i'm sure i did that before and it didn't work. \n\nAnyway the game runs smooth at 1280x720 in high detail with AA at medium, Anisotropic Filtering On, Bloom On, view range set to high, shadows quality medium, Depth Blur On and Motion Blur On. Those are the settings set as default on first run. It's playable and there's no noticeable lag considering that the game recorder was also running and recording the game as it is played. One thing that might be different this time was that it was running at 720p windowed mode on my external monitor. I remember now that not all games can run at 720p on my laptop native resolution of 1366 x 768.\n\nOptions available in menus:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdkkaGmuxMs\n\nSo take note of 3 important points if you're using a laptop with AMD Radeon GPU:\n\n[olist]\n[*]Install on C drive\n[*]Set AMD Catalyst driver app to use High Performance mode. This may need to be done manually if the game crashes immediately.\n[*]Try diverting display output to external monitor which supports 720p.\n[/olist]\n\nNow that we've got some technicalities out of the way, lets move on to a basic review as i've not played much of this game as of yet.\n\n[olist]\n[*]Graphics quality - i haven't scrutinized the trees or the NPCs closely as these serve decorative rather than functional elements but looking at the scenery from any of the helicopter views, the scenery looks good. The Depth of Field blur effect and AA works really well. There is no noticeable sawtooth lines in slanted menu boxes, helicopter models or cockpit frames. The distant blur effect is well blended and the draw distance is sufficiently far enough to prevent objects from popping-up at the last seconds.\n[*]Can't comment on the authenticity of rotor sounds due to my lack of familiarity with helicopters. However the sounds seem to be positionally correct. Cockpit sounds are muffled compared to external sounds so that adds to the sense of immersion.\n[*]Flight control with keyboard is well done. With mouse you probably need to lower sensitivity level a notch or two.\n[*]Mission requirements are a bit exacting, it appears that positioning the helicopter for drop-off or pick-up have very small activation areas.\n[/olist]\n\nMission 1:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOvUr4M8cUc\n\nI haven't seen any bugs, glitches or crashes yet but maybe it's too early to tell, will update if there are any changes. From what i've seen and experienced so far, i like this game. And the fact that SAR games are rather rare, i'm glad i have this on my repertoire of games to play.\n\nOne last note: There is weather effects based on what i've seen on YT.\n\nScore as of today: 6/10", "timestamp_updated": 1475243257, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1473647398, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "12441005", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1426968243, "steamid": "76561198150776082", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I don't know if my computer isn't loading the game properly or if there is actually something wrong with the game, but the ground is not rendering for me.\n\nIt's still fun though..

I thought I could get  enough out of it to be worth the small price, but I don't feel like It's even worth that.\n\nThe absolute primary problem with the game is the awful controls of the helicopters. The worst part is that they couldn't be bothered to add joystick controls. You're forced to use the keyboard, and lack good references to how your cyclical stick is positioned. This makes hovering a massive pain, and given this is most of the game .. well, most of the game is a massive pain too. The game also interprets a couple of quick button hits as a desperate need to do something extreme, so you could end up dropping out of the sky or shoorting far away from your mission target. It happened far too easily and far too often that I'd be just about complete when the helicopter would suddenly shoot upwards and I'd ahve to work my way back down to the target again.\n\nDon't bother. Without joystick controls it doesn't feel like a proper helicopter simulation. The graphics aren't fantastic. The whole thing is sadly uninspired.
