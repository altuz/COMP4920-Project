But the cracks really started to show after extensive play... not 100% done with the game yet but I'm annoyed enough to write a negative review right now so woo~\n\nHmm what problem should I address first.\nHow about the slippery edges and dropped jumps? Yeah, any edge of a platform seems to not count as part of the platform for jumping's sake, so often you'll end up not jumping when you wanted to and, presumably, dying. This doesn't feel like my fault. It feels like an error in the game engine. Dropped jumps are even more noticeable on downhill slopes, where there always seems to be a high chance of jumping not working if you aren't sliding (which you don't always want to be doing).\nAnother major problem is the homing cannons, since, well, that's already a bad idea to begin with. Bad game. Bad, bad game. Often they're shoehorned into sections that don't need them, though, and the homing power is waaaaay way way too strong, leading to it often coming down to luck whether or not you can survive a section.\nThere's also a lot of slooow autoscrolling sections that go on way too long, yet require a few tight, easy-to-mess-up jumps such that you can get all the way to the end of the section, screw up, and have to restart it. And some sections go on waaay too long. A lot of the levels are good about keeping decent checkpoint placement and level length but there are also plenty of exceptions. \nThe physics also seem somewhat inconsistent, to the point where there are more than a few cases where a puzzle solution working correctly comes down mostly to luck. Not horribly inconsistent, and there aren't a lot of puzzles that have this issue; mostly any puzzles involving rolling objects.\nThe overall pacing of the game is a bit wonky too. The higher-speed platforming doesn't mix with the puzzles well so the end result is a platformer that occasionally slows gameplay to a halt with a sliding block puzzle or a tedious autoscroll puzzle. The puzzle and platformer elements often exist in entirely separate universes, mostly. It's not a blend of the two genres, it just does them both at diferent times. There are instances of high-speed puzzle platforming that tends to be the more enjoyable parts of the game, but they're infrequent compared to the slower puzzles.\nThe bosses (that I've seen so far) are also mostly trial and error, which is... not fun. When you know what to do, they're utterly simple and nonthreatening but when you don't they're frustrating to try and figure out; the second boss is simplified once you know his full pattern but a bit tricky until you do... and notably this boss is one of those instances of SUDDENLY PUZZLE in the middle of a platforming section.\nI probably shoulddn't comment that the music is bland and the character designs/general visual style is ugly, but I will, because why not. \nI can't find a lot to like about this game. I can be clever or interesting at times, but it does nothing to really stand out from the many better platformers available for the same price or less.
