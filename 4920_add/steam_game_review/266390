Normally if I don't like a game, I just don't leave a review. However, this game I feel people should know something about before they buy it. The game has a great concept, its the integration of several casual games into one game. Its fun in the beginning but then it gets tedious fast. Balancing out produce for the restaurant and for your ammo as well keeping your hired help fed, well it's tiresome, it's not that it's hard but it's tedious (the opposite of casual). There are some AI glitches with watering cans and other items as time goes by, it would be almost easier to do it yourself if you had time to do it all on your own. The day/night cycle moves fast enough you really need to rely on your bugged/incompetent helpers to one degree or another. I think it has possibilities if the developer would fix some of the bugs as well as balance issues.  If you really want to buy this game wait till it's at least 50% off.", "timestamp_updated": 1505456832, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505456832, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34849502", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502098", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507019523, "steamid": "76561198358899447", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "BEST GAME EVER i love this game so much it is the best my fave one is endless mode but i still like storymode i really recommend this game if you love fun i love fun", "timestamp_updated": 1505001621, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505001621, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 190, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 62, "total_reviews": 252}}
