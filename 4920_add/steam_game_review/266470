Totally worth it. Best mech game I have seen since Mechwarrior 4:Mercs and it's still in EA!\n\nOwned about a dozen or more mech games over the years. Being a fan of mech games especially the Mechwarrior series. I longed for a good mech game like this one.\n\nI saw a lot of potential in this game when I discovered it just over a month ago. I liked the rpg elements, the different types of mechs, weapons, maps, etc. It was small and needed work but not a lot to complain about. It was the best thing out there and I wanted to see where it was headed.\n\nAs soon as I opened the beta release it reminded me of the training levels of the good old days of Mechwarrior. Everything looked better than I could have ever imagined it.\n\nBeen waiting many years for something like this. $14.99 is nothing.  I would easily pay double for an hd version of Mechwarrior 3 Gold if it were released on Steam.  \n\nThese are the types of Early Access that get you really excited. Seeing a good product become a whole lot better. Become something exceptional. All the improvements in this new beta release 4/10/2017 are a milestone. Everything looks just fantastic.\n\nAnother plus with the update is now I can use my Ferrari Racing Wheel to pilot my mech. Believe it or not racing wheels are an absolute blast to use as a controller on mech games. Had some annoying issues with the controller setup but once I got through it no problem. Seemed to be the axis pulling one way every time I set up a new button. Hopefully this gets resolved soon.", "timestamp_updated": 1492050263, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491878115, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 26, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 8, "total_reviews": 34}}
