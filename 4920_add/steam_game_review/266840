As DLC, it wouldn't be so bad if it didn't break the base game, but in random matches the CPU almost always picks the Chinese, which causes the game to give an error and quit out to the title screen. This all happens AFTER you've already started a game and loaded the scenario. As soon as the game world loads, you get the error that DLC characters cannot be used without purchase and the game quits.\n\nLet me be clear: THIS IS THE WRONGEST POSSIBLE WAY TO HANDLE THIS SITUATION. You are essentially punished for not buying the overpriced DLC as the game wastes your time allowing you to start and load a game before kicking you out to the title screen.\n\nI only bought the DLC in order to play the base game, and I did so against my own better judgement. If I had it to do over again, knowing what I know now, I would simply not buy the game at all and simply install the original CD version that I have. Achievements and instant availability is not worth the fact that this game was poorly handled in the translation to Steam, and apparently some DLC/compulsory in-game purchase was planned from the start.\n\nAs far as gameplay, AoM is amazing, with many minor and major gods to choose from, and similar gameplay to other Age titles, with certain cardinal differences, such as earning Favor and the ability to summon god powers.\n\nAll that said, I am still not recommending this game due to the hostile way DLC is implemented and the fact that as a rerelease with very, very few quality additions, this game is rather overpriced, especially when you account for the mandatory DLC.", "timestamp_updated": 1506105541, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506105459, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34855142", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474208", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505182388, "steamid": "76561198062578569", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The game constantly freezes.
