My only real complaint is that even on the novice setting, the mini games/puzzles that you have to solve seem extremely hard. I like these games because you have to think a bit but it's usually nothing that I have to stress over and I rarely find myself having to skip the puzzles but with this one, for my own sanity, I skipped several of them. They seemed to be more guessing games than any real strategies and there were to many options to ever be able to guess correctly. Wasn't a fan of getting so frustrated to the point of not following through on the game entirely.\n\nBut the storline and hidden object scenes and clue finding was entertaining enough that I kept going and plan on completing the game. It isn't worth $6.99 but as a $.49 or $.99 hidden object game, it was fun.", "timestamp_updated": 1496079118, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496079118, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31215741", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491255", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1492516606, "steamid": "76561198101994125", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Extremely long winded.", "timestamp_updated": 1492510847, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492510847, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 45, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 55}}
