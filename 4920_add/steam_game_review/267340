This toilets cabin makes him so alive, and yet we never see the guy ! Now, imagine that all the 'towers' you put in the fields are alive too... Man, this ambiance is soooo fun ! It's actually a part of the machine, but it's also its eyes. It's a vent, but it's also its mouth. Just love the design of these characters/machines ! Mobs have suits, costumes, cohesive animations, and their abilities are related to their appearance. You could guess what it can or cannot do by just looking at them. It's very pleasant and made me feel like I was watching a good old cartoon from Tex Avery/Hanna Barbera. So alive !\n\nThen came the game... I really don't like Tower Defense game type. BPE is the first one I DO want to complete ! God, I felt entertained all time long ! The first levels were clearly designed as tutorials. That's why all the people who got used to play TDs may be bored, but I think their experience will allow them to complete these levels very fast, to finally get to...\n\n... THE ZAPPER !\n\nHere is how you can turn a simple TD into a frenetic game experience : developpers managed to give you this intense feeling of being overwhelmed, without simply adding mobs, and mobs, and a new wave of mobs... The ZAPPER ! They also played on mobs' resistance, and finally managed to balance mobs' speed, defense, zapper's power, machines' utility and player's actions so that you have a lot of things to setup, manage and use... but in a very effective way ! Everything is damn simple to understand and use, and provides a lot of fun ! Don't... forget... to use... the ZAPPER ! It's your best ally all game long !\n\nAnd finally, a new dimension came to my attention: mobs' transformations ! You think you killed it, it turns into something else ! Hard Rockers turn into \"Berserk Hard Rockers\", Zombies turn into graves, where new smaller zombies emerge, ... but I won't spoil everything ^_^ I found these game mechanics very inventive !\n\nA lot of TDs should take example on this game. It's simple, yet effective and terribly addictive, fun and easy to play, and includes a very well balanced challenge.\n\nI should have given feedback on the 'charismatic' fields, or on the growing number of aliens' spawn points as you progress in the game, or maybe on the evolutive environment (mushrooms and their spores, ice forming on your machines during winter and the zapper's utility at this moment of the game,...), and maybe I should have told you about the bosses, the drill, the gears or the cow bell... but I really have nothing to say about it, because everything was part of the fun, and very well thought !\n\nPlay this game, it really worths its price !", "timestamp_updated": 1397313121, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "10", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1397313121, "votes_down": 20}, {"recommendationid": "9798311", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 46, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534549", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1397336280, "steamid": "76561198010630893", "num_games_owned": 381, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Cute little gem of a game! It's Plants vs Zombies in space ! Well on earth, tehcnically xD\n\nDon't be fooled by all those colours: there is actually quite a bit of depth poured into the gameplay, and the zapper makes sure you basically never sit idle (on the contrary, you must constantly decide if/what to boost or explode), and that's where it differs from many other TD's (and from PvZ, specifically): apart from building towers and picking up ressources, you are always active with what is basically a multi-tool, there's not much waiting involved.\n\nVeteran mode is also quite handy, and I'd recommand tower denfense... veterans ^^ to actually enable it. I'd even say it's worth to turn it on from start. You won't get to make many mistakes and get away with it, but the difficulty isn't offputting either, and as long as your strategy is sound, you shouldn't get stuck wondering what went wrong. \"Normal\" difficulty I didn't try so I can't really comment, but it sounds nice to be able to play with less focus, or to enable less-hardcore players to fully enjoy the game I guess. Plus, you can always switch between Normal/Vet with the flick of a button apparently.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of animations, graphics, easter eggs, you name it. You get everything from ninjas, to secret agents reading news papers unsuspectingly, to Martian ladies filing their nails and cleaning up the alleys :D\n\nGameplay wise, there's something I found rather odd at first for a TD: compared to mostly every other TD I ever played, the maps are rather small, and towers have very limited range (basically just 3 squares). I was afraid of that at first, but it turns out that it just makes you think about placement and synergy even more, instead of just spamming long ranged OP towers everywhere like in some other TDs. Speaking of which : the game starts slow, but it's kind of a tutorial even though it doesn't officially says so. You gotta hang in there for the first 4 or 5 levels, but after that you get the zapper and get to occupy yourself with it, and start seeing more diversity towers-wise.\n\nAll in all, much more fun that some random movie, at the price of a movie theater ticket ;p", "timestamp_updated": 1397324154, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1397324154, "votes_down": 10}, {"recommendationid": "9798218", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520375", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403466583, "steamid": "76561197985519216", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "At first the game starts pretty slow, but the pace really cranks up a notch after the \"tutorial\" levels. Everything's explained in great detail (maybe too much for some people?), but after those explanations, the fun really begins and boy does it get hectic at times!\nThe main originality is the \"zapper\" (a raygun you get at level 6 I think), and it's used pretty much everywhere: you can shoot down creeps with it (although it's quite weak compared to your actual towers and traps, and it breaks down if it overheats, so you have to manage that too), and you have lots of interactions. For example, quite early in the game, you have G-men like martians that your towers can't detect until you blow his cover with the raygun. You can also zap away the forcefields the mad scientists cast around other martians.\n\nIt really adds a great deal of action to the game, it's unlike any other tower defense game I've played so far (in which you basically deploy your towers and wait for them to do the job until you get enough money to put some more).\n\nThe graphics are cute and really fun and the music is cool too. It look like PopCap's \"Plants versus Zombies\" and is every bit as good (although quite different when you get far enough in the game).\n\nThe demo is good but don't be fooled: the learning/difficulty curve is actually smoother in the game (although the beginning is still quite slow). Oh also, you have two difficulty modes: normal and veteran. Normal is pretty easy, Veteran is the opposite and will have you yell at your computer, only to come back for more right away :p", "timestamp_updated": 1397323531, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1397323531, "votes_down": 10}, {"recommendationid": "9803987", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508739", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1482952720, "steamid": "76561198030781344", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is both cute and has depth.

I'd really like a button in Steam to turn them all off.)\n\nBack to just playing for the fun (screw veteran), it's entertaining me still, replaying the levels in order and the challenge and bonus ones I like.\n\nThere are plenty of levels, hours upon hours of play time! The progression is good, starts easy and gets slowly more difficult. \n\nThere are some different types of challenge levels throughout the Story mode, where I would like to just skip the one that I find no fun at all (Maid Raid), and get more of the one I like best (Back to Basics). They each unlock a few more levels of the same type once you've beaten the one in the Story mode, which is nice. There are also bonus levels where the aliens and playing area look different, and some have somewhat different special abilities (with no way that I know to read up details about them, unfortunately). \n\nI'd have liked a way to re-check the aliens while playing in a normal level, too. My memory isn't the best anymore.\n\nAnd I'd have liked a way to go to the next level in a second play through, rather than having to go back to the main menu and pick a previously played level just to get to the one after the one I just played.\n\nAnd I'd much prefer the game to remember that I unticked Fullscreen, rather than having to do it again every time I launch it.\n\nBut overall, great fun.
