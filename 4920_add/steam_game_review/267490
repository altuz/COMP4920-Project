I know this is a port of a 3DS/Vita game, but if you're going to be on PC, you're going to be judged by PC standards.\n\nClunky fighting mechanics. Despite this being a sidescroller, your attacks will go in front or behind of your opponents more often than not. Dodge mechanics are broken as well.\n\nStealth is broken. The game offers these \"cones of sight\" so you can see where the enemy's looking and how far that goes. Yeah, don't think that's even remotely accurate. Enemies will see you even with their backs turned, and once they do see you, it's virtually impossible for you to evade their notice again. This wouldn't be so bad if they didn't make this an essential part of the game and even center a few of the boss fights around their \"stealth\". So there's that.\n\nHorrible, HORRIBLE level design. This game tries to emulate a Metroidvania type of game, but it fails miserably due to frustrating level design and generic set pieces which all look alike. The map is worse than useless and seems more like one of those optical illusions where you can't tell which way is up. About 75% of this game consists of backtracking through this cesspool of a map, so that only adds to the fun.\n\nIn short, this game is in no way worth the price tag.

Again everything that can make a game like Metroid bad this game commits in someway or another. Either boring or confusing set pieces and stage design, check. Lame puzzles that seem to be a distraction from what you should be doing exploring this world check, combat that dosen\u2019t seem to fit in right, check, and finally mcguffin quests just for a sake of a mcguffin quest check and double check. I only recommend this to hard core batman fan and only on sale, wait for this game to be 5 dollars or less before picking it up.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQy7UsN8lLA", "timestamp_updated": 1504809759, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504809759, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35164791", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433642", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1492524423, "steamid": "76561198088193014", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "idk i dont like platformers", "timestamp_updated": 1506203613, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506203613, "votes_down": 28}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 86, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 169, "total_reviews": 255}}
