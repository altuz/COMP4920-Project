I have a feeling that this game was made in a big hurry. Here are some thoughts. \n[h1] Story [/h1]\nI like Lego Movie and game sticks to movie plot. But you know all of the cutscenes are cut from the film and it looks really cheap. \n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\nI rarely talk about graphics but here I'll say something. Here's the thing it looks so bright and kinda blurred. Everybody looks like gummy bears. In some levels gamma and filters are so bad that i can't get into atmosphere. Lego Lotr had even better graphics and design and this is older game. \n[h1] Map/World [/h1]\nThere are 4 locations and they are pretty small. 6 missons are located in first zone. These worlds are connected by a teleport so there is no traveling experience. Also there is nothing interesting in locations they've removed huge quests from npc. Usually objective is close to npc. You dont need to find characters anymore you can unlock them in selection menu. So there is no point to investigate world anymore just for the red bricks. \n[h1] Characters [/h1]\nThere are a lot of them. The problem is you dont need them all. In other Lego games you encountered around 90 % of all characters during the game which made some interest in finding and playing those guys. Here you will face less than a 50% of all characters. Most of them are same and some are really powerfull  what makes the majority of figures useless. \n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nSame old Lego platformer. Exept fighting and mission content is really poor. Its just boring. Its hard to explain why. Maybe cuz you are playing same characters till the end. And I dont like this feature with building stuff its kinda boring also. \n[h1] Collectables [/h1]\nPants, gold manuals and gold bricks i dont know what they do really. Pants give you powerups like more speed and ... i really equiped only 1 pants so they are like forging items from Lego Lotr. And golden manuals allow you to build some vehicles in bonus room. Again i find it bad idea. Ive completed bonus room with the Superman and he has more functions that those vehicles. Its a good move to finally use minikits for something but not for the bonus level where they are also unnecessary. \n[h1] Music [/h1] \nYou know it doesnt give you a proper drive and some compositions are really annoying. Especially ones which are repeated. It seems voice acting was done in a hurry, it sounds really cheap and unemotional. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nLike I prevoisly said it seems that this game was made in a great hurry. I didnt really like it ive completed it only because of achievements. Id like to mention some bugs. Sometimes scripts dont work and some folks cant get red bricks because some stuff is just floating in the air that spoils game. 4/10", "timestamp_updated": 1506686088, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506686088, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35323872", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493772", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1431735933, "steamid": "76561198109081495", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I feel like LEGO games are getting worse and worse.
