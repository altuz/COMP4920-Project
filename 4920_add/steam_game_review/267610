You wonder who you are and how you got there, and why you are standing next to three recycle bins. You see a tree and you decide you want to cut it down. You run up to it in super lag at 1fps and try to stick the chainsaw which you don\u2019t know how you got into the tree. You try to start the chainsaw but it says you are holding the chainsaw in the wrong position. So you give up and decide to explore. But then, all of the sudden, you feel the need that you need to cut down some trees. You have no way of getting this information, you just know in your mind that you must cut down three trees. So you decide to cut down these trees and you realize that you can run faster sideways than you can forwards. You don\u2019t know why, you just do. In your head you visualize a map. You have no way of getting this map, you just picture it (in the top-right corner of your screen). You run to this place where you feel the trees are and you magically stop. You have reached the end of the world. Small world right? Then you turn around and you see a hideous, very scary sight. You see\u2026a mountain that is literally covered in trees!!! Then you see a crane and decide to jump in it so that you don\u2019t have to look at that hideous mountain anymore. You don\u2019t know how you got in it or what you pressed, but you\u2019re magically in the crane. You can\u2019t get out. You\u2019re stuck. The game is over.\n\nSecond In-Game Adventure: You start out as a random guy with a chainsaw standing in front of a house and you see that you are next to four recycling bins. You once again wonder who you are and how you got there, and why there are now four recycling bins. Maybe the garbage man came and dropped off another one? These questions remain in your head leaving you in confusion. You see a tree once again and you decide you want to cut it down. You think that maybe this time the chainsaw will actually start\u2026You thought wrong. Once again the chainsaw doesn\u2019t move. You decide that maybe this tree just has problems and doesn\u2019t like you so you decide to run away from this tree that doesn\u2019t seem to like you and you run up a hill. You then remember that you can run faster sideways than you can forwards. You don\u2019t know why, you just do. So you awkwardly run sideways until you come to another tree. You think that this one looks more friendly and will want to be your friend so you can cut it down\u2026You thought wrong. As soon as you get up to the tree and raise your chainsaw, the tree pulls you into it. You don\u2019t know how, since you were standing about 5 ft. away from the tree. How can this be? You are stuck with these puzzling questions waiting to be answered. Anyway, the tree pulls you into it and you go into the tree. You don\u2019t know how, all you know is that you are now inside the tree. But then, things get much more scary. You then fall out of the tree and start falling into a world of whiteness. You look up and you can see that you have fallen out of the world. You can see the bottom of the world fading as you fall farther and farther into the world of whiteness. You look down into the whiteness. It looks very\u2026white. But then, as you start to think that things can\u2019t get any worse\u2026You thought wrong. Black and white lines cover up your screen. Everything fades. The game crashes. You are back at your desktop.

I also wound up walking on top of trees after finding I was unable to climb up a hill trying to get to my objective. The game and interface are not very intuitive. Figuring out where to go on the tiny minimap is confusing (the tutorial is no help being simply a series of 20 second text overlay videos pointing out UI elements), and once you do reach an area figuring out how to use the chainsaw is frustrating. Once you do it simply turns out to be finding the right spot to stand and pressing the action button, no skill or planning involved.
