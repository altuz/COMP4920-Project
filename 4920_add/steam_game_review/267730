Here  is what Ground Pounders has:\n\n1.Supply lines.  \n\n2.Transport units\n\n3.Replacements\n\n4.Units with 1-5 steps\n\n5.Supply zones and Victory hexes\n\n6.CRT (Combat Results Table)\n\n7.Artillery, AA Guns, Command Units, Scouts, Engineers and of course Tanks, Mobile Infantry etc. \n\n8.Scanning & signatures create a Fog of War. Quiet units are harder to see. \n\n9.Units have lots of stats. Attack, Defence, die pool, range, movement points etc. \n\n10.Terrain effects.\n\n11. ZOC \n\nSounds a bit like a wargame, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nThe main game has two campaigns to play through, Human and Hiver.  There is also multiplayer (good luck getting that to work) and skirmish mode.  In the campaign your small core will travel from battle to battle, so it is important to try to keep it intact.  There are plenty of turns in most missions, so the game rewards tactical play as opposed to charging everything headfirst at the enemy.  \n\nEach turn has 3 main phases, Supply & replacements, command, and move/combat.  (You also draw cards to replenish your hand at the beginning of the turn).  The game is Igo/Ugo so players take turns completing the phases. \n\nThe supply phase checks all your units for supply.  Units out of supply will lose stats and, if they remain out of supply for a few turns will begin to lose steps.   Each scenario has a replacement pool which limits the number of replacement steps you can allocate to damaged units. \n\nThe command phase is the most unique phase, which wouldn\u2019t work on a tabletop wargame.  You roll a bucket of dice which is determined by the number/quality of your command units.  You then pre-assign these dice to your units.  If your unit is in combat, instead of rolling a die, you will use the pre-assigned die.  Different units can be assigned a different number of dice.  When attacking, supporting units and artillery need to expend their own dice (value doesn\u2019t matter, they just need to spend one).  This limits the number of attacks an artillery unit can support.   You can allocate all or none of your dice manually.  There is an option to automatically remaining dice.  So if you expect little or no combat, hitting \u201cauto\u201d and skipping this phase is fine.  When you have a detailed plan and you want your two \u201c6\u201ds on the right units, you can allocate every die if you wish. \n\nDuring the move/combat phase the player can move units and attack in whatever order they wish.  Once a unit attacks it can no longer be moved.  Although units can support and still move.  Combat is resolved on a CRT with your die being added and the enemy\u2019s die being subtracted to create the DRM (Die Roll Modifier).  Odds are determined by attack:defense ratio.  Supporting units add half their attack value, artillery adds its full attack value.  A typical combat result is A1D2R.  If you\u2019ve played any tabletop wargames, you would read that as \u201cAttacker loses 1 step, defender loses 2 steps and retreats\u201d.  Supporting non-artillery can also sometimes lose steps depending on the result. So the result can be A1s0a D3s1r, which would be Attacking unit loses a step and may advance. Defending unit loses a step and retreats, defending supporting non-artillery units also lose a step. \n\nAfter the player has finished moving and attacking, it is time to assign defensive support.  Again, you can click on every unit and select which units will expend dice to support it if is attacked. Or you can just hit \u201cauto\u201d if you don\u2019t have many concerns.  Again, how much time you spend is up to you. \n\nOne other thing I should mention is the cards.  Before battle you can create your deck of 32 cards from your card pool (or use the random one generated).  What I have done after a few missions is I\u2019ve built my \u201cbest deck suited to my play style\u201d and I just use that one.  The initial card pool is random so it will be different for each player.  Also you can \u201cwin\u201d random cards when victorious in a scenario.  If you like the card you win, it is pretty simple to tweak your deck and add the card.  \n\nCards can do a variety of things from adding movement points, +attack value, DRM, odds shift, increase artillery range, isolate enemies, lower signature, add AA to a unit, shorten enemy supply lines etc.  I don\u2019t know how many cards there are but there are lots. Almost everything appears to have a card that can affect it.  Used cards are replenished back to your hand size (3-5) at the beginning of the turn.  I presume it is possible to run out your deck, but it hasn\u2019t happened to me yet.  \n\nCards also have a \u201cSpace Superiority\u201d (SS) number on them.  At the beginning of the scenario you can discard 1-5 cards (take them out of the game).  The highest total determines who has space superiority for the scenario.  If you have SS you get additional powerful cards that you can re-use every 2-4 turns.  These bonus cards can reduce steps (orbital strike), scan an area, reduce enemy supply range, or increase a units attack/defence for a turn. \n\nAnd that, in a nutshell, is Ground Pounders!\n\n\nThe Good, The Bad and The Ugly:\n\nThe Good:\n\nTwo big* campaigns provide plenty of scenarios covering a wide variety of situations.   I\u2019m actually quite impressed with the big variety of situations that are offered.  Flanking manoeuvres, amphibious landings, head on assaults, fighting withdrawals and protecting fleeing civilians from the advancing horde are just a sampling of the different situations offered.  (*Refer The Ugly.)\n\nTactical play is rewarded.  This game requires careful play and is not just a tank rush.  This is a real wargame.  Most missions take 1-2 hours to complete. \n\nUnits gain experience through missions.  When they reach a certain level they get a +drm.  Also, they can choose a special ability when they reach veteran and elite status. These are little bonuses, such as \u201curban fighter\u201d, \u201cAA gun attachment\u201d, \u201cextra movement\u201d etc.  There are about 6 different choices at each experience level which varies to unit type.  A nice little addition and preferable over the random leaders of Panzer General/Corps as you can tailor your units to your own play style. \n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe tutorial is poor and hardly explains anything.  It took me about 3-4 scenarios to finally grok the majority of the game\u2019s mechanics and situations.  This game doesn\u2019t have the slow learning curve of more streamline \u201cwargames\u201d but is instead pretty steep.   UI isn\u2019t always intuitive and it took me a while just to figure out how to assign Defensive Support.  \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised by the \u201ccartoon\u201d sci-fi graphics.  Although taking place in the Sword in the Stars setting, this is a real wargame. \n\nThe maps are drab, dull and difficult.   There are different terrain effects, but it is difficult to tell what terrain each hex is on the washed out colour maps.  Just because this is \u201canother planet\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you couldn\u2019t have had distinctively coloured maps with forests, rough, plains etc. clearly identifiable.  A consolidated TEC (Terrain Effects Chart) would also be useful.  It is very difficult to plan one\u2019s advance when one is unsure how far your units can move across the different terrains. (You can get the information with a few clicks, but this is tedious and not intuitive).   \n\nSpace Superiority should have been done differently.  It becomes a no-brainer to discard 5 cards and hope you get it.  The \u201cfree\u201d SS cards are very powerful and reusable with a cooldown of a few turns. This affects deck construction a little as I am using some \u201cinferior\u201d cards with a high SS rating.  If you lose SS there is the possibility (and temptation) to just forfeit and retry the scenario. \n\nI recommend Ground Pounders. It\u2019s not perfect, but scratches the itch in the right places. A good wargame marred by bugs and lack of support. 6/10", "timestamp_updated": 1457697158, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1457697158, "votes_down": 2}, {"timestamp_dev_responded": 1402088314, "recommendationid": "10293527", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 170, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586547", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1411694203, "steamid": "76561197993930568", "num_games_owned": 4439, "num_reviews": 350, "playtime_forever": 520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Update:\nThis game must not be doing well: 8 weeks after launching on steam it was in an 80% off sale on an internet store; 9 weeks after launch it was in a cheap game bundle.

Only change is increased thread locking and post deleting in the forums. Here's a post I made about the Early Access price supposed to be lower than the release price before my reply was deleted and the thread locked:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/FNe0Pdy\n\nMAIN REVIEW FOLLOWS:\n----------------------------------------\n\nI have been holding off writing this review because the game could be so good and I was hoping it would change. \n\nThis is a hex-based wargame in the SotS universe and that's exciting stuff. (I just realized that will sound like a joke to non-wargame fans, but it's true).\n\nBased on the screenshots you would think was a cool, deep, fun game. The information in the encyclopedia in game is a nice touch.\n\nTry to play the game though and you'll find a confusing, fiddly mess. There are far too many phases and lots of fiddly things you have to keep doing. The user interface is really bad both in usability and in showing you what's going on. A lot of this is because of the developers making the bad decision to have a \"unified user interface\" on mobile and PC, which means no tooltips, only one button used and no scrolling when you get your mouse to the edge of the screen. This cripples the PC UI and the developers flat-out refuse to change it to make the PC version easier to use.\n\nThe tutorial has been through a few changes but still remains awful at teaching you the game. This is both due to the content of the tutorial and the way it is presented, which makes it hard to tie together the UI with what the flash-card like windows are telling you.\n\nI bought the game at the start of the Early Access on Steam and I was disappointed to find out that the game was not as finished as I thought it would be. From the store page it seemed like the only thing missing were some campaign missions, and the ironing out of the last few bugs:\n\n\"With this Early Access release, Ground Pounders is feature complete, and the main differences between now and final release - besides a few last minute cards and units - is there is only 1 campaign (instead of 2) and 5 scenarios (instead of ten).\"\n\nIt turned out that early adopters really were unpaid beta testers and only by assiduously playing when it wasn't fun and giving feedback could we turn the game into the good game it had the potential to be. I mean, it wasn't just bug fixing, there were actually changes to how the game worked, and there was really the feeling that the game hadn't been tested at all before putting it on steam.\n\nI did this for a short while but then I just couldn't be bothered any more- it was just not fun. I decided to put the game down until they finished it and see how it was. As of today the game is still in Early Access but is 66% off on a certain online game store. Because the Steam store page went out of its way to point out that we were saving money by buying into the Early Access game at the start vs. buying when it launched I felt a bit betrayed by this; I also took it as a sign that the studio may be in some sort of trouble. The game was planned to be released in March according to the Steam store page and it's almost June now with no release so maybe that's why.\n\nAnyway, I suppose if you do get a deep discount on this or even get it in a bundle (there have been a lot of Early Access games in bundles recently) then it may turn out to be the game you expect, but at the moment it's unlikely that it is.\n\nedited to say something positive: The music is good.

It should be expected that bugs will show up from time to time as well as things will change while the game is still in production.  As long as constructive feedback, bugs, and any areas where people are running into confusion are posted in the forum or emailed to the developers, their voices are heard and changes are made.\n\nWe have had a lot of feedback throughout the time in early access, which we are pushing to the end.  We have listened to everyone's input and we have made changes during this process.  There have been many changes due to the helpful feedback from the players:\n- The number of phases have been reduced and optimized\n- The tutorials have been redesigned completely\n- Units have been tuned and balanced\n- The campaign missions have been balanced\n- Cards have been added and removed\n- Scenarios have been added (The Ridge is a fan inspired map)\n- And of course bugs have been discovered and resolved\nThis is all because of effective feedback and the game is better because of the players.\n\nWe highly appreciate and are very thankful for all of the feedback from everyone who has effectively participated, as it is what we have used to make the game better.  This is what to expect for all early access games.\n\nIf providing constructive feedback or posting a bug is not desirable for someone, I would suggest for them to maybe stay out of early access to begin with.  Otherwise, join in and participate in the journey.

IT'S FREE THERE.\n\nI've given this game as many chances as I care to. While it's fun and wildly addictive, the rules are extremely complex and inconsistent, always favoring the AI. You'll always be vastly outnumbered, and usually outmanuevered. Your ability to heal your units is restricted to some arbitrary number that occasionally gains points for absolutely no reason, and always stops as you make the final push needing it the most. This on top of only being allowed to heal each unit by one each turn make things needlessly aggravating to say the least. Every campaign mission gives you an extremely tight time limit, and throws everything it can at you. For the sake of argument, let me walk you through the last straw.\n\nCampaign mission 1: Hold the ports. You start off with a limited force in the north and a small force of your choosing in the south, with air support. Honestly, this one isn't that difficult. Just keep everyone alive and the enemy away from the left of the screen, which they never really go to anyway. \n\nCampaign Mission 2: Capture the cities. Small force in the east, single helicopter, your force, and transport boats capable of missing the mountains in the west. There's a gimmick to this one, as the time limit isn't counting down to your win. In order to clear this one, you have to pick up a troop in the east with your chopper in the west, and take him north while you use the boats to attack the northern city. Use your helicopter troop to capture the central area and bleed the enemy dry so they can't defend the city (or even attack, since their supply lines are cut). Then move the pinned down east troops north for a win. There's literally no other way to do it. I've tried everything I can think of and this all that works. \n\nCampaign Mission 3: Reinforcements are coming from the east. You get a full deployment in the west, and are tasked with moving them through a narrow canyon, clearing hotspots along the way. You get 30 turns. Now even in the best of circumstances, this would be tricky as vehicles aren't effective if they leave the road. Regardless, I was able to push all the way to the east, where I met with a significant enemy force on top of the damage that had been done already. Despite having higher rolls, better tech levels, and better units, I was pushed back HARD and the largest part of my effective force was decimated. Then I timed out, failing the mission and having wasted a half hour of my time, at least. In what universe is an APC with no support able to take out a tank? \n\nHonestly, the entire thing seems like it was made with freemium in mind, to sell you more reinforcement points or more time for your missions, or just more units in general. But there's not even than option. It's all the frustration of barely passable missions without paying, without the option of paying for the satisfaction of razing the map with nuclear orbital barrages in hatred for your enemy. I honestly have no idea how the skirmish mode or multiplayer modes play, but I have to assume that multiplayer is passable, but skirmish suffers from the same bullshit roll fudging and stat decimation the campaign does.", "timestamp_updated": 1445533833, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1445533833, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "10324956", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511314", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1430085093, "steamid": "76561198017328264", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Ok. Personally, I think this game has potential and there are obviously still issues needing to be worked out as the game is still pre-release.\n\nNow, that said, I'm going to advise against buying the game now if you are looking for something to play. If you are wanting to support the development of this game, go ahead and buy it, play it, and give the company feedback. I'll give a brief bullet point list as to the current pros and cons with the game as I see it.\n\nPros:\n1. Tutorials are worth the time and explain a lot of the game's mechanics. Do -not- skip them, thinking you'll pick up the game quickly without them because you've played games like this before.\n2. Luck and skill both play a role in this game, without placing a premium on either.\n3. The card mechanic is a nice touch, as it creates openings that you might otherwise not be able to take advantage of.\n4. The campaign structure (from what I've been able to play of it) rewards careful husbanding of the units you buy, without punishing you unduely for taking risks with the temporary units assigned to your command.\n5. The three layers of the battlefield keeps things fresh, as burrowers may sometimes pop up in your lines unexpectedly.\n6. Keeps the flavor and expands on the lore of the Sword of the Stars universe.\n\nCons:\n1. The game is buggy as hell. But it's early access, so...you should be expecting that going in.\n2. The high-res texture pack will cause the game to crash when loading in. At least, that's been my experience.\n3. The game has a sharp learning curve. As noted in the pros, the tutorials are worth the time, so...that helps curb that somewhat.\n4. Some aspects of the game are counter-intuitive, adding to the learning curve noted above.\n5. No adjustable resolution or window size.\n6. It's early access, therefore not recomended for someone expecting a completed game. It's -very- much a work in progress.\n\nOverall, however, I highly recomend this game and look forward to seeing the end result.
