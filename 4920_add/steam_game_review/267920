Which makes it even more fun, in my books!\n\nOf course this is an older title, so dont expect cutting edge tech on the graphics front, having said that this more than stands the test of time, and going from uber speedy jet to walking tank of doom is very satisfying.\n\nYou almost definetly wont be happy with the standard control setup, but just play with the sensitivity settings in game and you can make it feal right very easily.\n\nStoryline isnt Oscar winning material but is more than fine and does help to set up some sense of urgency on certain missions.\n\nOverall, damn good fun and after clocking it is still one of those \"load in for 10mins, blow shit up, log off\" kinda of games.", "timestamp_updated": 1501358282, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501358282, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33929214", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477781", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500087822, "steamid": "76561198272044252", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 12, "review": "Hello am 48 year man from somalia.
