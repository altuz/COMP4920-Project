Sure outdated and aged. Clunky graphics and (camera) controls. But you cant beat this classic story driven adventure of a lone captain and his digital crew. Deserves a remake for sure.\n\nExtra: Please bump up my review so people can read the following; Steam puts the game in compatibility mode causing FPS to tank and stutter.\nSollution: Go to game directory and put BOTH .exe files into compatibilty mode for windows 8 FOR ALL USERS! (again FOR ALL USERS, else steam will overide the setting and it still stutters)\nAlternative: Adding the -windowed tag to the main executable and launching outside of steam seems to work as well.", "timestamp_updated": 1505226354, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505225903, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 37, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 37}}
