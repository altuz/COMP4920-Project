For anyone else the game gets old EXTREMELY fast, as in faster than any other game I've played. \nI was rushing towards the end before I hit the 15 minutes mark, something I never did before. By the time I hit the first roadblock though I simply couldn't be bothered to put any more effort into it. What's  the point of struggling with a game that I'm not having fun with? \nI can already tell this review will be downvoted to oblivion since people love to play watchdog in the reviews section but whatever. It will not change my opinion."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505212170, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34898429", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198068118610", "num_reviews": 15, "last_played": 1472859761, "num_games_owned": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2210}, "timestamp_updated": 1505212170, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is absolutely brilliant. I had heard about it from watching Indie Game: The Movie and the time mechanic really piqued my interest. The game explores the time mechanic in wide variety of very clever ways. I can't spoil how without spoiling the puzzles, so  I won't. And don't use a guide! I know some puzzles will be very hard, but don't use one!\n\nAside from the gameplay, the art and music are also incredible and enhance the atmosphere. The story, while minimal in word count, is very deep and thought-provoking. I have replayed the game numerous times, even after solving all the puzzles, just because it's so fun to replay! Braid has to be one of my favorite games of all time."}]}
