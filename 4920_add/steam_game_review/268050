I played it originally when it came out at a buddies house.  I liked what it was doing, but it made me sick to my stomach due to the black bars on the top and bottom.  I didn't buy it at that time.  Fast forward a couple of years and here I am just having completed the game.  It's almost October, it's my favorite month with my favorite \"holiday\", and it's a great time a year to play a creepy game.  \n\nOverall:  I really liked this.  You can feel the RE4 roots here.  It's very reminiscent of RE4 in some of the best ways.  The character controls in such a way that you can't play this like an action game.  Ammo is not everywhere, and when it is you can only carry so much of it.  Traps lay rampant in your path, as well as perhaps running into one too many enemies you can safely deal with.  Running is not much of an options at first because it turns out Castellanos is very out of shape at the beginning, or at least he seems so with that 3 second sprint limit.  The green gel upgrade system is quite useful and should be approached deliberately when choosing upgrades.  At times I wasn't sure what I wanted to upgrade, especially when you get close the end of the game, so I just sat on my Green Gel till I thought more about it.  I spent about 18 hours on my first play through, I did not collect everything and there is a NG+ feature I may take advantage of at some point.  \n\nGraphics: Surprisingly good.  The textures were good on many of the main characters.  The shadows were pretty nice and used very well for the game type.  More than once I crouched around a corner and the only thing that stopped me from turning the bend was seeing a shambling shadow.  The textures of some of the monsters, however, were a bit questionable.  But the scenes where you are going through a destroyed city were pretty amazing.  Not so much during the first chapter, but when you return in later chapters it was very nicely done.  They did some really cool stuff with the water too where there was essentially a kind of ghost texture of the water that made it look like a lot more was going on that it actually was.  I also am not the type to run up to a wall that make camera rest right on it to check the textures, so I am not sure if this would pass that kind of test.  \n\nGameplay:  Tanky controls and enemies that can be, at times, surprisingly quick added significantly to the tension.  There were times I also thought I was in the clear only to run across a trip wire or run around a corner to activate a motion controlled bomb trap.  None of it was cheap, but it was all placed very much to let you know that this game is not meant to be a run and gun affair.  The tension was great throughout and bosses were fearsome during the first encounter as well.  To note, I played on Survival Difficulty and died 65 times at completion (a stat the game seems anxious to let you know), but almost none of these felt cheap.  Many times it was me dying because I approached a situation in a really bad manner or didn't quite understand what a boss was doing.  For example, there is a boss about 2/3's of the way through that has an ability that is instant death.  At first I was frustrated because it felt cheap to me.  But then I realized that it was my way of playing that resulted in me getting hit with this ability.  Once I figured out what was actually happening, it no longer was able to kill me.  I liked how encounters like that taught me that I was doing something wrong, the game wasn't being cheap.  \n\nSystems: The upgrade system at first feels a little trivial, but after a few choice upgrades your character is significantly improved.  Don't underestimate how 1/2 a degree reduction in weapon sway can make a huge difference.  Also, when you max some of the upgrades you get a bonus that really helps.  For example if you max your sprint time, not only can you run for a while, but it also increases the speed at which you recover your stamina.  That matters a lot and it helps with the games tension that you rushing some upgrades by ignoring others makes you realize that it's not a good tactic, especially when those end upgrades are really expensive.  If you max your sprint, for example and ignore everything else,   you will soon realize there are situations where being able to run longer is not helpful at all.  One thing that was kind of a miss was the whole crafting of Agony Bolts.  You could do it on the fly even in middle of a fight.  So you find spare parts laying around and use them as you need them, and different bolts required varying numbers of parts.  But it just seemed like an extra step to me.  You end up crafting a lot in the heat of battle because at most you can only carry 4 of each bolt with one loaded into the crossbow.  I would rather have seen crafting stations interspersed and the ability to carry more of the bolts, or a total number of bolts you then decided how many of each you wanted within a set number.  Too many times I was just sitting on flash bolts because they don't seem to useful for anything but the normal human shamblers.  And the freeze bolts vs electric bolts was a strange situation because most of the time they resulted in the same thing, an enemy that is frozen in place for you to attack and/or kill.\n\nWorld:  There is a nice mix of stage types.  Some are enclosed and linear, some give you a bit more leeway and offer you some more open areas to traverse and murder enemies in.  Some might say the number of enemy types is on the low side, but with the way they are interspersed through levels and how you can approach them with varying trap types being around, with the various weapons at your disposal, it didn't really get old.  The first stages were right out of the opening village in RE4, but you also go through mental asylums, hospitals, a destroyed city, an old mansion... it all feels very unique from each other.  \n\nMusic and ambiance:  The music was really good and placed logically throughout.  But the thing that got me was how good the ambient noises were.  At night I will play with headphones on to not wake up my wife or the neighbors, and it creates this environment where I hear something and look over my shoulder.  It's an absolutely exhilarating experience when a shiver runs down my spine and I'm wary about what is going on in the room I'm in.  Other games going for huge creepy factor should try to emulate this.  Also, using headphones, I can't count the number of times I could hear a creepy shambler before I ever saw them.  Sometimes I am trying to sneak and hear one from behind it creates a moment of tense terror that sends my adrenaline spiking through the roof.\n\nFinal thoughts:  I knew I might like this game if I was in the right type of mood to play it (ie. ready for some Survival/Adventure Horror).  The game isn't scary, there is only a handful of places that something jumps out at you.  No, it's better described as amazingly tense and creepy.  I would often times feel the hair stand on the back of my neck, if I was about to come across what felt like a big encounter I would do a personal inventory of my health, how many healing packs I have, my ammo count for each gun, load the seeming best option for the Agony Crossbow and take a deep breath before diving in.  It's a completely different experience to realize you went wide with your last handgun shot and now don't know how to proceed so you run. It's really great.  I did come across one part that I found frustrating in the game, but it's so rare that I can easily recall it.  There was one spot where I kept getting killed by a trap but I was in no way touching the tripwire to spring it.  It was right at the end of the game and this one single tripwire, in the entire game, seems so sensitive that if I breathed on it it would go off.  It resulted probably in about 5 of my 65 deaths, but I can't recall a single such situation happening any other time.", "timestamp_updated": 1506025978, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506025978, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34910952", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490476", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505413422, "steamid": "76561198011321852", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of the best horror game.", "timestamp_updated": 1505263134, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505263134, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35337182", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504714", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507003434, "steamid": "76561198253791578", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 571}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Just found 3 dlc of this game i was whole blind on them since i bought it. well picking it up again hope the 2nd playthrough would be a lot more fun!", "timestamp_updated": 1506777770, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506777770, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "34941755", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505359363, "steamid": "76561198005582304", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Snuck up on a zombie haplessly eating some meat next to a fire.\n\nStealthy drew a knife inside his brainstem the very instant he peaked over his shoulder.\n\nTurned to my right and saw a horde of twenty zombies scream and growl at me.\n\n10/10 would train zombies into landmines again.", "timestamp_updated": 1505360619, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505360619, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34928393", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504735086, "steamid": "76561198153519371", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Had problems with mouse control but game is epic.", "timestamp_updated": 1505342374, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505342374, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35351978", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500118", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507166011, "steamid": "76561198139405171", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 944}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Awesome very scary", "timestamp_updated": 1506800854, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506800854, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35253603", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497630", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506496290, "steamid": "76561198047690060", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 1914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1040}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[h1] The Evil Within\t[/h1]\n[i] The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.\t[/i]\n\n[b] Pros:\t[/b]\nAtmosphere is creepy and consistent.\nControls are great and the visuals are fantastic.\nCombat rewards both stealthy and aggressive play.\nA variety of enemies that forces the player to constantly change tactics.\nThe Assignment & The Consequence DLC adds SO MUCH to the story, it's great.\nThe Executioner DLC is extremely fun and the player no longer has to fear the enemies.\n\n[b] Cons:\t[/b]\nDetective Sebastian Castellanos is KIND OF generic.\nCamera angle is absurdly close.

I found myself planning my ammo use, making snap decisions about sneaking/fleeing vs fighting, and fretting as my health got low.  \n\nOne-hit kills are harder to land than you may think.  I missed many times trying to finish the enemy off while he writhed and recoiled from the first hit.  The way the monsters move adds to the difficulty of the game and is brilliantly designed.  The mix of dejection and confusion you feel when a boss you killed earlier in the game has inexplicably been resurrected is unlike anything I've experienced before.\n\nEach chapter is its own unique adventure, with different surroundings that range from the abandoned mental hospital to creepy church catacombs and dark underground metro stations, to more stereotypical outdoor areas where you're in the open and exposed to God knows what.  No two chapters are the same in terms of environment and each presents its own unique set of challenges and horrors.  Even a bus falling from a high ledge and crashing to the ground before you is enough to scare you if you aren't expecting it.\n\nAs a horror fan, this game is worth playing.

I got this game on sale after I heard that there would be a second one and all this game has done is convince me never to bother with the next game.", "timestamp_updated": 1507120227, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1507120227, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35069758", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498829", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506324726, "steamid": "76561198153233056", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 163}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I thought this game is good, but I was wrong, firstly PC controls are very bad, late key reaction(when you push button you expect reaction quickly, but reactions are like you have the worst graphic card with 5 or 10 FPS). Very bad camera anyle in many situations, very bad shooting and aiming. Skills in game, there is 100% critical shoot with rifle but only works if you shoot into head(if enemy have mask that is not true and same if enemy have 2 heads) and if you do not upgrade sniper rifle headshot will be deadly anyway.\n\nAnd new game plus, if you going for achievements, you will still need to play 4,5 x whole campaign because you cant change up diff in new game plus, but you will need to play it, because you will need a lot of gel for upgrades. Minimum number of plays is 3x - but its practicaly imposible, because when you collect gel and collectibles you cant do 5h run and doing that on akumu diff is very hard(one hit you die)", "timestamp_updated": 1505844905, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "6", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505844905, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "35400501", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497644", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506907759, "steamid": "76561198070968007", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 130}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "In order to get an actualy playable frame rate I had to use +r_swapinterval 0 in the startup command box.", "timestamp_updated": 1506904946, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506904946, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1676, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 675, "total_reviews": 2351}}
