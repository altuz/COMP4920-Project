It's the most thrilling fun I've had in a game all year.\n\n~~~~~\n\nI'm stuck on a ship facing enemies I can't kill. You see, they all have shields equipped, and I don't have any tech left to take out said shield, so they're impervious to anything I can throw (or shoot) at them.\n\nMy target is already dead. The captain is also already dead. I'm not at risk of getting captured here, I can just leave. But there's an enigma clause on this contract, and I want the extra coin. After all, I'm fighting to save my friend Mercy, and losing these credits is going to be a setback I don't want to risk. The clause says no living witnesses, and I'm stuck here with seven of them. Seven guards who've seen me, whom I can't even hope to kill.\n\nMy very last hope on this ship is a lone room with a viewing window. If I can manage to corral all the remaining guards into that room and break the glass, it's game over for them and a perfect contract for me. That's...a big ask. I don't have much to work with here, and it's not as if the guards will kindly and helpfully congregate in front of the window if I ask nicely. No, there are going to be bullets flying everywhere, and if even one witness remains I'm screwed.\n\nBut - I've got a shotgun.\n\nI can pull the guards to me by firing off shots from adjacent rooms. They'll come to investigate the noise, and I can lead them toward the viewing room. If I do it right, I can get them to bunch up. They'll cluster close enough for the vacuum to pull them all out at once, and if I go with them I can just remote pilot my ship and save myself. This could work!\n\nI move methodically through the halls, firing shots to grab the attention of the guards. Mercifully, they act as I'd hoped! They investigate the noise, moving as a group, all ten remaining baddies clumped up like some kind of shielded-shooty amoeba pushing itself through a maze of spaceship corrdiors. Finally, we hit the room I want them in, but I have to dodge down a hallway first, lest the leader of the pack shoot prematurely and hit the glass. When they all enter the room and are in range, I push back - but I'm cut off by three guards. They've spotted me, they're close enough to shoot me with no chance of dodging. I've only got one choice...\n\nI fire my shotgun.\n\nIn slow motion, I see myself get hit by one of their bullets and fall unconscious. I see my shotgun spray creep forward, hit the leader's shield, and ricochet toward into the viewing room. I hold my breath, praying for the sound of breaking glass. And CRASH - there it is. The viewing window breaks and all the remaining guards are pulled out into empty space. My body lay there bleeding as I wait for the recovery timer to finish counting down. I see the notification pop up saying SHIP CLEARED as the triumph sets in. I can't believe what I've just pulled off. I can't believe there's no achievement for this! \n\nI fulfilled my enigma clause, and got my full pay. A couple missions later, I freed Mercy and regained her as a player character, then retired.

You do this to further the rebellion against all the factions in the 'galaxy' (the game's region of space).\n\nAfter \"docking\" uninvited on an enemy ship, you will [strike]murder everything[/strike] disable it by [strike]exploding everything[/strike] cautiously knocking out the ship's crew - non-lethally, [b]of course[/b].\nThe game allows (and encourages) you to press SPACE for a quick, tactical pause, that allows you to switch gear and do crazy amounts of cool moves. Like hacking a turret, disabling enemies' shields, teleporting/switching places with an enemy, murdering the pilot and blowing up a hole that sucks a squad of unsuspecting crew members out into space in a few seconds.\n\nHaving randomly generated characters with personal missions is also very neat. If you're a roleplayer (as in, you set rules, morals and/or goals for characters) you can create pretty cool stories.\nIf you're not into that, by losing a character you'll only lose its gear, which is pretty light when compared to roguelites/roguelikes by which you lose all of it's skills, experience and unlockables. Losing is Fun.\n\nMind that if you're not into roguelites, the lack of an overarching story and the expected repetitive nature of the game might get to you.\nThat said, the only thing I'd wish to have more of, is equipment/customization for your pod. Sensors, EMP, hacking capabilities, would make it a much more lively part of the game.\n\nIn conclusion, Heat Signature is an amazing surprise. I've only heard about it yesterday, saw 3 minutes of video and that's all it took to guarantee my purchase. \nIt is by no means a perfect game - much could be further improved or added. But for its price, even if you're not familiar with the related games, it's worth checking out.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n-\nEdited September 26, 2017: For clarity, I previously said the game could be further polished.

You're a resistance fighter in space, and you're tasked with infiltrating ships to weaken the powers in place, and your deeds will inspire people to revolt and liberate their station from the oppressive powers of the galaxy.\n\nSo you rush in your small pod, latch yourself onto a ship, and then infiltrate it. Soon, you will find some cool gadgets or awesome weapons in the randomly generated cargo holds or the bodies of your enemies. Theses items usually have several effects and purposes, which mean you can combine several of those in clever ways to progress towards your goal. \n\nWhether you like to be stealthly or just go in all guns blazing, the decent array of items available and their different effects can be combined to suit both your playstyle and the current objective. \n\nSo why shouldn't I give you the game a thumb up ?\n\n[h1]A thumb down for lack of content[/h1]\n\nBecause past that first glance, after the first 2h ingame, you will notice the main problem of the game: it only has 2h of content. \n\nAfter theses first two hours, you will have seen everything the game has to offer to you. Once you've liberated a few stations, the game will have shown you every difficulty modifier or special enemy you can encounter. You will also probably have seen most gadgets (though not all their slightly different variants). \n\nBut the goal of the game is to liberate 40 stations, not just a few of them......which mean if you wish to see the end of the game, you will have to grind theses liberations one by one, for 15 to 20h, until you reach the ending. \n\nNothing new will happen, it's just completing the same kind of randomly generated missions over and over until you have enough liberation points to liberate another station.\n\nWorst of all, most liberated stations will provide you with a new permanently unlocked item in your shop, which mean that you will have more and more tools easily available (rather than randomly looted), to do the same type of missions, So the more you play, the easier the game will become, which will reinforce the impression of grinding and boredom.\n\n[h1]Not really a game, more like a proof-of-concept[/h1]\n\nUltimately, that \"2h game stretched over 20\" is not a critical failure. For 12 euros (or whatever your local equivalent), it doesn't feel like the game robs you. However, there is definitely a feeling that this game is just not finished. That it's just a proof-of-concept, with a bunch of features that were mostly not fleshed out. \n\nA very simple example of that is the \"Coldfire ship\" that you can unlock by liberating a system. It is the most expensive ship in the game (twice the normal price) because it has the special ability of being invisible to enemy ships sensors...which sounds cool in practice, but as soon as you play the game you will understand is completely useless. You're always asked to breach a ship from its backside, and the small range of sensors are always located on the front and slightly on the sides of the enemy ship, making them totally useless...it will be very rare for you to ever have to worry about them.\n\nThis and many others examples explain why, despite some cool ideas and a nice style, I can't really recommend this game. If you have time and money to spare on a so-so game, you might want to get Heat Signature and play it for a few hours.

The game constantly dares you to risk everything, and then floods you with options to escape when you get in over your head.\n\nThe randomness of the galaxy map means that your item unlocks will be uncertain game to game. The item unlocksare based off of space stations you unlock as your individual crew members reps. \n\nI highly recommend this game if you like a heavy dash of critical thinking with your action. The launch trailer for this game really describes everything you need to know about it.\n\nI heartily recommend this.", "timestamp_updated": 1506312409, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506312409, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35243186", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548530", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506885264, "steamid": "76561197972835583", "num_games_owned": 1185, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1064}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "My first character was Traveler Truth, and his mission in life was to rescue his kidnapped daughter. He was new at this stuff, but he muddled his way through, barely escaping terrible situations, building up a reserve of equipment, and finally saving enough to pay for the intel on where his daughter was.\n\nHe learned how truly nasty a ship full of shielded enemies is. He got captured one room away from his daughter.\n\nWhen I went back to the character select I was in for a shock: one of them was Traveler Truth's father! Not only that, but he came with the perfect shield clearing weapon, a subverter grenade launcher. Pappy Truth was much more experienced, and by the time he had earned enough to pay for info on where his son was, he was ready to rock. He found where the enemy's pilot was and took him out, leaving the ship dead in the water. Then he left, recharged his gear at a friendly station, and came back to methodically tear the ship apart to save his son.\n\nTraveler Truth learned from his own mistakes and his father's triumphs, and less than an hour later, saved his daughter. The Truth family retired with two weapons named after them and six stations freed, leaving an indelible mark on the galaxy of Heat Signature that would not soon be forgotten.\n\nThen, a couple hours later, I came across a character who wanted to rescue someone. Imagine my surprise when it turned out that he wanted to rescue a character from my friend's copy of the game! After a few good missions and lucky drops he managed to save Taiwan Whiteblood, and I chose to play as him next. All Taiwan wanted in the world was to kill the Offworld officer who had executed his son. He almost failed when he got knocked out and dragged out an airlock, the timer running out quickly. He went right back in, and at literally the last second he knocked out the pilot, took the controls, and accelerated past the station that the ship was about to dock with. He accomplished his bloody goal just a few minutes later.\n\nThat gave him enough liberation points to free another Offworld station, which was just enough to open up the stronghold liberation mission for the Offworld stronghold. Taiwan, left with no family and his revenge accomplished, knew what he had to do.\n\nHe rammed a ship into the stronghold while still at the pilot's seat. That night, everyone at the bar toasted to Taiwan Whiteblood, and they named the stronghold he freed Whiteblood Bastion.\n\nHeat Signature isn't just a great emergent gameplay generator, it's an amazing gaming memory generator.", "timestamp_updated": 1506524380, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506524246, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35117776", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545172", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506376934, "steamid": "76561198091334757", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 485}, "votes_funny": 8, "review": "[h1]The (Short) Life of Cygnus Elvashak[/h1]\n\nCygnus Elvashak was a simple man with a tragic past. His sister had been killed by the Glitchers; specifically, by a man named Gio Estralda. With a heart of fire, Elvashak raced to find the best way to exact revenge. And, as luck would have it, he became the main character... For a short while. With his Longblade and Rechargeable High Capacity Stealth Shield, he was ready!\n\nElvashak amassed a large sum of money through missions of three difficulty types; Easy, Medium, and Hard. With his blade and shield in hand, he managed to gather what almost seemed to be randomized, but useful, loot, such as a Rechargeable Glitch Trap and Quiet Quickfire Gun.\n\nWith his money, he paid for intel on his sister's killer. He tracked the man down to the exact ship, but when he boarded, Elvashak was blown away. Literally. A turret shot him and he was thrown out of the airlock.\n\nHis breaching pod managed to catch him, however, and bring him back to safety! Elvashak, now being far more careful, found the ship to be much, much larger than any he had encountered before. Try as he might, Elvashak could not overcome the huge amounts of guards and sentry turrets. Taking out six men, Elvashak felt himself thrown into space yet again. Once again catching himself with his remote controlled pod, he boarded for what he knew was the last time. He would make one last effort and, failing that, retreat and try again at another point in time.\n\nUnforeseen by him, however, was the explosion of an engine. The ship was split apart, and he managed to get very, very close to his sister's killer. The ship, on the other hand, was fast approaching its destination. As the countdown ticked away, he decided to retreat. As his pod pulled away, he was blasted by an array of missiles. Barely hitting the proper buttons to keep the pod from breaking the part, he relaxed in his chair.\n\nThe day was done, and he would come back another day. That is, he would have. If he hadn't been on emergency fuel.\n\nTry as he might, he could not get the trajectory correct; and once the fuel was out, life support disengaged. After multiple successful missions, liberating a station, and coming so close to avenging his sister's death, Elvashak was left to die from lack of oxygen, his pod drifting away from the known galaxy.\n\n\n\nAnyways, that's Heat Signature. Randomized loot, what feels like a personal story each and every time,  and a very intriguing retirement system that I didn't experience with Elvashak. Seems that when your character retires, he goes down as a \"Living Legend\" and can name one of his items. This item can be found by later characters you make and by your Steam friends! Very interested in trying that out.\n\n9/10, would highly recommend.", "timestamp_updated": 1506044181, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506044181, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35359519", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538441", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506816242, "steamid": "76561198035871053", "num_games_owned": 489, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 404}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Let me start with this; Heat Signature is really fun.

Sure, there are incrementally better items, but there is nothing really different. You have seen the entire game, and yet you have a ton of stations left to go.\n\nSo, I don't recomend the game, not because it isn't fun to start, but because the everything after that intial burst of \"Woah, that's cool!\" feels the same.", "timestamp_updated": 1506820320, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506820320, "votes_down": 7}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1031, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "review_score": 9, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 52, "total_reviews": 1083}}
