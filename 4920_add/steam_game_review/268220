Now that I've played it for a while, I think it's awesome!\n\nThe gameplay itself is fun. Though the graphics are un-usual, they are still 3-D and are awesome for the price. One factor that I believe really makes this game more fun is the MUSIC. Awesome dubstep/trap plays in the background, and really fits the fast-pace mood of this game. \n\nThe actually gameplay is mostly focused on fighting, and is awesome. many different levels, and the spawns are always different which makes it more challenging. No matter how many times I lose or rage-quit, I keep coming back to it!
