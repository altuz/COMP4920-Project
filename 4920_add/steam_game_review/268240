It's a platformer, duh. It is moderately fast paced and has elements of Super Meatboy in it (namely that when you die, you gotta start the whole thing over again). I am currently through chapter one and the levels take about 30-60 secs if I get everything (20 levels per chapter it seems). There is not much room for speed runs I think, because there is a \"lovely\" feature in which you are very often hunted by an annoying robot thing that kills you on contact, catches up to you and even explodes periodically and is only lost when passing a gate. Your goal is to just complete the level, as a bonus there are small and big monitors in the levels. I don't know what the small ones give you, but the big ones unlock skins. I completed every level on perfect so far (albeit with some cursing and retrying) and almost got all the skins now, so after that point there is no sense in collecting them anymore (they make the levels harder of course) other than personal accomplishment.\n\nSounds like an ok game, doesn't it, so why the negative review? For starters it gets pretty boring and repetitive. New elements are gradually introduced, but they're not very catchy or game changing. You don't seem to get any abilities, you don't fight, you just weave through the levels and those levels are pretty bland, not to mention the soundtrack which is the same for each level within a chapter...\nMy second problem are the controls. The game feels clunky and unresponsive, sluggish even. Not the best formula when you have to run away from a big bad killer machine. It almost feels like you are floating, you can double jump and wall jump and often it works as you want, but too often it just feels off, hard to explain. For example when you swing on a chain you cannot jump off the chain if it is not at its apex somehow. Either that or the controls are not responding properly. Also holding down the jump button makes you jump continuously (I am the kind of person that wills a jump to go longer if you only hold down the jump button lol, so that cost me a few lives).\n\nI can't say too many bad things about this game though. If you desperately need some sort of platformer and it's on sale, go ahead. If not then there are A LOT of better alternatives. Generic levels, boring sound track, weird controls and a wonky hero with a hitbox the size of an elephant as well as meaningless collecting of stuff within the levels and a constant pressure by being hunted. That is \"mechanic escape\" in a nutshell for me.

Maybe I haven't played the game long enough? But that's tough, it's so plain, repetitive and boring right out of the gate.

How much insufferable \"collect all the things as you jump through a stage\" mechanic do I have to suffer to get through to more content?\n\nWhy is it insufferable?
