Grapple is one of my dream games finally realized.\n\nThe basic mechanics are simple: you are a blob that can attach to the side and underside of platforms, jump, and fire a small string of yourself onto solid objects to grapple and swing past areas where there is no ground to land on. Further mechanics are introduced in the levels themselves, such as red death platforms, ungrapple-able forcefield platforms, white bouncy platforms and pink cannons.\n\nThe quality of the levels rollercoasters up and down--some levels make use of brilliant ideas and flesh out the basic mechanics of the game in fresh and clever ways, while others come off as lazy free-form collections of platforms. There are several weak levels and gimmick mechanics--for example, the invisible platform gimmick (platforms that only become visible when you are close enough), which is not at all interesting or fun and results in three of the worst \"maze\" levels in the game. Later levels fall into the trap of an over-reliance on precision momentum slinging, using long falls, bouncy platforms and cannons. This comes to a head with a level that requires slinging with extreme precision into another cannon, which can require many attempts.\n\nThere is plenty to do: collectibles are used to guide the player through the \"intended\" path of each level and give reasons to return to levels for 100% optimal completion. A time trial mode challenges players to beat individual levels under a predefined par time (which is a useful gauge of performance, since there is no online leaderboard for the game). There is also a speedrun mode that challenges players to beat the game in 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nAs with all games, there are a few quibbles here and there that you should be aware of:\n[list]\n[*] Movement is oriented to the direction of the camera; this can make adjusting to the side and underside of platforms somewhat awkward. It is something to get used to, but could ideally have been done better.\n[*] You cannot seem to remap the controls. Thankfully, the default controls are nothing out of the ordinary, but if you're an old guy and use ESDF or something, you're out of luck here.\n[*] The music is average to mediocre, full of aggressive synths, and can grate after a few hours of play. I found myself eventually turning the music off and listening to the Dustforce soundtrack instead.\n[*] The game seems to have no community to speak of, and the developers do not seem to have reached out to the players much at all. I believe this game could have received more recognition with a more active development team, online leaderboards (which I think would be the most valuable addition for garnering a community), and a level editor to extend the longevity of the game; as it stands Grapple basically hasn't been touched since its March launch.\n[/list]", "timestamp_updated": 1451814249, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451118321, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "14822653", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509586", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1428446876, "steamid": "76561198031177414", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "This is a great little 3D platform puzzle where you play the role of a sticky ball that can grapple.

It looks great and the controls and physics feel great. Unfortunately the thing that really kills it for me is the camera. It follows really close behind the blob and is always dropping behind pieces of geometry and obstructing your view. Movement is also relative to the camera angle, so if you have a really bad viewing angle around the geometry (which was often in my experience) and instinctively try to adjust the camera, then the blob goes veering off into oblivion.\n\nThe gameplay footage in the trailers shows the blob swinging and gliding in these unbroken graceful arcs, but in all the levels I played, I felt like I kept having to stop so that I could move the camera around and actually see where the grapple points were located, because if I swiveled the camera while in motion, I'd veer off in a different direction and fall to my death. And this game has you crawling all over walls like spiderman, so your blob will go over the edge of a wall, and the camera just faceplants into the wall, so you try to correct the camera by swinging it around, but that messes with your movement, and it just makes a mess. I don't know. Maybe if there were some camera options to adjust camera controls or follow distance, but camera options are non-existent.\n\nClearly I'm the minority opinion, but that camera and I just cannot work together.", "timestamp_updated": 1443150172, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443149800, "votes_down": 28}, {"recommendationid": "21726243", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510424", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1457681651, "steamid": "76561198025153641", "num_games_owned": 695, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I really like this game. It's incredibly smooth and fast paced. I find in this game you can be quite flexible in how you reach the goal most times. It's incredibly easy to start picking up and it just feels so good to be good at it. \n\nSomething I really love about this game is that you'll usually be sending yourself in the air for just the right amount of time as to figure out how to position yourself for the next obstacle or jump. \n\nJust a bit of advice too. Try not going for the little point blocks every chance you get. The game is much more fun when you're just flowing through, and the point blocks don't do anything special. Keep them in mind when jumping, but don't ruin your run trying to get them. \n\nAnd if the gameplay doesn't quite click in the first 10 or so minutes, keep at it. Eventually you'll just have it down and be swinging like a pro\n\nThe aesthetics aren't ugly, but nothing amazing. Music is nice too, nothing to stand out from it. No story. It's just a cheaply made very smooth-fast paced platformer, and i appreciate that. \n\nSome people complain about the camera, but I don't think that's all that valid for this game. You're in complete control of the camera and its up to you to position it so you can aim your grapple as well, so using a mouse is probably preferable over a controller. The levels are designed around this. There shouldn't be many times when the camera is working against you (since its all you controlling it), although I admit it can feel very weird navigating the curves/spheres at first, but it's just something you need to get used to for a couple levels. \n\nIt's a great platforming experiance, but offers very little in terms of aesthetics but does rather well for how simple it is. For the price of 2 dollars i got it for, I think it was really worth it.\n\nTL;DR if you like platformers or games where you swing around and junk, you will like this game.
