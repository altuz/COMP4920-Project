Reminds me of the old Soul Blazer trilogy (Soul Blazer, Secret of Gaia, Terranigma) and maybe some Secret of Evermore and Earthbound. Loved the watercolor artwork pan shots (like the coffee scene in Earthbound). The game is not too long, which I actually appreciate. It doesn't overstay it's welcome or make you grind. It took me about 4 hours over a weekend. I picked this up for .99 cents during a sale. Great buy. If you like those other games and get this for a few dollars you'll have fun. Don't expect to have your mind blown I believe this was a small team.
