I'm not really a big fan of tab targeting but I'm not going to be biased and say the combat is bad just because it's not my style, I'm saying I don't like it because it isin't really imersive. You always will do the same combination of spell launch once you get all you spells and you won't change it unless some lvl 99 scrub says that he has a better spell chain. IMO Combat can use some improvement but it's not all bad, the game has a really interesting waif-- partner system. They're like summons which aid you in battle (some of which are women dressed in a well... anime style huehue). ALSO , you can equip two weapons, which is quite nice and quite (quite) original.\n\nStory is as you would expect from an anime MMORPG, personally I found the story OK at best, nothing I haven't seen in the other 86% of games.\n\nCharacters/classes/beta males/waifus/whateveryouwanttocallthem Is something this game does nice, there's your typical guy (or loli) with the 10 ft Greatsword, your Legolas, your Aragon, you get it. But there are some few more classes that separate them from the rest of the MMORPGS that i've played in a while. As you would expect from a Asian rpg, you can customize the hell out of your character with all sorts of accesories (which some of them give boosts which I don't approve of tbh)\n\nEnjoyment, Even though I don't play AK anymore (i left because all my friends stop playing it FeelsBadMan) I really had fun playing it and I do recommend it if you enjoy anime style light hearted MMORPG with tab targeting combat... that being said I do wish they would improve a bit that combat, but overall solid game. \n\nI will give it a solid 7.5/10 on my IGNorance scale.", "timestamp_updated": 1488241471, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488241471, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "30085861", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513253", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504128736, "steamid": "76561198207216895", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 14594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great Anime MMORPG..
