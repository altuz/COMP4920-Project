They doubled down on enemies who break all the rules, like taking 4 actions in a single turn and also get to shoot you every time you shoot at them. So I guess on average 6 actions. No thank you.\n\nThe lost concept is way over emphasized, where you can't walk but 1 turn before you have to stop and shoot a \"horde\" of them. It gets old extremely fast and turns what used to be semi fast missions into 45 minute long reload fests. \n\nThe ticking clock in every mission is very aggrivating and if that isn't enough for you, the entire game has a ticking clock. To have a ticking clock every now and then is fine, but it is every single mission. Again, an over emphasized concept which happens to be one I hate.\n\nThe original xcom is one of my most fond childhood memories and the first xcom firaxis released was a lot of fun and made me excited for what the future of the franchise would be. Now I know that it is 13 levels of RNG, guaranteed wounds or deaths every mission, time limits that keeps me from enjoying the game and prevents me using a play style that I WANT TO USE instead of running everywhere as fast as I can like an idiot because i'm forced to, and my personal favorite enemies that break the rules of the game by getting free actions against every action you take, then getting 4 more as they summon a minion, move, attack then move again to hide. If you designed a set of game rules so poorly that you feel the only way to challenge players is to break them. I don't find that interesting, or fun.\n\nNo thank you.

Overall, the expansion is a great edition to the base game. The Chosen, who are the new boss-type enemies added, are a fantastic edition to the game. Each Chosen is different, requiring players to vary up their strategy against each enemy. As well as this, the ability for them to capture and interrogate soldiers is a solid edition. \n\nAs well as this, the expansion added in three new resistance factions, with a new hero/class type to go along with each faction. Each of the new soldier types are fantastic, with each offering a unique way of playing. Interestingly, it is quite difficult to obtain multiple of a hero unit, for example more than one Templar soldier, which I feel is good decision by the developers. If players were permitted to have a full six-man squad of the new units, I could imagine the balance would go out of wack.\n\nOther cool additions include the bonding system, which allows two soldiers to form a bond, giving them access to special abilities that include an ability to both fire at a target within the same action, or given a bond-mate a free action point. The covert action system is also pretty neat, allowing the player to send soldiers out on missions, with a wide variety of potential rewards. During these actions, there is a potential for a soldier to be injured or captured, which forces the player to weigh the potential risks and rewards of a cover action. Lastly, the new enemy type, the lost, as well as missions associated to them are a good change of pace to the standard mission types. \n\nAnother feature added that I loved was the propaganda feature, which allows players to create unique posters of their soldiers, which can later show up in missions. Whilst the options can be somewhat limited in certain areas, overall, the mechanic is amazing. \n\nLastly, the new maps and areas added in are neat. In the base game, a lot of the locations could feel repetitive after a while. Whilst the maps were random, the environment was very similar. The new areas added in, like subways and sewer tunnels, add a spice of variety, which always helps. \nThe only negative thing I want to share is regarding the story with the templars. Without going into spoilers, it feels clear to me that a decent amount of effort was put into the story between the Skirmishers and the Reapers. But the Templars feel kind of just slid in. \n\nOverall though, I enjoyed the expansion. The amount of content added in is staggering, with the vast majority of that content being a joy to play. \n\nTL;DR - The expansion is a fantastic addition to the base game, and well worth the price.", "timestamp_updated": 1506253062, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506253017, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34979993", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503338", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506859520, "steamid": "76561198031256739", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 26603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3011}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Mod it.
