I've played some of their Deponia games, and didn't like them (for many of the same reasons as I didn't like this one). \n\nThey have the love of the genre - that is clear and laudable - but they don't have the ability to do what makes it a great genre in the right hands, f.ex. what Ron Gilbert did with Thimbleweed Park, or what Wadjet Eye games manages to do. I can't stand some of the clonkyiness of the puzzles in Daedalic games. Poorly executed puzzles, some puzzles too complex in the wrong ways, and dialogue feels dull and not entertaining. Not to mention, in this particular game, the voice actor of the main protagonist has a very grating lispy voice that doesn't give me anything.

Long story short, I can't. Although the game is well made, the story is lackluster and most of the characters are difficult for me to like; especially the protagonist, Sadwick. I understand what it's like to be depressed and stuff, but Sadwick is a straight up edgelord supreme. I decided to stop playing after Chapter 2 because I couldn't tolerate him, his attitude, and his godawful nasally voice. I honestly can't believe I lasted a little more than 4 hours putting up with him. \n\nI almost forgot to to talk about the only character I liked, Spot. He's loyal, lovable, and adorable.

The protagonist, Sadwick, is super annoying. His voice, the things he says, his corpselike skin...

All I know is, I couldn't stand to go on playing.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of dialogue, which is basically a good thing, if it's entertaining.

This game breaks down in the gameplay by containing my biggest PCA pet-peeve: puzzles that make no sense. \n\nThis is the type of PCA where you have to try everything in your inventory on every action spot because there are many times where there is simply no way you\u2019d ever think about using that item in that way. To add to the frustration, the game designers knew they were being ridiculous and even have the protagonist make a comment about it in Chapter 2.\n\nAs some reviewers have pointed out, the gameplay does improve in the last 2 chapters, but by then I was so frustrated that I had all but stopped even trying to figure things out on my own. As a bonus, there\u2019s a glitch in Chapter 3 where clicking on a highlighted spot doesn\u2019t work, instead you have to click the space between 2 spots. \n\nIt is also annoying that some characters have long dialogues that you have to wade through every time you talk to them (looking at you, rock brothers). You can click to skip, but then are likely to accidentally click on a dialogue option you don\u2019t want, sometimes closing the dialogue menu and being forced to start all over again.\n\nThere are a couple of positives. I loved the art style and the story is pretty engaging (although I didn\u2019t care for the ending). Those 2 things, however, are not enough to make up for the frustrating gameplay. \n\nI do not understand how the reviews for this game are mostly positive.
