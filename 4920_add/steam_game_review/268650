I may have 500+ hours of play time but i still cant build anything very large. Mosly because of the limitations of my potato XD. Also how do people make hovers so stable?!?!? Also if you havent seen any recent gameplay the video above is over a year old so some things are different.\n\nThis was the game i was looking before which had both building and combat using your creations. It also has a lot of customization that allows you to make all sorts of abominations. You can build any creation for a specific niche like tanky ships, quick fragile planes or even a gigantic satillite with an incredibly powerful laser with a Khorne simbol on top (if you're willing to pour hours into creating). Seeing my creations function the way I want it can feel so satisfying. It's also cool that you can capture enemy ships and make tham yours and even build apon them. There's also co-op!\n\nHere are some downside though. For starters it is a quite complex game so building like a master may take some time. Also this game is not really for lower end computers like mine but if you are willing to put up with the lag then go ahead. Huh... I dont have any other bad thing to put down. Oh wait, building at least decent crafts can take a while to build to build meaning building a massive juggernaught (only in the regular Neter Campaign)requires your whole weekind or more. but seeing your craft function properly can feel so rewarding especially when it stomps on your enemies.\n\nI recommend it to those who love building with a lot of custimization and time on their hands. As well as not rage quiting when your craft doesnt work right or gets hammered by the enemy.", "timestamp_updated": 1506044884, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506044884, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35443060", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506932016, "steamid": "76561198060502339", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 95186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 988}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Its like Minecraft but actually fun", "timestamp_updated": 1507031424, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507031424, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35251079", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500147", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507073900, "steamid": "76561198144453404", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 18281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4167}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fantastic game, for an alphe.\n\n      It is a very thorough game, with some of the best aspects of creation I have encountered. You can spend hours screwing around in the designer, or in the campaign.  The campaign may barely have a storyline, but there isn't a complete lack of purpose in it. If you aren't feeling competetive, you can just go to the designer, and make a pretty boat, or a 7 barrel 200cm gun. Whatever you may wish.\n      Be that as it may, the game is not flawless. It is still early access, so there are still a number of glitches that make the game difficult to play, and you may want to stop completely. I've come to this point, but I just kept playing and found that it was actually worth it.\n     The main area of poor gameplay is multiplayer. This is because the multiplayer is very young, and undeveloped. This means solely that you must be patient. The result is definitely going to be worth it. Even with the half broken multiplayer, the difficulty is surpassed by all of the fun you may encounter when cooperating, or communicating with somene while you shred their fleet.\n    All in all, I am fantastically excited for the future, as for the amount of development time that was put into this, you get so much, and later, I cannot imagine how much better the game will become.", "timestamp_updated": 1506554561, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506554561, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35478547", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507148368, "steamid": "76561198057121166", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3065}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "- Buy the game\n- Spend 50 hours building and fine-tuning your battleship\n- Crush your enemies with it\n- Drive in the next quadrant\n- Get crushed by a new enemy design\n- Goto step 2 again\n\nTotally worth it! \n\nIf you are scared of the steep learning curve in building your vehicles, you can use pre-build vehicles from the workshop or from the game, and also there's a ton of prefab stuff (engines, gun turrets, missile racks etc.), which you can put on your own constructs without worrying too much.\nAlthough building is half of the fun...", "timestamp_updated": 1507144030, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507144030, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35116055", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506750184, "steamid": "76561198177953903", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 95}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Very good game, I suggest gamers with a lot of time would benefit from this as it takes time to learn the in's and out's of this game.
