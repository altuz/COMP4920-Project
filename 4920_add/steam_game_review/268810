It explains the uncanny valley character models, the really lackluster voice acting, and why there were so many characters. I was so confused by the huge cast, unable to really keep them apart. \n\nThis also explains why each time you open the game, there's a cut scene that you have to skip rather than it taking you to the main menu right away where it explains who Ryan Buell is. \n\nDespite the hilarity of how far into the uncanny valley this game can go and some absolute fails in emoting, I didn't enjoy the game. Originally, it felt like the puzzles were clever enough and practical enough, but I began to feel like it was a slog. If the game had been half the length, I probably would have loved it and shouted its praises to the world. But as we got further in, I disliked the protagonists more, I disliked the story more, and trying to pick out objects in all these dimly lit backgrounds was beginning to give me a headache. \n\nBuy when it's on sale. I paid 3 bucks for it which sounded about right. If I had paid full price, I would have been really frustrated.", "timestamp_updated": 1504984947, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504984915, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 46, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 15, "total_reviews": 61}}
