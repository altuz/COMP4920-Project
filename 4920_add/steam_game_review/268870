I love cyberpunk. This is the perfect spiritual successor to SW! Hate the ending though. I loved everything about the game except sometimes the positioning of the agents glitch and they end up getting stuck in the walls, stairs, debris.\n\nI really enjoyed coordinating an awesome attack and strategy. There's so much depth. I don't get why some people don't get it. It's really cool at later stages where you can go into bullet time, and make the agents pull off some Matrix style mayhem with a combo of silent attacks, sword chop, mind control, drone hacks and good old assault rifle. The art style is awesome - reminds me of blade runner the game. The music is bad ass. Missions get tougher and tougher but do-able. There's so many ways to approach the problem. Lots of replay ability. After finishing he game you get bullet time for free instead of upgrading it (reflexes).\n\nThis game is so true to cyber punk lore it's astounding - if you like everything from Neuromancer to Deus Ex HR.\n\nFor all its flaws and glitches it's one of my favourite games. It's amazing that a team so small pulled of something so awesome.", "timestamp_updated": 1506775253, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506179207, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35322180", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503098", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504559133, "steamid": "76561197970789204", "num_games_owned": 509, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A solid decendent of Syndicate, complete with vaguely-communicated mechanics that you figure out inconsistently through random accidents, with awesome Blade Runner graphics and lots of ways to spec out your team.  Mostly bug-free (sometimes, rarely, your character will get stuck in geometry; it is possible to get weird or missing mission log text).  No hand-holding.  People get confused by this game, but if anyone thinks the game is too hard, read my guide at the end here.  The combat and infiltration mechanics are pretty awesome when you figure them out, and the game is pretty imbalanced if you wanna min-max your team.  Being able to see the electrical grid and use it to disable things was cool. Figuring out how to overcome or bypass infinitely-spawning mechs and hoards of elite mobs with shields and heavy weapons was satisfying even if it's OP.  Despite what some reviewers say, stealth is absolutely viable and even OP.. once you develop your team to use it.  The weapons you choose don't really matter but I give strong preference for ones that are silenced, which is most of them if you acquire the right gun mods. \n\nHere is a simple OP guide for building your team to handle any situation by giving you multiple ways to escape or defeat any combat roadblock.  This is legitimately imbalanced so also definitely SPOILERS.  Note that each of these requires you to level up your characters to support it, or to spend the time to research and deploy the appropriate supporting mods, items, and weapons.\n\n1) ALWAYS research and carry Grenades and deployable Ammo Packs.  Do this as soon as possible.  Ammo Packs replenish Grenades.  Two people with Ammo Packs replenish eachother's Ammo Packs.  Infinite Grenades makes you into an artillery squad.  Enemies are infinitely respawning, so there are diminishing returns to engaging in war, so make sure you at least can win.  Infinite grenades blow up infinitely respawning enemies forever until you get bored of it.  They also are absurdly effective against every door and turret and sentry gun and mech and generator in the game.  Brokely OP.\n\nSecondary Good Ideas:\n\n2) ALWAYS research and install character mods to support moving through vents.  No enemy in the game can use vents.  It is OP and guarantees disengagement from the current combat.\n3) ALWAYS research and carry cloaking items.  You can walk right through any enemy in the game and it usually guarantees escape.\n4) ALWAYS buff your character's energy regeneration.  Most of the special abilities in the game rely on it.  \n5) ALWAYS research and carry silenced weapons.  Taking out cameras will still trigger a suspicious investigation, but it makes it substantially easier to dissect your way through any fortification.\n6) ALWAYS research and carry at least one Smoke Grenade.  Enemies shooting you at point blank range cannot target you in a cloud and guarantees disengagement from combat, at least for a few seconds.  Pop a Smoke and press Cloak and walk away from giant mechs and dozens of assorted assailants.  \n7) ALWAYS buff the class ability that slows down time.  Only one of your characters gets it, but it is the most useful character ability in the game.  Buffing energy regeneration is critical to supporting this ability.\n8) If you want to level up your characters faster, unlock grenades and ammo packs as soon as possible.  Go stand near any enemy spawn point and mortar the crap out of them for an hour or so.  Character XP is specific to who gets a kill, so give whichever characters you want to level up a Grenade so they can rack them up.'", "timestamp_updated": 1506745015, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506744523, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34762476", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495747", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504636722, "steamid": "76561197996174884", "num_games_owned": 476, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I hate this game. It has brought out a rage in me that few other games can. The pathfinding is some of the worst I've ever seen, they run into enemy territories or straight into closed doors and just stand there doing nothing. The Enemy AI is so idiotic that you can lose them by walking through a door and just standing on the otherside. The game has a few possibly game breaking glitches that trap you into lead pipes or other objects that you can walk into but not ever escape and if you happen to find your whole party trapped and no enemies patrol around where they are .. well you get to start everything you did up to that point again (you cant same in enemy territories and this tends to happen in those.) The AI is constantly moving out of cover to stand right in the middle of enemy gun fire and refuse to fire on the enemy that is pistol wipping him just taking it like a champ. And to add onto the fustration caused by the idiotic AI the lazy devs put seemingly no time into, you cant pause action .. so im constantly struggling to get my guys to stay in $##$#$ cover ! while having to tell them what of the 10 enemies that are firing at us i want them to shoot at ... couldnt you at least put some sort of defend yourself action in the god dame game ! or at least make it so they dont run into the bullets ! I hate this game while wanting to love it ... i kept trying to get into it .. again and again i would try and find that each time i have to quit before i punch a hole in my wall. You ... should have shown more respect to the world you made ... but how this game is and knowing it will never change ... all i can say is you ruined this game by slacking off on the AI and refusing to add basic things like a pause time feature (and the ablity doesnt count when i need to use that same dude as my healer and it drains his energy rapidly)", "timestamp_updated": 1504637499, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504637499, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "34907625", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495033", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505250332, "steamid": "76561198107644436", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "not optimized at all\nplenty of bugs", "timestamp_updated": 1505246344, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505246319, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 806, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 250, "total_reviews": 1056}}
