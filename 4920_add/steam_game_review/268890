A seizure warning would have been nice developers. Once I got past that, I started the game as the good ol' USA, and was overwhelmed by the amount of options you had (as you should be, you are the leader of a large industrialized country). However, I wasn't new to this sort of game where many options are presented and you have to strategically choose many options at once (...you know... like a strategy game/simulator...). But this game lacked a proper tutorial on how to teach you everything. It basically only introduces you to your country, your department heads, and off you go. No gameplay mechanics. You have to figure everything out for yourself. And believe me - it's a BEAR figuring things out for yourself. This seem like it would be a great game if it had proper tutorials, more interactive gameplay sliders, maybe hot-keys or something where you don't have to navigate through 5 different menus to adjust the tax on tobacco. But unfortunately, it isn't. What you're left with is menu after menu of nothing but sliders and policy options that are hard to find, and even when you do propose policies, they often get denied by congress. This is a waste of money. Don't buy it. Luckily I bought it discounted on the Steam summer sale. 15/100. A for effort.
