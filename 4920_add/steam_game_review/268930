This is a throwback game to the days of yesteryear. However there are things that are deeper here and things that are more shallow. The deepness lies in the vastness of the world. There are literally thousands of dungeons in this world. The shallowness is the lack of creature variety and no actual RPG interaction. But this is More in line with games like Eye of the Beholder, Legends of Grimrock, Fall of the Dungeon Gaurdians and the always ephereal grimoire. The difference is it is free roam. Now that can be a good or a bad thing. Free Roam is great but you might wonder into a tomb where you are seriuosly out matched. You play as a single character, which I usually don't like in an RPG, (combat rpg or real rpg) and take various quest to gain prestige, power, and ability to purchase greater goodies. The quest are shallow, really just go find this dungeon, which is not easy in this vast world, kill certain amount of x creatures or the big bad boss. Not anything that hasn't been done a zillion times. But it is done differently than the games of old. Of course you still attack monsters wth a few different attacks, weapons, or skills but the magic system is based on Gems. Power gems have different levels and different colored gems are for different spells....fire, frost, healing, slowing...you know the deal.  You also have two Gems on your HUD. Now these are warning gems and have nothing to do with the spells. One gem lights up when monsters are near, simulating what would be sound and smell, the other lights up because of your dungeon intuition, something is near...could be treasure...yay! or it could be a trap...booo! I need to mention now there are ways to check for traps, and you better do it cause these aint the prick your finger kinda traps. These traps were meant to kill aspiring heroes.......   So some specifics....\nVisuals...uhmm..no, not its strong point\nsound and music....decent no better.\nautomapping in dungeons...yes praise be...you need it\nsecrets areas...check\nvastness...uncomprehendable really\ngameplay...repetitive but fun, or frustrating depending on how your adventure is going.\nOh, you know how in some games you can run back to the entrance and escape disaster? This may or may not work here as monsters will follow you outside. And I already said it was a blobber so one increment at a time movements. There are obstacles out side and the creatures very often cut you off ruining your day.\nLots of treasure and stuff? nope. I forgot to mention this is more a 3-d rogue like. Its designed to be tough.\nNow I kow none of these description are particularly wowing so you may ask why I recommend this game?\nIts one of those games you play to give your mind a break. Couple hours here. Couple hours there.\nIn small chunks it will hold your interest. \nNow I wont call it relaxing completely because there are plenty of \"Oh Crap!\" moments you experience.\nWho might like this game? Old school rpg'ers. Casual adventurers, gamers that love step rpg's.\nWho will not like this game? Console converts, graphics junkies and people who hate to have their avatars die.\nYou will die my friends...oh but how you will die.\nOh one last thing. This game has been in development for a LONG time. Not 23 years Grimoire long but still a long time.\nThe difference between those two games is that this is an entirely finished game. Why early access? The dev is always updating,albeit very slowly, unlike the afore mentioned game that has not had anything more than ademo released since 2004.\nCheers.", "timestamp_updated": 1499652387, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499652387, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34705616", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1400791974, "steamid": "76561197991157647", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I really couldn't get into this game. I really really tried. I know this is going to be unfair because it is listed as 'early access' but it's been in early access for 3 years and feels really barebone to me. These are all my opinions but I could not play past 1.5 hours because I got REALLY bored. In fact, the screenshots really make the game seem cooler than it really is because the world and moving around in the world was uninteresting. I can't put into words why but I did not feel really compelled to explore. When I died I did not really feel compelled to jump back into it and try exploring elsewhere.\n\nMaybe my expectations were wrong and my judgement is unreasonable as a result of it.
