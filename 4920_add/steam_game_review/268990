But when I actually got into the game, it became so much fun. It only took me about 5 hours to complete, but there is so much more you can do in the game it's not even a problem. There is actually two characters to pick from when you're doing story mode, each one with a different story. There is even other gamemodes like arcade. It took me 5 hours to complete only 1 character, so you could really do a lot of grinding in this game if you would like, because there is more than enough content. My only real problem is co-op is very glitchy and messes up sometimes and you have to restart the level, which gets pretty annoying. But other than that, it really is a great game and 100% worth the $10.", "timestamp_updated": 1505703632, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505009437, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35196271", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502126", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506401847, "steamid": "76561198268051184", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 429}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I loved Salt and Sanctuary and that\u2019s why I bought this game. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely different, but I love it. \n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s a beat em up Salt and Sanctuary with a good story.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_updated": 1506314069, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506314069, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 112, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 116}}
