Draw a box in the sky, let it fall onto one side of the ball, and thanks to physics, the ball will be pushed in the opposite direction. Draw a bigger box and it'll be heavier. Or maybe attach a rectangle to a pivot point, and let it swing down to knock the ball like a golf club. And then watch as the ball runs up ramps that you've set up beforehand, or crosses your drawn bridge, or busts through obstacles to reach the goal. \n\nExcept the \"Physics\" in Crayon Physics don't always work the way you anticipate. And a lot of times, you are setting up weird contraptions in such a limited space that you feel like you are cheating your way to a real solution when it works just slightly differently than the 19 previous tries in the way you wanted. Like other physics-based puzzle games, there is oftentimes just frequent reconstruction of a valid approach because physics decided not to be kind.\n\nCrayon Physics is a fun game, but download the demo first to see how much you'll be fighting the physics engine. When it works, it's pretty fun and makes you feel smart. When it doesn't... well... it just feels cheap.
