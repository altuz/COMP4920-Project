It was. It was relaxingly beautiful, and that was the most dangerous part of it. It is creepy, suspenseful, and absolutely breathtaking. The story is lovely and the lore is wonderfully input. I feel like I have woken from a dream, and I honestly don't want to wake up. The hints are very helpful without completely giving away the game and objectives, and are pleasing to read.

It has a nice art style and interesting Scandinavian folk lores. However, the rich background information is not properly integrated into the game play, but only described in the encyclopedia. Even taking the true end into consideration, the story is very short and quite bare-boned. The game system is not very responsive and thus some of the operations required in the game become annoying. The biggest problem of this game in my opionin is that the game play feels boring, all the puzzles are uninspired and some are unlogical, requiring either simply writing down everything you encountered during walking around or proceeding by trials and errors.\nOnly recommended for light point-and-click adventure players or walking simulator lovers when discounted.", "timestamp_updated": 1499592758, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499592758, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "33583025", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500155669, "steamid": "76561198061655952", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Beautiful visuals with a very enjoyable style that really fits the mood of the game. Music fits in the mood as well, with a good mix in ambiance and more suggestive background music. \n\nGameplay wise, there's small improvements that could be made. In the dialog part (even tho there is very little) its quite annoying to know when you have to press in order to cycle dialog. I would also prefer the possiblity to use the up and down arrow keys to move back and forward instead of having to use the mouse to click it, as it is much less intuitive in my opinion. \n\nLove the mood and stye of this game. Also enjoy the fact that it is inspired by real folklore, which makes the content more grounded in reality compared to if it would be all ficiton! \n\nIt's a short game, but definately a must buy for a cozy (and quite creepy) saturday evening/night!", "timestamp_updated": 1500205516, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500205516, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34740662", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500128", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504548318, "steamid": "76561198134565642", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "While I enjoy most things mythology-related, I cannot recommend this game.

Many people enjoyed the puzzles, some even called them too easy. Personally, I found them cryptic, obtuse and very much incomprehensible without using a walkthrough.
