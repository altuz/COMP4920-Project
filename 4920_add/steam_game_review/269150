And there are technically 12 levels, but they differ from each other in ways that are mostly cosmetic.  In all of them, gameplay isn't skill-based but patience-based: you do best if you go very very slowly, although as long as you don't go [i]too[/i] fast, the game will allow you to finish the level.  It's hard to justify the game's price on account of its gameplay, though.\n\nAs an [b]interactive art exhibit[/b], it's a neat conceptualization of either the female org[i]a[/i]sm or the psychedelic experience, and it's totally worth a few moments of your time.  There's some psychedelic music and cute little animations that wouldn't have been out of place in the Beatles [i]Yellow Submarine[/i] movie.  You probably haven't played anything quite like this before.  I could imagine some people finding the experience very relaxing\u2014 I didn't, but that was just because neither the keyboard + mouse nor the controller interface felt quite right to me.  It would probably be enjoyable to experience in VR or on some kind of really heavy drugs.\n\nWhat it would be really great at would be an [b]Audiosurf-style procedural-level game[/b].  Because playing a Shpongle track that sync'd to one of these these flower tunnels would be [i]deeeecent[/i].  Sadly, the developers did not see fit to code in this functionality.\n\nIt's a really cool idea, executed with some finesse.  It's probably good for an hour's entertainment, once.  If you can justify throwing down the necessary ducats for that much playtime, you could do worse.\n\n[b]EDIT:[/b] it is obscene that Steam's language filter flags \"org[i]a[/i]sm.\"  That is some serious grade-A Puritanical nonsense, GabeN.", "timestamp_updated": 1498594581, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498527899, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 38, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 43}}
