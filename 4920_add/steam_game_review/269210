That's how I feel right now while writing this review.\n\nThe game is extremely unbalanced:\n\nRecently in 2.0.0.4 (2 days ago) They scaled elite monsters up by a lot, the speed they now have they're basically right alongside you and there is a specific mod on the elite with \"Reflect\" however it's not like a reflect where you deal damage and take reflect damage it shoots out projectiles instead. \n\nThose projectiles will catch you off guard 99% of the time and you will die. You might be thinking \"Well you're only dying, it's not permadeath on softcore\" I agree to that, however the reasoning is simple:\n\nAt level 150 you enter wormholes. Wormholes are opened by using a key that you either get from act-bosses, uber damien, or buying them for 250k coins each. \n\nThese wormholes are 1-use only so if you die, that's a 250k loss and a lot of time lost whereas if the game was more balanced you would feel some sort of progress you didn't. \n\nThe end-game consists of rinse repeating wormholes and it's a never-ending thing (which the developers are pushing to change) because some people are in wormhole 40-70k while me for an example I am only in WH200.\n\nBasically it's like an indie diablo 3 right to the core. \n\nI personally would love the game if the developers take serious notes about balance and how crucial it is to have a balanced game rather than an unbalanced one that it is now.\n\nFor the time being I will certainly not recommend the game to anyone. \n\nAlso to mention that the moderators abuse their powers on the discord server, after me questioning why path of exile is superior to diablo 3 because he couldn't justify a reason as to why he thought diablo 3 was better he thought \"I'm toxic\" lets ban him. \n\nI've got massive experience in both games and the arpg genre as a whole and to hear someone trash talk a game they most likely haven't played before really burns me.\n\nBut yeah I'm getting carried away.\n\nTL:DR\nDon't buy unless you like getting 1-shot all day long", "timestamp_updated": 1506699089, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506699089, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35039407", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506767672, "steamid": "76561198119779922", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "this game is pretty fun when playing with friends.", "timestamp_updated": 1505712391, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505712391, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34992211", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501347", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505307998, "steamid": "76561198052400812", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "bought this on sale. thought it looked cool. \n\n\n-think pixel version of diablo\n\n-item quest craziness. you just keep getting more and more things, but they all basically suck. the fun is supposed to be in this mechanic. think borderlands. this isn't fun to me. \n\n-Game is full of microtransactions. arguably p2w\n\n-boring to play alone. \n\n-meant to be intense fights with crazy shit going on. but isnt intense. \n\n-pay to use other classes. \n\n\nJust not worth investing time. not fun solo. maybe fun with friends. idk.

Melee classes stand literally, and I mean literally, 0% chance in the end game due to acid pools and bleed stacks.
