As a visual novel, especially a \"kinetic novel\" with no choices, it's mainly about the story. And, let me say, the story is a damned 15/10. Regarding other technical aspects (sound, graphics) the first episode is a bit lacking, but this improves in the second and especially the third episodes. The three episodes are kind of separate, there is a four year gap between each, but they explain everything well, and the last one is a nice conclusion to the story and leaves no loose ends. \n\nGetting a bit on the story, it's mainly about economics. I didn't know much about this so I had to use wikipedia/investopedia quite a bit, especially at the beginning and during the third episode, which is quite heavy on this. Even if I didn't have any previous interest on the topic, I do think I'm more interested in the dinance world now, so the story does a great job here.\n\nIn short, I think that as a VN it should be judged on the story and you can't get much better than this.

Keep in mind it's purely reading with some images, there is no interactive component. (i.e. you don't change the story in any way)\n\nI can understand some of the criticisms: the main character seems annoying and immature. Yes, that's right. That's part of what the story is about.  You see how characters change over time and how things affect them. The subtitles DO have some errors, but not that many, and not really a problem to me. The main thing I missed would be more graphic images. As some have noted, there are scenes where the screen is just black, because no image was ever made for it. It would be nice to have new artwork in those scenes instead! Also some common scenes are just re-used dozens of times. But, that's OK, think of it as reading a book, that has an occasional image printed (this used to be common back in the days of those printed book things). By the way, as you'll see, \"printed book things\" are actually a major component of the story.\n\nI would recommend this if you know what you are getting in to. Because of the minor issues noted above, I'd rate it at 4 / 5.\n\nNote that I've only done this first episode, but after spending the time and getting to know the environment and characters, I plan to buy the next chapters to see what happens...", "timestamp_updated": 1500826826, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500826826, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33821848", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499662", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506891199, "steamid": "76561198055190702", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First I should make this clear. I'm a huge fan of the Spice and Wolf series, made by Isuna Hasekura. I own every single SeW novel and I absolutely love them, so I was excited to see a Visual Novel written by her.\n\nAnd yet, I was completely dissapointed.\nAs many have already mentioned, it's amateurish. Almost no images, lots of black screens, repetitive music that loops awkwardly every minute..\n\nHowever, even with those problems, I was kinda enjoying the novel. That is, until the ending.\n\nThis is the single worst ending I've seen in a Visual Novel EVER.\nAnd yes, I do know that there's episode 2 and 3 after this one, but the ending was so damn bad I can't bother with them.\n\nI really can't get into details in order not to spoil it for people who want to read this, but to keep it spoilerless, I will only say that the novel that is overall light takes a full 180\u00ba, introducing some.. \"conflicts\"... at the last minutes and keeping eveything open in the end, with no sense of closure AT ALL.\n\nEven though it's just the first chapter, you can't just stop a chapter in the middle of nowhere and call it an ending.\n\n(Before anyone talk about my playtime, even when I was with the game open, it didn't show that I was playing it, and it didn't recorded the playtime either, for some reason)", "timestamp_updated": 1501119704, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501119704, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 225, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 34, "total_reviews": 259}}
