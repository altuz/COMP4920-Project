I finished it in about 2-2.5 hours, and that was with some futzing around trying to solve puzzles. If the length of the game is enough to deter you, then I'd let this one pass. Otherwise, read on...\n\nThe game is a platforming puzzle game that mimics the artwork and feel of Teslagrad, Vessel, and Limbo, but with the mechanics of something like Braid. You are an old man who wakes up in a strange place and need to figure out where you are. He discovers his lost timepiece and with it, the ability to control time. You use the device to travel between past and future, altering the world in ways that allow you to overcome puzzles and advance to new areas. You can interact with certain objects in the environment, carry them with you between worlds, and use them in the past to influence the future, etc.\nThis is inherently the difficulty in the game: figuring out how to manipulate the past to affect the future, etc.\n\nAbout a third of the way in, you meet a snail companion, who also has an uncanny ability; he can stop time. Together, you must use your powers to help the other succeed.\n\nThe puzzles are clever and challenging, but nothing that will keep you too stumped. The platforming is ok, and sometimes it's a bit frustrating, but it's nothing that's too unforgiving or would make you want to put it down.\n\nThe music is pretty good and fits well with the game ambience.\n\nIf you don't mind a short game that's more pleasing with the visuals and music, then this one is worth a go. I might suggest waiting for the price to come down, but <$10 isn't too bad.", "timestamp_updated": 1400026602, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1400026602, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "10097152", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502918", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1399941360, "steamid": "76561197989487702", "num_games_owned": 956, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A nice game with overall good puzzles thats definitely much too short for my taste.

An expertly crafted platformer, the game boasts a beautiful art style to complement its sharp gameplay. The story is simple, but effective. An unnamed, elderly inventor is determined to find his shady mentor after one of the pair's contraptions causes apocalyptic destruction. Along the way, the inventor encounters a friendly snail with the ability to freeze time. Combined with the old man's penchant for traveling from past to present, the slimy companion introduces a unique gameplay structure.\n     The player alternates between the two characters in order to solve brilliantly designed puzzles oriented around manipulating time in order to alter the landscape and circumvent obstacles. The snail's shell serves as a movable platform that can be used to cross gaps, sawblades can be halted in mid-air, and impassible walls in the past become ruined structures in the present. Switching time periods in the middle of a jump can turn certain doom into a saving ledge or platform. These basic mechanis build and combine in interesting and challenging ways as the levles progress. One particularly creative head scratcher involves multiple time switches, an anvil, and flaming cannonballs, all to simply open a door. \n     The game's visual design is superb. Colorful character models and environments seem to pop off the screen. The bright wimsy of \"before\" transforms into the dark, dilapidated melancholy of \"after.\" The contrast underscores the narrative's focus on regret and the consequences of terrible decisions. Puzzle construction also reinforces this relationship. In one of the game's shining moments, a decision made concerning a young child in the past has subtly profound implications in the present. \n     While the time spent in \"Chronology's\" world is welcome, it does not last forever. The entire experience can be completed in around 2.5-3 hours, leaving the player with a distinct-- and regrettably brief--brush with greatness. Osao Games should be commended for this effort, a game that merges artistic integrity and ambition with incredibly enjoyable platforming mechanics. Warning: \"Chronolology\" also contains blatant disregard for the laws of the space-time continuum. \n     Score: 9/10\n       \n", "timestamp_updated": 1400114136, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1400114136, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "10545448", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1408597082, "steamid": "76561198132860179", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I absolutley enjoyed this game!
