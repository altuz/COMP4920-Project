The first vehicles are kinda slow, and it's difficult at first to make money, or buy any cool gear. Then you get the buggy.. That's when the game goes bad;\n\nYou can fly so high, your car will bump into the sky and fall down. Or hit a pylon at the wrong angle, and your flying off.. in the opposite direction you where going. It becomes basically a surfer game.. with a car.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad, but the physics haven't been fixed. So it's easy to accidently fly off the course track. Unlike the AI, you do not get a respawn. Instead. You hit escape to see the menu, and quit the game at last place. My other gripes are the following;\n-No Multiplayer\n-Not enough tracks (You do 3 different tracks that I know of.. that are inverted, or slightly changed to make the 16 race challenge)\n-Not enough vehicles/weapons\n-Expensive for a 2 hour game.\n-Some aspects of game not balanced (Lv 3 Nitro = Insta Win, Lv 5 Shotgun = Insta Kill, Mines are tough at lower level, but once your in the dune buggy.. completely underpowered.. useless!)\n\nSuggestion to customers;\nA game called \"RC Cars\" is alot more developed, and was kind of what I was expecting when I purchased this game.. Might be better to try that out before playing this game.\n\nSuggestion to devs;\nTake a look at the Road Rash series with how they did upgrades, included plot lines, actual characters with weapons midgame. (Reboot Title: \"Road Redemption\")\nAnother one is called Skithin, which was similarly pretty awesome game to play. (Had a storyline as well.)\nThe last one that was pretty cool, was called Renegade Ops. They used voice overs, and comic stills to create the storyline between each mission.", "timestamp_updated": 1396346788, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1396346788, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "19258301", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518992", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1448232069, "steamid": "76561197971039476", "num_games_owned": 2474, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Phew Burning Cars...I play alot of games throughout a year and sometimes i'm finding some beautiful overlooked gems amongs all the games out there...Burning Cars is NOT one of those...This game is a serious contender to the number one spot of my most hated game 2015...This game is ridiculous, frusterating and awful in every way...Thank god there is ONLY 16 tracks in this...Now this would normally not be a good thing but in this game it IS a good thing...Everything is awful in this game...It's so boring that i sleeped through 8 of the tracks and the other 8 i ate my keyboard in frustration, the graphic cut my eyes to pieces and absolutly NOTHING is fun in this game...there are only 2 freaky cars in this game!? A truck and a Buggy...I mean come on? And worst part is...There is a EASY and HARD mode...Fine i started with the hard mode and discovered a very strange thing...Apparently The developers haven't heard that cars can actually turn...This shi t can't be for real!?...I was litterly going 5 kmh through corners and STILL i had to reverse the car and SQUEEZE the car though a corner and THEN hit the wall...My waterbottle have not flown so many times around my livingroom EVER!...I was *F*R*U*S*T*R*A*T*E*D* to the limit...I was finally through the HARD mode with the last of my sanity and saw to my horror i had to do the whole thing in EASY mode...EASY mode was really EASY mode for one f ucking reason...The cars could TURN!? So the developers has chosen that the different between HARD and EASY mode should be that the cars can't turn in HARD mode???....WTF!? I mean WTF!?!\nWith all this said...Yeah you can upgrade your 2 cars...Weapons, armor, nitro etc. but these things dosen't do jack for the game and it's funess (is that a word?)...This game stinks in every aspect and it's so boring...The 16 tracks is in the same place just add a few more corners and nothing else.\nPlease people...DO NOT BUY AT ANY PRICE...To be perfectly honest, do not gift the game to anyone and if it's gifted to you delete it from your inventory.\n\nMy Judgement: 1/10\n\nPeace out Peeps!\n", "timestamp_updated": 1448409790, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448409790, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "11401424", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507247", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1406220499, "steamid": "76561198074771734", "num_games_owned": 2363, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of the worst games I've ever played.

However (and this is a BIG however) On hard (as there are only two dificulty levels) The game become pretty much unplayable. The games so-called realistic car physics make the game unplayable. Steering is lousy and unresposive at the best of times and this becomes more of a problem given that your vehicle gets hung up on every sudden change in the course. If you get turned around (and you will be a lot) You'll most likely of lost whatwver lead you had by the time you start to face the right direction.\n  I actually had to drive backwards for 3/4 of a lap just to come in 3rd. If you get knocked off the track (durring a pile up on a corner most of the time) you wont be able to get back on it. and killing yourself with your own mines won't help either. you can drive until you fall off the map entirly (which wont kill you by the way) the only way to get back to the game is to quit. There is no retry on hard so you'll automatically get 4th for that race.
