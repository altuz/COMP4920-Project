I've tried every major freeware video player on the market, all of which are useable, none of which are as customizable or feature rich as Zoom Player. I have a lot of old and new video I play using this program, so I have a lot of hours on record on Steam but probably 10x the amount of hours on the freeware, so I figured it was about time I help support the developers and buy the full version here on steam. \n\nIt's worth every penny at the current full price they charge here, getting it on special just makes it that much of a better deal.  Don't bother with the reviews with 0.1hrs.  If those people could actually read the feature list properly, they would understand that this player does not play back copy protected Blu-ray discs because that requires expensive licensing that would probably at least double the cost of this program.  Also do not listen to thor32123's review, because this program plays every major format available as long as you have the proper filters and codecs installed on your computer. I have played back: mpg, mp4, avi, ogm, mkv, rm, rmv, rmvb, asf, wmv, qt, etc.  Plays them all fine.  I don't use this for audio, but every audio file I have accidently played on this program has played fine: mp3, wav, ogg, flac, etc.\n\nPros: \n[list]\n[*] Feature Rich & customizable well beyond the available freeware players out there\n[*] Excellent Playlist feature, light years better than every other player I have tried\n[*] Plays almost everything, copy protected Blu-ray being the only format I am aware of it doesn't\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Doesn't play copy protected Blu-ray, but it doesn't claim it does either. \n[*] Doesn't offer enough at the price point over freeware players for the casual media playback users.\n[*] Steam Updates are sometimes buggy with Anti-virus software, requiring disabling your AV prior to updating\n[/list]\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nWhile no copy protected Blu-ray playback support is a con, the program does not claim it does so you cannot fault the program for that.  The problematic updates through Steam are a hastle, but more of a nitpick than a real con. Most programs tell you to disable your AV prior to installation as a precaution anyway, but this was the first time I have had a problem with installing an update or any program for many years now that were caused by an Anti-virus program. \n\nIf you're a casual media playback user, you'll be fine with any of the freeware players out there, VLC being the best 'Video player for Dummies' out there.  If you absolutely have to have copy protected Blu-ray playback, look elsewhere. I have a set top player for my Blu-rays as well as a software player that came with my BD-R Writer so I did not need nor care about Blu-ray playback.  I've used the software player that came with my burner once, and that was just to test if it was actually a fully useable version or just a trial (it's a full version). Any time I play a Blu-ray, I do it with my set top player.\n\nIf you're a power user, or not afraid of learning how to work with this program (not that difficult), there's no better video player out there available at this price point or cheaper.", "timestamp_updated": 1459212889, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1459212825, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "24288694", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496821", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1466808786, "steamid": "76561198173425493", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Just download WinDVD", "timestamp_updated": 1468384072, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468384072, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "20843884", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499836", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1497848626, "steamid": "76561198024440251", "num_games_owned": 755, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Only 13 minutes of usage in Steam, but this is my main video-player ever since I bought it.\n\nZoom works like a lot of free players, but the smoothing of movie is where it excells.
