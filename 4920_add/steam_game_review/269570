His copy and pasting of code instead of creating a function, his misunderstanding of how some construct work and a general lack of OOP can be a bit of a distraction or teach bad habits to a novice developer. \nI suggest anyone new to software development to find tutorials on C# that focus on \u201cObject Oriented\u201d programming first. Once you have an understanding of the basics these tutorials become more of a \u201cWhat Can Unity Do\u201d tutorial then a programming tutorial. \nEven with the issues with the coding, I will recommend this as a good way to learn the basics of unity.

Both the sound and the resolution of the videos are very good and all the project files and scripts for the finished project are included in the download.\n\nThe tutor does a good job of explaining all the steps and tasks, not to slow or to fast and with a good amount of detail. Most importantly he does not skip anything, so you won't feel left alone.\n\nA big part of this tutorial is coding. Make no mistake there is no way around that if you want to make your own games.\n\nThat said, even if you are a complete beginner at coding you should be able to follow the tutorial, though I would encourage you to at least read up on some basics (What is a class? What is a function? What is a variable?).\nYou will need them sooner or later anyway no matter what engine or programming language you use.\n\nIf you are intermediate the scripting won't bore you either. From a software development standpoint the scripts are very well structured, both in the way they interact and in and of themselves.\nThe scripts are kept simple and make no mistake, that is a big endorsement.\n(If you don't know what I mean google the KISS principle.)\nStill the tutor does not miss out on important elements of Unity coding and I was very happy to see some co-routine programming included where appropriate.\nThe tutor does an awesome job of commenting everything he writes and explaining what everything does, which makes it very easy to follow his train of thought.\n\n\nIf you are an aspiring gamedeveloper, beginner or intermediate, this tutorial series is well worth your money.\nYou do not need to buy any other software since both the game engine Unity 3D and the script editor MonoDevelop are free.\nYes, Unity has a commercial \"Unity Pro\" version but you don't need to worry about that at this point. The extra features included there are very specific and well beyond what you need to make most games, not to speak of just getting started in game development. \nSo all you need besides this tutorial is patience and time.\nLearning takes effort and anyone who tells you otherwise is a charlatan and a liar.\n\nBut while there is no fast way to become a cometent developer, as far as learning effectiveness, pacing of content and completeness are concerned this is the best you will find.\n\nSo good luck and many squeals of delight ;).", "timestamp_updated": 1404452174, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404452174, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "13822226", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 47, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547260", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1420419922, "steamid": "76561198095346990", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 169, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "If you want the videos themselves for free, they're on the youtube channel [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/GamerToGameDeveloper/playlists]GTGD[/url].\n\nWhy would you buy it on Steam?

It's a great series and it's easily understandable, plus it's designed using the free edition of Unity 4.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone who wants to learn the Unity engine.  Why Unity?  It's actually a great engine, and you shouldn't associate it with Air Control or any of that shit because if you look closely, you can see just how little effort was put into those shovelware titles.\n\nWhile I'd say you should watch them on youtube and decide for yourself whether you actually need project files, the videos themselves are very high-quality and GTGD deserves every donation made from this.\n\nThese videos teach you Unity's interface, basic knowledge of C#, and more; arguably, they're more helpful than the actual Unity Technologies' tutorial series.\n\nIf you truly wanted to know why this is on Steam, have a quote from the series creator himself...\n[quote=GTGD;558747288136138884]It's important to study as many tutorials as time permits if you're into game development. You'll notice though that the overwhelming majority of tutorial creators can't continue regardless of how awesome their tutorials are. By having GTGD S1 on Steam I can fund the future of the series. There's a lot of expense and an incredible amount of time (years in the case of GTGD S1) that goes into making quality tutorials and a lot of people just don't realise that until they also start making tutorials. Relying on self advertising or setting up my own streaming website is a no go and isn't sustainable. Steam is the ideal place for getting game development in front of as many gamers as possible.

The video is very easy to follow, even using a never version of Unity (not reccommended).\n\nI would warn buyers that the video series does not aim to teach you how to code in c# or how to use the different technologies showcased. It's more about following along, monkey-see-monkey-do style so you can see what goes on behind the scenes in game making. You will still need to learn more on your own to understand how everything works (especially the code).\n\nFor people who have never coded, or used any sort of game development technology, this will be hard to understand - easy to follow. By that I mean. You won't learn a ton about how the C# language works, you might not understand how Unity keeps track of all the objects or how it applies materials, and you might not become a GIMP artist, but you will be opened to a wonderful world of possibilities.\n\nI highly suggest anyone without any programming or gamedevelopment experience consider buying this series and following every spoken word to the letter (most important when coding so you can keep track of the variables he's referring to).
