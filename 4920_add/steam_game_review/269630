I love all kinds of them, from AAA titles all the way to tiny Indie releases.

The worst part isn't that it does anything particularly wrong, it just fails to do much of anything right or original, and gave me no reason to keep coming back. Save your money on this one folks.

The trailer, the screnshots, and especially the promotional artwork sell a very different experience.\n\nMight have been a decent game at a dollar or two, but this thing isn't nearly worth the asking price of five bucks. It's basically a crappy upgrade-fest skinner box with a \"fancy\" paint 3d paintjob that would have been more at home on 2005-era Newgrounds than a proper Steam release.\n\nAlso, it's worth pointing out that the control mapping doesn't seem to actually match the \"tutorial\" screen- nothing I could do would make a melee attack, and the \"melee\" button instead did some crappy five-foot teleport dash that leaves your character stunned for a split second afterwords, making it almost worse than useless.\n\nAs for the actual game, it appears that the dev put basically no effort into balancing it. I mean, what the hell is wrong with the shotgun? It's barely got enough range to safely take down a single regular zombie outside of its melee range- there's literally no use to it! You can basically insta-win every level by just keeping your flamethrower upgraded and strafing from one side of the arena to the other, and pop off your invulnerability any time you're getting low on ammunition in the tank since it automatically refills it to max.\n\nAnyway, 2/10 overall- it would be fun as a free game on Kongregate or something, or MAYBE a dollar or two at most, but for the asking price there's no way it's worth it.", "timestamp_updated": 1487914745, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487914745, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "26516901", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1478774447, "steamid": "76561198013777141", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A Woefully boring attempt at a dual stick shooter.

You're killing zombie hordes that come in waves in a top-down view. As you progress, the stages are more difficult and there is more variety in the horde of enemies.  There are three maps and each has 10 stages with different enemy makeup. Three stages have boss battles, and there are three challenge maps.\n\nA mass of dead has three weapon types, with variants of each type (SMG, Shotgun, Flamethrower). All weapons are upgradeable with a basic upgrade system in place. There is also a variety of equipment upgrades that modify your character slightly, including health points, increased item drop, and increased run speed.\n\nI wish there were more content in the game. More maps and enemy types would go a long way to make the game replayable. It's still pretty mindless fun.
