After realizing that the key to success is in subtle, slow and considerate boost use and the receipt for survival is stealth and evasion, since you do not have the luxury of blasting the dangers away with lasers or missiles, you start to feel the poetic power of empty space. You will start to appreciate te success in survivalism, since the space is vasta nd hostile. You're not going to dominate this environment. It will dominate you. Still, life in the void feels pretty easy once you get the knack of it.\n\nAnd then it all changes once again. In stages 1 and 2 things were pretty peaceful, with enough consideration I was able to float past scorching suns and deadly debris pretty easily, nice and slow. Now it's stage 3 and it's getting hectic again. There' s mines. There's tons of scrap flying around. There are hostile aliens, some content with blasting past and cracking few potshots at me, some trying to follow me and bombarding me with their missiles. The quests are getting longer, the environment increasingly hostile every step. And I'm just a peaceful guy, trying to scrape by, unable to shoot back!\n\nAs frustrating as it can be to experience once again being blown away in cold space, it is also highly rewarding when you manage to haul one enormous cargo of materials to your mothership, to find something useful in spcae, to upgrade your pilot or ship one small notch to survive just a bit longer next time... These are the moments that keep me playing on. That, and the constant unending feel of exploration, the gift of finding, the beautifully desolate and dryly nihilistic but poetic blurts of machine voiced astronaut that is me speaking out his feelings once every year I have drifed in space.\n\nIn its own way RymdResa is merciless as any roguelite. On the other hand, it gives you much leanway by not stripping you of your labour's fruits (namely levels and items you've found) after your death - unless you want it to by activating difficulty levels above \"normal\". Most of all it is nearly zen-like in its nature of slow and tranquile space exploration, and I love it for what it is. For me this is some kind of equivalent for meditation, the way to escape the hectic real life into something slower, but not dull. I give this little big game my heartliest recommendation.", "timestamp_updated": 1503232492, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503232492, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 95, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 36, "total_reviews": 131}}
