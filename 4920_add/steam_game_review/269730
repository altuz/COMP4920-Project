You really need to put some time in with it before you can really get the hang of it. The short game is very difficult especially from around 20 yards. The putting can be frustrating because there is a huge difference between the green speeds. Fast is extremely fast and med-slow is like putting through honey. The fringe is like glue that grabs the ball and really slows it down, which can make chipping hard. The swing mechanics are good once you get used to them, but making a partial swing is very hard unless chipping. With the add on pack there is roughly 200 good courses you can play (some are very tough with narrow fairways) and you can add courses you like to your favourite course list. The game really pushes your hardware so be ready to lower some settings unless you have a very strong GPU/CPU. Probably the best computer golf game since Links 2003.

Tiger Woods PGA Tour, Hot Shots Golf, Mario Golf, Golden Tee Golf, Neo Turf Masters (worth looking up if you haven't heard of it)... Golf video games are likely the genre of gaming that I've collectively spent the most time on. While it's a strange focus, I've loved every second I've spent with the dozens of golf games in my library. So, how does The Golf Club hold up? ...Meh. It's okay I guess. \n\nI've got to give props to HB Games for one major thing here: Making the game difficult. Golf video games in general are far too easy as a genre. The Golf Club turns this formula on its head and attepts to create a genuinely difficult golf experience, using great course design as a cornerstone. For the most part, the game succeeds at what it attepts, but it's a far from perfect experience. Controls are tight, but chipping and putting is made excessively difficult by how fast you need to move to execute a \"half-swing\". To be honest, putting is a nightmare in general here, and is the only part of the game that really feels incomplete. While you can shape your shots in a separate menu, I earnestly wish that executing draws and fades was more difficult than just hitting a normal swing with a tighter swing path. The course creator in The Golf Club is the highlight, and rightfully so. You can tell how much time HB Games put into this system and it really paid off. Even with this as a bonus though, the game runs moderately sluggishly on even the best PCs. I still find the game slowing down occasionally with a Nvidia 1060 6GB GPU, 8 GB of RAM, and an Intel i5-4440 processer. If you have a computer you'd consider \"slow\", don't get this game. It's not worth it on that front. \n\nOverall, The Golf Club is a decent experience, but is honestly one of my least favorite, and least played golf games in my library. If it's on sale and it appeals to you, it can't hurt to give it a go. Worst case scenario, you can return it later and buy something you'd be happier with. \n\n6.7/10 Not terribly great, but still worth a look.", "timestamp_updated": 1503026643, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503026643, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 472, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 270, "total_reviews": 742}}
