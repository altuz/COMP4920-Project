I like the skin tight clothes and big graphic tits lol, but the game is FULL of bugs and it's boring. The puzzles aren't exactly intuitive. There's logic errors as well. The storyline is extremely boring and having to reach over and press ESC to skip convos gets annoying quickly. The inventory looks like it's half finsihed. Sometimes you'll pick something up and forget what it actually was, but theres no way to find out what it is again! The narrator in the corner which appears in episode 2 is supposed to be there to help, but when you drag items to him for advice it doesnt work (except for 1 or 2 times)! I'm glad part 1 and 2 are over. Apparently part 3 is much better - let's see how that goes.", "timestamp_updated": 1495257583, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495257583, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "31148264", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512502", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501201487, "steamid": "76561198142442939", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This has the potential to be a fun game, but one thing makes it horrible:  You cannot skip dialogue.

I enjoyed it though. Point and click adventure game with a few annoying little things like not being able to skip dialogue you've heard before and the main characters tiny legs and thigh gap in the artwork and she does do some pretty messed up things to advance the plot but overall I did enjoy it. It is definitely an intriguing story line and I can't wait for the last episode to come out I will be buying it.
