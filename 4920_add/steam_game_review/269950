The improvements were just what was necessary to bring it up to date with today's standards and it went even further! I can recommend this to newcomers with much more confidence than the last version. Not only because the new UI is geared more towards newcomers, but also because the graphics out of the box are vastly superior to the last iteration and can really make anyone say \"Wow!\".\n\nThe overall default experience has been overhauled and made fluent and easy. In addition, the freeware content available is superb. Without spending a penny, you can make v11 look much, much better than P3D with freeware addons. The physics engine also still is something that increases the immersion by a huge amount - it makes every aircraft feel that tad more real.\n\nRegrettably, X-Plane 11 still is very unoptimzed despite the recent efforts to boost fps. I believe it has a lot more potential in that area. Also, if good-looking clouds out of the box are extremely important to you, I definitely do not recommend it either. The terrain textures also seem outdated and need some work and the availability of payware aircraft is still not as diverse as the ESP platform's. There has been a huge growth recently, however.\n\nOverall, I think this iteration of X-Plane is a great upgrade and recommend it to anybody interested in aviation. It has a well crafted UI, awesome default aircraft and really raises the bar again. Again, there are things that definitely need some work, and Laminar Research isn't always good at adressing them - but all things considered this has been well worth it for me.", "timestamp_updated": 1505229036, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505229036, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34954137", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504589", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505941537, "steamid": "76561198198816873", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great sim!

Why make more of it and deliver more. Training Missions in FSX are often buggy but they teach the basic of flying and using the SIM.\nHere we come to (in my opinion) one of the important drawbacks: No missions are supported :-( ..in FSX this brought life to the SIM.\nThe next point is, flight planning is so weak. One can set the airport for take-off, nicely configure weather and time and very powerful failure options (even: not working runway lights, bird-strike). The flightplan needs to be set when you as pilot are in the cockpit of the sim. It is pity the Boeing has obsolete navdata and as mentioned it is not possible to create a proper flight plan from the given gps/navs.\nThe map is useful to get airport data around and much better than in FSX. Radio information can be easily set to Nav1 or 2.\n\nOften the standard scenery does not contain popular buildings of bigger cities (e.g. TV-tower in Berlin, Statue of Liberty in NY, Eiffel Tower in Paris and many many more) which were even included in FSX standard package.\nThe generated scenery looks great but I experienced the same effects with upcoming clouds as in FSX.\n\nWhen taxiing on Ibiza (LEIB) the guidance leads you away from the field across grass. The next weird thing one will experience are the routes of AI planes. On Geneva Airport (LSGG) for example departing planes turned like 300 ft above ground directly into the hill. \nOn the approach to Zurich (LSZH) RW34 ILS from the south I had to descent below 3000 ft which again almost lets you crash into the hills. Radiocommunication is nicely assisted and clear - not realistic.\nAll European airports I've tried did not support a pushback service (it just showed like: try bigger airport).\n\nTo summarize:\n++ (realistic) simulation (dynamics of planes, damages, phy)\n+ graphic\n+ sound\n+ configuration interface (joystick, display, sound..)\n+ pre-flight settings (weather, time, location)\n+ cockpit\n+ control (feels better than in FSX and smoother)\n+ failure console (easy to use many options, even problems at the airport)\n+ map/info (move the plane to any point and altitude)\n+ AI can control your plane\n+ plane editor (extensive settings)\n+ system (64bit, 'state of the art')\n\n-- missions\n- flightplan creation (briefing/cockpit)\n- ground handling\n- taxiways\n-- routes (approach and departure for AI and player have severe bugs)\n- scenery without the well-known buildings\n- clouds which disappear and re-appear (weather update, rendering?)\n\nAs conclusion I would still recommend this game although there are some downsides so that the sim feels less thrilling at least to me. To people who wanna save the money I recommend to try the demo of X-Plane 11 or use the free/opensource sim: 'Flightgear'.\nI hope updates will fix the important bugs and may be missions will be integrated in future?", "timestamp_updated": 1506636267, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506627176, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35429916", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507148195, "steamid": "76561198007171411", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1215}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Excellent, detailed, fantastic graphics, used the core game not obtained dlc or addons yet but so far is impressive.

It's not easy to justify dropping \u00a354.99 / 62 EUR / $72 on a game, but this isn't really a game. It's a full-on, commercial-grade flight simulator and one that will either make or break your commitment to learning curves.\n\nIf you do any flying, this sim is the only one worth getting. It accurately simulates flight dynamics based on real-time flight modelling; it's as realistic as you're going to get. Paired with the correct hardware and licences, it allows pilots to log hours towards ratings. So, for the best part of \u00a360, you'll get as close to flying as you can in your home.\n\nFor someone who doesn't fly, this game presents a significant challenge. There are some basic tutorials which explain the fundamentals of flying in a Cessna 172 - after that, you're absolutely on your own. There's a few aircraft to choose from, from small GA planes like the Cessna all the way to four-engine passenger jets from Boeing. Systems are accurately modelled and interactable - you really can control everything just as you would in the real machine. So, once you've mastered some simple pootling about in your 172, you can escalate to small jets or 747s and find a whole new level of challenge. It's the only game where I've had to consult actual reference material outside the game, and when I found myself reading a flight manual in my idle time, I realised I was either very sad and or probably justifying my purchase price. It's an immersive world, and if you've got the time and the brainspace, it's rewarding too.\n\nXP11 is endlessly expansible too; the default install package includes the WHOLE world's terrain and is impressively accurate, but with the help of mainly freeware mods online, you can accurately simulate your hometown if you so wish. There's a raft of extra aircraft (including some payware which rivals the base game price) which are unbelievably well-concieved - the community go the extra mile here to faithfully recreate their favourite airliners.\n\nA small mention has to go to the visuals - it's a stunning engine and some of the 3D cockpits are so immersive it's easy to forget you're sitting in front of a monitor. Engaging, stimulating and satisfyingly accurate, Laminar Research have continued to impress with XP11 - but it's not a light purchase. There's a good demo, if you fancy it - and for the love of god, play with some sort of controller, it makes things a lot easier.\n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1507067243, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507067243, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34914048", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504326", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507180773, "steamid": "76561198012705979", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 796}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The game is great as lomng as you have a fairly new processor for gaming, you need a fairly new video card, you might be able to get by with an older video card with 4gb vram, but I played this for 66 hours, on a new pc, running a Ryzen 1700, 24mb ram and 1050ti 4gb, and now its crashing at the load screen. something common with steam gamnes, they crash before you get to the main menu screen. happened with rainbow 6, wouldnt work for 2 weeks, then it started working.  know its xplane.
