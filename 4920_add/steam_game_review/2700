Bought this on a rainy Sunday afternoon to pass an hour or 2 next thing I know its almost midnight. A good fun game. Had the game crash on me once though but think its just my computer. Hoping to find some mods. Bought this as I used to be a big fan of the classic Theme Park game by Bullfrog. If you enjoyed Theme park back in the day or even tycoon building games then this will be a good game to try,"}]}
