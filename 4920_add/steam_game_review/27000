Not impossible, but harder.\n\nThe core concept of the game is to take your chosen sister to Grandmother's house, but the meat of the story and adventure lie off of the brightly lit path and instead in the ominious, dark forest. Inside you will discover random items that each sister can give her own thoughts on, special items that have particular meaning to the girl in question, sparkling flowers to help lead you to specific interesting items, and a wolf. And just like the fairy tale it's based on, your story is only complete by meeting your wolf and telling your story.\n\nThe game offers a lot of value in replaying it at least once, as there is no way to get every single item with one sister, and one item in particular can be commented on by every sister even though only one can get it, but I find the biggest value is what you get out of the story, as the thoughts of the sisters and the temptation and danger of their wolf can translate to something different for everyone. The game is more of an experience than a game with goals and specific conditions, so if you approach it as you approach a funhouse mirror, to see how your vision distorts and what you make of everything, it is a very satisfying playthrough."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504564894, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500690", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34745386", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198151662783", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1427566497, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 341}, "timestamp_updated": 1504564894, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Extremely pretentious game with confusing dynamics and downright horrible graphics."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503778059, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492290", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34513271", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197962388417", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1357372800, "num_games_owned": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 40}, "timestamp_updated": 1503778668, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A \"game\" I quite enjoyed but is nearly impossible to recommend. The Path is creative and atmospheric, but it's so minimalistic, short, unguided, and awkward  so as to be completely empty. The game consists of walking with rudimentary controls through the creepy but largely blank map to discover a few hidden vignettes about that character connected within a red riding hood metaphor-that's it. If that sounds interesting you should try the demo first since it's quite expensive for what you get and really rough around the edges, most people should avoid wasting their time and money."}]}
