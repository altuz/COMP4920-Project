It is hard to see what the tricks buttons do alothough the stars show up which is neato I guess.\nI would also like fo there to be some downhill feeling. It all just feels like a flat surface that you are auto sliding down.\nAnyway, good horse game...okay snowboarding game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvsmxiZzqzg", "timestamp_updated": 1470403880, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1470403880, "votes_down": 30}, {"recommendationid": "24706477", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459826", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1470311134, "steamid": "76561198174553317", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 10, "review": "Best Snow Game Ever!\n\n10/10 would horse again", "timestamp_updated": 1470311174, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1470311174, "votes_down": 40}, {"recommendationid": "30123958", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1491112009, "steamid": "76561198137553681", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "What more could you want?", "timestamp_updated": 1491088342, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487873099, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "29977582", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504819810, "steamid": "76561198050162295", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I get it is a joke game\nI get it is a game you give for shits and giggles\nBut good god I have seen better collsion detection in bad rats\nThis is a 6 dollar hunk of trash that you should never even think of buying for a joke\nIt has two moves\nHorse spinner-Literally spin any which way\nHay grind (or some shit)- fly along these green lines that are brighter than the lights in this game\nDon't buy this anyway\nit is awful\n", "timestamp_updated": 1487309905, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487309905, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 9}}
