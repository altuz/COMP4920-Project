The sensation alone that I feel when playing is one that takes me back to the time of the N64.  I've compaired it to a combination of \"legend of Zelda Ocarina of time\" meets \"Brothers.\"\n\nMy only true disappointment was reaching the end only to then find out that the game is only but 1 Act. Along with more online searching I discovered what is to be Act 2 will end up being a whole other game that I will have to buy separately.\n\nBe warned about that fact alone.  I also can not find any information stating the Act 2 game is even in development.\n\nOver all though from my own playthrough.  I'd at least rate this game a 7.5 out of 10\nThough as much as I'd like to recommend this game, I can't until I know forsure that its story will be picked up again with the second game, because otherwise your only buying half of story.", "timestamp_updated": 1506661055, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506660958, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 18}}
