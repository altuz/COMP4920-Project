The game starts up with a set of unresponsive text panels that display and skip through way too quickly. When I realized they would move through before I could read anything I chose to skip through them but every click of the mouse would take a second or two to respond before going to the next pane.\n\nWhen I finally got into the game, lag spikes due to loading as well as badly positioned warp zones held back the quality. I'd rather play hotline miami than to keep playing this game. There were no transitions between screens, virtually no animations besides flickering fullscreen effects, and the HP meter drops to -1 often before giving a game over.\n\nTo top it off, the windows volume mixer showed two programs, NPPD Rush (which didn't produce sound the whole time) and \"New Project\"\n\nThis game has virtually no polish and feels like it was hurried through.\n\nI expect more from a game that is able to get on steam.", "timestamp_updated": 1496701565, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496701565, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "32696161", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496988", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1466031334, "steamid": "76561198079230446", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "#1 I've played all sorts of video games since roughly 1979. Do I sound like a pretentious old fart stating this (and all the below)? Probably, I do not care. I along with other dorks who still sit in the basement and play games made gaming what it was, made the classics \"classics\" and also helped inspire contemporary games of any salt, for the most part. So accept this fact and my word or bugger off, poseur.\n#2 Many of the \"classics\" from C64 to early PC (up to mid-90s before games started to suck bad), I have played and loved as an original consumer.\n#3 I like originality and creative especially pertaining to aesthetic - legitimate aesthetic - and admire some games that achieve this as well as stand on their own ground as unique visions.\n#4 This game is tough as nails (you can view the walkthrough online) - I dare you to complete it. Does this mean that it is a bad game? NO.\n#5 Is this the most legitimate true punk meets cybergame ever made? Along with the Trese brother's Cyber Knights RPG (Android) - ABSOLUTELY.\n#6 Am I biased or serving an agenda in some way? NO. Have I even emailed the developer to only be ignored and did this bother me to the point of thinking the guy may be a jerk, when he's on youtube and simply could have replied? YES.\n#7 Do I like this game? YES. Do I play it often? NO. Is is fantastic to put on once in awhile, get acclimatized to its bizarre environment and controls and give it a go in a gaming session? YES. Did I grab a copy of the posted walkthrough in my permanent vgame video archive - YES.\n\nLike a great trash cult film, the developer has made a real and true original cyberpunk cult gaming classic that is top of the heap, truly. Unsurprisingly when many cult film classics came out they were considered trash, unwatchable or crap. Time and appreciation tells another story. This is the ultimate cyberpunk challenge or even a torturous, bleak, dystopian coffee break game.\n\nI understand most games prefer another aesthetic or Green Day as their prefered poseur form of manufactured punk. I do not, and I constantly look for games in the weird or cyberpunk genres, this is a must --- even if you try to play it and give up due to its lack of instructions or confusion. You have a computer, look it up... A game of strange fascination.
