I'm 47 and got goosebumps playing this. I've been waiting 20 years for this game. This is what VR should be like. How the hell these guys set such a high benchmarks on what was really an emerging system is incredible. The story, acting, graphics, sound scape, immersion are outstanding. The in-game user interface, the backpack system all so clever and well thought out. Everything works. It's easy to get stuck on the beach but really after you solve it you see it was pretty simple. I just love everything about this game, it is short but it is so high on quality I don't really care. I hope Valve have their eyes on these guys for HL3 VR. Becuase you can easily see how they could pull that off after this work.

Is it a game where you shoot people's heads off and blow up building for hours? No. But the Gallery is incredibly well crafted, thought through, and engaging by its own merit. \n\nMore than any other vr game thus far, I was struck with mystery and wonder. \n\nA must have for you VR library. \n\nAs far as the negative views because of the price: please remember that these guys aren't billion dollar production companies. Yes, the original price of $30 was pretty steep but I doubt these guys are pricing it that way just to screw us over or be greedy. They spent countless hours with a small team of creators  (not a hundred of hired hands) and created something beautiful for us to enjoy. I don't think it's unreasonable to want something back for that effort (so that they can keep working on more products!). You won't find a good painting being sold for less than a $100, so why not support these artists with $30? I'm just so tired of people complaining about artist's high prices because they are comparing those prices to mass production goods. They can't compete with those prices! This is why good artists starve while we complain about \"nothing good/original coming out.\" Invest in what you want to see more of. That's the only way they are going to be able to keep making good products.\n\nOk, rant over. \n\nGood work guys!", "timestamp_updated": 1506062198, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506062198, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35276313", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500019", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506640893, "steamid": "76561198072350122", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 189}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Buying and trying an awful lot of VR games and experience at the moment and this one is in the top 5.
