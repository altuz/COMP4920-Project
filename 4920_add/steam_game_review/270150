Do you want to get shot and die in one hit? Do you like picking up random stuff that soldiers drop and selling them for real guns?\n\nWell, this game has all that and more.\nGet a gun, get to cover, start shooting, basically. This game features a massive multiplayer war with realistic killing,  shooting, and driving. Yes, you can even drive cars into tanks and blow up the C4. Or drive tanks and get blown up becuase you are too far into the frontlines.\nBasically, this game lets you do whatever you want (And possibly die on that solo raid) with still having a massive objective. This game lets you feel what soldiers feel, either you blaze the field on the frontlines, or you manage the flank that wins the stalemate. It's oddly very fun. It has the very fustrating feel of trying to do something, then a very satisfying feel when you finally win, it stikes just the right balance between the two. The community is great (As of this review), alot of posts on the community of the game are the greatest, and it even has places for any skill and playstyle.\n\n10/10, It IS hard to pick up at first, but then once you learn it, it is most, if not all, of what I said.\n\nP.S.

You take on the role as some average soldier fighting for whatever side you choose to fight for. The goal of the game is to rule the world for your faction, the only problem is that two our factions hold pieces of that world; don't expect the two to give you those pieces like gifts for your birthday. You'll have fight, along with many other soldiers, for those pieces. \n\nYou start off with the lowest rank, with just a few toys to play with. As you crawl from the dirt you were thrown onto you will stand, and when you stand you will walk, and when you walk you will run all the way to victory. As you fight you will gain exp and in-game currency, allowing you to increase in rank and make purchases of different weapons, equipment, and off map support. As you rise in the ranks many comrades will follow your every actions, fighting by your side either in the narrow trenches, in the open streets, or even in the cold snowy fronts.\n\nThere will be times where you'll need to fight alone, and even away from the front-lines to gain victory for your faction. Go in lone wolf with stealth and the shadows as your ally, eliminating and sabotaging the enemy to give your allies in the front-lines the upper hand. \n\nDespite all that's given to you, you'll still be faced with challanges ahead. Battles lasting for hours, commanders who orders do not have proper sense, over-whelming forces that will make you wished you were back home in your mother's arms.\n\nSo...do you wish to stay as boys and girls, or do you wish to become strong men and women?\n\nEnlist now! I mean buy now.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPros:\n+ A challanging top down shooter that's easy to learn, but hard to master\n+ A level up system that actually gives you more option on how you play as you progress\n+ Tons of weapons, equipment, and vehicles to use\n+ Good maps\n+ AI soldiers are smart enough to take cover in combat, operate vehicles, and call in off-map support\n+ A co-op/multiplayer mode that allows you to play with or against your friends\n\nCons:\n- AI are smart...but tend to be not at times; like giving a tank to the enemy like a christmas gift\n- Orders from command force allies to get cut off in some maps", "timestamp_updated": 1505358885, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505358885, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34996328", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505360497, "steamid": "76561198344155720", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Can't wait for the new DLC to be released!\nBut the armored vehicals should be more realistic.
