Nothing to particulary rave about. The puzzles were good and challenging and I can see how this would be considered a horror game. Though it left too much to wonder about. I'm all for \"fill in the blanks\" but when you can't fill them in because the story has too many holes... then you've just written a bad story. \n\nSo yeah. Story wasn't conclusive but ok. The gameplay was ok. The art was ok.
