The history will not accurately portray the time of our life, nor will we be contained, but an array of figures not meant for us to fathom.\n\nAging is perhaps the least graceful thing that happens to man, but the end may not be so. The most delicate touch is the way Tale or Tales tricks you into thinking you are to leave with the protagonist, but you don't. In the Graveyard, you quit the game, she will be left behind along with the relics forsaken surrounding her, and the tastes, smells, feelings and experiences that comprise the texture of her life will be forever gone."}]}
