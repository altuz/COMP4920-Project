Well the controls are terrible, but the game is alright.\n\nThe puzzles are interesting, but I feel like the hunting for the objects is much harder than the actual varied puzzles (none of which have taken me more than a few minutes), it's hard to build good depth when you only use a puzzle system once. The story is well executed, with forshadowded twists (so it's rewarding to be engaged with the story) with decently good voice acting. The controls are abysmal, even with an options menu for them, the mouse controls are completely bonkers, they *need* a \"normal mouse\" checkbox, and there are no convience features I often see in similar style games (auto save, arrow key navigation, some transitions (via doors) take too long, etc). The graphics are alright, some scenes look very nice, others merely ok, due to compression and the resolution I play at the video transitions look terrible (I also spoted one immersion breaking graphical glitch in the cafeterria).\n\nIf Myst style point and click games with a sci-fi story are your thing, this is an alright game for that genre, I enjoyed it because I love the genre, but it probably wouldn't pull in someone not specifically looking for the experience.

It's easy to ruin a point and click adventure game (unfortunately), but this one pretty much nails it. Reminds me of what the best point and click games of the late nineties had to offer (think of the Myst series, 7th Guest, 11th Hour, Journeyman Project series etc.). It has good looking graphics, an interesting story that's slowly revealed, an intuitive interface and well integrated puzzles. None of those - I guess I'll just lock my safe with a sliding puzzle - type of puzzles. And also no puzzles that require some heavy lateral thinking in many, many complex steps (remember the puzzles from Day of the Tentacle or Monkey Island?). Some achievements can be tricky to get, but they are fun to find and there's plenty of hints in the forum. I've encountered no bugs, no glitches and no crashes, so the ones that have contributed to the negative reviews have aparantly been fixed. I'm also very glad they included the momentum slider. When I first started to play the game I felt seasick and had trouble clicking things until I turned the momentum WAY down. The only other negatives I can think of is the fact that the enhanced view mode you receive later on in the game has to be actived with the F2 key, which is all way on top of the keyboard. It would have been nice if it had been bound to either the space bar, the middle mouse button or if you could have turned this mode on and off from the inventory screen. Also the cursor changes to an upwards pointing arrow when you can climb up or down a ladder or something similar. It confused me several times having to click with an upwards pointing arrow in order to move down, but I got used to it in the end. Some of the screens could've done with a bit more animation, especially the one in the cockpit. But these are minor irritations which only serves to indicate that there is very little room for improvement.

I have honestly never played an adventure game with such poor controls. It looks like it's a first-person game, but you can't move around with WASD. In fact, you can't move around at all.

The story is plausible and original.\n\nI was frustrated by several hidden hotspots -- a regression from otherwise excellent, plot-integrated puzzles.  Once you are aware that you spent 10 minutes trying to figure something out, only to discover that you simply weren't aware you could open some container, you spend the rest of the game wondering if the same will be true about each new puzzle. \n\nThe interface felt old-fashioned at times.  The ability to look around in three dimensions, but only stand in one spot seemed awkward.  The transitions should probably just be turned off for all they add to the game, although several cutscenes were well-done, if short, including a glorious compilation of sun surface video (which I think were taken from real videos of Sol!).\n\nOverall, a strong recommendation, especially for science fiction fans.  Certainly not ground-breaking from an interace or graphics standpoint, but this is made up for by the care taken by the authors in crafting a narrative and world to take part in for a few hours.", "timestamp_updated": 1454285970, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1454285970, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 29, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 8, "total_reviews": 37}}
