However I have to say when i woke up to one of the youtubers I frequent playing this and asked my sister if she wanted to give it a go. An hour and a half later 5 dollars down the drain and some of the worst singing I have heard later I really enjoyed it. It was simple, short, and did not do anything to really drive home any of the points it was trying to get across (I assume). The homemade feel of the game is what really got to me though the time that someone invested that isn't amazing at making games but wants to is what I took away and I appreciated it.", "timestamp_updated": 1494563874, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494563874, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 93, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 20, "total_reviews": 113}}
