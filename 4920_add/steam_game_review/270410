I wanted to play at least before writing anything, the game seems decent, jumping off ostacles seems a bit wonky to me honestly, if I wasn't having the wasd issue this would be a positive review, this game is on sale for 3$ too so I thought it would be worth the buy even though the reviews are mixed! If anyone might know how to fix the issue message me please. at it's price of 3$ yes this game is worth the buy, but otherwise I'd say np, so if tis on sale buy it for some cheap fun.\nOkay so I thought I had fixed the wasd issue, go in gme, low and behold it went back to arrow keys... I wish it wasn't so glitchy like this, I really love this game but it practically makes it hard to play for me, my hand just gets so uncomfortable, :(\nHey, so I tweeted at the developer since I haven't seen anyone doing so, and he responded and said that he'll most likely work on patches after his current project or something like that, so all hope is not lost on this game!! I'm still going to keep the review negative only because it could be polished a bit more, but otherwise that is all :)", "timestamp_updated": 1499470908, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499395979, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "33442298", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497018", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499804232, "steamid": "76561198253706069", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "this games actually pretty solid, idk why the ratings on its so bad", "timestamp_updated": 1499725550, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499725550, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 10}}
