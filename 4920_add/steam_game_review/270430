There are so many problems in just the first half-hour of this game, that I doubt I will even try to brute-force my way through the sludge. First, they seem to have ignored optimization completely. Frequent and long loading screens, poor frame-rate, choppy camera control. Secondly, there is really no stealth. Enemies can spot you regardless of your position, visibility or speed of movement; most of the time, seemingly at random. Other times they will completely ignore you. The stealth utilities they give you are difficult to use when harried and when the frames are dropping (you know, the moment you need them). I found that the medkits were totally useless as well. Most of the time you can only take a single hit, and when you got lucky, two. There was never a point where I could stop and heal that graze.\n\nThe fact that they are trying to work on a Chapter 2 before dealing with all this seems to be a marketing ploy. The developers need to stop what they are doing and work on the game engine + A.I. before they waste their efforts on this shell of a game. I sincerely hope they do; I still think the premise is good.

It is boring, pedantic and predictable with poor graphics, controls that can't be reconfigured, almost no gameplay instructions that make sense...I could go on.  Combine that with the inability to jump or manuver past up/down/right/left, and you have a huge yawner.  On top of that, for some reason if you don't skip the beginning part of the game...the story, there is a better than fifty fifty chance you will see the island blown up and get the credits rolling through the screen. Credits mind you, you must CNTRL, ALT, DEL to skip as ESC won't get you out.  Got to get those accolades in folks.  I know this is a rather harsh critique and I don't usually post them but with all the hype about this game, you would have thought it was something special, something worth paying for.  It wasn't until I bought and paid for it...money I can't get back for this piece of cr*p, that I found out just how bad it really is.  The reason for the criticism is to hopefully keep someone else from making the same mistake.  Buy Styx with your money, buy Thief, Dishonored if you want stealth, heck, buy Dark Messiah of Might and Magic...a fairly challenging D and D for a challenge with about the same level of graphics but some interesting gameplay, but please, don't invest your hard earned dollars in Cypress Inheritance.

When I saw this game at sale, it caught my eye and seemed to have the elements I was looking for: nice graphics, exploration, a mysterious island, interesting gameplay (cause&effect). \n\nThe game delivered on what I was expecting on the graphics part and exploration. Also, the island sure is mysterious and a deserted place only populated by those knights robots. For me, the game began on a high note with the briefing at the mansion and the scene at the port. Only enough information to get to the next place. I was intrigued. \n\nI arrived at the island and it was very nice, but then some execution problems started to pop up. I was faced with a bug that prevented me from continuing the game or even start a new game. Every time I tried to get to the island, I was kicked out of it and the game ended. I managed to get around it, but it was a frustrating introduction.\n\nSome other problems happened and also other good surprises that I try to summarize below.\n\nPros:\n- Nice graphics\n- Nice atmosphere\n- Nice voice acting\n- Ok CGI\n- This game has some thing very nice and kind of rare that I always look for in games in: persistency, especially in Chapter I. If you drop an item, it will stay there. Forever. The ATVs have their position, fuel, flat tire persistent. If you leave an ATV in the back of beyond in the island, it will stay there. Your health, stamina is persistent. They only regenerate when you sleep/drink/eat. If you get a stun gun from a dispenser, it will never respawn. If you use it, then for this play through is gone. In this time that, for many games, even the health auto regenerates and every enemy you kill disappears within seconds, this is a welcome change.\n- Nice change of pace in the VR Desert (if you overcome the frustrating beginning).\n- Nice change of pace for chapters II and III. Almost different games.\n- Some vistas in chapter II and III are beautiful.\n- In chapter I, some times I saw one of those parked ships flying. Nice touch!\n- In chapter II, the room with all the old movies/cartoons. Wow! Another nice touch!\n\nCons:\n- You know the persistency I mentioned above? Well, this can be a problem when encountering bugs. On Chapter II, I was stuck in terrain. Could not by any means get out. So I exited the game and entered again. I respawned at the exactly same stuck spot...\n- The map in Chapter I cannot be scrolled.\n- No transitions. If you get caught, got shot, fall from somewhere, the screen blinks and you go back to the respawn point. There is no animation, no sound.\n- The beginning of the VR desert, if you stay put and allow the knights to come at you, is very frustrating since the respawn point is very near where the nights already are. You enter an unnerving cycle of dying/respawning.\n- Many bugs that I got stuck in terrain. Especially if you try to find every game item...\n- Could not use only the controller. To start a new game or continue, I could only do that via mouse.\n- Found some bugs trying to collect all chapter I assets. After getting 4 of them and knowing which vault the fifth was supposed to be, I kept getting the same assets I already had.\n\nOverall, I had an enjoyable experience, but ultimately I was expecting a bit more of it. Some bugs almost ruined the experience for me so I feel more polish would greatly help this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1489612751, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1489539985, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "9749860", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 42, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461553", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1396829597, "steamid": "76561198066705589", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 5, "review": "$10 game at best.", "timestamp_updated": 1396829720, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1396829663, "votes_down": 44}, {"recommendationid": "29732951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492616", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1484285090, "steamid": "76561197977555236", "num_games_owned": 401, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Seriously, no-one seems to know what the developer is up to except the developer.
