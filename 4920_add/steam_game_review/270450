So good that I have bought 18 extra copies to gift to most of my friends that do own this game (I have not bought it for every single one of my friends on Steam that own this game, but I have gifted for most.)\n\nThis game has the potential to be the best game ever created. The only problem is, there isn't enough players.\n\nYou could ask anyone of my friends about how passionate I am for this game and how much money I have put into it.\n\nI have spent a lot of money on the community market as well, I probably shouldn't have, but being the best game in the world, I thought I'd support the game that I feel should be the most played game on Steam.\n\nPros: [Everything]\n\n- Fast Paced Dodgeball Action\n- I am the best person at catching on this game\n- Cosmetics are swaggy and I must have them all\n- A fucking great laugh\n- Everything else is amazing about this game\n\nCons: [NONE] (Apart from one thing)\n\nIn all seriousness, this game hasn't got a lot of players on and sometimes is hard to find a full lobby. I have bought a lot of copies for my friends to kind of try and revive this game (step-by-step).\n\nAll this game needs is a little bit of exposure so that it can be brought back to life.\n\nI don't have the most hours on this game, but now that a lot of friends have started playing again, I'm sure I will get a lot more.\n\nI rate this game a good 11/10 for everything.\n\n\nSHOULD YOU GET THIS GAME? OF COURSE! \nSHOULD YOU SPENDS SHIT TONS OF MONEY ON THE COMMUNITY MARKET FOR COSMETICS? OF COURSE!\nSHOULD YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT THIS GAME? OF COURSE!\n\nI have the passion and willpower to bring this game back and I challenge all my friends to write a review for the game and leave a positive recommendation.\n\nThank you for creating such a great game! <3\n\nya boi, \n\nJago\n", "timestamp_updated": 1504624712, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "6", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504624712, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34776561", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503951", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505426507, "steamid": "76561198049874905", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A fun party game for everyone, doesnt matter if you have less than average reflexes or mediocre aim, everyone can have fun in this game.\n\nI love this game, not just for the music but for the engaging multiplayer but how its a FUN engaging multiplayer, its hectic, crazy and absolutely insane and I love it.\n\nCosmetics are optional and completely obtainable through natural gameplay which is amazing for the decicated players whilst casual players will recieve cosmetics also, a nice touch honestly.\n\nLots of different gamemodes with different playstyles to play with your friends, or a solo campaign type game mode which makes the game endlessly replayable and one of the best games I have.\n\nWell played devs :)", "timestamp_updated": 1504708296, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504708296, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34768972", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504174", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506852510, "steamid": "76561198165552597", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Cool game, jumping is a little bit hard but overall it's fun, music is dope. \nBut\nIt can make you dizzy because of the lights", "timestamp_updated": 1504669214, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504669214, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34946359", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504978714, "steamid": "76561198034083409", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's a nice shooter game, little different, so it's nice :) I like the art style too.", "timestamp_updated": 1505387099, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505387099, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1403, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 107, "total_reviews": 1510}}
