Rather than grabbing onto the play's theme most suited to exploration in video game form (e.g. its obsession with the danger of \"looking\" and its positioning of the aesthetic gaze as, paradoxically, both creative/reverent and destructive/dehumanizing), FATALE instead spends most of its 20 minute running time on plot and a conceptually murky sequence where the player extinguishes candles on a static 3D tableau. \n\nThus, ultimately the game plays like a hollow bit of 3D diorama--with the candles just being an excuse to get the player to look at different parts of the scene. An interesting and often pretty experiment, but ultimately vague and underwhelming, both as a game and as a commentary on Wilde's play."}, {"votes_down": 37, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1388627963, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533727", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "8496829", "votes_up": 61, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009791711", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1374469349, "num_games_owned": 649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 62}, "timestamp_updated": 1388628026, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It's \"art.\"\n\nI have no problems, nay, I *love* artistic games.\n\nExcept this isn't a game.

Their endless ambition and imagination can easily be seen with the amount of care they put into their projects. They are simply a once in a lifetime experience, and for all the effort that Tale of Tales puts into their work, the payoff is almost infinite.\n\nFor instance, as of this writing, Tale of Tales has priced The Graveyard at a fair $4.99, and it takes less than 20 minutes to complete the game in its entirety. I actually managed to beat Bient\u00f4t l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 in a whopping 80 minutes, and it's priced at only $9.99. With FATALE, at only $6.99, it took me a very fulfilling half hour to reach the end. What amazing value!\n\nMeanwhile there are developers who think they can hock games such as The Binding of Isaac for an exorbitant $4.99, of which I've only managed to squeeze over 50 hours of gameplay and I haven't even completed the game yet. What a joke.\n\nDon't forget that Tale of Tales introduces highly intuitive controls with each iteration of magnificent gaming art. Thank god I can now only move my head while holding the left-mouse button, which also causes me to walk forward at the same time. I could never understand wanting to keep still while being able to freely look by solely moving the mouse around. Primitive WASD scheme is completely thrown out the door, and good riddance. Half-Life 2 has nothing on FATALE when it comes to traditional game mechanics.\n\nIf you haven't done so already, you simply owe it to yourself to play every single one of Tale of Tales' amazing artworks. It's like trying to suck your own dick and failing, but that small glimmer of hope is the only thing that motivates you to continue trying. Just once more inch.\n\nUntil you break your neck.\n\nThen you definitely know it was all worth it.\n\n/s"}, {"votes_down": 10, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1389036072, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506857", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8595592", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025004712", "num_reviews": 117, "last_played": 1389035699, "num_games_owned": 1507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 42}, "timestamp_updated": 1389036072, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I got this exploration game because of \"The Path\" being an awesome game and the screenshots look gorgeous in \"Fatale\".
