I am not very far in the game (I hope), but I am already certain, that I will finish it.\n\nA few (unsorted) notes:\n- The controls are as good or as bad as most action adventures of the era Long Night tries to connect to.\n- There is no combat. Think Clocktower, not Resident Evil.\n- There is little explanation of the health system. Sometimes I die, sometimes I don't.\n- You can turn off checkpoints (there are save points, make sure to memorize the locations) and interaction popups (tapping A/X while bumbing along the wall is back, yay). This replaces a difficulty system and greatly improves immersion.\n- The game is not dubbed.\n- Story is represented by short visual novel style films.\n- Make sure you are a quick reader! The text in the videos is so fast, reading the text, looking at the picture and understanding what's going on can be a pain.\n- There is a lot of text to read. Books, notes, journals, diaries. You can also click on most items and read a description. This is a feature most modern games are missing. Yes, I want to read more about that picture on the wall, that plate on the table and that empty bed with smelly sheets. Well done!\n- Most of the text was obviously not written by an English native speaker. This might be bad for some, but it brings back the charme of the genre ca. 2000, when all games like this came from Japan, with weird translations. This one however, rather sounds like good French English... and I was right, it's a French developer!\n- You can freely roam the camp, as free as you can roam any place in a horror game at least.\n- As the main cast is a bunch of teens, be ready for a lot of teen tropes.\n- There is an actual inventory.\n- I spent 88 minutes in the game without finding a map. The camp is not that big, but...\n- ...the camera angles do not really help in finding my way and knowing where I am. I actually have no idea of the geometry of that camp, thanks to that camera. Like I said, the game reproduces a late 90's charme, including those fun details we actually never missed. EDIT: According to the comments, there is a map.

But don't worry, you'll find a whopping two puzzles in the whole game to help pass the time!\n\nThe whole time you're outside, you're constantly being assaulted by some sort of ghost thing who runs after you, and since the whole place is linear corridors, the only way to escape is backwards. The only way to get rid of her is to either outrun her until she gets bored or you reach one of a handful of hiding spots which get rid of her 100% of the time (a heavily oversimplified take on the system from Clock Tower). You can get this down to a science after a couple of attempts and every time she shows up -- about once every 45 seconds by the end -- it's just an annoying detour.\n\nThe story makes absolutely no sense, and the giant walls of text that make up the notes do little to give a sense that any more thought was put into what happens than Weird Things Are Afoot. The closest it ever comes to a coherent narrative is in that one area that I'm pretty sure you can skip entirely.\n\nThe final area is kind of cool visually, but it's an absolute dog to play and starts and ends abruptly with no real attempt at coherency. Near as I could tell it had NOTHING to do with ANY of the other ~spooky stuff~ in the rest of the game.

The graphics look halfway between a PS1 and PS2 game and there's a slight unpolished feel to things. Controls are weird (WASD to move, spacebar to sprint?) and cannot be changed. I would say a gamepad is almost mandatory.\n\nThat said I would still recommend it.  The atmosphere is creepy. For most of the time there is only one enemy but it's creepy as hell and you never know where it's going to pop up and send you into a panic attack trying to get away. While the graphics are primative and performance unpolished, it has that unique art design most Frech games have and it works. At less than $5 it's worth the price if you're into survival horror games.\n\nOne gameplay complaint I have is they never explain to you how health or dying works. You have a \"mental state\" that seems like health but I never noticed it do anything when it got low. When the enemy catches you, sometimes it's an instant death, sometimes it's harmless. I played through this episode twice and I still have no clue about either.  \"Health\" doesn't seem connected to the enemy killing you and your mental state sometimes degrades on its own. The game tells you to use inhalers to restore your mental state but there's a VERY limited amount and you are never given any clue when or why you need to use them because you never notice mental state affecting anything. There's still more episode to go so hopefully they'll fix that.\n\nOne STORY complaint I have is you coming across a document related to the central plot that is such a blatant X-Files reference (right down to one of the people having the exact same name!) that it breaks the immersion a bit.", "timestamp_updated": 1417483595, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415017083, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "13666071", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510612", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1419710310, "steamid": "76561198022820771", "num_games_owned": 529, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trvprxLUolk\n\n\tLong Night is an adventure/horror game operated entirely by the\nkeyboard, with no mouse options.

The developers took some serious inspiration from Silent Hill with surreal atmospheres, frustratingly deliberate camera angles and view-dependent control schemes. Overall, it was well executed.\n\nThe reason I do not recommend this game is that it is waaay too short. I know it's only episode 1, but the 2.4 hours I spent playing the game do not warrant the $5 I spent to get it. Most of 2.4 hours I spent playing this was me repeating the same frustrating chase scene or overly confusing shark puzzle. I know this is titled as \"episode 1\" but even episodes have resolutions to the stories within them. The story that was started was in no way resolved, and the ending rasied way more questions than it did answers. I left the game feeling unsatisfied, and wanting more than I got. While wanting more is usually a good sign, and encourages players to buy the next piece of the series, I don't think I will be buying the next one. Especially if the episode is as short as this one was. \n\nIf you want to spend $5 on a very small, albeit well done, content then maybe Long Night is your time. The cut scenes were well done, the atmosphere was spot on, but I honestly feel like the developers could have released more content, or at least fixed a few common bugs in gameplay before release.

Could dig the oldschool survival horror in general, if the execution weren't so terrible. If you still want to get it, note that this is only episode 1, and there is no continuation after the cliffhanger ending of this VERY short episode.\n\nThe premise is classic and compelling - haunted camping grounds, Native American ghost legends, with a nice dose of personal psychological horrors the character/s has/have to deal with. A camping trip with friends, a local urban legend, a spooky dare gone wrong, and our protagonist finds himself alone and scared, looking for his friends and hunted and haunted by a ghostly woman. So far, so good. The added effect of monitoring the protagonist's fear-level and dealing with his asthma (?) to reduce it seems a nice touch, but lacks in effects and ends up looking more like a poor attempt to emulate similar elements from better games.\n\nThe gameplay suffers primarily from stiff, occasionally bugged controls and repetitive elements. While I don't mind the often surprising and - with a few unintentionally comical exceptions - rather unforgiving attacks and opportunities to die so much, given that it's rare you'll make too much progress without coming across a save point (use those whenever you see them - you'll often backtrack to older ones, but there aren't that many in the game), I do mind their unoriginality. A few \"bad choice\" deaths and a slightly more interesting though very railroaded boss fight notwithstanding, the primary threat is the aforementioned ghost woman, who will upon your entering an area occasionally appear, scream, and begin to chase you down. Once or twice you may be lucky and she will disappear before reaching you (she also seems unable to enter certain areas, making it easy for you to lose her depending on your positioning) but for the most part she will insta-kill you upon reaching you. To evade her, you may simply dodge into one of the designated hide spots, and it is generally very easy to lose her, unless you happen to be badly positioned, such as trapped by a dead end. The game therefore presents mostly frustration-deaths, forcing you to backtrack a little and try again, hoping for a better angle this time. The faulty controls may also do you a disservice here if you enter an area from the wrong side and directions are mirrored until you let go of your movement keys for a moment. Not so convenient when you're running for your life.\n\nMy greatest problem with the game is, however, that it is insultingly short. Yes, even for the price, even for an \"episode 1\". If you're an idiot like me and need forever to understand that no, you really can't/shouldn't taunt the ghost and lead her on a merry chase, you may spend up to two hours on it. I like trying things out, and I can be stubborn when I think a boss fight should work the way I want it to work, what can I say - entirely my fault. But more than likely, you will be done much quicker.\n\nAll in all, there was some real potential for an indy game here. I don't mind the rough edges such as some (!) issues with the controls, the mediocre graphics, or the nostalgia feeling of a somewhat rough and tumble, simple third personal survival game. But with the complete lack of conclusion or real explanation of the setting (you may piece it together from notes you find, if you care to read them all), the short duration, and the additional flaws of repetitive gameplay and stiff, buggy controls, I can't even use nostalgia as an excuse to recommend it. You may think \"It's only five bucks!\" or \"It's on sale!\" but for that money, you'll be left with what feels like nothing but the barest prologue to a game.\n\nI'd completely change my mind if it were finished, but it isn't, and from the looks of it it won't be, so I can't recommend this game.\n\nTo the developers, it'd be prudent to finish the game and move away from the episodic release.

I played 105 minutes or so, mostly because of the infuriating and deliberately clunky \"running puzzles\" that compose the last HALF of this title. I sincerely wish I could have my $4.99 back, because I wouldn't spend more than $1 on this game or any subsequent chapters. The only thing I can think of is that people who backed the game feel overly fond of it, or the friends of the developers are being very outspoken here.\n\n To elaborate...\n\nTHE PROS:\n*Great cut-scene graphics, very Gone Home meets Telltale games. A pity they flash so fast that you can't read the text, though.\n\n*Retro-style nostalgia in abundance, even the year it takes place in.\n\n*A fairly interesting storyline.\n\n*A \"creepy, scary\" villian type that is pretty unnerving.\n\n*Decent cliffhanger ending. I feel sincerely intrigued by what happens in the rest of the story, but... \n\nTHE CONS:\n*Horrible controls. I understand the Retro static camera, but the poor controls paired with the \"running puzzles\" and the fact the main character has asthma simply make the game 100x more frustrating than fun.\n\n*Short -- If the clunky running mechanics hadn't have doubled my time, I'd have finished this in 35-45mins. Tops. Totally not worth $4.99 in my book!\n\n*No audio controls -- not to disable the music, nor slider-bar it down. The music isn't -bad- it's just loud compared to the other sounds, and it somehow makes my head want to explode when getting frustrated with the running puzzles.\n\n*Poor Storytelling \"plot devices.\" I'm all for foreshadowing, or having a plot arch that spans the entire series of episodes.
