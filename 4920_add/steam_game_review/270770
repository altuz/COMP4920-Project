As a side note, alongside its quite improved sequel [i]Etherlords II[/i], the game holds a special place for me; meaning many frustrating hours of deck building and combat practice during 2001-2004. I was about to shed tears of joy when I first managed to beat this one!\n\nIn the world of Ether, there comes a time when the way to the Temple of Time is finally open. The old legend states that whoever holds dominion over the Temple shall rule the power of Ether, the substance of all magic and creation. Four distinct nations of the realm: druidic Vitals, aloof Kinets, fierce Chaots and decaying Synthets all begin a race towards the Temple to challenge the master of the world: the White Lord. Only one shall succeed and overcome the challenges of becoming the next White Lord. As the saying goes: \"The Ether enslaves the ones who obey it, and destroys the ones who do not\".\n\nI suspect that neither European nor American market are familiar with this challenging and enjoyable series, so I'll try to make a resume for the game dynamics. In its essence, [i]Etherlords[/i] is a strategy game which presents the player an isometric map with a capital city, resources to gather and monsters to challenge. With each combat your hero overcomes, he/she levels up to unlock a selection of abilities. You have to make sure that you protect your base and gather needed resources to wage war at the same time. Here, we basically have a [i]Heroes of Might and Magic[/i] alternative.\n\nThe combat itself on the other hand, is a variation of [i]Magic the Gathering[/i] card game where your hero and the enemy faces each other, with monsters to summon and spells to alter the battlefield. Here is where things get complicated: you will be collecting the spells throughout the strategy map and you will have a limited number of spells that your deck may hold any given time. For each spell acquired, you will also need the appropriate resources which determines how many times that spell can be cast. Thus, you have to establish a careful balance between the game's strategy and card game elements. Easier said than done, this restriction quickly becomes tricky to handle. When you decide to change one card, you can easily find yourself travelling to the other side of the map, while an enemy hero silently marches towards your capital.\n\nGraphics are fairly outdated, but still charming enough in my opinion. The environment and character animations are colorful exaggerations that we are already familiar from [i]Warcraft III[/i] or [i]King's Bounty[/i] series. Camera settings are usually a bit distasteful, inconveniently choosing to focus on random figures, but hey! No one promised an A+ game. What we have here is an old, challenging strategy and card game that certainly doesn't hold hands with the player.\n\nThere is a truckload of negative reviews about the game out there, complaining about constant crashes or not being able to run the game at all on modern systems. These issues are long gone. The worst that you should be expecting is that you may have to run the game from the directory rather than the Steam shortcut which doesn't record playtime. Otherwise, it works fine. The campaign is fairly long - with two concurrently occurring separate scenarios. You can always run an independent strategy or dueling session too.\n\nI strongly suggest giving [i]Etherlords[/i] a chance if you either enjoy strategy or card games, or that you'd be curious about a successful combination of the two. Take it when you're feeling up for a challenge.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_updated": 1460453082, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452779380, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "11516932", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530993", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1407493275, "steamid": "76561198011119127", "num_games_owned": 631, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of the old school classics.\nSince the game was developed by Nival (Russian based), western market might not be familiar with the game.\n\nHowever there are few points why you might be interested to play this game even though it has been 13 years since it was released:\n\n- Game is Hard. No kidding, even normal difficulty will have you thinking over on what kind of strategy and builds you must use to win every campaing map.\n- Game is played out on a strategic map (similar to HOMM) & tactical battles (collectible card game).\n\nSome points to think before trying it out:\n- Game is Hard. It is a double edged sword...when playing campaign, think of it like a puzzle game (remember HOMM campaigns with impossible odds, but when you knew a particular trick it became easy).\n- Game runs on a locked 4:3 resolution.\n- Game pace is rather slow (you can improve it by choosing various game options, but still)\n\n\nHowever, I would recommend it to anyone born in 20th century.
