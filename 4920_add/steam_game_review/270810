It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version. \n\n[h1]Gameplay.[/h1]\nYou play as Emma Jones. She's a firefighter and your mission is to guide her along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, you'll collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more.\n\nThe camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.\n\nThe gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios.\n\nGraphically it's clearly based on [i]Minecraft[/i] fashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.\n\n[i]Jones On Fire[/i] could have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions, [i]Jones On Fire[/i] doesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.\n\n[quote][h1]Positive points. (+)[/h1][list]\n[*]Sincerely, none.\n[/list][/quote]\n\n[quote][h1]Negative points.

The only two are clicking and arrow controls, however the clicking controls aren't explained in depth, while the arrow controls only work on the arrow keys themselves, not WASD, what can hurt the hand/wrist.\n[/list][/quote]\n\nI think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good.", "timestamp_updated": 1493827480, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1474829997, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "17070126", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488825", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1440185299, "steamid": "76561197993179875", "num_games_owned": 846, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I highly recommend this adorable game.
