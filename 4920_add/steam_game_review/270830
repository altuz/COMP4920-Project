This one looks good at first but once you get into it, the bugs are too much to overcome.  I can't see the flight strips, I can only see my mouse cursor change when I mouse over them.  I tried changing the compatibility settings in the .pif file many different ways, nothing worked.  There is no exit menu command option anywhere in the game, simply clicking the x on the upper right only closes the window and doesn't shut the game down even though the computer will think its not running, it still is running.  Only way to exit game is to ctrl alt del and close the game in the task manager while the window is still open.", "timestamp_updated": 1498435531, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498435531, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 14, "total_reviews": 29}}
