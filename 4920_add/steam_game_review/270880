If you just want to get into a truck and drive, this is a perfect \"simulator/game\" for you.\n\nHowever, even in what would seem to be massive success with the Truck Simulator franchise, SCS seems to be coming up extremely short on the innovation and progression of the game.\n\nThe biggest issue is content. The base game simply does not have enough. First off, trucks. SCS seems to have only been able to secure a license with a single American truck manufacturer. That means, the only trucks in the game are made by Paccar. Kenworth, and Peterbilt. The saddest part is since these are both Paccar trucks, they are very similar with differences mostly being cosmetic. When it comes down to it, there are 4 trucks in the game. SCS said that more trucks were coming way back, but have been completely silent for quite a while about the trucks. I seriously doubt that any more are coming.\n\nNow, area. I understand the challenges of modeling maps and areas, but the TS series isn't exactly a revolution in map detail, given that they're only mapping linear corridors, really. The lack of area mapped so far is... disappointing. Instead of exceeding expectations, SCS has actually come up very short. Again, putting everything new behind DLC is one thing, but new areas aren't even available as DLC! \n\nNext to the core mechanics of the simulator. Let's face it, this is essentially a reskin of ETS2. If you're happy with the \"business side\" of running a trucking company to basically hiring drivers, leveling them up, and having enough garage spots and trucks for them compelling, then this will be satisfying. Because that's really all this game is beyond you driving your own truck. You can't own and manage your own trailers, you don't build contracts with certain shippers. There's so, so, so much more that can be done on the \"company management\" side of the game.\n\nFinally, to the business of \"simulating trucking\". There's some very basic aspects modeled beside driving the truck itself. Yes, the game calls it \"truck simulator\". Not \"trucking simulator\", and that's a good reason. Most of the aspects like weigh stations, fueling, sleeping, aren't really modeled in detail. It seems logical to model the dynamic of having a sleeper cab or not determine where you could rest. That's simply not here. \n\nSo, this game is a good experience for just relaxing and putting some miles in. It's just not very deep and SCS seems OK with that. There's probably opportunity here for someone else to come in and make something better, since there's clearly a market and SCS seems willing to rest on their laurels and slowly crank out DLCs to keep their business running rather than innovating and putting in new features.\n\nI'm gonna mark this as don't recommend simply because the game has some negatives and they need to be seen so expectations are properly set. As I said before, this game is great to pick up and relax and drive a bit, but don't expect much beyond the driving itself.", "timestamp_updated": 1505587931, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505587931, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35083604", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501299523, "steamid": "76561198273008791", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 8514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "8/10 \nneed more details to cities but I only recommend getting it if you have steering wheel", "timestamp_updated": 1505913068, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505913068, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34913440", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 40, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499088", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502518328, "steamid": "76561197971196625", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 10235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 7, "review": "I posted this on SCS's Facebook awhile back but this still rings true.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmerican Truck Simulator Release Date: Feb 2, 2016\n\nIt is currently, August 17, 2017.

I knew what I was getting into with limited content and I accepted paying that cost to help support SCS make this game into the awesome game I know it can be. The problem is I expected Some progress on this game. I sit here writing a review a year and a half after the games release with no real progress made.\n\nAt the current state that ATS is in we have 3 states all that were promised to us as part of the base game and took 4 months for just that to put in the third and fulfill peoples pre orders. Now we are slowly coming up to the 2 year mark and in that 2 years we have basically got what we were promised when we first bought the game. A pointless Rescale of the whole base games map which people are soon going to find is going to royally f them as the game develops later on down the line but wait and see on that one. \n\nNot to mention we are hoping the first real piece of DLC content in New mexico will be releasing later on this year and before the 2 year mark. This is for state number 4 out OF THE 44 CONTINENTAL STATES THEY STILL NEED TO COMPLETE. do the math 44/4 x 2 gives you a grand total of 22 THAT MEANS AT THIS RATE OF PROGRESS THIS GAME WILL NOT BE COMPLETED FOR 22 YEARS IF IT HAS NO DELAYS...\n\nLet's summarise before the 2 year mark we have our pre order bonus fulfilled had a unnecessary rescale and we are hoping to have the first real piece of DLC come out for this game before those 2 years are up, and a current progress of game completion in 22 years not the significant progress I was hoping for. \n\nThis is before I get into the fact that the developers seemingly have a sheer lack of interest working on this game at the moment, and would much rather work on there predecessor game of ETS 2. Want evidence of this let us do a comparison on what has came out for ATS vs ETS, since ATS has been released. \n\nATS has had 7 dlc's come out for it all cosmetic DLC's apart from one of them being map content, and that being the free pre order map bonus content of Arizona. Now compare with ETS 2 that has had 1 map release with France 1 that will be done before the 2 year mark which is Italy so I am counting this as 2 map releases and 22 new cosmetic DLC's released (primarily paint packs) in the year and a half that ATS has come out 7 DLC'S for ATS vs the 24 ETS 2 DLC packs or 23 if we do not count Italy so please people who try to critique this review tell me how that does not show them focusing more on ETS2? \n\nI NOW STATE CLEARLY because of the above there is no way in my right mind I can tell people that this is worth the \u00a314 price tag AT THE MOMENT IN IT'S CURRENT STATE with a current progress for the full game to be done in 22 years and a lack of interest by the Developers. \n\nI mean if you are a diehard fan of the Truck simulator series then sure pull the trigger on this game but be under no illusion this game is deprived of content and expect a lack of any real content for I would say a good 2 to 3 years while SCS wrap up everything on Euro Truck simulator 2. If on the other hand you are totally new to the truck driving simulation games and were thinking this would be a Awesome place to start STAY AWAY FROM IT FOR NOW, come back in 3 years when more has been added or better yet go and spend that \u00a314 on Euro Truck simulator 2 and you will get Way more bang for your buck. \n\nThis Review will be subject to change if and When New content releases for ATS and we start seeing the developer become interested in making this game again\"", "timestamp_updated": 1504577056, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504577056, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "35200149", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506424818, "steamid": "76561198156614967", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 134}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "8/10 Still need to work on him but i Love this game ATS <3\n\nI have ETS  too its better for now i hope ATS too :)", "timestamp_updated": 1506335760, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506335760, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35220388", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506867183, "steamid": "76561198023041713", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 129}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "GREAT GAME BUT TRAINS SHOULD BE A LOT LONGER.", "timestamp_updated": 1506426466, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506426466, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35337497", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506777284, "steamid": "76561198050024852", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I got this game because it seemed interesting...my nephew seemed to really enjoy it, but I just can't get into it as one could tell by the low amount of hours I've played on this.

The Mojave desert scenery gets stale REAL QUICK, and the second major bugbear I have is that these trucks have hoods, which is nice, but the places we have to deliver to? THERE IS NO SPACE for that massive freakin' hood, it can be extremely difficult manouvering a truck and trailer though an area that is CLEARLY not designed to support large vehicles.\n\nSo play area is super limited, truck selection is EXTREMELY limited, unless you get mods...and at the moment it's starting to feel that modders can do a better job at this than SCS Software themselves can.  I played European Truck Simulator 2, and there is a LOT more to see and do, you get ALL of Europe to drive though, the UK and even Norway and Sweden, ETS2 is far more worthwhile than ATS is, you have more to see, more vehicles to choose from, and let's not forget the paint jobs, American Truck Simulator has very few paintjobs to choose from, lots of colours but very little decorations.\n\nMaybe instead of relying on pages of DLC and modders to make their game great, SCS Sofware and many other game developers should do the right thing by consumers and give us COMPLETED games to play, rather than a little taste with the rest locked behind paywall after paywall.", "timestamp_updated": 1506778354, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506778354, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "34807618", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489032", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504837313, "steamid": "76561198402307123", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Get this game if you want to have a driving simulator in which nothing special ever happens and you can stop a huge truck with a heavy trailer from going at 75 mph to 0 in 1 second.", "timestamp_updated": 1504844062, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504844062, "votes_down": 9}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6005, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 439, "total_reviews": 6444}}
