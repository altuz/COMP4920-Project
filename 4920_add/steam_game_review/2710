Eugen Systems are the developer of games such as the Wargame series and R.U.S.E. The game is set in an unknown period though seems to be set around the 1990s-early 2000s. A global energy crisis occurs and the uprise of terrorist organisations allow them to use the crisis to their advantage to gain publicity. However, suspense is great as to revealing whether a president of an existing major oil company was in charge of the crisis and the uproar of terrorist attacks. You, the player take control of Task Force Talon to fight back the terrorist threat that is secretly hitting many American nations including San Francisco, Washington D.C. among other worldwide nation states.\n\nThe game sounds great on paper but the question of does it live up to that expectation is present. And yes, I can simply say that this game immerses the player into the story through the games mix of in-game cut scenes and a real-life movie. Instead of in-game cut scenes during each mission there will be a live movie playing that continues the story through actors. I really like this approach to the cut scenes because this game was released in 2005 and in-game cutscenes would have been dull at best. Therefore by placing actors to enhance and further the story it allows for more elements and reach in the story compared to in-game cinematics.\n\nAccording to the game mission selection feature there are 33 missions. These missions are crafted with profound engagement and are relatively simple. The main missions are solid. They progress the story, are intense, and they are entertaining. As the game progresses the missions and story improves in quality. Missions would include taking a stronghold and/or defending your base or secondary missions of destroying field generators to assist in your main mission. The use of secondary missions are substantial as just mentioned as if you complete them they provide benefits. For example, destroying enemy field generators help in limiting the enemy weapons. Or capturing a bank would provide more money for your base to build troops, among others. I completed the game in about 13.5 hours on normal difficulty. Each mission had an appropriate length of completion whilst varying in difficulty.\n\nThe gameplay is your typical gameplay for a strategy birds-eye view game. You control multiple units and move them along the battlefield while completing your objectives. It is good at best at times, however the pathfinding can be ridiculous. For one having many vehicular units is annoying because they get caught over little objects like civilian vehicles. Moving the units is annoying as there are no options for formations to move your best units at the front followed by your weaker/more useless units. So other than those two complaints gameplay was good. \n\nThe graphics are pretty solid for a 2005 game. They flourish in showcasing the buildings, locations, and capturing the various locations. The sound is pretty annoying including the main menu theme. I liked the dialogue in the game quite a bit. The dialogue is short, sweet, engaging and intense, which improved the quality of the story.\n\nTowards the technical aspect things are not so great. There is no full screen option in the game. The game is capped at 1280x720. However, the limited resolution is understandable for an 11 year old game and there is a mod to allow for higher resolutions. You cannot access steam overlay, which is a real nuisance. Basically if you want to talk on steam or do anything else on your computer while you play you have to quit the game as minimising will not work. It is a major nuisance as specified but if you are playing for multiple hours at a time it does not overly bother you. And there are framerate hitches when moving along the map or selecting other parts of the map.\n\nLastly the game was recently updated to allow for Windows 10. Fair to say it works like a breeze.\n\nOverall, Act of War: Direct Action is a very unfamiliar game amongst people on Steam judging by its 80 reviews. But for $2.99, I totally recommend this game. You will get a lot of value out of the game with multiple game modes but you will enjoy the story and the gameplay aspect of the game. The rating is low due to its technical issues but I can't penalise it overly due to its age. In saying that, the positives are strong. 6.75/10.\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

The units don't have anything witty or neccessarily interesting to say; they instead respond in ways that you'd expect their real-life counterparts to respond.
