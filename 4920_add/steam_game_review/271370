I had the flickering issue on the main menu page --which didn't clear up and there's no help or bug fix to resolve it.

Unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, the game fails to bring that excitement. A decent amount of work was put into making this game, but that is all - just decent. Although for a 2004 game the graphics are up to par, there are notable interface and menu design problems that make it difficult for players to play as smoothly as they did with Transport Tycoon and the Railroad Tycoon series. To be specific, the menus and features of the game-play are not  not intuitively designed (hard to navigate). Another issue is the limited amount of information the game provides about vehicles, stations, industries and cities.\n\nI will not say that I am disappointed at this game, but I will say that I hope whoever continues the legacy of making transportation games, uses way more care and attention in desigining such games by learning from the mistakes of their predecessors.\n\nAll in all, Tranport Giant is a FAIR attempt at reviving the dead era of transportation games, but in falls short of being exciting and addictive. JoWood Entertainment, the make of the game, is no longer with us! Hopefully someone will come around and end our wait by making the next awesome \"transport tycoon\" game.", "timestamp_updated": 1427649795, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427649795, "votes_down": 12}, {"recommendationid": "26240212", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500056", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1477539180, "steamid": "76561198263737167", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I paid for this game downloaded it heard great reviews tryed to play 5 different times play for about 5 minutes and all of a sudden none of the controls would work so i am deleting and giving thumbs down", "timestamp_updated": 1477538555, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477538555, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 22, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 54, "total_reviews": 76}}
