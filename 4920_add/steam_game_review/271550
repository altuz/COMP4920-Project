It's not a time management game as the time is only for arbitary bonus points. Unlike Alawar and similar light strategy games that follow overhead paths, this one goes the vertical and horizontal route. Also, it is possible to use up resources the wrong way and have to restart a level whereas the Alawar ones tend to not have a way to paint yourself into a corner.\n\nSome more aspects that make this game stand out to others in its class is the unique characters and story. Instead of following the tired \"inspired by history\" or \"rescue the whatever\" pattern, this one involves completely fictional creatures, the Tribloos. The story and dialog were entertaining and kept me going to figure out how it would end.\n\nConsidering this game was essentially made by 3 people, it's very impressive. It was a nice addition to my casual game selection. There's nothing stressful about this game, the levels and puzzles can be worked out, and getting 100% achievements is simply a matter of playing the game, including the Challenge levels.\n\nThe price is a bit on the high end, especially since the game has been out for over 3 years now, so you may want to wait for a sale. However, dedicated casual gamers might be willing to pay full price.\n\n[url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=672508107[/url]\n\n---\n\n[i]For more...[/i] [b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/recommended/]My Reviews[/url][/b] || [i]My casual gaming...
