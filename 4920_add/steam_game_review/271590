Considering I ported my character over from Xbox 360, it should be at least double that. \n\n\nSo lets say 700 hours. \n\nI have spent aproximately 700 hours playing this video game.\n\nYet I cannot recommend it. \n\nYes I have had some of the best gaming I've ever had with this game. I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign, I played online mostly and had a a character legitimately over level 100 and with a nice sum of money set aside. I even supported the game further with the very occasional shark card. I was there for the DNS glitch that caused 9 billion dollar bounties to occur, and I was there when they cut literally everyone's funds to 500,000 as a \"fix\"\n\nBut one day I was playing and some guy joins the server, forcibly teleports myself and a handful of others to him, freezes us, and makes bags of money rain from the sky. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not stupid, I know people hack and people give out money. I've seen countless people ask for them and praise them etc. I've generally ignored them, but this guy didn't give me much of a choice. \n\nRegardless once I figured out what was happening I left the server. I didn't want the money in my bank so I blew it customizing street cars and blowing them up. \n\nA couple hours later I was temporarily banned and my character was reset. I lost all of my cars, including old ones with rare paint jobs that could only be obtained by an exploit that had been patched, not to mention the majority of that 700 hours I'd put into having a character I liked. \n\nRockstar punished me for something that was thrust upon me. My ingame wallet was raped and they decided to blame the victim.\n\nThere was no way for me to voice my displeasure to Rockstar. No appeals process for them to hear my case, check the evidence, and see my innocence. \n\nThat was several months ago. I uninstalled the game and let it go. \n\nI'm only writing this now so that others can see what they're getting into. \n\nYes, as I've said, this game is incredibly fun and contains hours upon hours of content. From an objective standpoint, its very good value for money and the free, regular, DLC is a nice touch. \n\nWhat ruins all of that is the way Rockstar treats its customers. There's no consistency, and no compassion. I know people in real life that have been taking free money for ages and they've never had any trouble. Yet it happens to me once, without my consent, and I get temp banned and lose literally everything. \n\nWhat motivation is there to play legitimately then? If people who do can lose everything in an instant with no way to appeal the decision, and those who don't can get away with it indefinitely. \n\nHell you actually get a bonus for playing illegitimately because those people can just make new accounts and hack their way back to wealth and experience. \n\nRockstar, if you actually end up reading this, please start treating your customers with some compassion.

I think theifs is the best way to describe these companies. I can confirm to those of you reading these reviews saying \"surely they wouldn't be removing in game funds that people pay $80/\u00a360+ for?\" that it is really happening. I will split this review into two parts; Single Player and Multiplayer.\n\n[u] Singleplayer\t[/u]\nThe story and how it plays out for single player is possibly the best out there. The story is fantasic, and there are very few missions that aren't fun to play. Also, the implementation of an in-game stock market (although not the best thing ever) is really cool to me. Pairing this with missions that allow you to manipulate this stock market, you can earn millions, even billions. But this leads to the issue of there being nothing to spend it on. Singleplayer mode for some reason does not get content from Rockstar's updates. The only way you can access them is by grinding multiplayer for days to afford the likes of one car, however we will get to that. \nOverall, Singleplayer is absolutely fantastic, except from the fact that after the story there is little to do unless you are interested in mods, in which case you will probably love this game for that.\n\n[u] Multiplayer\t[/u]\n\nOh yay, this train wreck. Okay, so I have 1,151 hours on Steam for GTA V, with around 1,000 being for multiplayer. I converted my stats from PS3 so likely have around double that. I know what I am talking about with this game. The multiplayer in this game is absolutely trash now. I was always able to look past the grind in this game, but it has gotten to the point now where money is so hard to make, and things are so expensive that it is no longer fun. At all. Rockstar and Take-Two have become money whores, so much so that they are taking purchased in-funds away for NO REASON and will accuse you of hacking the game. If you refuse to purchase the in-game currency (like me), then you will have to grind. Now, at least in my ways, around 1 hour of in game grinding will bring in, at most, around $300,000, and that's if youre grinding really hard, non stop, and have the most lucrative in game businesses in the game. When starting out, you will be lucky to bring in $100,000 per hour, so as you can see, it's a pretty tough grind anyway. The last update called \"Smuggler's Run\" brought some of the most expensive content in GTA Online to date, with things costing $1,500,000 upwards. I had 2.6 million removed from an in-game challenge called Criminal Mastermind that took me months to complete, getting $10,000,000 from. This was removed because it was \"modded or cheated money\". So, 6 tickets to Rockstar later, I have quite rudely been told by a robot to go fuck myself and that I'm not getting it back, and that's why I've finally decided that enough is enough with this game.\nSomething that I have always found interesting in GTA Online is that you can buy a yacht - a real calling card, with the most expensive one sitting at $10,000,000. The highest in-game currency you can purchase is $8,000,000, sitting at $100 real money. That to me has always seemed ridiculous for what is already a fairly expensive game.\nAlso, if you want to mod singleplayer, thats fine in their eyes (not really since they shut down OpenIV, a company they supported but hey let's let bygones be bygones), but if you DARE go near their money making method and try to make things fun, you will be banned and stripped of everything you have online.\n\n[u] Overall\t[/u]\nThis review could go on forever, about a game/company that steals from their fans and shuts down companies who they once directed their fans to, but I think it's time to sum it up. For what was for a very long time my favourite game ever, I would highly recommend that you never go near this game, even if you recieve it for free. I will never touch another Rockstar or Take-Two game, and hope that their next game flops and they learn no treat their fans better, however, if you're not giving them money, they hope you fuck yourself.\n\nUpdate: Went on today to see if I had been refunded yet, and guess what!!

Probabaly the absolute best single player game of all time. If you are looking into this game for SP, then its a no brainer.\n\nHowever, next we have \"GTA Online\"\nIts a mixed review.\nI have a lot of hours into online and I will continue to put a lot of additional hours into online.\nPROS:\nIt gets constant content added several times a year the release \"free\" DLC's\nThere really is a lot to do, if you wish you can really role play the most corrupt criminal to the fullest extent.\n\nCONS:\nI'll just start out with the biggest con.\nThe game has clearly taken a big turn in the last couple years and its intesifying toward micro-transactions.\nIts pretty obvious, the keep raising the prices of items you purchase in game, compared to the amount of money you earn. Unless you are dedicating your life to this game, its pretty hard to obtain the in game items. And if you are starting out as a new player, the amount of money you need to catch up is really a huge obstacle. \nI am not one of those people who are defiantly against micro transactions, but these aren't even fair micro transactions.\nRockstar keeps raisning the price of the in game items, but the amount of money given out on a \"shark card\" has never been adjusted. \nHere is an example, a 8 Million dollar shark card (unless on sale) costs $99 always has.\nIt use to be that most items were under 1 million with the extremely high dollar things around $2 million.\nSo for $99 you could typically buy say 5-15 items for $99. \nFast forward to today. \nMost items are over 1 million closer to 2 million on average) and the most expensive items are 4 million with a yet to be released item that is going to be 6.5 million.  Rockstar is really going for a money grab here and they aren't even attempting to hide it. Not to mention that the latest DLC the amount of money you can earn per hour has actually gone down from the previuous ones. So higher prices to buy stuff, lower income from doing work. So you are forced to not really play the new DLC but the old ones for cash.  Which is a shame because the new missions are actually very fun, they just dont pay well.\n\nSo if you are new and want to ever come close to catching up to current players you have 3 choices. 1.) Buy Shark Cards and ALOT of them. Several hundred dollars worth. 2.) Play an insane amount of hours, quit life and play this game every day, all day long  3.) Cheat - Find mods or a modder and get \"modded money\". Warning you can actually get banned for this. I cant even beleive I am giving this advice out, I use to depise money modders, but given the greed coming out of Rockstar now days, I really understand why new players would do it, and I dont frankly care anymore.\n\nSo you might ask, Why do I have this game as recommmened still.\n\nWhen it comes down to the game itself, single player and even online. \nIt's fun, there is a lot of varitey, I can do missions, I can race cars, I can pvp, I can play mini games (and there are dozens of varietys of games) I've played 600 hours and honeslty still to this day havent even played 1/2 the things you can do. There is a massive amount of content. The game is fun.\n\nThe politics behind the scenes is horrible, the comminity is toxic, and the micro tranactions are getting out of control.  But at the core its still fun and I still enjoy it after all this time. \nBut on the other hand we probabbaly wouldnt get all these updates without the microtransactions, so there is that factor too.\n\nI rate GTA 5\n\nSingle Player gameplay: \n10/10\n\nOnline Gameplay:\n8/10 (-2 for community)\n\nVariety of things to do:\n10/10\n\nGame Updates:\n8/10\n\nMicrotranactions:\n1/10", "timestamp_updated": 1504630984, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "11", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504630984, "votes_down": 95}, {"recommendationid": "34986677", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512292", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504493297, "steamid": "76561198080515307", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "Even with all the money they make, they still cost you $100 USD for 8,000,000.

With all the new buildings constantly being added it beings to quickly drain your cash adding up to be almost 2000+ dollars. It sounds small but it adds up really quick. \n\nAnother issue coming up with it is that things are becoming way too over priced for any average person.

Then have the balls saying \"You wanna buy overpriced virtual crap?\"\n\nThis game has become shit, nothing is reasonable for a casual player to get and its hard to start off as almost everything is behind a pay wall or grind for hours upon hours for a tiny amount of cash.\n\nSave your money and buy something better.", "timestamp_updated": 1506615247, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "6", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505962974, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34785122", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503781", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504499937, "steamid": "76561198053574030", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's a shame because the game is really fun to play with friends but the online is becoming flooded with modders.
