This game combines linking cards to form damaging, defensive and dirty combos with a quirky but well-realized world populated with rivals, eccentrics and people who look like Easter Island heads. This thing is as wonderful as it is hard to describe. \n\nThat having been said, I'd not recommend it it anyone who hasn't watched the original Yu-Gi-Oh or at least knows what that is. You will not get the jokes. I also warn that if you want a challenge, you won't get it until your about halfway through the game. Thankfully for people like me who have become slightly disillusioned with the whole TGC scene, which I'd imagine is anyone looking at this review, the lack of difficulty is made up for with the ability to just play against characters for fun. Its good to see so many people interested in things like this, things that are genuine, charming and just self-aware enough to look smart without going overboard.\n\n9/10, for simply not being ENOUGH. It needs more card effects, preferrably crazy and more crazy characters to round it out a bit further, preferably before the final boss. The shortness doesn't bother me, because I feel no pressure to finish it quickly, and the lack of multiplayer is more of a nuicance than a real problem. As for the grinding, yeh, you need to do a little bit, but it feels like a side effect of the game genre, and I'd rather do that than pay real life money at least.", "timestamp_updated": 1494908220, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493165833, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31030749", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1492308899, "steamid": "76561198042605380", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Edit: I decided to flip this to recommend.  It entertained me just enough for me to play through it, most games can't make that claim.  It does have some \"atmosphere\".  It's still kinda \"meh\" though.\n\nIf I could rate this game as \"Neutral\" or \"Meh\", that would be the rating.  Since the question is, \"Can you recommend it?\", then the answer is \"no\".  If the question was, \"Can you reject this game?\", the answer would again be \"No.\n\nI have 15 hours of playtime, and the game is played out.  I don't feel like there is any replay value here.  Music is kind of nice and atmospheric, but not anything that screams \"I must download to MP3 player\".  Art is interesting, but not inspiring.  \n\nI was looking for a game like Shandalar, and I appreciate that this game isn't an online experience requiring card pack buys with real money.
