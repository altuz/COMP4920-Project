Much like the first game, the base mechanic is that tiles are either marked blue or give a number representing the number of blue tiles adjacent to them, somewhat similar to minesweeper. But the game takes that base mechanic, adds a few other basic mechanics (number of blue in a column, marking that some need to be consequtive, having some '?' tiles), and builds it into a wonderfully satisfying and relaxing puzzle game. The music is ambient, and actions taken in game generate tones that go with the music as well. All puzzles can be solved without guessing and have a single solution, so when playing, I find it most enjoyable to take my time and only take action when I know it is correct.\n\nThe puzzles largely pick up where the first game left off. While there is some introduction to the mechanics, it is done in levels that serve to introduce the mechanics while also providing some challenge if you played through the first game. The levels (36 in total) grow in difficulty more quickly than in the first, but even the last few levels, although they can take some time to carefully comb through, remain enjoyable and approachable. The new mechanic, blue cells with numbers that give the number of tiles within 2 blocks, is used well, and makes for neat levels that are just as good, if not better than the levels in the first game. It took me about 7 hours to play through the game originally, and a majority of that time is on the last few, larger, levels (it took me around 40 minutes to do level 35 when I played through a second time, though I probably could have been faster if I'd wanted).\n\nAll achievements but 'Perfectionist' will be unlocked simply by playing through the levels. 'Perfectionist' requires that you beat all levels with no more than 1 mistake each, so if you play through each level the first time with that in mind, it too will be unlocked after a single playthrough. If any levels are completed with more than 1 mistake, you can simply redo them again, so all in all the achievements for this game are straightforward.\n\nThe Hexcells series is wonderful, and I highly suggest you pick up the complete pack of all 3 if you enjoy peaceful deductive puzzle games.", "timestamp_updated": 1505019717, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505019717, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35038349", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492058", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505706846, "steamid": "76561198005655897", "num_games_owned": 1001, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The addition of question marks to replace numbered hexes makes this less of a logic puzzle game and more of a guessing game.", "timestamp_updated": 1505706892, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505706892, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 433, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 22, "total_reviews": 455}}
