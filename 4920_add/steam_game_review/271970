Hero and Daughter is one that does, with consistently funny writing and entertaining plot developments that keep each chapter fresh. While primarily a grinding game, H&D actually has competent gameplay as a result of the large cast with their diverse skills, town building elements, dungeon events, and very fast battles. There's a surprising amount of content in the game, with things only really starting to slow down in the second to last chapter, and the final chapter naturally offers you the ultimate bosses that you'll need hours of grinding to beat. Might be a pain for those total completionists, but if you're willing to pass on the bonus bosses you'll get a pretty well-paced and fun experience out of it.", "timestamp_updated": 1498599559, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498599559, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31476658", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510853", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502410082, "steamid": "76561197997453217", "num_games_owned": 443, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "CRASH WARNING: This game hates itself and will melt with regular frequency once you reach endgame content. After some searching it doesn't seem there's a reliable fix for this--so as much as I'd love to recommend spending many hours grinding away in this happy waifu-world, you'll hit the crash wall eventually. For that, I have to say no sale.\n\nIt's a sad state for an RPG love-letter that always gives you something worthwhile to do with your time; a collection of character content, spicey dialogue, minigames and RPG-type extras. The raw amount of characters will ensure that you find at least one waifu in the mix, and if decorating your imaginary home is your kind of jam, there's also no shortage of tinkery homestuffs to make your virtual abode cosy.\n\nThe combat has enough unique skills that it becomes more than button-bashing in certain instances, and the individual types and bonus enemies mean you can always find an extra challenge.
