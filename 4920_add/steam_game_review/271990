This is by far one of their best games I've played!  And I've played some really good games, and really bad games.  This one is a solid 8/10.   If anything bad can be said about the game is that its a little too open, and very little direction is given.\n\nI actually the first time through the game had to stop, because I couldn't figure out a way to make any more progress whatsoever.  I had to look at the guide multiple times in order to figure out how to beat this game.  It's not bad in the aspect of difficulty (unless doing true nightmare mode) but it is confusing on the 'where do I go now' portion.  Several key items are in areas you normally wouldn't expect, or you do things in ways that are a little too obvious.  \n\nThe biggest example is that there's a big brown mouse at the beginning of the game that there is no real indication that he's your next party member XD.  You have to talk to him to unlock the next area and get the giggle bell, which gives you a key to unlock stuff in egypt, and the list goes on.\n\nBut this is by far a super creative and fun game!
