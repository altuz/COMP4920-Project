It has a tutorial which you can play in offline mode or you can join players online. \n\nSupport 10/10\nThis game is still actively supported by the developer.  I got a response in a very short time on their discussion forums. \n\nGraphics 8/10\n\nGraphics are unique and interesting.  \n\nSounds and Music 9/10\n\nSounds and graphics are near perfect for its genre. \n\nGameplay 9/10\n\nGameplay is awesome.  Always something interesting and it is enough that you will be enjoying it for months to come.  \n\nFun 9/10\n\nHave a lot of spare time because it is fun and somewhat addicting. \n\n\nPrice:  I have over 750 hours online with this game so I have to say that the price is definintely good for the amount of fun that you will be getting out of the game.  \n\nBugs and Execution:  Occassionally server connection time outs but the game it self has no bugs and runs flawlessly on  XP , and windows 7. (I have not tested it on windows  8 or 8.1) \n\nOverall : This game is awesome and worth the price.

Multiple players on the same team are able to have different vehicles. Each vehicle has a moving/shooting/guarding sort of system. You can upgrade these systems accordingly right at the beginning or throughout the game. Careful though, when you do die you do have to upgrade your system again. Right click enables the aim, left click shoots, and space engages the weapon/defense at your will. You can move as you shoot, however moving is done in increments and there is a \"slow refill gas\" gauge indicating after moving that a certain amount of time is needed to recover and move again. Shooting is made easier by pressing the number 1 to scroll quicker through the weapons. \n\nIf this game is on sale BUY IT! This is a game I'd hate to see be called a graveyard as it isn't because there is a lot here. \n\nPM me if you have this game and want to play!

This awesome game went from hundreds of people playing it during the open beta - every server full, every new server instantly filling - to dead in months. Why? Price. Hyperbol was $20 for most of its lifespan, and while it's still not technically dead, it's still also not $5. This game would have been a tremendous success had it come out as a F2P game (something Steam didn't support back in 2007) but instead the developers were stubborn and steadfast in killing their own game.\n\nThere is literally no reason for this to be more than $5 right now. I say that as someone who waited for the pre-purchase to end in 2007 so that I could pay the full price for the game. It was worth $20 then, but now? Well, there's not a single active game to be found, unless you like playing with half-baked AI. Should this ever go on sale for less than $2, I'm buying it for 20 people on my friends list.
