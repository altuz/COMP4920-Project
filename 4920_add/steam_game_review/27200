You win shiny things, and break records and your keyboard.\n\nIt ran smoothly for me and some of the events had a bit of a learning curve. It suffers from some lazy moments (did it have to be rushed out for the Beijing Olympics, I wonder?) but is basically fun.\n\nIt's certainly not presented in '3D comic style' - more 'trying to be real but not quite getting there because we don't have the money' style.
