It really does look nice and as far as I can tell it's all-original.  The sound is especially good with some really well done environment ambience and some really memorable tunes.   However, the gameplay itself just really turned me away from continuing this series.  And by the way, I found out just now that it was a series.  Never noticed the part of the description clearly noting this.  My fault I guess.  \n\nI really tried to stay engaged with this game after the first few really well done opening acts, but it steadily became more and more apparent that this game has issues that I don't want to be subscribed to.  The character development, game mechanic-wise, is nonexistant.  Leveling up has a neglegible impact on combat with every character stepping up through the same present 30 HP tiers.  The only other attribute not directly associated with gear is physical strength, and raising this didn't seem to actually change anything in combat.  Basically, your stats are your equipment, and there are only a few sets in the game.  Grinding is hardly worth it for just a few additional HP.  \n\nThe battles are beyond basic as well.  Think Final Fantasy Mystic Quest here.  There are 3 status effects, each has maybe 1 or 2 enemies that use it exclusively, and aside from that it's just trading blows until someone runs out of health.  There is basically one cheap-shot strategy to beat every boss:  keep tripping them every round (it'll almost always succeed) and let the rest of your squad wail on them unimpeded.  Or you can just let the vampire wear the curse armor (she finds it almost immediately), and she is then essentially invicible the whole game by way of the drain ability.  Speaking of abilities, there are only two character that even do anything besides attack, and they are each basically pigeon-holed into a set function.  The healer does absolutely nothing but heal/shield/cure, and the main character can either trip or steal, however I never had the steal ability succeed even once in the whole game.  Not sure if it works or not to be honest.  \n\nI have very little to say about the story really, despite this being one of the key aspects of a good RPG.  It starts out really promising with an interesting premise and characters, but for whatever reason it gets about a halfway into it and then devolves into what I would describe as a sequence of random events.  You go random places with no real compulsion to do so, you do random things for random people, and then thankfully by plot contrivance one of the random people give you your mcguffin for no real reason.  They just happened to have it I guess.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is the quest and map design.  I'm not sure how long I actually spent playing as I went AFK a couple hours here and there to do other things, but I'd estimate it was at least 5 ot 6 hours.  Take out the time spent walking endless back and forth from opposite ends of the game and I bet you could cut it down to 1/4 of that.  So. Much Walking.  You have no idea how much uneventful walkthrough you're in for with this game.  There is a fast travel system, but it is prohibitively expensive and less than adequate for the amount of back-and-forth the quests have you doing.\n\nAveyond looks nice, sounds nice, and had potential at the start, but the story just sort of wanders off halfway through and sadly I found the gameplay to be just flat out boring.  I'll be interested to see what this dev does next though, and hopefully they'll put a bit of poilish on those combat mechanics and come up with something that's as enjoyable to play as it is to see and hear.", "timestamp_updated": 1422430170, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422430170, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "9053379", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 70, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566289", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1392123546, "steamid": "76561197990016510", "num_games_owned": 593, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If you have already made experience with RPG Maker games and found them decent enough, you will find this game decent.\nIf you like these games, you will like this one.\n\nA classic Top-down RPG game.\n\nIt shows it was not made with a budget to speak of.\nThis is noticable from the beginning, as the 'Options' menu is the bare minimum.\nThere is no resolution to choose from.\nWindowed is not recommended because of the resulting low resolution setting.\nThe sound is also restricted to On/Off with no option to choose a specific level.\nButton remapping is also a thing dearly missed by me.\n\nStill, i find it enjoyable.\nThe story (2h in) is written well enough to keep me interested.\nBoth keyboard and mouse controls are viable.\nCombat is simple with a classic turn based system.\n\nIf you are someone who needs a lot of options in the options menu and are more used to modern style games, you will be disappointed.\nBut, If you are looking for a classic turn based RPG experience, I can recommend this game to you.\nIt feels quite nostalgic.\n\nI've also researched a little bit about this series and found out, that all parts of the \"Orbs of Magic\" series (this is part 1 of 4) are already available for download at amaranthia.com for 10.99USD, though i recommed getting the game during a Steam sale or promotion, as the standard price is set a little bit too high.\n\nIn the end, it is a game made by only a few people, enthusiastic about old school rpg's and it shows.", "timestamp_updated": 1392123931, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1392123931, "votes_down": 17}, {"recommendationid": "9040924", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 57, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521479", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1417267629, "steamid": "76561198089326034", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Pretty fun game even though i got lost for hours and managed to complete the game.

From what I understand this is the first part (of four) of the third game in the Aveyond series; a curious place to start for Steam gamers unfamiliar with Amaranth's work.\n\nAs with most games made with RPG Maker, writing quality weighs heavily upon whether or not a title is worth your time and money.  Here Lord of Twilight is thankfully relatively solid.  Most attempts at humor fall flat, but character dialogue is decent enough, if occassionally a bit unnatural.  The overarching plot is kind of all over the place at this point, and the game ends on a really weird note, but of course this is only the introductory chapter of a larger narrative.\n\nGraphics are nothing to write home about, with much of what's on display being RM stock assets.  Character designs are attractive though, and the handful of original assets are done well.  Map design is occasionally frustrating, particularly in towns, which have a tendency to be needlessly convoluted and complex (a lot of dead ends, no shadowing to indicate changes in elevation, etc).  \n\nMany games using this engine are plagued with slowdown, but Aveyond runs smoothly throughout.\n\nThe soundtrack is really the standout feature here, featuring catchy town themes and one of the better battle tunes I've heard in recent memory.\n\nOverall I would cautiously recommend Lord of Twilight.
