The gameplay feels good, the controls are perfect. But, Why I'm saying this? Because there are a bunch of ported games from IOS and Android that have clunky controls, lack of undo and reset button, slow transitions/animations, and some waste a lot of time in load a new level or restart the level. \n\nAbout the puzzle itself, some of them can be really tough but you can purchase a hint to make the first move, and this helps a lot when you don't know what color and segment switch. \n\n- My only concern is the lack of achievements and trading cards, some people find this pointless but for me, this gives the game more value to my purchase, I would love to craft some badges and complete 100% of the game.", "timestamp_updated": 1500582369, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500582213, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33896790", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500897941, "steamid": "76561198391253136", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Nice game.\nUnique art and gameplay.", "timestamp_updated": 1501389378, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501389378, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34371353", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502841", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1492587643, "steamid": "76561198025204475", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Lovely little puzzle game.
