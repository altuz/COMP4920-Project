The hype died down after a couple of hours of gameplay, though. Sure, the writing is similar to Planescape: Torment (to the point of being self-plagiarism) but it lacks it's depth and originality. The battle mechanics are better suited for a boardgame (the pacing just doesn't work for the video game), the characters are annoying (especially the useless little girl), the skills are weird and the main plot line is boring.

If you\u2019re expecting nail-biting combat, labyrinthian skill trees, oodles of loot, and a robust class system\u2026this is not the game for you. However, if you\u2019re after detailed and rich storytelling, complex characters, and an immersive and unexpected world that demands your focus and attention, then look no further.\n\nIn some ways, I was fortunate in coming to this game late, as it gave me a chance to read lots of reviews and reactions. I can definitely understand how it may have been mis-marketed early on, setting up some false expectations, but I think enough time has passed that the game can be understood and judged for what is now, rather than for what people were expecting it to be.\n\nFurthermore, I was actually drawn to this game specifically due to some of the things that others have complained about. Chiefly: the insane amount of text (serious, this makes War and Peace look like a pamphlet), and the lack of combat. In short, this game offers an alternate take on what an RPG can be, and that\u2019s exactly what I was looking for.\n\nStill, there are pros and cons. Other reviews here have done a better job of this, but here are some that stand out for me. \n\nI really like how combat is handled. An encounter is called a \u201ccrisis\u201d, and there are multiple ways to resolve it that don\u2019t require fighting. Essentially, based on how you want to play the game and types of characters you build, you can choose to either take a social approach (lie, bribe, intimidate, etc), a mechanical approach (lore, repair, manipulating things), or the old standby of fighting. This gave me more choices as to how I wanted to play a scenario, based on how I was feeling at that time, and it also gives the game more replayability. My first play through (based on someone else\u2019s advice) focused on the social skills (I basically lied my way through most encounters, which was great), but now I\u2019m curious to go through again with a different focus. And, as I said, it\u2019s nice to take a break from hack-n-slash once in a while. The flipside is that each crisis, no matter what approach you take, is unfairly stacked against you. Things usually go terribly wrong (you\u2019re always outnumbered, never have enough supplies, and AI is irritating). You will die a lot, but that\u2019s actually the point. Much like Planescape, death is merely a gateway to another realm, with it\u2019s own set of quests and characters and things to do, and then you can easily re-enter the world of the living and try again (note that there are a few deaths which are permanent, so saving frequently is still a good idea).\n\nThe other criticism of combat is true: there isn\u2019t much of it. For a game of this length, there are probably no more than a dozen crisis encounters. Maybe that\u2019s an exaggeration, but combat was very, very, very few and far between. However, each crisis is a major event, so they make up for frequency with complexity. Some of the encounters can require a long-haul commitment and take quite a while to get through, so that also makes up for the lack of numbers. \n\nNow, if the lack of combat is a turn off for you, then it\u2019s best to give the game a pass. However, in my opinion, it more than makes up for the reduced role that fighting takes, by expanding on some of the other things that role playing can offer. Things like story, character building, choices, exploration, interactions, are all extremely rich, detailed and rewarding. \n\nAnd I suppose that\u2019s where the other justified criticism comes in. All of the aforementioned role playing elements are almost entirely text based. Yes this is a modern game with visuals, sounds, and UI\u2026but the heart is un-abashedly old-school text. Seriously, reams and reams of it. However, the writing is, with few exceptions, fantastic. And sometimes, the images conjured in my imagination are more powerful than anything a visual could render. The scenes, descriptions, ideas, dialog and details are simply mesmerizing. This is a thoroughly constructed and very deep world. It is worth every syllable. \n\nYou do run into some hammy lines now and then, but considering the sheer volume of text, a few throw-away phrases hardly dent the epicness of the whole. I can\u2019t stress enough just how rich and imaginative this game is. There are enough ideas in here for a hundred games, if not more. Some are fanciful, others disturbing, and yet others quite profound.  Ultimately whatever you do think of the game, there are many ideas and images in here that will stay with you for a very long time. Maybe haunt is the better word. This is also true to the mood of the game, as it is just as cruel as it is verbose. This is a painful, spiteful, gruesome, and utterly disgusting world that you are inhabiting. Nothing turns out well, for anyone, ever. But it\u2019s also insatiably riveting. \n\nThe only other complain that I might add, which isn\u2019t a bad thing depending on your viewpoint, is that items and trade are rather disappointing. There is finite number of items in the this game, and finite number of merchants who have a finite amount of money. Maybe I\u2019m just spoiled by games where looting is a reward, and trading is a skill. Not so here. If you get carried away and use up all the healing potions, life will suck for you, as there are no more. And the merchants are dirt poor, so you\u2019re never going to get rich, which is fine as there\u2019s nothing of interest to buy anyway. The most coveted objects in the entire game world are the Numenera themselves. These are basically single purpose objects that can do amazing, deadly, or powerful things in combat and beyond. And the whole Numenera system is really cool and well executed in the game\u2026BUT there are just so darn few of them in the world that I wound up hoarding them, rather than using them, because I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever find more. As for the weapons, there\u2019s almost zero point in trying to upgrade. The difference it makes in a crisis is minimal, and there just aren\u2019t many options to choose from. Not to say there aren\u2019t surprises, the Merecasters are fun, for example. When activated they essentially launch you immediately into a mini side quest, a sort of choose-your-own-adventure. Depending on how you do, you might gain a bonus or something from them, plus they\u2019re a nice departure from the main narrative.\n\nDespite any minor flaws, I definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to try something that\u2019s beyond the rote RPG. It\u2019s very rare for me to want another playthrough of a game. But I do have to honestly say that I will revisit Torment in the future, and I wish there were more like it.

Far, FAR, future, where anything is possible.  Very original set pieces, characters, puzzles, etc.  It took a couple hours for me to get really invested in the story, but it's a pretty great one, all in all.  \n\nThe bad:  Combat is pretty dull.  Found that auto-attacking pretty much did the trick the entire game through.  \nSome of the exposition can get a bit longwinded, even more so than pillars at times. \n\nIn general, this is almost an interactive book.  The combat challenge is almost non-existent.  And that's ok!  It's an interesting and original story.  The lack of challenge is striking from that of pillars, which I had to turn down to baby mode.  \n\nHowever, I think my biggest problem is that it's ~$45, and I was stunned that I finished it in about 15 hours.  And that's after chasing down every side quest I could find.  Plus, I only found 4 party members, which seemed low.  It felt like I was just getting into the story and then END.  \n\nAnyways, I feel that its gameplay to dollar value is quite low, especially compared to other inXile games.  If you're a fan of the setting, and of reading, it's a decent buy.  If you like InXile games, it's much the same, just surprisingly short.
