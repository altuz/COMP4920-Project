Finally picked it up during the last Summer sale. The story is...whatever. It's there. Store says it's \"Fully Voiced.\" This is...untrue? There is sound effects during the story cut scenes but there was no voiceover. Found it odd. There's 3 different modes. Normal, Hardcore and Master Class. You unlock the latter 2 after completing the game on normal. The level design varies differently depending on what difficulty you're on. Overall the controls are tight but on the Master Class difficulty their flaws begin to show when you need to be a little more precise. The games forgiving though with lots of mid-level checkpoints.\n\nThere's collectables in each level and then a handful of challenges to complete after the fact. The challenges aren't particularly difficult. You can probably beat them all in 15-20 minutes.\n\nOverall: Great platforming ninja themed game. More focused on speed than stealth. Just the right amount difficulty to be frustating but not anger-inducing. Controls are tight but sometimes not precise enough for hardest difficulty.", "timestamp_updated": 1502586927, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502573935, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 37, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 8, "total_reviews": 45}}
