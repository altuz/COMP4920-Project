I didn't, and still don't know a lot about the serious sam franchise.\nOnce I was able to buy the game(after a long time of hyping over another game from these developers), I wasn't sure what to think, I am not much of a fan of twinstick games of this nature but it works surprisingly well, and while I do still find myself missing HW style of gameplay, this is still a great game in its own that makes a feature I am not all that fond of work for it.", "timestamp_updated": 1504772562, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504772562, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 62, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 69}}
