YOU'LL PROBABLY DIE.\n\nSo after earning the achievement for playing a single round for 20 minutes and landing myself 4th on the global leaderboard, I suppose I can adequately evaluate this game:\n\nIt's simple.\nIt's fun.\nIt will cook your eyes and strenghten your fingers.\n\nThis game reminds me a lot of Super Hexagon for its simplicity; if you liked that game then you will probably like this one, but it is also a bit more... bizzare. The premise is simple: use the space bar to control a colored bar between the upper and lower limits on a \"gauge\" while the background flashes alternating colors and patterns. The closer to the top of the gauge you are the more points you earn per second, but if you TOUCH the top or bottom you lose a score multiplier A.K.A. your lives (think the Bit Trip series: reach zero multipliers and its game over). Periodically you can collect score bonuses near the bottom of the gauge and, if you so elect, press the CTRL button to start controlling 2 bars at once for twice the points.\n\nProblem is, the game doesn't like it when you start scoring high and progressively speeds the rate of color flashing, swaps patterns more quickly, stretches/shifts/flips the screen orientation, moves the location of the upper and lower limits, changes music, and even flashes text questions and pictures of cats when you least suspect it.\n\nIt gets very difficult and I don't recommend playing for extended periods of time, especially on a large screen. That being said this can be a really fun game in small doses and getting put on the leaderboard is satisfying. In addition, after playing certain amounts more and more game modes unlock for you to try, tweaking one aspect of the game at a time to keep it fresh.\n\nIn conclusion I would give this game an 8/10 as a casual, but challenging, lunch break spender. The only detracting aspects of this game for me are:\n-The music is good, BUT it could be better. I prefer something even more aggresive in this type of game to keep me focused.\n-The agressive strobing of bright colors for minutes on end make this game difficult to play for more than 10-15 minutes, basicaly forcing the player to stop playing after a short time (and thats saying something because I have a pretty decent tollerance for this stuff).\n\nAll in all, for 4 bucks I'd say its well worth the money.", "timestamp_updated": 1401153545, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1401153381, "votes_down": 40}, {"recommendationid": "11301689", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 64, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522188", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405514069, "steamid": "76561197972319241", "num_games_owned": 937, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I was hoping for something with actual gameplay, but this is nothing more than Spacebar: The Game.
