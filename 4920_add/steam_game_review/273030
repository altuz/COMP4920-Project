Perhaps they thought 10 years is a long time and we have all forgotten about PRM2005, either way this game is nothing like it was advertised to be... I really want to say I would give it a chance with mods and patches etc, but the simple fact that we paid in excess of $30 for a game that's a scaled down rehash of a 10 year old framework is unforgivable - I fail to see how they spent any serious time on this at all and therefore something in the $4.99-$9.99 price range and actually advertised properly (as a rehash of PRM2005 and NOT a new game) and I think the negative backlash they are receiving would have been less.\n\nOverall - very bad business sense - for a very very bad game\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1426569399, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1426569399, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "12164587", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517040", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1433679356, "steamid": "76561198007288116", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I would genuinely by quite interested to know how much time was clocked by cyanide developers on this project.
