Games never play the same Twice. Who knows which race will conquer whom, which races are left standing when all is said and done. Did your federation form during an era of relative peace with lots of political intrigue? Or was it bloody solar-war that sometimes literally last milleniums. \n\n2. Highly unique dogfight system where many different stratagies to many different situations are welcome.\n\n3. 8 Alien Races (Not including your self) all have their own quirks. Some are benevolent, some indifferent and some outright malevolent. Here's a short description of each one, not by actual names).\n\n- Peaceful Communist Owl-Pigs (cute, easy to get along with and pathetic).\n-Bird-Foot Klingon Mongols (enjoy barfights and you killing their leaders. No joke.) \n-Little Grey Men (Honorable Solar-Police Force)\n-Lame'os (Peaceful Robot Philanthropists)\n-Worse than Xenomorphs (these guys land troops on your planets, you can expect upto literal quadrillions if you arnt careful)\n-Capitalist Robots (Good ole' straight forward buisness men, you can nuke planets with them. Fun!)\n- Revenge of the Squid Nerds (Nosy Scientists. Willing to blow up part of the solar system if cornered. Or even gas a planet..)\n-Medieval Space Hogs (Tough pigs that keep to themselves but are also good at making two races come to an agreement)\n\n4.Always something to do. You will either be engaging in combat, tweaking planet statistics, adventuring or playing diplomacy. It can seem very overwhelming at first. You will see lots of numbers and news headlines/events in your UI but dont stress....1.Focus on Races you want in your federation this game. 2.Beef their planets. 3.Make them like eachother. 4. Do the opposite for races who you dont want joining or are having a hard time of understanding who's the boss around here. \n\n5. Everygame feels like its own story with a satisfying ending in its own right. You cant die unless you activate permadeth in settings so don't load-\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.

The graphics aren't bad. The sound track isn't bad. Where this game fails is a LACK OF PLAYER CHOICE, and issues with the combat mechanics.\n\nWhat I mean by a lack of player choice is while many options are always presented in a sandbox-type open environment, the simulation mostly plays itself and the effects of you actions are unclear.\n\nTo win my first game after experimenting with various actions trying to see what I could do I figured out that the most important aspect toward forming the federation was getting the races to like each other. However, most of your actions don't impact this. You have an option to directly promote relations between two races but all that is displayed is a ticker of the influence gained each month. Click button and wait is not a game.\n\nSlightly more interesting is you can suggest a race build certain buildings that have positive and negative influence gains, but there is no net gain under the current version. You sacrifice relations with one for gains with others.\n\nFor my first game I simply built hideaways on four of the races and set myself to help build armada for the federation. then 2x speed to the end and Yay! Victory with a federation of 4. Kind-of lame though to just 2x speed to the end.\n\nThe issue I have with the combat is some of the ships are too hard to hit. The just zip about and you don't seem to have a reasonable counter to this behavior because your targeting doesn't work well against this. Also, as the timeline progresses it appears the races ships invariably become ridiculously strong compared to your ship so the point of any tactical combat is suicide. That's a shame because the tactical combat was my favorite part of the game.", "timestamp_updated": 1504056387, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504056387, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34324021", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509825", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502132330, "steamid": "76561198062399793", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game has a very cool premise and some interesting ideas. I liked the writing style, but it doesn't really have anything like a story, so gameplay is the primary concern.\n\nThe big problem of Last Federation is that fighting everything is the fastest way to achieve pretty much any goal. And fighting, while fun at first, quickly gets very stale. There is no tactical depth to it - some cool ideas are there, but you will quickly figure out how to beat a battle (if it is even challenging) and then you need to do exactly the same thing every time this battle happens.\nE.g. at some point you will have several pirate bases up, let's say 6. That means 6 absolutely identical combat missions to take them all out - and not doing it is simply the wrong move if you want to win the game (they give a bunch of everything you want).\nIf you don't put combat difficulty on maximum, fighting will be effortless and even more boring. If you do, you will just sometimes be bursted down and the already tedious battles will take ages.\n\nIf you don't fight, you will simply pick a \"dispatch\" (effect over time) and stare at the screen while the simulation runs. While the effort put into making a simulation with so many variables is admirable, all of that stuff becomes pretty irrelevant when, for example, one race randomly conquers another before you can react at all.\n\nI cannot recommend a game that bored me after 13 hours that costs 12.6$ even here in Ukraine.", "timestamp_updated": 1503046458, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503046458, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "33852673", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501631", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498423333, "steamid": "76561198062486642", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very fun little game.
