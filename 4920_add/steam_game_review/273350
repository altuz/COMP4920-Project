Most of people who chose the 'monster' didn't realize that 'hey, I have to be stealthy before I grow', which lead to them making a lot of noise, practically spamming the 'hunters' map with location markers to chase after not to mention all the footprints. But if you had a player who knew what he was doing, he'd be able to literally sneak right past them, having them running around entire map clueless as to where he was. And -that- is what I loved in the game. The thrill of actual hunt, leaving behind fake footprints, leading them into completely wrong directions only to duck and sneak right between them. Eventually evolving, and growing from prey to predator, or even picking them off one at a time if they separated. \n\nAfter Stage 2 all that was stripped. Sure, the 'moster' got boosted and made able to kill entire hunter team in weakest stage of evolution, but all that was there to make it a hunt got stripped. Respawn timers on hunters decreased to practically none, a 'Monster is this way' skill they could just pop at any time with not long enough reuse delay. From a stealthy/hunting game they turned it into a 'RUNRUNRUNRUN WAAAAGH BASHY BASH'. \n\nCould I recommend it? That's hard to tell. I wouldn't recommend the Stage 2 version. If you can get people to play with on the 'Legacy' version, then certainly, yes go for it!
