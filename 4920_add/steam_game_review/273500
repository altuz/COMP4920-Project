You build turrets to aid you in killing the masses of undead, as you progress, you'll \"level up\" which allows you to increase stats like overall health and health regen, increased weapon damage and reload speed, increased resource pickup and health gained from dropped health packs, and turret damage and ROF. When you kill a zombie they have a chance of dropping health, grenades, powerups, and scrap metal which is needed to build turrets, fortification, and to repair said turrets and fortification, occasionally the zombie dogs will crap all over the place and if you run over the \"pickup\" it slows you down. As you progress through the days, zombies get tougher and tougher and newer types of infected start showing up. To unlock weapons, you press the \"i\" key and you look at the chart, and you follow it. When you die and restart, no progress is saved.

This game is a great little hybrid of a twin stick shooter and tower/hoard defense. I was definitely mildly surprised at how much fun I actually had with this poorly named game.\n\n In every aspect 9K Zombies is a simple game. The top down perspective allows for basic graphics, though things are easy enough to identify.  Objective wise things are also elementary; successive hordes of zombies spawn ever day/night cycle and it's up to you to blast them away using weapons that unlock as you progress as well as turrets/defenses you can build. Zombies drop grenades, health, and most importantly: scrap. The scrap is used to build turrets to help keep the Zs at bey. There are quite a few different ones to build and they have unique effects (Grenade Launcher, Flamethrower, Laser, Lightning, etc.). \n\nAll in all this game is quite fun, especially for being a simple game in 3 played out genres (zombies, twin stick, hoard/tower defense). My one main complaint is that the top down perspective + the crude graphics make telling the difference between a wall and the ground difficult in a few places.  This doesn't happen all the time so it doesn't impact the enjoyment for me. I've really been enjoying playing this game. For the normal $9.99 price definitely pass, it\u2019s WAY too much money. Stick it on your wishlist and when it's on sale for $0.99 then absolutely grab it. While this game is good, and I enjoyed it, it\u2019s not worth anything more that $1.99 imo.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1500456501, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500456501, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33655014", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498123", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500480596, "steamid": "76561198031529307", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "1/10 Got it on sale for 1\u20ac. This price is ok, but don't pay 8\u20ac for this piece of crap! It's kind of interesting in the beginning (maybe the first 45min, I have 10h on record because I left it paused an went outside) but it gets insanely stupid and repetitive later in the game.\n\nIn later stages your entire screen is filled with monsters, you hold down the buttons for shooting and grenades and walk around in circles. That's it. No strategy. No aiming. No evading. No game. There are too many monsters, you can't miss, you can't evade. Best strat is just to keep shooting/spamming nades and move your cursor around in circles. If you stand still they can hit you, that's why you have to walk in circles. You can walk through them most of the time without taking damage. Sometimes your health drops in in which case you walk towards a medkit. You can \"unlock\" different types of weapons by shooting with one weapon for a period of time until the next one is unlocked. You simply pick the weapon that deals the most damage an stick to it. The weapon upgrade percentage was bugged for me.\n\nBuilding sucks. You can't build defenses because monsters tear down walls in a matter of seconds. Just build six towers (you can't build more) in the middle of the map, build a wall around them an leave them. The zombies will only walk towards you in a direct line. That way they don't get attacked and deal some (neglectable) damage.\n\nThere is no endgame. Played to day 24 or so before I quit. At this stage every day is the same. No new monsters, no fun.\n\nIf you are really bored you can try this... but there are flashgames which are as fun as this one (something with zombies and boxes...) and don't charge 8\u20ac (ridiculous, lol).", "timestamp_updated": 1506544465, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500483073, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "34143878", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497268", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1489914345, "steamid": "76561197967777557", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Does what it says on the tin.
