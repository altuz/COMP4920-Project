Go play the freespace Blue Planet mod, you won't regret it. I've played thousands of games and The FS Blue Planet series is among my all time favorites, \n\nThe best part is it was made by dedicated loving fans and its better than the new AAA space sims that get shoved in your \nface for $60 a pop. DL Fs2 from steam, download Freespace open installer play mods.\n\nIf you like Blue planet theres also a bunch of other mods too, your getting dozens of cool fan made storys for $10 pretty \nmuch.\n\nIf your worried about shabby graphics, hell the community even remastered the game. Like really remastered \nit, not like these scrub moneygrab remasterings you get sold by money grabbing developers. The games fuckin beautiful \nit was released in 1999 and looks better than The space sims being release today lol.\n\nOther Honourable but less relevant mentions:\nBaulders gate series\nWarcraft 3 Custom maps from release day til the community died off\nAVP2 Multiplayer ( This was release in 2001, they killed the servers, private ones rose from the ashes because fuck letting this game die)\nPlanescape Torment\nDungeon keeper 1&2\nSPAZ\nHomeworld - Homefront mod / Freespace mod (base games great, modders and community made it even sweeter.)\nSOASE - Sins of the prophets\nMount and Blade Warband", "timestamp_updated": 1503378909, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503378909, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 105, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 43, "total_reviews": 148}}
