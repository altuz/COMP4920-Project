The map is extremely small, the trucks handle extremely bad, the AI is extremely spastic, the bugs are extremely prolific and annoying, etc. DO NOT BUY, or at least DO NOT PLAY if you are a collector. At best this is not a truck simultator, its a simulation of a truck simulator.\n\nPros: nice lighting\n\nCons: everything else\n\nWorst offences:\nTrailers seemed oversized and some are extremely top heavy causing you to roll even at slower speeds (30mph). Sometimes it will just jackknife instead for something different. Turning trees off does help mitigate this, but the game forgets your settings and still places them in other areas. It seems you have to turn them off 4 times to cover the whole map.\nControls are extremly sensitive and the limited options dont seem to have any affect on that. Combined with the constant drifting (which is not caused by lack of deadzone) you will often experience the problem above.\nSpeed is slow, 1st truck is luck to get to 40mph, 2nd can get to 50mph. Speed gauge only has 45 and 90 displayed on the dial. \nTerrible map design. There are parts of the road that have guard rails on the edge of the lane, not the edge of the road. Combined with the 2 problems above, you will soon start driving offraod to avoid crashing and getting stuck. Driving offroad is possible since trees are only imaginary. You can get stuck on uneven ground though, or smash into a mound of dirt that is a little too steep. Some parts of the road have chunks i them as well. The roads are very limited and can all be driven in under an hour. There is an annoying section at the bottom that doesnt connect and results in driving half way around the entire map just to get to the other side. Extremely annoying when you are on the wrong side and meant to be on the other.\nFaulty map and lack of GPS means you will sometimes have trouble finding where you are meant to go. Part of the map is outside the map boarders so if you need to drive there, you are going blind because it wont show on the minimap. Also you will need to stop while checking the map, becasue the game wont pause. Looking at the whole map and not returning to your location, while cause the minimap to not show where you are anymore.\nNO SAVES: seriously, if you play a few hours and the game crashes, tough luck. The only way to save is exit the game.\nAI is extremely slow, except when they come from behind and smash your truck off the road. Ram the cops as you see fit, there is no penalty aside from normal crash damage. Your truck does seem to be extremely light though, so expect to get plently of air time.", "timestamp_updated": 1451778753, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "9", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439955783, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "17998506", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506961", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1402862642, "steamid": "76561198120220117", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Game is very awful!
