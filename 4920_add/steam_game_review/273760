It makes you wonder why UIG even bothered.\nIn the past you could drive like a maniac with your car hanging off the side, rushing around to get all the cars back to your lot, just left to your own devices to do as you please. This time you must do everything prim and proper until you're even allowed to drive the truck away. I never got that as far as to drive away with the car on the back as I couldn't figure out how to get the truck moving again and in that time the car I had put on the truck had somehow slid it's way off. They focused so much on the physics of the hydraulic stabilizers it seems they didn't have time for much else.\n\nThere is no tutorial to guide you through each bit, you're merely given a control screen (controls cannot be customized) and you just have to figure out what to do from there. It doesn't explain things such as what you have to do for the game to trigger to allow you to do the next bit. It's a pretty big thing to overlook really considering the linearity of the game. You're wrapped up in cotton wool to avoid you being silly but doesn't really tell you how to be a great tow truck guy either.\n\nThis game is graphics glitches galore. As you view cars in the distance it looks like a scene out of Tokyo Drift as they seem to be sliding down the road at an angle until they come into your draw distance and dissolve away revealing the car that's meant to be there. Everyone on the roads drives at 2mph, yet the sounds in the game would make you believe you were in the middle of Manhattan. It's not uncommon to see the same car several times in one scene, in fact you can even see that in the screenshots! The only thing that differs between them is some cars have shadows and some do not. Spooky!\n\nThis game has a star style wanted level system taken straight from GTA. I don't know why it's there or what it does though. It just made a police siren sound and that was it. Not a cop in sight. \n\nI can't tell you if it has replay value or what the rest of the game is like as I couldn't figure out how to get that far. It feels rushed and hastily put together. If you want a tow truck simulator game just find the older version made by Astragon in your local charity shop or on ebay.", "timestamp_updated": 1394571276, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1394556804, "votes_down": 50}, {"recommendationid": "9436804", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 88, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562727", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1394613498, "steamid": "76561197995737047", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I thought I would try this out for a bit of a laugh, not really my cup of tea, but boy was I disappointment way more than what I expected. \n\nI will probably NEVER play this game because of the poor quality. It is a shame, but they have reasonable graphics, but a lot of the time you find you have the car on the truck, but the game refuses to accept it and you just waste your time trying to resolve the issue. Some of the physics in the game are so bad also, for no reason the truck will just flip upside down. The driving control is bad and there is absolutely no way to remap the keys in the game at all. Just going into the options shows the sheer lack of settings. \n\nThere is no tutorial in the game, so you spend about an hour trying to work out how the bloody thing is supposed to work before you get a grip of the controls and then find out it ignores the fact when you do things right also. There doesn't seem to be anyway of knowing your progression also, just says pick up cars marked with RED dot, then half of them are too heavy and no way to know how to earn a larger truck.\n\nVery POOR game in my opinion and certainly one for the masses to AVOID. When you think ONE GUY created Banished, what was the organisation thinking of to launch such a game in todays market place?\n\nIt is a shame that Steam does not offer a \"Game Guarantee\" for satisfaction of a game for valued customers like myself to obtain a refund.
