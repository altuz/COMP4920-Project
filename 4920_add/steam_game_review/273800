But in all fairness, I've played this game a short bit and it was at least \"OK\". It ain't exactly epic and there are things I would add to it, but I did find it entertaining so far and intend to go back and play it some more. Considering Steam's new refund policy, if you think you might like it, it might be worth a try because you can always get your money back. A lot depends on what you think you expect the game to be... It's pretty basic and uncomplicated. At least I haven't found any glaring bugs or anything like that yet.\n\nI'd describe the game as a basic simulation in which you start off with a horse (with single log trailer) and a chainsaw. It seems like you can pretty much fall any tree in sight of the town you start in, saw it into 4 sections, then haul each section (one-by-one) back to the lumber mill for money. There's a light RPG element as you gain experience/level for selling logs, for which you get a point to allocate toward a skill (higher selling prices for logs, cheaper equipment prices, etc.).\n\nI've only gotten so far in the game as of this review, but after level 3, you can buy a garage (which opens up the ability to buy tractors and other logging equipment... Couldn't afford them yet myself). A level 6 you can buy an office to accept contracts and so on. In higher levels, it appears (I haven't got that far yet) that you can hire employees, possibly buy the lumber mill, make stuff to sell there, etc.\n\nAnyway, I think this game may suit some, but not others. For me, I give it a tentative thumbs up, subject to change. I know buying again from this company is scary, I almost didn't do it either. But so far, even though there's things I think they could/should add, I do like it better than anything else I've bought from them. And I haven't seen much about the game itself except people angry at the company for past burns (rightfully so). So, I thought I'd try to post something informative to help those on the fence.
