It is dissapointing the amount of Bugs that this title has. The two which pretty much break the game are: 1. At times your units will stand there and get slaughtered without returning fire and 2. The UI in the lower right hand of the screen will disappear -- meaning you can't interact with mission objectives, reinforce, order new troops etc. I honestly wanted to like this game... but there are so many frustrating items surrounding it that playing it is a real grind. Balance and difficulty are also factors which haven't been well considered in this title. Futhermore, in light of all these problems, that fact that you can't save mid-mission is a real kick in the teeth, esp. when a bug is encountered which makes completing a mission impossible.", "timestamp_updated": 1492932941, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492932941, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 27, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 36, "total_reviews": 63}}
