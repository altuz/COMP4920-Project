Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble (DHSGiT) offers a peculiar type of challenge. It's a game of highs and lows. Whether or not you'll find it fullfilling seems deeply personal in a way I've rarely encountered.\n\nAt first glance, DHSGiT appears quirky and charming - undeniably unique. A quick look at promotional material suggests 1920's teenage rebels taking on their school and town with wit and verve. I was excited to install the game. Who wouldn't love mouthing off to authority figures and getting into all kinds of period-appropriate debacles?\n\nUnfortunately, I was met with an immediate wall to my enjoyment. Most encounters in DHSGiT are gated with one of four minigames. This has been exhaustively covered in other negative reviews. The four minigames in question are remarkably dull. If you don't enjoy them the first time, I assure you, you'll hate them by the 100th time. They never give way to something more nuanced. No matter what the circumstance, you'll have to taunt, bluff, hangman, or rock-paper-scissors your way to victory. It's disheartening, I must admit. When I realized that they made up the backbone of the game, I almost quit right out of the gate. I was looking for story, not tedious grinding.\n\nWell, as it turns out, my ex adventure gamer instincts eventually took over. I have (if I do say so myself) a rather high level of tolerance for painstakingly hunting down a narrative.  When I became comfortable with the minigame repetition, I started to enjoy myself. The characters are honestly endearing. Over time, I grew to care about my little girl gang. Every hour I spent with them added more affection. I saw my queen Charlotte as dangerously glamorous. Her second-in-command Jean was everything 1920's society found unfeminine, and I loved it. I was hooked.\n\nUnfortunately, my love was not to last. I'm confused by the last acts of DHSGiT, to say the least. The spoiler-free version of this review is that if you care about these characters, prepare to be heartbroken. The story takes an unexpected and extremely dark turn. I'm all for complex narratives, but this felt rushed and disrespectful to what had come before. I've seen many reviews reference \"girl power\" as a primary theme of DHSGiT. I think the ending puts the lie to that theory rather thouroughly. I've also seen people recommend this game as \"family friendly\" or an option for children, which I feel could not be further from the truth. At the very least, make sure to play it through first, to understand the conversations you might want to initiate afterwards.\n\nFor anyone that wishes to explore the spoilerific:\n\n[spoiler]For some reason, that I cannot fathom, DHSGiT decides to introduce the theme of rape as a major plot point. Not only is a random member of your gang a near victim (incapacitating her for the rest of the game), but the entire town of Brigiton is complicit in systemized rape. Very late in the game, the mayor is exposed as a beneficiary of Prima Nocta or Droit du Seigneur. Which is, to say, he is allowed to have sex with any woman in town on the night before her marriage.This is made even more repellent by a subplot in which you arrange the marriage of two of your classmates.  You have, in essence, arranged both their marriages *and* their assaults. I'm not ashamed to say that I felt a bit betrayed. The story doesn't feel so empowering as it does exploitative.  To make matters worse, a noted suffragette has traded the right for women to vote for this violation. It's off-putting and unnecessary. I can't imagine making that trade in good faith. No matter how well meaning, it is beyond fathoming. As a woman, more than anything, I feel like throwing my mouse through my screen. This game touched something unpleasant in a way I never could have expected. I'm willing to acknowledge the parts of DHSGiT that I enjoyed, but it's impossible to forget the parts I didn't.[/spoiler]"}]}
