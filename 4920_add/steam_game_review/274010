This is both a good and bad thing - it's good because there are many, many fewer graphical bugs and general slowness than you get from the classic ship simulator, but it has problems that I'll get into later.\n\nMy biggest concern with the game is the ship physics. They just don't feel right - a long endurance rescue vessel seems more like a small boat, and the boat feels terrible at low speeds, because of how it moves in the wrong direction when trying to steer. This might be realistic, but it sure doesn't seem like it.\n\nSecondly, there's a distinct lack of content. There are only a few other ship classes, and cargo ships are represented by fishing boats etc. It gets annoying, but not too badly. Given the nature of the ships that they've modelled, a true open ocean scenario would be wonderful.\n\nThird, the towing and cable attachment walkaround system is way, way too slow, even in calm seas.\n\nI actually rather like this game. Poor ship physics aside, the campaign is at least okay, and there is a fair amount of diversity. However, it isn't quite worth 25$ - if it was 15$, I'd say you should buy it, but not at the current pricing. I hope that the developers continue to expand the content that's avaliable, though I'm not too hopeful.\n\nEdit (too long for a comment):\nI think that the easiest one of my complaints to fix is the walk-around one, I suspect that there's just a constant somewhere that can be changed.\n\nThe motor launch dynamics also need to be improved, as the sliding action when attempting to turn at low speeds makes it difficult to perform rescues effectively. However, this might be a realisim thing, as I have very little real experience with these boats.\n\nThe thing that I'd like the most to be added, content-wise, is an open-ocean component, far distant from the shore. The Hermann Marwede in particular was designed for this, and it doesn't show up a lot in the game. This would also go well with the addition of the emergency towing vessel Mellum, also based on  Heligoland.\n\nOnly one real new ship class is needed for freighters, really, and I think that something like a 5,000TEU containerized vessel would be enough. I'm not sure how hard it would be to add, though.\n\nWith respect to the missions, something that's been bothering me about the ones that exist already is that they're so close to shore and in good enough weather that the majority would seem to be done by helicopter. It would be nice to make you cooperate with a helicopter, possibly even conducting air operations off of the Marwede.\n\nFinally, a mod kit would be very nice. VSTEP doesn't have one, for reasons I can't determine, but I know that I would be interested at least in developing new content for the game.\n\nI think that implementing any two of my suggestions would make me, at least, reccomend this game. I'm excited to see where the game goes in the future.\n\nEdit #2:\nThe ship physics are really the worst thing, though. The ships's weight more or less does not exist (the RHIB pushes a 5000 ton freighter around), and the boyancy model is nonexistent. Floating appears to happen based on a uniform height above the water. Furthermore, the drag model doesn't work: when you have a ship under tow, the top speed does not decrease whatsoever.", "timestamp_updated": 1404428751, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404359673, "votes_down": 22}, {"recommendationid": "11009948", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515926", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1473271598, "steamid": "76561197996692712", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "After some issues with the controls I managed to track down the issue.

It's not.  The game is stable, free of obvious bugs, and it is somewhat engaging for the first couple of hours.  Let me run through the first challenge as a case study:\n\nYou get a call that some one is in trouble.  You put the pedal to the metal and head toward the arrow which indicates where the people are who need rescuing.  \n\nYou realize very quickly that this is taking a long time.  Ten minutes in fact.  That's ten minutes of doing nothing but holding down the 'w' key.  I discovered later that there's an option that doubles the speed; so reduce the time to five minutes of holding the 'w' key.  \n\n[Edit] Greanthal pointed out that I could go at 4X speed.  I didn't remember that option so I returned to the game and headed out to sea.  Under menu there are several speed options one of which is 'fastest'.  This is what I had clicked before and got 2X speed.  So I clicked it again and got the same result.  What I didn't realize was that 'fastest' is not 'fastest'.  If you click the option again you get 4X.  I guess it means 'fastest acceleration'.  \n\n[Edit] This does not save the game from my thumbs down rating however.  In the third mission under the Baltic senario, it still takes 7 minutes at 4X to reach the rescue destination.\n\nOnce you arrive on the scene you perform a couple of tasks including pulling three people out of the water.  This all takes less time than it took to get there.  \n\nNow you discover you have to take the rescued people back to port . . . another five minutes of holding the 'w' key.  You get back to port and you find out you have to return to the damaged boat . . . another five minutes of holding the 'w' key.  \n\nBack at the rescue site you attach a rope to the boat (takes about a minute) and you turn around to head back to port . . . another five minutes of holding down the 'w' key.  I think you get the picture.\n\nAmong other issues I have is that you can't turn off the music.  It's integrated with the master volume.  The music is louder in the menus but still in the background while travelling back and forth holding down the 'w' key.  \n\nAlso, the claim about the wonderful water physics is a gross exaggeration.  I spent most of my childhood on the water, including open sea.  The water in this game barely resembles anything I've experienced.  A passing boat makes a deep furrow which lingers for an unnaturally long time; it looks more like a large furrow left by a tractor and plow ('plough' if you're outside North America).  Worse is that your boats do not interact with these 'furrows'.  You practically hover as you pass over them; not so much as a slight dip.\n\nSome one in a review said it might be a $15 title.  I'd say it's barely worth it at $10.", "timestamp_updated": 1405450306, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404833318, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "14637312", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500363", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1424801250, "steamid": "76561198088149823", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "As an arcade game it's Okay, but personally I thing it's a bit of a joke refering to this game as a 'Simulator'.\n\nThis game does give a basic but fairly decent idea of how sea rescues are often carried out. Graphics are nice but for some reason are  unusually heavy on RAM for what you get, resulting in a poor frame rate for something that doesn't appear particularly high-spec.\nControls are pretty rubbish to be honest, these would certainly benefit from having a precise control feature, such as with V-Step's Ship Simulator series, and the boats acutually reponding better to control input, particularly when going astern (reversing).\nPhysics could do with some fine-tuning, such as the boats being less bouncy over waves that don't appear particularly big or rough, also the afore mentioned poor controls go hand-in-hand with these below-par physics, especially in the case of the smaller daughter-boats.\nHave also come across at least one bug. The first being that the already poor controls bring it on themselves to go full ahead on the throttles and full to port (left) on the steering, any atempt to correct them, either by using the keyboard or click-dragging the mouse only working until buttons are released. Sometimes this bug takes affect at the start of gameplay, sometimes only taking affect in the middle of gameplay.\n\nAs a spare time arcade game this is okay, but on the whole it's got potential but in need of a great deal of improvement.

The game is much too linear and scripted to be considered a simulation. The controls are easy to learn, but very unrealistic. Towing another boat behind your ship seems to have no impact on its speed whatsoever. You have to use a small speed boat launched from the back of your ship to rescue floating civilians but it's very hard to manoeuvre. The graphics and ship models look good, but the physics are substandard. The game is not dynamic at all. There is a free cruise mode option, which I thought was a mode in which the player cruises around waiting for distress calls on the radio; but I found out later it's just for exploring the map. WTF?\n\nOverall the game is decent, but feels incomplete. For example: some parts of the ship are blocked off to players even though those doors have clickable icons on them. The other ship from the second campaign is even more blocked off. You can operate the small launch boat from its pilot's seat, but you cannot operate the larger ships from their captain's chairs. You can sit in the chair but the controls disappear and nothing is clickable except for the radio. Also a horn, but no lights?
