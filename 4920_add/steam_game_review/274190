I finally decided to give it a shot. We played the entire campaign together. I like the graphics. The gameplay was fun... a lot of explosions and me getting lost in all the action that was happening all at once. The characters and level descriptions were amusing. The music suited the game. I laughed hysterically, and genuinely enjoyed a lot of the game. I [i]would[/i] say this is a solid multiplayer experience, but...\n\nToo many times while we played, the game bugged and we had to exit the campaign, go back to the main menu, go back to the campaign, and reinvite him to my game to pick up where we left off. \nSometimes, on my screen, his character would be standing there doing nothing, while I could hear him fighting stuff. \nOther times, his character would be in the ground (not as if he'd dug down... the ground would still be there and he'd be in it), or floating off to the side somewhere. \nSometimes he'd be fighting stuff I couldn't see, or vice versa. \nOn a few occasions, the camera stopped following us and we couldn't navigate the level further. \nAt least once, his character died but still appeared as alive on my screen. \nAnd finally (and this is the one that put the nail in the coffin for me) we got to the final boss. We struggled a bit [spoiler]killing his third form[/spoiler], and then it bugged. We waited around for a few minutes hoping it'd start working again, but basically the boss went up in the air and stopped doing anything at all. We could still move and attack and whatnot, but nothing would happen. We couldn't progress or finish the fight.\nIt's like almost finishing a violent, gory, pun-filled jigsaw puzzle, only to find out you're missing a piece or two. That was the final straw. Was totally off-putting and I had no desire to try again.\n\nSome of those may have been latency issues, but it's worth noting that we were both in the same room, on the same network, using the same internet connection on two different gaming computers. I play other games online and never have had quite that many issues. My buddy swears that he's never had those issues in single player or local co-op, so maybe online multiplayer is just a bit rough right now. I feel like the multiplayer side of this game is a major selling point for some though, so it's definitely something that needs to be ironed out a bit. \n\nAs fun as it was.
