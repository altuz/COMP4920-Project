Hotline Miami 2, Hard Reset, Titan Souls (turned out to be a complete waste of money given how underwhelming it was), even this game (which, according to other Steam reviews, is a light version of Mark of the Ninja?) is a pain in the arse in specific levels - the finale especially, when they flip the overall objectives from stealth to getting through the building quickly (in a single fluid run - dying at all places you back at the start of the run), killing the boss, and getting out. Getting injured doesn't even result in immediate death this time, too, they let you flail around for up to 9 seconds (max, and this timer is reset after each fresh kill).\n\nGood game though, logged 7.0 hours at the time of writing (and about to start NG+), decently rhythmic enough to tag as \"podcasting\" (listening to podcasts/music while playing). For anyone on the fence about getting this, know that the jumping function is buggy (but the hints will still imply it's intentional) and controller/XInput support is perfect.

Its like Hotline Miami, Deadbolt, Gun Point or Super Meat Boy, a small team creates a violent game with a very unique mechanic\nThe game is very good but it fails in some aspects\n\nThe combat/stealth is pretty good, BUT, it fells sort of broken at times, kind of frustating and that makes the game hard at times for the wrong reasons, even tough they are small issues and dont ruin the experience\nThe soundtrack is decent \nThe art style fits the game \nThere is a story, but it is very superficial. I mean A LOT superficial even tough its interesting. There are no voiced dialogues and ALL we get from the story are a couple of 20 sentences, thats all. There are 5 bosses so before each one of them the game shows 4 sentences about the toughts of the protagonist. THATS IT. I was expecting it all to be revealed by the end, unfortunatelly it was not\n\nI will give a 7/10. It really strikes me down knowing the game had a lot of potential, but the lack of a well told story and some broken mechanics make the game average. It doesn\u00b4t come close of being a memorable as other games like Hotline Miami\n\nHighly recommend gameplay wise, Its hard and you are going to die a lot, but its worth it and fair.
