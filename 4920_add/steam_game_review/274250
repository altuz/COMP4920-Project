If you're thinking about having fun, forget it. This game requires a lot of patience and sometimes, it's not enough. It starts off fine with amateur challenges, I believe they can be done by anyone who have a little patience. Then it's moving onto the pro challenges and this part is just fine until Neon City. If you ever manage to get pass the \"helicoptering\" challenge, you'll be awarded with RAD Mode which is really difficult. You have to make ZERO mistakes in this mode. No exceptions. Only perfect landings and grinds are acceptable. I also highly recommend using a controller otherwise you won't be able to play it at all. And don't listen the negative reviews that complaining about the unresponsive controls because controls are perfectly responsive.", "timestamp_updated": 1500165550, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500165550, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 179, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 46, "total_reviews": 225}}
