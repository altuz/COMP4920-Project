It's hard, fast paced, has a bitchin' soundtrack, and is snarky as all hell. The gameplay consists of 2D sidescrolling combat and light platforming. The combat mostly centers around timing your movement in and out of \"cover\" (we'll get to that later) to shoot at enemies or rushing up and getting the drop on them before they can shoot first. The game features about a dozen characters which can be unlocked by completing additional challenges in missions to improve your overall \"approval rating\". The game is sort of reminiscent of Hotline Miami, placing you in the shoes of a random character employed by a larger organization to murder people that may or may not deserve it. All characters are voiced and their dialogue is appealing to listen to. \n\nThe gameplay is the biggest issue for most people here, myself included. Combat can be difficult with the \"cover system\" just being you leaning against a 2D wall, the only indication of this is a slight shadow coming over your very tiny character. Not only is this hard to see in combat, it's unreliable as hell, meaning you often have to run rather than fight and risk dying from the unreliable mechanic. Additonally, if you die at any point in a level, you have to restart. Unlike Hotline Miami, this game has no in-level check points, so it's back to the beginning of the level, no matter how long the level is. This is frustrating as shit at times, and can cause a certain level of fatigue from the gameplay. That said, the game is still fun. Alternate ammo types and bombs can give you an edge, and on those runs where you're just gunning it and killing everything, it feels awesome. I'd recommend this game at full price. The content is there, it's just difficult to get to. But that's nothing new from Devolver. Enjoy the music, enjoy the pixel citiscapes, enjoy the characters, and have a good laugh at Bunnylord's antics. 7/10", "timestamp_updated": 1504624538, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504624538, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35038527", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494636581, "steamid": "76561198000143560", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Bunnylord brutalizes a corrupt government official.", "timestamp_updated": 1505707690, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505707690, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35053362", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501992", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506292378, "steamid": "76561197971173668", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "All Hail BUNNYLORD!!!!", "timestamp_updated": 1505770358, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505770358, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35384685", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502688", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506870150, "steamid": "76561198201587228", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "C\u044b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0433\u0434\u0435-\u0442\u043e 10 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0432 \u043e\u0444\u0444\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435, \u0438\u0431\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430. \u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0441\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0434\u0443\u0445\u0435 \u0430\u043b-\u044f Hotline Miami \u0438 \u043a \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0436\u0435 \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439. \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442, \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \"\u0441\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439\" \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u044b \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0438. \u0423\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \"\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 -- \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \"\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f\" \u0441 \u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438\" \u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442.
