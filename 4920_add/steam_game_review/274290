For example, should I kill this guy to make my life easier since I already died 10 times in a row by trying to save everybody, or should I find a more clever / hidden path to the solution? This wouldn't be a big issue alone, I like well thought puzzles and finding clever solutions, but this is heavily broken in the game for the following reasons:\n1. It's [b]RNG heavy[/b]. Even though there are difficulty modes that eliminate partially the RNG factor, I have to judge the Classic mode that the developers suggest to play.\n2. \"Optimal\" [b]solutions are LOOOOONG[/b], and you cannot make a single mistake. Which means you have to spend several minutes on the same level (I took hours for some), watching the [b]same animations[/b] over and over again, reading the [b]same textwalls[/b], clicking the[b] same buttons[/b].. I think you get it.\u00a0\nSo overall, even though i like that the core concept of the game revolves around ethics, the implementation is poor and you can feel your hate towards the level you are playing growing and growing every minute it passes. Plus, your choices don't really affect the future (thing that I [u]hate[/u][b] [/b]in all this kind of games, such as the Wolf Among Us), meaning that if you kill a character in chapter 1 it will be still alive in chapter 2 [spoiler](even though you can see the sprite animate in a different if you let that character die in a previous chapter)[/spoiler].\u00a0\nConcluding this section, if you don't like games that force you to make choices but are not able to make you feel guilty or make you think about what you've done (the pixel art doesn't help with empathy), just skip the purchase and the rest of the review. Otherwise, if you're still somewhat interested..\n\n[h1]Game mechanic[/h1]\n[b]It's just a point and click[/b], click on this character, open that menu, click this list item, do this, do that, so on and so on. It gets really frustrating to move the cursor over the same stuff repeatedly, and don't even make me start when you mistakenly choose another menu item and find yourself shooting a guy in the face. Surprise, no warning for that! .. Which is not even that bad, considered that if I had to confirm a prompt every time I had to kill someone in the game I would've uninstalled way before completing the main story anyway. \nThe context menus are really bad placed as well, in a lot of levels to get the stats of your team (stamina / thirst / etc.) you have to spend 5 seconds because you have to ask the damn robot to activate his sensors in order to analyze the team. What the hell?? Just put the numbers on a menu always visible!! I swear [b]I've lost at least half an hour just to fetch stats during my play through[/b], unbelievable.\n[h1]The graphic art[/h1]\nThe pixel art is mostly fine. The sprites are a bit weird, but that's personal preference and the objects are easily recognizable anyway, the images have a nice color palette. You honestly get what you pay for. The huge issue is that [b]the animations are very slow, [/b]and that doesn't had any kind of fun to the game.\n\n[h1]The story[/h1]\nOh boy, I really don't want to hear anymore about neither Everdusk nor Xenolifer. I like interstellar drama, but this has honestly gone a little bit too far and it bored me waay before the epilogue. To be honest the fact that you read the same, identical dialogues over and over again doesn't help as well. The characters have basically no personal development and even the Sergeant (the \"main\" one), the only true badass / promising in the game, has basically 0 action since it mostly gives orders and organizes the team. I think that [b]a game that is focused on team work without individual and group development in the story just doesn't work[/b]. \n\n[h1]The music and atmosphere[/h1]\nThis is good, I initially bought this title for this (found in the r/outrun sidebar, iirc). The music fits very well with the general \"space survival\" vibe and I love synths / retrowave / darkwave in general, but listening for the same stuff for hours turns out to be just plain boring, and you'll soon find yourself in muting the game and opening Spotify.\n[h1]\n[/h1]\n\n\nTL;DR: Game is tedious, boring and doesn't bring anything new.
