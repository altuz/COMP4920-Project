I thought there at least might be some predictable twist that Dropsy is a serial murderer, or a monster, or god knows what else. But it defied my expectations. While there are many dark themes running throughout this game, and a number of twists, Dropsy himself is pure-hearted.\n\nIt'd also be easy to pass this game off as just being too simple, sappy and over-sentimental, teaching you the same old things you learned in Sunday school; Don't judge a book by its cover, be nice to others, and so on. The game is about those things, yes, but it does it in a way that, at least to me, felt genuine.\n\nDropsy does a lot of things that fans of point and click adventures should enjoy. While there is a plotline to follow, the main thrust of the game is wandering around the world, meeting its inhabitants, and getting them to let you hug them. However, almost everyone you meet has some kind of problem, and one way or another are in a non-hugging mood. You solve their problem, then get to huggin'. All the dialogue they give you is done by representative pictures and symbols, which both help demonstrate Dropsy's loose grasp on language, and also make the thankfully simple puzzles a little more challenging, since you might not fully understand them at first. Many of these puzzles can only be solved once you have an item or a companion from doing the main story, but the rest you can solve at your own pace, and aren't required to finish the game. It's rare to see a game, especially a point and click adventure one, where you genuinely just help people out. It's a nice feeling, wandering back over familiar areas, and seeing a character you helped earlier in better spirits. Hell, you can even hug them again if you'd like.\n\nWhat mainly will determine if you'll enjoy Dropsy is its presentation. Personally I found the artstyle quite charming, and each character is animated quite well. The soundtrack also really appeals to me, having a good variety between upbeat, bouncy tunes and softer, more atmospheric melodies. In The Court of the Junkyard King is a particular favorite of mine. The soundtrack is what seals the deal on this game for me, so keep in mind it's also available separately if you're interested.\n\nOverall, it's a simple, charming experience with a unique personality and style. In a world that could always use more love, Dropsy has plenty to share.", "timestamp_updated": 1506347210, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506347210, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35309313", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506008007, "steamid": "76561198020866457", "num_games_owned": 498, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 289}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I enjoyed this game for a few hours, I liked the world and there was a lot of build up and mystery about the plot but ultimately the pay off was not worth it.\n\nI may have had a different experience if i had explored everything like some people say the problem being that the game abruptly comes to a point of no return in the storyline with no warning or indication this is going to happen around 3 - 4 hours in, due to the areas of the game i had not explored yet I thought that there was a good amount of story left and it would run me through those areas and then comes the ending ... the ending makes completely ZERO sense unless you find everything in the game and due to the point of no return i wasn't allowed to find everything in the game so i felt cheated out of any sort of closure which is a shame because i really wanted to love the game. I wanted to go back and find what i missed unfortunately i did not have a game save before then and the game is very tedious if you already know what is going to happen. big let down :\\ I would say the game was enjoyable before that but the enjoyment i got out of the game was the build up in events and the feeling that i was about to discover something huge but I didn't and it left a sour taste in my mouth", "timestamp_updated": 1506712663, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506712663, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 407, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 19, "total_reviews": 426}}
