It's got inexplicably great lore for a mech action game, and it's got a very tight action packed gameplay loop where there's a bunch of different and fun options. Just because there's a lot of different options doesn't mean that they're necessarily easy though. There's a lot of different and interesting ways to play to a wide variety of strengths.\n\nAlso it's stompy mechs and shooty tanks breaking absolutely everything in an adrenaline filled neon hellscape with a perfect accompaniment from a great soundtrack. If you want to engage with it in a technical sense or a sheer adrenaline junkie sense, there's a great way to play it for you. And yes, this does cover the intersection of the two.
