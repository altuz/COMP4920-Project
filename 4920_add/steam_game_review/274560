During combat, ground and air targets must be targeted separately, forcing the player to assess which targets pose the highest threat and adding some strategy to what boils down to just holding the fire button in other similar games. There are also a few different multiplayer modes to choose from. Unfortunately, not many people play, so your best bet would be to find a buddy to play with. I didn't particularly enjoy replaying the game three times to get all of the achievements, but it wasn't boring either, with each consecutive playthrough getting tougher than the last. If you must choose between Revolution Ace or Raptor, definitely go with the latter, but if, like me, you have already beaten Raptor enough times to be able to do it in your sleep, then Revolution Ace is the best next thing.", "timestamp_updated": 1504975170, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504974702, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34809734", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1472142909, "steamid": "76561198142196373", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Like mobile game", "timestamp_updated": 1504856993, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504856993, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34900641", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505405109, "steamid": "76561198076543237", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 122, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "DINGDONG GAME IN FUTURE\nLike touhou project?And you like this game\nThis game similiar to old game in Ps named war 1945\nAnd so fun, but you can only play with 1 friend only \n(I buy 4 pack and only 2 can play at same time ==)\nMy friend happy that i gave him this game so im greatfull \nWell in the end, you must try \n\n8/10 for me", "timestamp_updated": 1505221294, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505221294, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34986220", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1442665460, "steamid": "76561197976133575", "num_games_owned": 476, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Nice old school shoot 'em up.\nChallenging but manageable :)\n\nRecommended!", "timestamp_updated": 1505530514, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505530514, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 335, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 166, "total_reviews": 501}}
