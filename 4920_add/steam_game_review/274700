A game with hidden depth, surprisingly hard difficulty, and the good ol' \"one more run\" feel.\n\nYou control a hacker that navigates their way through a system full of viruses and daemons, and most of the time end up dying trying. The enemies all have unique movements, such as the virus moves two spaces instead of one, or the cryptog isn't visible until it's in your sights. Getting trapped by a bunch of enemies at once is common, especially if you don't play smart!\n\nLuckily, to counter the horde, there are a lot of powerups. These powerups each counter a specific enemy type, and make tough situations possible, that is if you have resources. To use powerups, you need either Energy or Credits. You collect these with siphons. But you only get two per floor, adding a descision making element to the game. \"Do I want this powerup? Should I just grab these resources instead? Or how about take some score?\" And to add on to this, each time you take a powerup, it spawns a specific amount of enemies, making each situation risk/reward.\n\nThe controls are great, just a simple WASD and number keys, or you can even just use your mouse.\n\nA lot of your deaths will be because of RNG, and that is one of my only complaints. RNG is such a gamble, and a lot of the time ends with the game over screen. \n\nThis is the perfect coffee break game, each run is about 10 minutes long, and it saves your progress if you exit the game.\n\nEasily 9.8/10!
