They are pretty wierd and also you can't use them all at once normally. So I changed them to the normal race game setup:\nW - Forward\nS - Reverse\nA - Left\nD - Right\nSpacebar - \"Hand\"Brake\nShift - Boost / Jet\n\nThat way you can use only the left hand for that part.\nFor the other keys I left them the same due you need to stabelise your car with the Up\" and \"Down\"\"keys, and basic \"R\" for restart offcourse.\n\nAlso, It would be awesome if you had a trackbuilding mode. So players can create and share there tracks on the steam workshop page.

HOWEVER! My thoughts on this game after playing it for about an hour. \n\nHoly. Shit. Balls. My first thought was \"This game is going to be the exact reason why Trackmania doesn't have rockets\" but after playing through the tutorial and being amazed at the easy and intuitive controls my thoughts were \"Holy shit!? Why dopesnt Trackmania have rockets?!\"\n\nSo yes, that is what this game essentially is. It is Trackmania with rockets. This is not in any way negative as Trackmania is arguably one of the most visually pleasing and intuitive racing games out there.\n\nThe only negatives that come to mind, or simply things I feel the game is missing are:\n\n- The graphics leave a bit to be desired. I understand this is an indi game, and for an indi game they are amazing. But I think if they were a bit better this game would be insane.\n\n- Get the community involved more than just ghosts! Let us race each other, crash into each other in lap races, race against each other in real time in time attack. Add in a track editor that we can build tracks and share with other players.\n\n- I feel like I should be able to control each air brake individually, at least each side, purely for more control in mid air. \n\nThat's it. If these things were implemented I think this game could easily be as big as Trackmania at it's peak.

Do you like to go fast? That's right, the next best thing to a Sonic is here!\n\nUnlike some of the other reviews, I very much like the way the cars control in the time attack and platforming modes. On the ground, the controls are quick and snappy. In the air, their turning/angling is delayed and slower as you would expect them to be (due to less friction). You can even adjust your position in midair slightly by coordinating between boosting and using your air brake. Some of the stunt jumps you will be making later in the game are insane but can be achieved with enough practice and strategy. \n\nOn the downside, there are a few tracks in the game where you will have to jump through several \"hoops.\" These hoops are kind of hard to fit through and the hitboxes between your car and the hoops seem pretty big and hard to avoid. However, with enough practice, it is more than possible to make it. Also, [u]the third game mode, \"Collector,\" seems like a waste of time and is poorly designed.[/u] The placement of the stars/collectables you have to drive into to collect is pretty terrible and incredibly difficult. The way the car controls in this mode is a mess - slippery and just all over the place. The camera is stuck in a fixated spot behind the car at all times, so if the car moves on the ground or in the air at all, then the camera moves along with it. Think of it as racing on the SNES with mode 7 all over again (...but in an actual 3D game). This gameplay mode seems to be the least important of the three though since it has fewer tracks.\n\n[u]The other two modes are great.[/u] The time trials allow you to just go all out crazy with boosting and pushing your speed to the limits. Gotta go fast! The platforming levels are really creative and challenging. Towards the end of the game, I couldn't believe some of the stuff I was pulling off and the crazy stunts I had to perform. Simple, yet effective design! If you've ever played ATV Quad Power Racing 2, the platforming levels (and time trials) in this game remind me a lot of the ones in ATV 2... but faster. So if that's something you enjoyed, this game is for you. \n\n[b]All in all, great game. I am very happy with my purchase since I got it on sale. I love the controls, the game engine, and everything BUT the Collector Mode.[/b] In fact, this game has so much potential to be even more than it already is. It would be amazing to see a REAL multiplayer mode, battle mode, bigger/wider tracks with more gimmicks besides just conering and jumping, a whole other mode, a better designed Collector Mode made easier, or even something along the lines of what ATV 2 had to offer with the tournament races or freestyle modes.\n\nStill needs:\n* In-game music?\n* Time Trial Leaderboards", "timestamp_updated": 1407778095, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405079881, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "30759823", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511050", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1489228154, "steamid": "76561198053622952", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS2xDJ8pTXs\nVroom!

So far I have spent 17hour of playing this game I have completed 3 of 4modes game offers and get 11 of 12archivemenents. Now I feel competent to write few lines about it.\n\nGame is remake of games released few years ago for iOS and Android. Despite developers call it remake game is simplistic lacking any advanced feature, setting and unfortunatelly being short even in comparison with other budget titles. On other other site game is very adictive and fun to play which is what matters.\n\nPlayers take control of rocket power formula which resembles that one from Trackmania Nation. Rocket engine is powered by nitro which is restored when next checkpoint is passed in modes Platform and Time Attack. In Puzzle/Collector mode turbo is refilled automatically when not used. With rocket engine equiped car can reach crazy speed, fly and maneuver(brake, steer, rotate) in the air.\n\nFirst of game mod is tutorial with 5 track where players have chance to familiarise yourself with control.\n\nSecond mode is Platform with 25tracks. Tracks are arranged from simple where rocket engine is used just to speed up cars, to track where rocket engine is used to overcome huge distances between distant part of track. Harder track in this mode require lot of practising to reach finish line. \n\nThirt mode is Time Attack (11tracks). Rocket engine here serves just like turbo to speed up cars. All track are easy to drive with few jump. Surplus of nitro make it mode feel totaly different from platform. Instead of precise aircontroled flight player control formula in tight corners whith even remind me Wipeout/F-Zero games.\n\n\nIn both previous game modes players have change to compare your results with other BUT only when track is finished with personal best. This is promist to be fixed. Game would certainly benefit from possibility to see records of other players anytime. Also developers implemented so called \"asynchronous multiplayers\" into these two modes. Game download ghosts of players with similar time and let them compete with it. Again unfortunately game lack here becouse new ghost are downloaded only when track is reload which result in playing with much slower and therfore uselles ghost all the time.\n\nLast mode is Puzzle/Collecter (8 maps). Objective is to colect 5stars on every maps. Starts aren't placed directly on track but on objects around tracks. This mode require lot of air maneuvers and restarts. Players face with challange to not just overcome huge distances but also significant changes in direction in comparsion with other mode where just slight corrections in the air are needed. Unfortunatelly camera doesn't work so well in JCS and any controled stunts are literally impossible. Fast camera rotation really doesn't help.. Therefore this mode utilise fixed camera which make game feel like beta but helps in crazy maneuvers. Personally this is the only mode I haven't finished. It's not really fun to play FOR ME. This mode also face it premiere in PC version and was created by developers of PC version. Hopefully other feature and content we might see for this game will push game further..\n\nIt's very disapointing that game doesn't include multiplayer and level editor. Personally think that editor would be much usefull. What would we play in that multiplayers without new tracks? For example game Trials Evolution:Gold Edition has functional editor and ingame sharing system which push game to endless of hours of gameplay for those who want and multiplayer which non of PC players ever make to work present NO problem in long term.\nWith multiplayer and editor this game might threaten possition of Trackmania which took direction to LOT of feature, realism, graphic and addictive gameplay was lost in the way..\n\nHope I will see more \"PC wotrhy\" sequel in few years.\n\n7/10 and must have for those who loved Trackmania before TM2 release.", "timestamp_updated": 1400409227, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1399972442, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "14152557", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502454", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1422772659, "steamid": "76561198142811072", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Don't get this game if you don't have a controller", "timestamp_updated": 1422142414, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1422142414, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "18732287", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1462475711, "steamid": "76561198118179101", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "FAKE linux \"support\" (does not support linux)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!          : (\n\n\nIt is a good game on windows though!", "timestamp_updated": 1446064187, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1446064187, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 36, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 14, "total_reviews": 50}}
