Why? Because it's fun and it feels like Halo. But why did I play this and not just Halo even though I own every Halo game made and it's DLC? Because, Murder Miners does a really good job of combining two really good aspects of both the games it takes inspiration from. I bought this game nearly day one when it hit PC because I liked it on Xbox so much though it's not like $1 is much.\n\nIt's got a little bit of everything when it comes to a shooter and while the game may seem basic it packs a lot of fun. I find it most closely related to Halo CE and while it does hold some similarities to Minecraft with it's voxelness I'd say it's almost nothing like Minecraft. You can build maps with a \"miner weapon\" but that's where the similarities end. The rest basically plays like Halo and that's a good thing considering we don't have enough of Halo on PC.\n\nI didn't play competitive a whole lot, most of my time was spent on Zombie Survival messing around with friends. Also, the Hook Shot adds a really cool touch to the game, being able to zip around from building to building is pretty fun.\n\nThe game is pretty basic when it comes to PC specific options as well. It has full rebindable keys and X360 controller support but video options are basically Vsync, Fullscreen In Desktop Resolution, Super Sampling, Fog Distance and Windowed Mode plus choice of resolutions. That's about it but it's fine because the game still looks great and plays great, there's an internal 60FPS lock even with Vsync disabled but the game plays silky smooth. Game also has Workshop support for user made maps.\n\nI see a lot of random people down voting the game with generic responses like \"Terrible game.\" and \"why?\" but I honestly don't know why. It's a really polished game for the dollar it costs and provides hours of fun. The game is exactly what it says on the tin as well so I don't see how anyone could feel like they were lied to or how they justify leaving a negative review without at least talking about the negatives. Devs are also super nice and engaging so that's a huge plus.\n\nI say; do yourself a favor and pick this game up, get the four pack and play with some friends, even co-op Zombie Survival, if you like Halo, you'll like this game.
