The game gets updated frequently, but it's mostly skins and events. New maps and new sharks are a rare thing, but when it happens, man, it feels good. \n\n There are a few game modes in this. Blood and gold is the main one. 4 divers vs. 2 sharks. Simply put, 4 divers have to escort an underwater robot named S.T.E.V.E across a bunch of different maps mostly consisting of sunken man made structures and vehicles, like a sunken oil rig, an old galleon, a destroyed tanker ship, a downed WW2 bomber, and an underwater temple. Both teams have 30 lives (Respawns, pretty much). Run out of tickets and it's game over for your team. There are 4 safes littered around the map, and it takes a while for S.T.E.V.E to crack them open. After that, S.T.E.V.E heads back to the ship, and if it reaches it, the divers win. The alternative goal is to kill all sharks too. \n \nThe sharks, on the other fin, must kill all divers. Simple enough. Don't let them get back to that boat in one piece. Either that, or destroy S.T.E.V.E completely with boops, but a competent diver team will not let that happen. \n\nThere are two extra game modes, but I feel like people don't really bother with them anymore, because queue times are really long. Megalodon hunt, which is basically collecting gold to upgrade your weapons to kill a single huge shark, the megalodon, and another game mode that pits a bunch of divers against each other trying to protect S.T.E.V.E. with a single shark player wrecking havok. The shark here is a minor feature, it's mostly about diver on diver combat.\n\nVisually speaking, this game looks pretty gorgeous in my opinion. I specially like the option to add underwater fauna to the game, with fish and eels and other creatures swimming around peacefully. The visual effects and lightning effects are pretty good, too.\n\nThis game went for the same lootbox approach that everybody is taking nowadays, it seems, expect that you can get some for free by doing daily quests (I've opened like 40, and I always get shit, except for one time), and the ones that you purchase in the store don't need a key, unlike say, CSGO and TF2 boxes. Weapon skins are meh for me, but shark skins are quite awesome sometimes.\n\nNow, while the experience is quite fun at first, it can quickly get frustrating to some after a few hours of gameplay. Let me explain why:\n\nBeing an asymmetrical combat game, balancing can be quite an issue sometimes. Even the devs admit this, stating that lower level games are dominated by divers, mid level games by sharks, and high level games are slightly diver sided, according to their data. The game mostly revolves around picking a weapon or shark evolution, and when the enemy picks an evolution or weapon to counter yours, you pick a different one to counter their counter. For divers, it's all about collecting gold and purchasing upgrades for your weapons. For sharks, it's getting kills and picking skills like a talent tree. Divers are using toxic rounds? Don't worry, you can pick placoid scales to greatly counter the effect of the toxic rounds as a shark. Sharks are using blindside and fast, hard to hit sharks? Just pick a fast firing weapon and rounds that split once they are out of the gun, greatly increasing your chances to hit them. This counter counter picking is quite tense at times, but that being said, there ARE some evolutions and weapons that feel a tad more advantageous than others. I'M LOOKING AT YOU, VOLLEYJET, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. \n\nAnother problem with the game, is that the community is small. With that being said, the skill gap is HUGE between players in this game. It seems like the only ones playing this game are complete newbies that just picked up the game, and high level players that got hundreds or thousands of hours in this game. It's quite easy to see a level 5 and a level 100 in the same match for example. And this is where it gets really, really frustrating. You can be a decent mid level shark facing a full team of level 100 diver pricks with a shark teammate that barely reaches 10 played games in total, and this can quickly ruin your mood. You can also pick up the game and get roflstomped all day by high level players all day that counterpick your picks, too. Pubstomping is rather common , and I've been on both sides of it. Fun when you are on the winning side, a pain in the ass when you are on the other side. And it seems like a lot of the community would rather stomp noobs all day rather than face high level players that can put up a fight. (Myself included, sometimes, haha)\n\nThat being said, I personally recommend this game. It comes with the flaws of having a small but dedicated community, but if that doesn't bother you and you are willing to take the roflstomping like a man, get good and finally roflstomp yourself, then you're gonna have lots of fun with this one.", "timestamp_updated": 1505354961, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505351397, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "35145285", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545178", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506504602, "steamid": "76561197996888493", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 159}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Played three rounds during the free weekend and it was enough for me to buy it", "timestamp_updated": 1506146906, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506146906, "votes_down": 10}, {"recommendationid": "35136347", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526098", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507012146, "steamid": "76561197965944554", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 19764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3331}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
