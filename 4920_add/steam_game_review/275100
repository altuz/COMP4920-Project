I've seen some mixed reviews, some labelling it as boring. I can get that though. I'll explain why I understand, and why it doesn't apply to me. \n\nThe goal of this game is to raise your 4 baby kittens to adulthood, feeding them and keeping them save from predators and natural disasters. It is, however, relatively easy to do. If you keep within the starter area near your den, you'll be able to catch enough food and there are hardly any predators around. And that's it, an easy life is a boring life.\n\nBut there are other areas which you can travel to, being an open world, where wolves can appear or eagles, and food is more scarce. Or when there is food, the area is more difficult to run through to actually catch your prey.\nI found the Mountain DLC to be a great addition, since it allows predators to appear in more areas, making it a bit more challenging. The mountain area that is included in the DLC provides a whole new terrain to explore and new predators.\n\nI try to give myself a challenge by leaving the starter area when the kittens start following me around. Try to take risks. Stray from the safe path. The game keeps me engaged as I raise my kittens and collect items wherever possible. \nI have to admit that there even is an area that I've been avoiding since I have an hard time finding prey there. I might explore it soon again.\n\nBy the time of writing this review I've played over 10 hours this week of this game and find myself eager to start a new generation of kittens!", "timestamp_updated": 1505298027, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505298027, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34969880", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1497333210, "steamid": "76561198178265121", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 7, "review": "Got PTSD from watching my cubs die\n11/10", "timestamp_updated": 1505476149, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505476149, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35249309", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505255468, "steamid": "76561198302680141", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have to say, this game is incredible!\n\nBut for such a short game its sad........", "timestamp_updated": 1506545684, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506545684, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 836, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 174, "total_reviews": 1010}}
