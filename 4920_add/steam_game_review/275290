Until I put more thought into it and realised it's not \"one of those games\". It's the only game of its type. \n\n1. Full, FULL command simulator. No pixel lives, no cursor-following 'units', you're someone behind the lines holding a map sending orders through radio, wire telephone, or voice. Through command-chains\n2. The most realistic combat simulation I have ever seen in a strategy/simulator game\n3. Shittons of potential playtime (8 campaigns in stock game, up to 100-150 hours of play-time) not mentioning DLC's\n4. terraformable terrain. A feature that I greatly appreciated in MOWAS.\n5. Night-fighting, lots of it. Realistic, confusing, intense, pure unfilterd night-fighting.\n6. I'm gonna have to resort to using the sentence \"this is one of THOSE games\" here - It's one of those games that don't cater to title-bait casuals, this is made by a small dev-team that doesn't give a shit about selling and more interested in spending hundreds of work-hours into obscure conflicts or battles that took place around their homes. It's not Normandy/Omaha beach or Stalingrad or Kursk or the Ardennes or whatever attention-grabbing battles to people with a very generic view of WW2, I never learned about things like Kampfgruppe Peiper until I played this game. This is one of those games that cover many conflicts some people never heard of\n7. Cold war DLC's. Straight-up the most fun I've had with this game. Includes a massive fictional tank-battle set in an alternative-history scenario if you want to fulfill your western-vs-eastern massive tank battle dream.\n8. Physics. This game is old, but their physics game is on-point. \n\nI don't know what else to mention, but overall like I stated at the beginning. This is not \"one of those games\". This is THAT game, one-of-a-kind, only of its type.", "timestamp_updated": 1505574540, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505541452, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35199322", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501992", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506599898, "steamid": "76561198159514699", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 405}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Brutally realistic, extremely frustrating, aids tutorial and a shitload of fum.", "timestamp_updated": 1506331688, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506331688, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 160, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 37, "total_reviews": 197}}
