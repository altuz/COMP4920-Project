Then, I had been researching about 19th century naval warfare but unfortunately there are not trully interest aside Totem Games and Fall of the Samurai DLC to make games set in this fascinating era. \n\nVictorian Admirals is focused on 4 historical scenarios set in 1880s: Caroline Island Crisis 1885; Panama Crisis 1885; Marianas Incident 1887; Samoan Crisis 1889. The ships of the period are transitional between sailing ships and pre-dreadnought with steam powered engines. There is a great variety of ship models including gunboats, light and heavy frigates and monitors. The ship models are trully detailed, especially the damage textures, and the environment graphics look good as well with beautiful colors set in the Pacific and Caribbean. I also enjoy the engine and cannon sounds.\n\nFor those who complain about the lack of customization, the game is indeed customizable. Just go to Victorian Admirals and you will find a file Config where you can customize video settings and sounds settings, including music if you don't want to hear music while playing or to lower the volume of the music. I have this game maxed out and the graphics improve substantially, take a look at my video on youtube:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-fGpl1Ll_w\n\nI am glad Totem Games has another games covering other conflicts of this era: American Civil War, Chincha Islands War, Anglo-Russian War among others.
