Unknown entertainment value for children. My guess is that by the time they are old enough to figure out the puzzles on their own they will find the game too kiddish for them.\n\nReview: A tablet puzzle game with cartoony 3D models and low difficulty level meant at pacifying children of neglectful parents while absolving their guilt by pretending this is somehow partially educational by virtue of the fact that it has so called puzzles. \n\nThe transition to PC is not all that smooth with odd click drag controls to make the toddler monsters move in a certain direction. An action that has to be repeated every few steps for any kind of granular control. The game constantly reuses the same assets, and there are few animations. The writing is the most generic swill you could imagine. Because production costs were kept at a minimum this game has quite a bit of levels\n\nThis is a derivative of the sokoban style of game in which you must rearrange obstacles to bring crates to predetermined spots. Most hotspots have this naruto-style slightly fluorescent glyph on the floor to identify them to keep poking blindly to a minimum.\n\nThe twerking toddler victory dance was a little bit much...
