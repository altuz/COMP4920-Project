For example, I eventually started pausing mid level every time I wanted to upgrade a tower, because actually selecting one with the mouse is a hit and miss thing - it tries to grab and slide the screen instead, which is utterly useless since the whole map fits fine in my screen. And don't start me on the level selection slider. The appropriate asking price tipped the scale towards yes for me.\n\nThat huge aside aside, this is a solid tower defense game of the more traditional variety, with fixed paths and some interesting mechanics - just don't expect a reinvention of the wheel. The maps of the campaigns repeat once too often for my liking, however they're intersting enough and at times challenging. I like the difficulty, though the curve can occasionally be steep and some grinding seems to be encouraged. It is mildly addictive, the graphics are fine and scale alright, the music is okay but can get very repetitive. All in all, as TDs go this one is lukewarm: decent, not great, not bad.\n\nPet peeve: It's really sparse on information about the levels, the enemies, the towers and the upgrades. I especially miss details on the enemy types (an icon and a level are not info enough in my book). More practical details at the level selection page would also help plan what towers/weapons to pack along. However, since many of the maps are pretty solidly geared towards one or two winning strategies, you could consider that part of the design: this is less a plan ahead and stratgize sort of TD and more a \"jump right in and take the hits as they come\" one. Personally, I consider the lack of information just another sign of a game made for smaller screens and less reading. \n\nSo buy? Yes, I suppose, if you're a TD fan and running dry.

Shame there is no such option. With that said - game is not exactly bad, but it has a lot of flaws. But let's start with good part - game has lots of maps (35+), lots of modes and difficulties and nice interest system where you have to keep your defences to minimal, which adds to tactical part. That's about it for the good part.\n\nNow about bad stuff - first of all, game is [i] really [/i] long. Each stage (except maybe very early ones) lasts at least an hour. On it's own that wouldn't be so bad, but you can't speed up the game more than 2x. Considering that some games has 3x, 5x, even 9x speed ups - very poor desicion. Next thing - in every stage to collect more money (and gain more interest money) you have to do your best to kill enemies withlou building anything. So you have to use abilities and your commander (yup, you have movable unit to help you) for a good 20-30% of the stage. Way to go for a TD, instead of tactical managing limited resourses you must jump around to collect money. Another bad thing is - there are basically only 8 types of enemies with small variations, nothing interesting really. If that was a game for 20-30 hours, it'd be ok, but game for 100h+? Definitely bad. And there is more! Towers are majorly disbalanced, by the end of the game you really need only 4-5 towers from given 12 - as if 12 was too much to make it more or less balanced. Well, that's it for big ones, i may also add couple small ones - bad graphics (but i guess if you play TD you don't care like me, still had to write about it), repetitive music (remember 100h+ of gameplay, on the other hand you can turn it down - again, like i did) and small glitch when you choose chapters, but that's not really an issue, just a bit annoying.\n\nSo. After all that you may ask why i even put \"recommend\" on it. Well, not everyone completes games on 100%. If you want to complete campaign and leave, i suppose, it's not so bad. I give this game 5/10, because it's badly flawed and artificially prolonged, but you may still enjoy it.

They can only come certain ways along a path, and you can place turrets somewhere along this path. The special *schtick* of Sentinel 3 is you have a special commander unit on scene that can act as a mobile turret / repair / buff unit that you can upgrade and outfit separately from your arsenal of turrets. And that introduced a whole new aspect of tactical decision making for this genre. \n\nIn a typical fixed-path tower defense, the path the enemy units walk on have already been defined and your decision is to choose which turrets to build where and when (and when to upgrade them). This is when you notice that the valid build spots are not that obvious. Instead of the valid tiles being highlighted, you need to slide your units across the spots to see which spots are \"green\" and which spots are \"red\" (not there). Once placed, you can spend further money to upgrade them to do more damage. exponentially more damage. Typical progression is each turret has 4 upgrades. The normal \"shooter\" turret is 1/2/4/8/50. You can see the \"maxed out\" turret does much more damage, at great cost. Other turrets are of similar ratio. The turrets are a typical mix: MG, bomb, slow, beam, flame, and so on. \n\nBetween missions you can spend your XP credits to buy upgrades, such as additional turret slots so you can take more than one type of turrets into combat. \n\nThe commander unit is the unique factor, in that it can be mobile (if you buy the jumpjet upgrade) and it has its own weapons to engage enemies, both from afar, and in melee. However, if it is destroyed, you lose! With sufficient upgrades, it can repair barriers that were previously damaged, as well as give an enhancement aura to turrets within range. Other capabilities, such as rage, fire support, and so on can also be added subject to the XP points.  As you level up, you gain access to more toys, and so on. \n\nThere are 20 campaign missions, and about a dozen or so maps, and four different difficulty levels. \n\nThe graphics are decidedly low-res by modern standards, but adequate, and music is nothing to write home about. \n\nAll in all Sentinel 3 is a tower defense game with a twist.

This game also runs really hot on my video card. The fan on my GPU maxes out when this thing is running, so there must be some real inefficient code running behind the scenes. The game still works just fine, though. I would recommend this to anyone who likes TD.

The levels are all very bland and \"samey,\" there are very few enemy types (although they can vary in strength amongst their kind), and it is very easy. The game never introduces anything which forces you to change your play style; your first two towers are all that you need to beat most every level.\n\nThe game tries to add some spice to the typical TD recipe by including a commander unit who can move from one key point to another and engage the enemies directly, except that it isnt very well implemented. There is no penalty if he dies, and he doesnt really do much for a very long ways into the game. The key locations that he can guard are basically capable of handling themselves without his help, as long as you add one bomb turret and a couple of lasers.\n\nThe game feels short, even though it takes awhile to beat. There are only a small number of maps available, so the game repeats several of them with \"different\" waves of enemies (which dont feel different at all due to the limited variety) and tries to extend gameplay by making you face absurdly high wave counts (50+ for most levels).\n\nI like TD games, and i have played a ton of them... but this game felt half assed and amateur.
