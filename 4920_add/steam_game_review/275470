Now make it so that I can actually click things fast enough to solve the puzzles. There is a problem with the controls for the game. many times timing is the key to solving puzzles. If you can't click the blocks to move them in time then you can't solve it. My son and I tried many many times knowing the solution but being unable to actualize it because the game wouldn't let us click the blocks fast enough. \n\nI would honestly LOVE to give this a thumbs up, but the controls are a real deal breaker guys, sorry.", "timestamp_updated": 1501565318, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501565318, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 49, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 18, "total_reviews": 67}}
