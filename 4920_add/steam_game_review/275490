That makes it difficult for me to recommend, because almost every time I try playing one of those old platformers again, I quickly lose interest. It's not that I'm against item collection by default. It's just that the act of collecting items needs to remain fun and varied throughout the game in order for me to enjoy it. In my opinion, very few item collection games successfully accomplish that. They usually become bogged down in tedium and make me feel like I'm just going through the motions.\n\nThe goal of each level is to collect whatever the game tells you to, such as gems, coins, treasure chests, or food. Doing so will unlock an exit portal, which you then have to find and enter before time runs out. Along the way you'll have to dodge enemies and various environmental hazards. The levels are usually open-ended and you can choose which area to clear first. As you finish levels, you can also unlock different characters with special abilites, such as magnetically attracting certain items, or having immunity to certain hazards.\n\nThe main problem I have is that it just feels like a chore to get anything done. Your jump height is low, so there are plenty of spots where you have to jump up multiple platforms stacked on top of each other, which feels awfully monotonous. Your movement speed is slow, so if you have to backtrack through an area you've already cleared, or loop around, it can take a while. Collecting items usually doesn't involve any creativity on your part; mostly you're just jumping from platform to platform a lot. Level mechanics don't evolve that much either, from what I've seen (about half of the game as of this writing). The game adds things like moving platforms and springs, but I never felt like there was enough to make individual levels stand out from each other. Level distinction is something I value very highly in platformers, and I don't see enough here, personally.\n\nAlso, this game can't decide whether it wants to be easy or hard. You can get hit multiple times by enemies before running out of health, and once you do, the game just respawns you somewhere nearby. In addition, you're invincible for a couple of seconds every time you're hit. So, there's little incentive to pay any attention to danger. On the other hand, each level has a fairly strict time limit, and if you run out of time, you have to start over from the beginning. On top of that, both health and time factor into your rating upon finishing a level, and if you get too many low ratings, you won't unlock the next world. What does this game want me to do? If I carefully dodge obstacles, I could run out of time; if I rush through everything, I could get hit plenty of times and get a low health rating. What usually ends up happening, especially in later levels, is that I have to replay stages to get higher ratings. That's a lot of item collecting- much more than I have the patience for.\n\nFinally, I don't like the menu interface. You can't use the mouse. The main menu constantly gets swapped with a high score table even while you're navigating it. There are buttons with pictures instead of text, and it's not obvious what all of them do at first.\n\nIf you loved the original game this one is based on, or if you're more fond of item collection games than I am, you might enjoy this.

I want 3 stars on every map.\n\nI really hope the developers keep doing updates. There's a lot of promise in this one.
