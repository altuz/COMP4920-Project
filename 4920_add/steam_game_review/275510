It's a sci-fi storyline which is told between levels in cutscenes (and also via radio chatter while you're playing). Now the game is story driven in a very simple way i.e. cutscenes set up the level and your objectives form a part of the overall storyline. You could skip all the story without really affecting the game, but it's worth watching if you get the humour.\n\nThis is a remastered edition but don't expect AAA graphics, it's the simplicity of this while remaining challenging is what makes it an enduring classic for me.

The keywords here are [b]at this moment of time.[/b]\n\nYep, this game does feel a bit like Early Access. There are some bugs and glitches here and there, most frequent of them are invincible bunkers (protip - bring some Pyros, their attacks ignore terrain at all) and targeting glitch, which makes your cursor think it's still on enemy building (it made me fail mission 12). Other bugs include units being stuck in buildings, units being unable to enter buildings (makes mission 18 unwinnable), untis reacting weird when under attack (I once had psycho running halfway around the map to retaliate to a guy who just popped up from nearby bridge), and minor non-gamebreaking bugs.\n\nCompared to original, graphics have been improved (original units looked like voodoo dolls of low-poly models; i could count polygons on those on my fingers), howerver there is a problem with bloom sometimes, plus bump mapping on some models look a bit over the top. Some units have been changed in their look, like Toughs now represtent robotic heavy weapons guy from TF2, only armed with homing missile launchers instead of machineguns, and mobile radar jammer now wheeled vehicle instead of tracked one it used to be. Generally, robots look more human than they were supposed to in original game concept-art, and some buildings feel like they've been enlarged and rescaled (worst case with robot factory and air hangar - the former feels a bit bloated, the latter has huge control tower).\n\nMy major complain so far is the interface. It's horrible, feels console-ish, and does not present some vital infromation, like balance of income and expences, timer in timed missions, unit count and upgrade levels.\n\nBut as far as gampelay goes, it still feels like i'm back in original ZSS: grab a handful of psychos, take as much of the flags on a map as you can, build up a strike group and go wipe the map with your enemies. Or, watch them wipe map with your troops, if you've miscalculated something. The latter however right now is entirely your fault, since there are no difficulty setting, and AI is somewhat clueless on what's it doing (however, on mission 14 AI tried to drop a light tank and two pyros on my command center via transport heli - never seen AI doing that in original).\n\nMultiplayer and Skirmish modes are missing so far, and i can't get clear understanding if devs will impliment them anytime soon/late.\n\nFinally, the sounds are taken right from original Z:SS, as wel as music tracks (and projectile models, save for Laser's - it's much brighter than original one was). However, currently there is a problem with music: it stucks in a loop and never ends. Even \"mission successful\" music. So, i dunno, pop your favorite epic techo playlist while you're at it? :D\n\nSo, as i said: get this if you're either hard-boiled Z:Steel Soldiers fan, or if you're Z series fan and don't mind game being a bit raw at the moment.

Below are my thoughts about this remastered version...\n\n- The developers have kept almost everything from the base game intact but have updated the game with new visuals, new models, UI etc. to match that of, for example, the older C&C Generals games instead of keeping the very old and outdated graphics from 2001.\n(By the way, all sounds are that from the base game.)\n\n- The devs are constantly updating this game, some features from the old classic game wasn't compatible with newer systems and so the devs are working around the clock to roll out updates frequently, just about two days ago the old cinematics were re-added to the game.\n(Skrimish is due around this month.)\n\nBased on my own personal opinion i recommend this game, the only flaw i've encountered is that some of the later Campaign missions are extremely difficult but aside from that this is a solid return of an old classic!\n\nZod is back!!!", "timestamp_updated": 1407493139, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1407493139, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "17581535", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498835", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1464506304, "steamid": "76561198028444797", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The Bitmap brothers bring us the sequel to 1996's real-time strategy \"Z,\" jumping into 3D yet sticking with the same quirky sense of \"robot\" humor and style of game that made the original game a success.", "timestamp_updated": 1439811381, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1439811381, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "12396161", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493112", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1414538982, "steamid": "76561198139082341", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Definitely an old favorite.
