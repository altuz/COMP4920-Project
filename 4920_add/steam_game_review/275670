Really the only difference that this makes is that there's a much smaller area for every weapon or defence system that you place. The gameplay is reasonably good fun and each level requires 5-10 minutes of concentration. However after just 5 levels I was already finding the game quite repetitive.\n\nThere is an upgrade tree, however despite a range of choices it still feels fairly one dimensional. Most of the upgrades involve giving a certain sstem a special power which must be manually activated. There is no pause feature in the gameplay as there is in Faster Than Light and so much of the game becomes time pressured micromanagement, which I do not find enjoyable. The upgrades are somewhat independent of your performance in a level. There is no real difference between limping across the finish line and dominating the level with an abundance of scrap metal, as long as you complete the requirements your reward is the same. The game wants you to spend all of your scrap each level as there is no benefit to being thrifty.\n \nThe dialogue in this game is truly terrible. Thankfully you are able to skip the dialogue and none of it has any bearing on the gameplay. Still, this turns the game into a series of individual repetitive missions as opposed to a game with any real story and progress.\n\nThere are much better strategy games and tower defenders out there.", "timestamp_updated": 1501167513, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501167513, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "33820924", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501171698, "steamid": "76561198016603957", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Story:\nStory is silly, and not really meant to be anything special.\nGraphics:\nGraphics a pretty decent.  The screenshots are an accurate representation.\nFun:\nThe game is a blast. It gets really hectic and you have to replay the level a couple times to get all the placements as effecient as possible.\nOther:\nThe good thing about winning a level, even if you don't get 5 stars, you get credits for better gear, or upgrades to current gear.  So, every time you replay a level, trying to get that elusive 5 star, you get a little bit more powerful.\n\nThe game is short, but fun.  Not worth $15 in my opinion...
