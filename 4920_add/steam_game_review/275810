From which Person is that game also the favourite childhood game? It works like then and I'm just sooooooo happy that I found it today on Steam! \n\nSo the Graphics are not very high and the Format is not adjustable. But I think that's making a big part of the charm it spreads. While you play it you feel more like a child (in my point of view) because it is very easy (Match-3 game) but the idea behind it is good. I personally love the old greeks culture and the 7 World Wonders were and are very interesting for me. I like to see how they were build while giving the people at the bottom new stones. Also I laughted very often about the caricatures of the people which build these buildings. You can see it's age but that's not a problem at all. It's a timeless game you can play for about half an hour or something like that time in between your daily scedule. I just don't like the free play mode because it's not the feeling of getting around like in the orgininal list, it's more like you choose just the background.\n\nI'm giving a big thumb up and recommend it to you all (let your kids play it ^^).", "timestamp_updated": 1494080748, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494080748, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 8}}
