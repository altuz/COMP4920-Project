There are seven levels in total with each level having several sub levels. In each level there are also two mini games which you can finish to get gold and statues with which to decorate the wonder you're building. To build them, you must match tiles in lines of three or more. A match larger than three tiles rewards you with special tiles. Clearing the tiles also rewards you by powering up special powers. \n\n[b]Long Review[/b]\n\n     [i]Story[/i]: In this game, you've been hired by the gods to build various buildings/cities of myth and legend. \n\n     [i]Graphics[/i]: The art assets are pretty good, though the multiple colours of the tiles in later levels can be a bit overwhelming due to there being so many on the board at once.\n\n     [i]Music/Sounds[/i]: The music and sound fx are simple, but pleasing to listen to. They do get a bit samey towards the end, but they're also easy to tune out. \n\n     [i]Length[/i]:  It took me about 5 hours to complete the game. For the price, this isn't too bad. \n\n     [i]Replayability[/i]: There isn't much in the way of replayability in this game. Once you've completed all the levels and          beat the two mini games in each level, that's pretty much all there is.\n\nThis game is simple and casual in nature. If you like matching games, I recommend it. Due to it not having much, if any, replayability however, only get it when it's on sale. \n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1418150096, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1418150096, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "15089743", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502708", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1426434081, "steamid": "76561198076629424", "num_games_owned": 1196, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Best in the series.

Beating it on normal took about five hours.\n\nThe goal of the game is to construct wonders. That takes resources which you get by matching gems. You can only get a limited amount of resources per level so you have to play about seven levels to complete a wonder. That is if you manage to get the maximum amount of resources every level. If not, you have to complete more levels. Each wonder also requires you to complete two minigames. The minigames have to be unlocked by collecting keys while playing the levels.\n\nTo complete a level, you have to break background tiles by matching gems on top of them. After the tiles are all broken, a special gem appears that you have to get all the way to the bottom by matching the gems underneath it. Once the special gem reaches the bottom, the level is complete. You also have a time limit, but I do not know what happens if you run out of time since it never happened to me. \n\nThe levels vary in shape and the amount of background tiles that need to be broken increases as you go along. The background tiles also become more durable, requiring multiple matches to break. There are also special abilities you can use that recharge when you match gems. Matching four or more gems spawns special gems that can clear whole rows at a time.\n\nTo put it all together, you start playing a level. You match gems until you have collected the minigame keys and maxed your resources. Then you break all the background tiles. Then you lower the special gem to the bottom of the screen, completing the level. Now you can spend your resources on building the wonder. Then rinse and repeat until the wonder is complete. Then you start a new wonder.
