The story felt dull, the landscapes were just... off, and it just wasn't what was advertised.\n\nI cast it aside, too late to refund.\n\nBase building came out, along with vehicles, creative mode, and a camera. I played around with them, and they were fun - but the survival still felt lackluster. Creative mode got boring fast, and the camera (probably one of my favourite game features at the time) was hardly worth going into the game to use just for screenshots.\n\nAnd now, after the Waking Titan ARG - we have Atlas Rises.\nTo be honest - I'm impressed. Suddenly, I find myself wanting to play survival because it's fun. Hell, I find myself wanting to play the game itself because I enjoy it now, not because I'm bored and need to sink time into something.

When the game was released almost everyone was dissapointed and I was a little but all these memories as a child boosted my determination to want the game more and more.

I was so excited to play it and I got it when the Atlas Rises update which was the best time to buy the game because almost everything they announced on first release was there. First thing I notice is the amazing soundtrack. I mean its amazing, it fits perfectly in with that spacy theme. I go on my first planet only with medium graphics and it still made my jaw drop. The HUD and the ground, plants, creatures, everything looked amazing. I bump it up to medium and high graphics with a stable 30-40 fps and that is perfect for my liking. I played the heck out of it. I find my self completing missions while exploring solar systems and planets full or life or baron. Creating a base to live in, creating a farm to earn profit working to get a good ship. Helping my fellow Geks fight off pirates. One of the best parts about this was that I got the game for only 25$. To me this is such a steal. This game right now is well worth 60$ and it constantly reciving updates. Listening to their supporters fixing bugs. But people still don't realize that they can't fix all the bugs in one patch. People have to learn to give them some time. I know its been a year but forget the past of this game and act like it was just released. Trust me the game is worth it,  you wont regret buying it.

Discussing the actual (constantly updated) features of the game is nearly pointless, given the volume at which initial negative reactions have been carried forwards, even more than a year later. So instead, let's do a thought experiment, or maybe an analogy. It's a bit long for a \"review\", but the payoff at the end should help you decide if it's worth your time.\n\nConsider the \"Simulation Theory\" of cosmology, which proposes that if \"simulated\" universes are possible, then they are likely to outnumber non-simulated universes - therefore, we are statistically more likely to be living in a simulated universe than a non-simulated one.\n\nConsider the modern \"Scientific Method\" - you observe a phenomenon, you produce a model or \"theory\" to explain that phenomenon, and then you (and other scientists who read your published papers) try to prove the theory [i]wrong,[/i] or at least find and categorize the instances where the theory fails to hold. If a counterexample to a theory is found, the model is adjusted or discarded, and testing resumes. The more attempts at disproof a theory survives, the \"stronger\" it is considered to be. Mere evidence that a theory is true is [i]not enough[/i] - you must [i]try[/i] to find evidence that it is false, and fail.\n\nConsider [i]both[/i] of the above. If we [i]were[/i] living in a simulated universe, [i]how could we test that from the inside?[/i] If there is no way to \"get outside\" a simulated universe, then we could not compare observations between a \"real\" and a \"simulated\" universe to find discrepancies. Any artifacts, documentation, or phenomena which appears to come from \"outside\" could also be the product of physical laws or highly-advanced entities existing entirely [i]inside[/i] this universe, that we simply don't know of or understand yet. Even an unexpected granularity at the smallest level, correspondences between seemingly unrelated events, or a giant monolith that says \"THIS UNIVERSE IS A PROGRAM\" could end up being explained by an entirely in-universe theory. Descartes made a similar argument regarding a \"malicious demon\", only in this case, it's \"trolling by alien jerks\".\n\nGiven the methods of science, what possible evidence [i]could[/i] there be, waiting to be found, that could prove [i]or[/i] disprove that our universe is simulated? If none is even hypothetically possible, then the \"Simulation Theory\" is no theory at all, but a philosophical article of faith - the belief that our universe is a simulation is reduced to a secular parallel to the belief in the existence of a supernatural Deity.\n\n[b]CONCLUSION:[/b] If you found the last four paragraphs boring and pointless, you probably [i]won't[/i] enjoy No Man's Sky. If you skipped over them completely as soon as you read \"payoff at the end\", then you're probably going to give up in boredom long before you find out what the game's plot and true goal is.\n\nIf either of those statements applies to you, then No Man's Sky will seem to be nothing more than a meaningless grind for resources in a randomized but boring universe. [i]You[/i] truly would be happier playing Call of Duty, and there's not necessarily any shame in that.\n\nIn Star Trek, most non-human intelligent species still look human-ish, with varying rubber masks and prosthetics. Originally, this was a matter of budget constraints and lack of realistic CGI. Eventually, the \"Progenitors\" were introduced as a plot element, and the fact that most starfaring aliens looked \"humanoid\" gained [i]in-universe justification.[/i]\n\nIn No Man's Sky, you can look at the repeated similarities in planets, biology, and technology scattered across tens of thousands of light-years of space, and your reaction might well be \"This is stupid, there's nothing to see, it's all so fake and boring\".\n\nOn the other hand, your response might be to ask, \"[i]How[/i] did this happen?\" - and if that seems like the more interesting response, then [i]you[/i] will probably enjoy this game. Just...don't expect to be taken seriously if you [i]admit[/i] to it.

Glad I didn't get it then (I've developed a habit of not buying anything at release).  The reason I picked it up was that I heard the Atlas Rises patch/expansion was awesome, and it was on sale.\n\nHoly what the wow.  For my 25 bukaruus or so, I have now gotten over 27 hours of pretty much nonstop enjoyable gameplay, and I'm only 8 achievements in, still on my first ship, and haven't ventured more than 2 warp-jumps away from where I started (with one quest-related exception).\n\nI'll say it again-- the free, open Exploration is unmatched.  Going from fumbling around to fix your sad, broken junk to mastering multiple levels of ship control and continually acquiring new ways to overcome challenges is a powerful feeling.  It stays with you; I'm even looking at the real world differently.  Beyond this, the art and music are fantastic, the writing is way beyond what I expected (to the point of messing with your head, I love it), and I always feel like there's something more to look forward to.\n\nDownsides?  If you don't like resource gathering (i.e. Minecraft) you may have trouble with this one.  However, there are a lot of things to gather for different reasons, and you can choose how much of that you want to do to some extent.  Inventory space is cramped, and you will have to manage the heck out of it, at least initially.  I personally like this pressure - it forces you to streamline and incentivizes seeking upgrades - but some may find it tedious.  It would be nice if sentient NPCs had better A.I. (they're more like Morrowind than Oblivion/Skyrim), but dialogue and animation are quite good and there's so much else to do that I honestly don't miss it.\n\nIs it worth full price?  At this point, it would have been for me.  I had no idea going in, though.  If you're an explorer type who likes sci-fi, enjoyed Minecraft and had fun with any of the Elder Scrolls games, DEFINITELY buy it if it's on sale.  You get elements of all those, plus a spaceship to fly and fight with in different ways.  You can even forget everything else and just play your own version of Asteroids while building up hoards of cash and ship upgrades-- a simple home base and finding a spaceport are all you need.\n\nI'm just having such a blast for the first time in a long while and wanted to share it with the world.  I quit a nearly 3-year Hearthstone addiction (the main game I kept playing during this time) and I'm so glad.  If you're still unsure about buying it, put it on your wishlist NOW.
