Even pony-mad kids are liable to find this unbearably dull if played for longer than five minutes. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b]: Awful. Straight out of the mid-1990s. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]: Now I'm a reasonably intelligent adult but the lack of guidance as to how to play this god-forsaken excuse of a game is insane. There is\u00a0no\u00a0information on how to improve the horses skills, health, cleanliness, etc. There are a handful of tasks to complete, but nothing useful in the way of a tutorial. Is there even a help guide? If so, I couldn't find one.\u00a0\n\n[b]Entertainment Value[/b]: Okay, so the show element is\u00a0vaguely\u00a0entertaining, but for every 60 seconds of competition I can guarantee you another 10 minutes of walking. Yes. WALKING: endless leading of your horse back and forth from the paddock and stables will sap your will to live. Oh, and then there's the grooming. Horse cleanliness seems to plummet regardless of how long one spends on the utterly tedious process of waggling a brush around. No indication is given of how long is long enough, or if progress is being made. Literally hours of your game day will be spent on this task... and largely in vain.\u00a0\n\n[b]In Summary[/b]: Run.
