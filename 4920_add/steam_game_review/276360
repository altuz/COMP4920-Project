Really enjoyed that, so I thought I'd get this for nostalgia reasons. It was a mistake. I don't remember the original having such frustrating controls. For this you have to use your mouse for just about everything, including steering and it just doesn\u2019t seem to work. For the show jumping you have to approach the jump square, meaning if you over steer by just a little your horse will refuse. Dressage is even more complicated. The horse care factor seems to be the same as any other game of this type, nothing ground-breaking about it. The Riding Out option seems a bit pointless. The training you can do is probably the best part as you don't constantly have to stop every time you mess up! \nIf the controls were different this could potentially be a fun game, as it is it is just disappointing.

Especially RS3 has brought me years of wonderful gameplay. I don't even know how often I have restarted all three slots and how often I have finished the game compltely just to start anew. \nThe control, of which many here complain only suggest the usage of you mouse for the very best experience. It is not necessarily needed! It works perfectl using the arrowkeys and the W and S key for stirring the horse and commanding its gaits. \nAlso the rather long process of training your horse is very realistic. yes it gets harder and longer the closer you get to taking part in the grand show at Aachen. But it is also directly taken from reallife horseriding. It is indeed possible for a beginner to train for a week and then enter and maybe even win a beginners competition, but to achieve great results at a 4*/pro level or even attempt riding such a course it often takes years if not decades to achieve such horsemanship. Therefore far more realitic than many other horse simulation games. \nAnd therefore also the free ride option is really an option if you get to stressed training your horses for the next competition Level. also it is a great help to memorize and just plan out the current crosscountry course (even though there are no jups in free ride mode). And that of course in the very calming athmosphere aof a magnificent sunset.\nAll in all this game is a game with hours of fun for everybody. Be they adults who ambitiously train their horses for the worldcup at Aachen or be they children just looking for some fun gameplay.\n\n\nIch m\u00f6chte hier einmal allen wiedersprechen die dieses Spiel schlecht reden.\nIch kenne und habe alle drei RS Spiele gespielt.

Jeder kann sich nach einer Woche Intensivkurs auf ein Pferd setzen und ein E Springen bzw eine E Dressur reiten. Aber um in einem Springen under einer Dressur der Klasse S zu bestehen muss man oft mehrer Jahre bzw Jahrzehnte an seinem K\u00f6nnen arbeiten. \nDa kommt einemder ruhige selbstbestimmte Ausritt im Abendlicht doch gerade recht. Auch um nocheinmal den Cross Parcours abzureiten, wenn auch ohne Hindernisse, bietet sich ein abendlicher Ausritt an. \nIch kann dieses Spiel nur jedem, sei er erwachsen oder ein junger Mensch, sei er JUnge oder M\u00e4dchen, w\u00e4rmstens ans Herz legen!", "timestamp_updated": 1415310382, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415309339, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "10867219", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511069", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1396221041, "steamid": "76561198071176952", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If you're looking for a decent equestrian game to waste some time with, look elsewhere.

The game involves grooming horses, training for show jumping, cross country and dressage, hacking and competing.\n\nThis game was originally made for console (I had the game on PS2) and it doesn't seem they bothered to make any changes to put it on PC. As opposed to other equestrian games (most of which are not available on Steam) which use the arrow keys for direction, this game uses the mouse in a way that takes some getting used to. With a controller, one would use the right joystick/thumbstick to turn, pushing it to the right or left and releasing ; and so one must slide their mouse to the right or left to turn, but you must bring the mouse back to the center to stop turning. As we all have mouse accelaration, this can cause some frustration in the game play when you're not used to it.\nI suggest turning the mouse accelaration off to make it easier, at least in the beggining, or just plugging your controller in if you have one.
