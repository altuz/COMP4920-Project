Over the course of many hours, and even days of gameplay, each virtual animal became more than just that. They became my true friends. My family. I return home from work at the soup kitchen every evening, perspiring with the anticipation of greeting my fictional buddies on my Personalised Computer. \n\nWhat initially struck me as interesting was the strength in dialogue throughout many levels of this elaborate masterpiece. Taking into account the story lacking a proper introduction and furthermore a real tutorial to aid the transition into the role of the \"Pet Hotel Manager\", the script the key characters followed in most cutscenes was by far the most creative and innovative i have witnessed in the past few years. Normally I enter willingly into a virtual world such as this to be met with an immersive and heart-stopping environment, but this was something else. The next-generation game engine which \"My Pet Hotel\" is run on exceeds that of any engine I have ever seen before in my many decades of pet-managing. \n\nThe unique flare within each detail and development I have encountered in my 7 playthroughs has led me to understand that each twist and turn in the plot leads to even greater story development, and when you thought that the story material had exceeded its limitations then something extraordinary emerges from the depths of \"My Pet Hotel\" to stun the player. Delivering an emotional punch to each player in their initial journey through the mystical world, this chilling and delicious rendition of its original 1986 work of art does not fail to deliver on the reminiscent euphoria I felt myself victim to as a young lad.\n\nWith all things considered, my encounter with \"My Pet Hotel\" has left me personally with a greater longing for a sequel than I have felt for many releases in the past.
