It's rather mediocre but still enjoyable until you grow bored of the rules that only slightly change over the campaign. At least graphics are pretty and atmosphere is nice and fluffy. So, what about the game aspect?\n\nBasically, in each mission you'll establish a production cycle that earns you money that is used to build special structures and cut stones (the other resource). Stone is used to build money generating buildings and other structures. Money is generated by clicking icons that pop up when the building has produced a patch of taxes. Then your tax collectors will rush to bring the gold back to the castle. Profit!\n\nSo the mechanics are very simple and repetitive and approaching dull. Most everything happens with one or two clicks. A naive story of getting friendly with the dragons runs along by completing the missions of each level. Missions range from gathering enough gold to killing all the wild animals and monsters (which simply costs money and/or mana that is a resource unlocked later) to building certain buildings and upgrades. While the mechanics are always the same, they are used in many ways within the story: early on you'll be saving the tree of life, helping some druids and loading up ships for a journey.\n\nThe full completion of the game takes only several hours: for me this was less than 5. The game is rather unchallenging. There are 9 in-game achievements that would be nice to see on Steam as well, but they are very easy to attain.\n\nIt's a decent, though rather short time waster. Though I initially recommended the game, I've decided to revoke my recommendation because of the utter repetitive nature of the game that becomes boring half-way through. It was somewhat worth its discounted price though because the story was so cute.\n\nif you'd like to test the game out anyway, a demo is available at bigfishgames.com:\nhttp://www.bigfishgames.com/download-games/23538/kingdom-tales/index.html", "timestamp_updated": 1392424655, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1392343147, "votes_down": 22}, {"recommendationid": "9149091", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512029", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1392595153, "steamid": "76561198025025501", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I would not recommend this game for anyone over 8 years old or who has ever played a game of this general type.
