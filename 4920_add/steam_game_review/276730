I decided to come back to Tango Fiesta now that it was released.\n\nIt... uh. Bleh. Guns are really bad at describing what they do before you use them in a level, which is fantastic since they're all terrifically expensive and several of them are an incredible pain to unlock via any method except running around in circles killing easy enemies for an hour, since you need to get hundreds of thousands of points in a single run.\n\n\"But points! You get them by doing well!\" Well, actually you don't get all that many by doing well, because you get points for killing enemies en masse, and you complete levels by ignoring most of the enemies and destroying the objectives, since enemies infinitely respawn and can be rather tough... especially enemy corporals, who sometimes take almost a full magazine, if not more, of your gun unloaded directly into their face to kill.\n\nBetween that and several glaring bugs still present in the launch version (enemies spawning or being knocked on top of walls in the Killionaire missions, a level of Bionic Cop that took me 5 tries arbitrarily deciding it would never end after I beat it) I wasn't really having that much fun with the game. Half of the bosses (Yatcha Queen, Ramishar) are interesting, but the others were just an exercise in running away from them in a straight line while shooting, and Ramishar's HP bar overstayed its welcome for me, a bit.\n\nI unfortunately wasn't able to complete the game yet, having gotten bogged down in the final level set, Bionic Cop, but I don't think it would change my review much even if I manage to get through it next time I try. Ultimately, there's much better twin-stick shooters and better, uh, Broforces. Like Broforce.\n\nEDIT: Tried once more, got through Bionic Cop 2, still not able to clear Bionic Cop 3. Guns still require me to farm 250+ enemy kills each.

It's a by-the-book arena twin-stick shooter a la Geometry Wars, made by a small studio. Solid mechanics.

It's still very playable. You start with an automatic rifle, shotgun, and some grenades. Every enemy drops gold. Gold is use to unlock the other weapons. The longer you play the more enemies spawn until you destroy or capture the objectives, then the spawns stop and you get to mop up the stragglers. The next level unlocks after defeating the last, and you can select any level you've completed. The levels are themed after various 80's action movies. I noticed a good mechanic in the second set of levels that was quite impressive. It's a jungle with areas of brush from which you can post up and pick off the enemies. The brush blocks their gunfire. If you are equipped with a rifle, the bullets fly through the brush. If your other weapon is for example a submachinegun, your bullets  will only hit the brush. Each tile of brush is destructible, so it provides temporary cover. Also, walls of most structures are destructible as well. I want to keep this short for now so will end it here. I may pop in to edit in the future. I like top down shooters, and this one is fun. If you don't mind playing an alpha, and you really like top down shooters check this out.
