Think of it less as a fancy chess game and more of an analysis tool for chess enthusiasts.\n\nEvery single bad review you'll see for this program is due, not to some defect or bug, but because this is a bloody complex application and it's rather hard to intuit what it is you want to do. Reading through the manual, especially if something doesn't seem to make sense, is highly, *highly* recommended.  If you just want to play chess, and nothing else, you'd be better served by the pack-in games that come with your operating system. The Fritz engine that comes with this software has a low end rating in the 1400s and is absolutely /not/ for beginners!\n\nSo what can you use this for? The killer feature for me is the ability to load up PGN-formatted games (I usually annotate them on my phone) and have the engine go through your game and note where and how you messed up.

While I'd like to consider myself a decent Chess player, I admit I still have much to learn of the game, such as end game calculations, mass attack and defense strategies, and how to not accidentally spill coffee on my chessboard while I play.\n\nAlthough I haven't found any tools or tips for coffee related checkmates, (Coffee Temperature Gauge, Player Motor Skills vs. Reaction Timing Graph, Coffee Cup Center of Gravity Chart, Coffee Stain Probability Meter, Estimated Remaining Time of Cleanup, etc.) I believe this program is a substantial learning and teaching tool. \n\nIn essence, this software is great for improving your game and playing techniques, or even teaching them if you enjoy being a Chess tutor. While you can indeed play a simple game of Chess with Fritz 14, it offers a great deal more than that, from multimedia files that explain the rules of the game as well as rated and timed matches, to differing analysis tools that suggest blunders, better moves and checkmate threats, to even more tools including subtle hints and showing every single possible move and the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\nI would like to warn potential buyers of Fritz 14, it can be very complex and intimidating to learn all of the programs offerings. I'm not questioning intelligence here but rather pointing out that Fritz 14 truly does go the distance in terms of analysis tools and options, and the time it may take to learn them can frustrate and be off-putting. However, in my opinion, once you learn how it all functions and how you can best use or customize the tools to your liking, it is that much more at your disposal. So, while figuring it all out can be an arduous task to master, I personally think it pays off in the long run, especially for anyone whom is seriously trying to learn and best the challenges that make Chess what it is.\n\nThe core game offers several types of 2D and 3D boards, not a considerable amount, but a few. A player can customize the pieces of the set, the board color and style, as well as the background table the board is set on. This is also the first Chess program I've played that offers 3D opponents that can move the pieces with their hands. While I prefer a simpler 2D Chessboard myself, I find the 3D opponents to be an interesting concept, and I certainly appreciate creativity.\n\nFrom what I understand, the game also comes with a six month subscription to the PlayChess.com website, which offers news, training, a dedicated server for online matches, and likely a good deal more, all revolving around, of course, Chess. I must admit I tend to be a very esoteric individual (I have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) and I have not played online. I would have to imagine the community at PlayChess.com is a positive, intelligent and friendly one, however, this is purely my own speculation. All I can honestly say is \"Multiplayer\" is not really my scene, so by all means, click the web link and check it out if you are interested.\n\nTo conclude my review, I would personally recommend it happily to any player looking to go from being a good Chess player to a great one, from a hobby player to a pro player, or even an inexperienced player to a rather competent player. With patience and a bit of mindful dedication, this program offers a considerable deal of training content and much more. However, if you would rather simply enjoy a Chess game or two, there are much less complex, not to mention cheaper, alternatives to Fritz Chess 14. \n\nAnd I personally recommend caution with certain...malicious...cups of coffee.\n\nGood luck and happy gaming!", "timestamp_updated": 1444442679, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1427876824, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "12200089", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524698", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1491182036, "steamid": "76561198022143876", "num_games_owned": 1711, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 1863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Amazingly detailed Chess software.

This is also the only chess software that is available through Steam that takes itself seriously. So you don't have many options anyways. I bought this on Steam sale when it was $19.99 and $9.99 for \"64 bit dlc\". \n\nYou probably would only use the latest Fritz 14 engine, so basically you get one good engine and two old ones. There is a ton of included games from history from all the famous players. They can be searched by all criteria like years, last names, etc. There are many analysis options. You can see suggested moves on the go or analyse the whole game. One nice feature is intentionally vaguely worded hints. They give enough descriptive advice but don't directly give you the best move. You have an option for exact moves though.\n\nWhile the core of the game is pretty good. But it is really puzzling how a known chess software maker can make a good engine and not take the effort to include more options in its main selling point which is the 2D and 3D representation of the chess board. You get very few options for the 2d chess board. There are nice wooden texture and tones included, but there are just five total! It doesn't even have the green and white traditional vinyl board colors that many players are used to. Doesn't have solid color options. You get too few chess graphics as well, and only 3 out of 5 are any good. The other two are abstract designs no one would use. \n\nThe 3d chess board graphics look nice but they look like they've been made very lazily. For example you get a number of options for traditional 3d pieces and boards but they can only be combined with solid color background. You can adjust something as insignificant as lighitng and reflection, but don't get many texture options for the background. The themed 3d graphics with backgrounds are pretty good, but they're mainly for novice players. In my opinion the experienced players would not bother running these nice looking 3d graphics since they are used to plain 2d diagram.\n\nSo basically I'd give it a 7 out of 10. You get lots of advanced options but not enough color and graphics variation. I'd even be willing to purchase additional ones as DLC if they were available. But there aren't any. Seems like such a missed opportunity to simply add more colors and graphics options.
