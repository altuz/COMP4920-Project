Unique weapons and powers for the heroes. A constant need to mind your funds as well as your turret condidtions and the past memories the toys bring. The Kaiser bringing back that old antique standup soldier style, Starbright's cutesy force reminding us of the old Care Bear and My Little Pony days, Phantom kicking our memories to the newer futuristic style that began to form, and the Dark Lord taking us back to the old evil magic boardgames. And as one of the dlc armies, GI Joe sparking that enjoyment of playing soldier and reminding us of that patriotic spark we had as kids. Oh the cartoons were great.\n\nThis game has the same elements of its predecessors, with a few differences and additions that really get you to think about how to play, which turrets to put where, and how to spend your funds. And with separate leveling up stages between armies to unlock new upgrades for damage, range, and health (which can also be bought from the customizatoin menu if you have enough tokens) no two playthroughs are the same. \n\nYou ask me, it's definitely worth buying.", "timestamp_updated": 1503012115, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503012115, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34735460", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504534667, "steamid": "76561197969849700", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "i can't start the game he is saying the Uplay account is not correct or something it just does not work.", "timestamp_updated": 1504534018, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504534018, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33692673", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488891", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500630200, "steamid": "76561198052111924", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Can't even get past the menu screen because there is no UI.
