It is set in the ruined city of Mordheim, which was devastated by a comet impact and has now become the battleground for four (later five and then six) factions all seeking to collect wyrdstone, highly valuable shards of the shattered comet. \n\nThere have been plenty of games based on the Warhammer IP, but Mordheim stands out because it brings the tabletop experience onto PC and console. Players take control of warbands, completely customiseable teams from each faction, and lead them on wyrdstone gathering missions with the aim of accruing enough to meet regular shipment requests from the faction's leader. Of course, on every mission you are opposed by an enemy warband, and any of your warriors who are put Out of Action run the risk of receiving an injury or even dying in the post-match rundown. Those who survive receive experience points which can be spent improving their stats, and levelling up grants points that can be spent training special abilities. This makes for a very narrative experience, where your favourite hero could lose an arm in any battle and weak henchmen can rise to become powerful warriors. \n\nWhere the tabletop experience comes in most strongly is in Mordheim's combat mechanic, which calculates damage and chance to hit for every attack as well as warriors' chances of Parrying or Dodging. Plenty of people hate on RNG but in this case it is just like rolling the dice on the tabletop: sometimes you'll roll 6s, sometimes 1s. The mechanic does not leave everything up to fate either; the better your warriors' Agility, Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill, the higher chance they have of Dodging, Parrying or hitting with a ranged weapon. However, what is often more important is their Initiative value, for this decides the order in which you and your opponent get to use your warriors within a turn. During missions the Initiative wheel scrolls along the top of the screen, showing the order in which warriors will get to move and attack. Getting your guys in first can be the tipping point between victory and defeat, as on their turn outnumbered warriors most perform an All Alone check which decides whether they will stand their ground and fight back, stay put but be too demoralised to fight or flee in terror after each of their assailants gets a free swing. Once enough of a warband's warriors are put Out of Action, their Morale will drop below a predetermined point and they will be forced to take a Rout check, which if failed means defeat. Passing a Rout check can keep a warband in the game long enough to force the enemy to Rout, but Rout checks are retaken each time Morale drops again, until the warband does Rout or no longer has enough units in action to win.   \n\nFor the most part Mordheim's mechanics are solid, but for those without human friends willing to play against them versing the AI can be a frustrating experience. AI warbands are not sophisticated enough to pursue the secondary objectives which can turn a narrow win into a crushing victory, nor are they particularly concerned with gathering wyrdstone. For the human player, this means you must fend of the mindless full-frontal assaults which are the only kind of attack AI warbands can stage, while also trying to gather wyrdstone, take out specific enemies or, hardest of all, steal the Idol from the enemy cart and carry it back to your own. Worse, there are a few issues with the AI pathing, and in almost every game on of them will get stuck on a wall or at a Jump Down point, or they will path into another unit and trigger a 'bounce-back' that ends their turn. This can be great if you're happy to exploit it, but detracts from the smoothness of an already somewhat clunky game. Things get somewhat better on the higher difficulties, where the AI will begin to ignore obvious targets in favour of ganging up on your weaker warriors and set up more effective ambushes, but the problem never goes away completely. \n\nOne of the most satisfying elements of Mordheim is warband progression, where levelling up your warband as a whole (as opposed to individual units within it) unlocks access to new hero types and allows you to field larger forces. A beginner warband consists of 1 Leader, 1 Hero and 3 Henchmen, but by level five you will be able to field 1 Leader, 4 Heroes and 5 Henchmen, or swap out two of your Heroes for a single Impressive, the most powerful units in any faction. The main flaw with this system is that it peaks too early; going up through the first five levels is exciting as you unlock new units and increase your warband size quite quickly, but after that level ups becoming progressively harder for paltry rewards. Thankfully individual unit leveling does not have this problem, and reaching Level 10 with a particular warrior is always worth it. \n\nTo its credit, Mordheim is a fairly well-balanced game. None of the factions feel overly tough, and each has their strengths and weaknesses. Human Mercenaries are excellent for beginngers as they have a flexible play-style with the most units able to wield melee or ranged weapons of any faction. Sisters of Sigmar have almost zero ranged capacity, but are the toughest melee fighters off the bat and have the best access to magic. Cult of the Possessed are well-balanced between ranged and melee units and become devastatingly good at melee on high levels, but all of their Heroes and their Impressive are subject to a random mutation system which gifts them with mutations at Levels 1, 4 and 7. This can be excellent if your Possessed ends up with an array of eviscerating bone-blades instead of arms, but can really suck if your best ranged hero suddenly develops a mace instead of a hand and can no longer shoot. The blessings of Chaos are fickle indeed. \n\nSkaven are my faction of choice, though they are not the easiest to play as you mast take careful advantage of their high Initiative and speed to compensate for their low Strength and Leadership. Witch Hunters were the first DLC faction added, and are basically just a remix of Human Mercenaries with a heavy metal aesthetic and less ranged options. Undead, the second DLC faction, have a significant psychological edge as most of their units are immune to All Alone, Fear and Terror while a higher percentage of them [i] cause [/i] it than in any other faction. Vampires are particularly fun to play as, but zombies absolutely suck. \n\nThe cruel and unyielding laws of probability that govern Mordheim reward those who survive to veterancy by making them statistically more likely to survive than newer warriors with inferior stats and abilities, and if you play a particular warband long enough you will most likely develop a core of elite veterans who keep pulling through while the new guys you hire to make up the numbers bite the dust. This can be a big problem if one of your powerful veterans does die, as it is very difficult to train replacements up quickly. On the whole Mordheim rewards conservative play, though the fact that you have to pay each of your warriors after every mission means that it is sometimes not enough to just win, you must win [i] profitably [/i]. Gold can be found in Loot Points around each map, but a better way to make money is by looting your fallen enemies and selling any weapons they were carrying that you don't want for yourself. Calculated risks are the name of the game in Mordheim, and if you miss four wyrdtsone shipments in a row, your warband is done. \n\nOverall, Mordheim is an excellent game that I have thoroughly enjoyed playing. I don't have room here to go over the single-player campaign aspect, so keep an eye out for some walkthroughs coming up in the next few months. Enjoy!       \n\n          \n", "timestamp_updated": 1506393496, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506393496, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34922643", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505118", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505682290, "steamid": "76561198035893605", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "The game design sets players up for failure.

You guys know the ones, they have extra attacks, far better weapons and always seem to dodge your attacks.\n\nI finally got a choas team pass 6 missions and they were really starting to shape up, I say were because I got so badly dealt to thay they are now unplayable, my beast warrior got killed, second best lost an arm, went insane so he has to take a test every round, third dead, foruth lost a leg and toughness by 1 point, fifth dead, so yeah pretty much fucked. It seem to me that this game is designed to punish you once you start to do ok.
