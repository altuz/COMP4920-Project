This is valid, I think, because the problems are exactly same.\nI gave these games a genuine try, but everything by Aldorlea has the same set of problems. Horrible level design, the most god awfully boring and unsatisfying stories, TONS of HUD problems, and a single goddamn music track for each game. The only redeeming qualities these games have is the art (one of the games has some humor as well); but unless you have a damn fetish single poses for each character, you're gonna be disappointed. Like if the story was good, the other shit would be tolerable. That's why we stuck through this shit with classic titles like Golden Sun. I'm sorry, but an rpg with \u201cmeh\u201d level combat and drool inducing story is not worth it by a long shot.\ntldr: This game is not worth playing. None of the other games (that I've played, which is the first title of almost every series) made by Aldorlea are worth playing either.", "timestamp_updated": 1496215812, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496215812, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "31699279", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525416", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494585050, "steamid": "76561198007536731", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Terrible.
