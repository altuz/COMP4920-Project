Your task is to fend off inbound enemies from your vessels by a arch-rival known only as The Talon. Each ship has a weapons system that reloads and recharges over time. Larger ships tend to have more health, but they can be upgraded at the end of each level, using resources gained from destroying inbound bogeys and bonuses through killstreaks.\n\nThe level of unit detail is really quite impressive.
