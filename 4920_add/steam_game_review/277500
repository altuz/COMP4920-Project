It plays in \"real time\", but EVERYTHING happens at noon, so there's no point in any other time of day.  It's not even like there's so much to do that your tractors might not complete a field in 24 hours, either.  When the requisite time has been fast forwarded, you punch the \"harvest\" button, and the picker hoarde zooms through your fields, and you make freakishly large amounts of money.  Rinse and repeat forever.\n\nMany of the game features don't even work.  There are \"contracts\" where you can take functional missions to supply specific amounts of product by a specific time... but the button to actually complete a contract was never implemented.  There are \"rival farmers\" you are supposed to \"beat\", but they basically decide by throwing darts at a chart of options blindfolded.  Basically, all you do is plant crops and harvest, and use the money to buy more fields you can plant more crops within. \n\nThere are also features that exist, but serve no particular purpose.  There is a weather system, with supposed storms coming through (although you can't actually SEE any storms, there are no effects whatsoever but that your crops mysteriously die) but you can't even tell without looking at the weather report menu.  Since there's literally nothing you can do about the weather anyway, though, there's no reason to do anything but fast forward through them.  There is a star-based unlocking system, but that only serves to make sure you have less variety in your game than you already had.  You get stars by harvesting crops, which is the only way you make money, so there's no reason it couldn't have been based upon money, anyway.  It only exists this way because Farmville did it, even though it serves no purpose here. Worse, it hides what the actual money price of something will be until AFTER you pay the star costs.  Hence, you have to plan your management of your farm around having to pay construction and upkeep costs on a factory whose real costs you can't see until AFTER you invested something in it.\n\nThen there are critically lacking features, like being able to see the prices of crops so that you can strategically plan what you are going to sell before you have actually invested all the time and money into growing them.  Yes, that's right, it's a game about picking what crops to grow for the maximum profit *WHERE YOU HAVE NO IDEA AT WHAT PRICE ANYTHING COSTS OR SELLS*.  The statistics page is utterly useless, as it shows you absolutely nothing of value, like what fields cost what amount of money to grow anything (you have to track that by hand), and what the crops sold for when you did grow them. You have factories that let you turn raw fruit into canned fruit or other similar intermediate or finished products, but there's no comparison of overhead to finished product and raw material selling prices.\n\nThis is a management game where you have nothing to actually manage.  There is no strategy here, all land is basically the same (even fertility differences are just papered over with punching a button to \"fertilize field\"), the whole map is one flat chunk of arable land, no matter where in the world you set up, and climate, once picked, basically ensures you will spend the whole game raising strawberries or potatoes or corn or whatever ad infinitum.  No thought, just micromanage those buttons to keep sending out tractors to plow, plant, spray, or harvest before fast-forwarding to the next time to do more of the same.\n\nUltimately, the game is like playing Candyland with yourself.  You roll the dice, have random crap happen to you that you can't do anything about, and then eventually progress further down the board and maybe declare \"you win\" when you get bored... but this game lacks the finish line, so...", "timestamp_updated": 1417114819, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417114379, "votes_down": 10}, {"recommendationid": "10642672", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505864", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1451244925, "steamid": "76561198031008341", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Great game.
