The graphics are charming and cute, although I wouldn't say it's as good as Pixar (don't know what crack pipe that guy was smoking who said that.) \n\nYou play as a firefly (duh) who flys around collecting his babies throughout the level and the objective is to get them to the ending unharmed. In order to complete each stage you don't have to save them all, just as many as each stage says you have to, but if you want to earn a medal then you have to save them all (earning medals unlocks achievements.)\n\nThere are three medals in each stage. Earn one for collecting all the coins in each stage, another for saving all the firefly babies and another for completing each stage in a set amount of time. If you want this game to be challenging then you're going to want to collect the medals. Otherwise you'll breeze through this game (maybe not if you're a young kid or you just really suck at these type of games.) It's pretty short with only three worlds with 10 levels and a boss battle in each. I'm already at world 2-4 and that's with going back to collect all the medals.

This game is a \"toilet game\".  The kind of game you play while on the toilet.  It is clearly a bad port of a tablet/phone app and wasn't optimized at all for PC.

The slightly embarrassing answer - though only VERY slightly, I gotta say (I'm pretty shameless) - is that I also have something of a penchant for \"cute\" and \"child-like\" things (hence why Among The Sleep is one of my favourite games of recent years...its cute and not-so-cuddly, all in one).  Now USUALLY these \"child-like\" things will also be a tad on the spooky and/or violent side of things - Limbo and Little Inferno spring to mind as other personal faves - and therefore have a kind of cross-over, however tenuous, with my more usual tastes.  And extremist though I may be, I think I may have actually crossed a bit of a personal line with the game I'm currently reviewing...which is to say...I think that Shiny The Firefly may be just a tad TOO light-hearted and child-like for Yours Truly to handle, even on the most whimsical of days.  You want \"cute\"?  This game has it in spades.  Chuck a \"sickeningly\" in front of that word, and we're getting even closer to the truth.  In fact, I'm starting to harbour the vaguest of suspicions that Shiny The Firefly may NOT actually be aimed at 40 year-old man-children such as myself, but rather...inconceivable as this may sound...may even be squarely and solely aimed at KIDS...and I don't even mean \"big kids\" like myself.  I mean, y'know...\"kid\" kids.  Ones under ten years of age, let's say.\n \n   All of which might be well and good if I actually HAD any kids of my own, or even nieces or nephews or something, but considering I have none of the above I possibly have no excuse to have ever bought this game, much less to be playing it ALL BY MYSELF.  Don't get me wrong...this game is actually pretty good.  A tad too pedantic at times where the controls are concerned - it's perhaps more suited to a tablet and a touch-screen interface than it is to PC and mouse - but certainly by-and-largely \"competent\".  Nothing much wrong with it, basically.  Except that IT'S ABOUT A MALE FIREFLY WHO HAS TO GO AROUND \"COLLECTING\" HIS BABIES.  Is the Universe trying to send me a message here?  Have I somehow failed in my God-given task of reproducing my worthless self, and now I have to be digitally derided for my sins?!  How did I even end up with a game called Shiny The Freaking Firefly in my Steam library?!?  Oh, waitaminute...that's right...I probably bought it real cheap in a sale, just out of curiosity, and to further my admittedly paltry ambition of edumacating myself in as wide a variety of gaming styles as possible.  Well, let's consider it a success then...I have now, officially, played a game just a tad too painfully \"cute\" for my stomach to bear.
