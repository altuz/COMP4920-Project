The first is the story. It kind of works, but it is too simple and short to give the player any value other than to just force feed us the next puzzle or area. The other big shortcomming is the voice acting, and this problem really ehances the weakness that the story is to the game. Having few voice actors in a game is not necessarily something to make a big fuzz about in a budget title, but this game would have gained more from only written dialoge rather than the addition of these voice actors.  It might be that the game is targeting children and that a child of about 10-12 would enjoy this more, but for me it was simply so detrimental that it just dragged the experience enough down to miss the recommendation.\n\nThe puzzles are somewhat enjoyable and the grapichs and aestethics are serviceable. The mechanic I enjoyed the most was the ability to tweak the difficulty in the options to fit your playstyle and patience. I also encountered a bug when trying to click object. Just some small glitches that made is a little cumbersome to click and choose the objects you want to. Fixing this would have given the game just that little extra feel of polish.\n\nNot recommended, but close nonetheless. One of the better non-recommended games for my taste.", "timestamp_updated": 1423431334, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423431334, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "13090061", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502455", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1423692047, "steamid": "76561198015227522", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A short and typical point and click adventure.
