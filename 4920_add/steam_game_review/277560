[i]Where Angels Cry[/i] is a mediocre point and click adventure with the environment progression of a HOG, but... without any actual HOG scenes whatsoever. Sure, it contains a selection of unimaginative puzzles and constant item collection - and it almost excites you with the promise of a medieval mystery as it starts - but sadly the game cannot avoid ending up as a short and tedious adventure with a distasteful plot presentation.\n\nIt is the Year of Our Lord, 1286 and as I have stated before, we are promised a medieval mystery. We take the role of a nameless monk who'd be sent to a secluded monastery set high in the Alps from Vatican, to investigate the murder of a fellow monk and the miraculous phenomenon of an angel statue crying blood as we are already there. So far, so good. We have [i]The Name of the Rose[/i] atmosphere mixed up with Wainwright's [i]Stigmata[/i] storyline. Yet, the actual thing here has little to do with either of these fine stories. No one knowing your true identity, you are mostly free to investigate the monastery that consists of 4 areas and a village nearby. With each passing moment and each new discovery, my expectations diminished with the game until the last scene - which was the moment that I threw my already diminished basket of expectations out of the window.\n\nHere in this paragraph, I'll be ranting about story and concept build up, so whomever would like to try this game and avoid spoilers, please skip ahead or stop reading. First of all, I know that the given concept here must have been tempting to hurl in all medieval clich\u00e9s, but there really should be an orderly and meaningful way to do that instead of all this soup of terms like \"sin\", \"temptation\", \"sacrifice\", \"Angels\", \"Templars\" etc. Whomever arranged the storyline, clearly has a vague outline of the concept and kept throwing in these notions until they somehow stuck together to make a setting. The storyline is so badly arranged, it crumbles to pieces the moment you'd ask an intelligible question like [spoiler]\"why the f*ck the Spear of Destiny is here of all places?\"[/spoiler] or [spoiler]\"what has done the prior abbot so meaningful and beautiful that an angel would descend from heaven to cry for him?\u201d[/spoiler] See, all these questions have no satisfactory answers. There is just the accumulation of medieval motifs, hoping to build up a storyline eventually.\n\nEnvironment art is considerably dull and badly rendered compared to pretty screenshots that we see in the store page. Those are taken from the iPad/Android version with enhanced graphics. Environment design itself is somewhat alright, but nothing actually breathtaking. Apart the main character, all others are voice acted properly but the dialogue text itself is agonizing, ridden with the unnecessary - and narratively false - amount of usage for words like \"nay\", \"pray tell\", \"alas\" for everyone around to establish a false sense of authenticity! It was hilariously contradictory to see a simple peasant woman capable of using Shakespearean terms - completely wrong though!\n\nThe game consists of 7 short chapters which would give you approximately 3 hours of gameplay. You are to walk around, collect random items disguised in a similar color palette environment, use them in appropriate places and solve a selection of easy puzzles now and then. That's basically it. We have already an achievement system here in the game which has never been converted to actual Steam achievements sadly - lessening to need for exploring the game to an unnecessary extent.\n\nI hear that the game has a sequel - which would be far better than this, I hope. Even if you are strictly into medieval concepts like me, I wouldn't recommend the game. For casual HOG lovers, there are surely greater games you may explore. For the adventure gamer: avoid the game like the plague.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_updated": 1461352207, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1461352207, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "9281172", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 52, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561322", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1394423377, "steamid": "76561198044786551", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "So far this is a pretty well executed casual point and click game developed by a very small team compared for the price.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game, it is a casual game and a small casual game gem for the price, or while waiting for the 2014 game of your choice.

Sure, the same could probably be said of all hidden object games, depending on your skill, perception and how many H/O games you've already played, but this could probably be blazed through in two hours.\n\nThe visuals and settings are not bad. Objects aren't very hidden - they sort of stand out from the scenes a bit, in their shading and also a vague object outline. People are a bit wooden - moreso than other H/O games I've played. They have minimal or no animation to them, and even the voice-acting doesn't strike me as particularly good. The monks are often high-pitch, at least one sounds nasal, most sound like Americans. I believe going for a more traditional voice cast would have been a pro move as the voices do tend to detract from the immersion.\n\nThe story is ok. It could do with a little work - the first half of the game is repetitive at times, a lot of revisiting the same scenes, a lot of finding the same object just on a different day.

More scenes would help with this.\n\nCompared to other H/O games out there, this one let me down. While it does have achievements, these are currently not on Steam, only in-game.

Skip to the end for the TL;DR version of this review.\n\nI could forgive the mediocre graphics.  They seem simplistic and lackluster compared to some of the vibrantly detailed comparable games, but they get the job done.\n\nI could also forgive the simplistic and unoriginal puzzles.  After all, most of these games recycle the same types of puzzles over and over again, and it wouldn't be the first time that I came across a tedious Tower of Hanoi puzzle.  If you're looking for actual hidden object scenes, look elsewhere; I didn't find a single one in this game.\n\nThese things aren't egregious for a simple time-killer of a game. I can forgive them.\n\nWhat I cannot forgive is the game-breaking bugs that will force you to either start over from the beginning or quit the game in disgust.  I got to a point where I absolutely could not find another item I needed, so I gritted my teeth and used the hateful \"HINT\" button (I really dislike using hints!) so I could progress.\n\nThe hint took me to a place and told me to use the object that I couldn't find in the first place.  You heard it correctly, the hint told me to use an item I HAD NOT PICKED UP YET and could NOT find.  After further research, I discovered that there is apparently some sort of bug where necessary items are in the same screen/scene as minigames, and if you don't pick it up immediately before finishing the minigame puzzle, you are completely borked.  Utterly, thoroughly, and irrevocably borked.  But the game doesn't realize you're borked, and acts like you are holding it the whole time.  Baffling.\n\nSo you can either restart the game, or quit in disgust.  I chose to quit in disgust.  The game is simply not compelling enough or of good enough quality to wade through it a second time and pray the same thing doesn't happen again.\n\nHad this not happened, I would have finished, and given it a conditional recommendation (try it out if you're out of other comparable ones to play, pick it up on a big sale, use it to kill some time as long as your expectations aren't high, etc.).  But with these bugs (and the fact that it has happened to other people in different parts of the game as well, so it's not an isolated error), I am changing this to a fervent \"not recommended\" verdict.\n\nTL;DR - The mediocre graphics and puzzles are not enough of an excuse to pick up a game that could easily force you to restart multiple times if you happen to hit one of the several game-breaking item bugs.", "timestamp_updated": 1485473044, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485473044, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "17992174", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505037", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1442027162, "steamid": "76561198099662596", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The scenery is interesting, but that's about all there is to this incredibly short point-and-click adventure game.
