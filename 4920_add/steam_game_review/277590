I bought it today and found out that the stand alone version does NOT recognize/support the keyboard/mouse controls....and evidently there is no patch from the developers even though they are aware of it and have been for years! Like WTF Ubisoft!\n\nEvidently the DLC version (for those who own Black Flag) does not have this issue...not positive but this is what I read on the Ubi forums.  Can't believe the devs have not fixed this issue!\n\nSo, I suggest you do not buy the game unless you have a controller.

First off, the story is boring. The gameplay is boring. All of your actions feel like your hand is being held. They shouldve just sent the devs over to push the buttons for me. And even though every single action is being prompted to you, they do nothing to tell you how or why you should use certain features.\n\nI reinstalled to revisit this game. I had it form the beginning. I played for 30 mins and never went back. So, I thought maybe I was being unfair. Im not. And the only reason why this has good reviews is because the cinematics are fine and there is a loyal fanbase that only upvotes things because it is AC. Thats it. I've had a long and detailed discsussion about this with a few of them. In the end - after a long long time of denying their bias - they finally just said \"well I like AC so I can look past the fact its almost totally flawed\". To date not a  single one  has been able to make a Pro vs Con list where the cons are less numerous than the positive points.\n\nAlso, uPlay FTH (for the headache)!", "timestamp_updated": 1504658349, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "9", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504658349, "votes_down": 17}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 258, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 108, "total_reviews": 366}}
