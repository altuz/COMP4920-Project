That is about what this game is. All-in-all, it was fun, and had a number of difficult missions that made it easily worth what I paid and more. \n\nThe one major flaw with the game is that it auto-upgrades the core army between missions. Maybe I wanted those experienced pioneers for their mobility and bunker busting? Also, by the time you have the three expensive generals, there is nothing to use your Fame on, especially as unit costs (recruit, supply, reinforcement) are so low. Having more unit upgrades or the ability to recruit a few auxiliary units per mission would have been nice, although the latter would have significantly reduced the challenge.\n\nAt any rate, it took me 101 hours to get 3 stars + secondary objectives on every mission of each of the campaigns. I am quite glad I purchased this.", "timestamp_updated": 1496633954, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496633954, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31631371", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497576", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494266343, "steamid": "76561197979966149", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "10 / 10 GAME.\n\nPerfect game mechanic.\nEasy to learn.\nGraphics are perfect for the game in question.\nEXTREMELY challenging - requires strategy.\n\nIt becomes quite addictive.
