The first 3-10 (I don't remember exactly) levels are very easy - an introduction of sorts. But then it just keeps on going. It keeps being interesting - they throw in easier levels (where you juggle new concepts) with more challenging ones where you have to really think on how to apply them to reach the solution. This is one of those extremely few games where I'd gladly pay for extra DLC every month for the rest of my life.", "timestamp_updated": 1504368596, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504368596, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33561830", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498196", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504857308, "steamid": "76561198079777190", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I LOOOVE YOU, I HATE YOU.", "timestamp_updated": 1502181969, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500132013, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 125, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 18, "total_reviews": 143}}
