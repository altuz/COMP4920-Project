The story revolves around Elvis, who just had their house destroyed by a meteor. Elvis remembered they had insurance that granted a new house for free and set off. The idea, concept, and reason to traverse the area is great. I found On Rusty Trails through a discount from crafting badges.

The game concept is also really interesting, but it is not well executed. It is very easy to forget where the character is because the character is really small and there is a lack of contrast between it and the background. The checkpoint system idea is very interesting but it is annoying that checkpoints activate automatically when you step on them, at least when you are trying to complete the stage without using them.", "timestamp_updated": 1498370789, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498370789, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 26, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 30}}
