Get a HDMI cable, a tv and some controllers to get the most enjoyment out of it. The modes are 1v1 and 2v2, so it doesnt support odd numbers of players.\n\nSportsfriends offers a suit of games - all of which would be worth buying in their own right.\n\nBaraBariBall is a volleyball/platform fighter hybrid. You score points by having the ball sink in the water on your color coded side of the screen. Points are lost when you yourself die. Your fighters can ahve a maximum of 7 spirit balls floating around them, which quickly regenerate when on the ground. One ball is consumed with each jump, and they can also be used for power throws or power attacks.\n\nSuper pole riders has a ball on a rope with two goals at either end. Each player is given a pole vaulting pole - the pole can be used to hit the ball slightly, propel yourself for a powerfull kick, block other players from moving, or jumping on their heads to kill them (they respawn shortly afterwards). This game is crazy fun and often when under pressure you may spin the joystick in the wrong direction, propelling you the wrong way.\n\nHokra is the weaker of the gamess.
