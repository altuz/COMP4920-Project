You can make items and food but they are limited in variety. It's all about survival in it's simplest sense so don't expect a lot customability. In fact, base modules are added automatically every mission phase so you don't even get to build your modules. In terms of completeing missions, the game litterally throw you to the deepest end of the pool because you WILL be confused with what to do. However, in reality, the first 4 phases are actually pretty easy to pass that is if you spend the time reading the mission tutorial thoroughly and run through it a couple times. In fact the mission work orders don't need to be followed step-by-step as long as you know what has to be completed. Once you are at the fifth phase, things get a bit more interesting and you'll find yourself swamp with work while you are trying to keep yourself alive.\n\nCritisim: Just as others have said with others interactions with objects is not very comprehensive such that it's purely point and click and you are done (although the work sequence does matters in terms of efficiency). The graphics are not top notch and there is no music (except ones you played yourself) but then again we all have seen worst. There are some game breaking bugs though like being unable to move if you didn't close a work screen before walking away, work stations disappear after a game reload, or unable to set an object if you have it on your hand while taking on or off your suit. If you figured out how to backup save states, then please tell me.\n\nWhat I like: Despite getting the feeling that the game didn't achieve it's full potential, I do enjoy certain concepts of the game like farming and making the compartments livable. Also hidden amongst the simplicity of the gameplay is the complexity of survival as you constantly have to check your vital signs, the stats on your farm, your mining operations and your base life support system. If and when version 2 comes out which according to the developer would include some sandbox features, then this game would be a whole lot better.\n\nOverall feeling: If you like task oriented game or generally want to get a feel of what a Mars would be like, I think this game is for you.

Mars Colony: Challenger is a complex space station simulator that relies on a lot of knowledge to get the hang of things. You aren't given much to go on when they drop you into the first area, and it feels good to just experiment and try different things. This game is also NOT for people who just play single-player games. This game gets boring fast when you don't have people to interact with. Definitely a good game if you and a few friends all grab it and figure out how to do things together. This game screams cooperation, not competition, which is something that I really enjoy. \n\nBeing a new game, Mars Colony is very buggy. It was almost impossible for me to activate some consoles because you had to click on a very specific spot to activate it. The controls are a little messy and take a while to get used to. You don't have automatic free-look, and you must hold down the right-click mouse button or you'll be stuck in a static camera view. It's such a minor inconvenience, but it gets annoying fast and it's a pointless mechanic. The graphics, while not bad, are very outdated. This game looks like it came out in the early 2000s, not 2014, updating the graphics a bit would really make the game feel more alive.\n\nOverall, not in the least a bad game, but it really needs a community to be fun.

Almost every aspect of the base itself is interactable in some way, and the emergent gameplay coming from environmental hazards, your friend eating all the rations, or perhaps even another player depressurizing the base make it a fun experience.

Most of the time it consists of waiting for a green bar to fill. Which mostly works accept for the fabrication benches and the constant rover repairs. Which push it too far and it feels like needless time wasting instead of a gameplay abstraction.\nThe science is a little iffy in places.

The only people complaining about graphics are the FPS kiddies. Of course this game doesn't have AAA graphics but they are more than good enough for a sub $10 simulation, especially if you crank it up to max settings.\n\nThere are a ton of things to do here like installing parts for the various equipment, repairing stuff, tweaking equipment settings, making sure everything is running properly, deploying weather beacons, growing plants, and much more. You are tasked with making a self sustaining martian base and let me tell you that requires quite a bit of time and work.\n\nThere are several phases and all of them keep adding more and more things for you to do and take care of. My advice is to ignore the \"Score\" for each phase and take your own time with things. It has some minor RPG elements as well since your character can earn skill points in several different categories like Engineering, Agriculture, and more.\n\nIt also has multiplayer which is a real nice touch.\n\nThis game is definitely worth it and I can't wait for the sequel or version 2.0 as the developer calls it.", "timestamp_updated": 1395360940, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1395360586, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "15835962", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507919", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1401109581, "steamid": "76561198012212042", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have a love / hate relationship with this game.

The graphics are just fine.\nTHe missions start you off getting to know the ropes of the game, before finally trying to manage your base by yourself.\nYou have to first get your life support going inside your base, then the power and heat.  You have to travel far in your rover to hook up radio and weather stations.  You have to manage your power and keeps things maintained and repaired.  All of this you have to do while keeping yourself heathy from radiation.  You have to eat and drink and also urinate.  You can not take your helmet off to do these things unless your base's life support is functioning.  IF you are a mile away from base and you start to need food you have to go back.\n\nI have 60 games on steam and most I never play.  This is one of the best I have, I give it 5 out 5 stars.  A very entertaining game.  The only thing it needs is more content, you can expand this game so much.  Maybe other moons or planets with alien life.

While it's true that some of the graphics seem outdated, I found that's actually really only true for the HUD. Most of the other parts look pretty realistic. But the best part of the game is actually the realism. A lot of research went into the game and it almost feels like a training simulator. Step by step you are guided (with detailed instructions) on how to setup and develop your basic station module by module. You get the feeling that you are actually learning what basic machinery keeps the station running and how they all interact. You'll also find out various ways to die if you are not careful. After playing for a couple of hours, walking through the station carrying equipment and seeing the ambient light of a morning on Mars shine through the station or opening the airlock and stepping outside looking at your HUD and realizing what a \"crisp\" winter morning it is, you cannot avoid an eerie feeling that you are actually there. \nI wish this game was open source though and would allow other developers to add even more functionality - maybe different tools and Mars base variations. It would also be great if some of the modules would consist of sub-systems so as to add some more layers of difficulty on top and to make it even more challenging.
