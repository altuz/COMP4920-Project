While it may invoke those older games on the surface, the bulling and Power Zone mechanics really make Space Giraffe feel like more of it's own game than the rehash it's often accused of being. The shooting and dodging are tight and satisfying and the risk vs reward elements make for some crazy intense shooty action. When all that comes together with the visuals and audio in the way that it's supposed to, Space Giraffe is simply astoudning to play and you can almost feel like you're in a trance when you're on a roll.\n\nWhen it doesn't work however, the game just feels plain unfair and frustrating. Far too often, the emphasis on eye-searing visuals over gameplay can and will cause many unnecessary deaths due to how obscured the playfield can get. A large chunk of stages also to alter the game's rules subtly without telling the player, which just seems like a cheap and sloppy way to prohibit progress. \n\nThere will inevitably be frustration with this game, but I highly suggest at least trying the demo. It's something I've stuck with since its release and if you can manage to get over its initial quirks and don't mind some frustration later, Space Giraffe feels about as satisfying as Portal can be once you finally \"get it.\""}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1450983510, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512207", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "19916149", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197976166323", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1366873200, "num_games_owned": 1753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 10}, "timestamp_updated": 1450983510, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Jeff Minter's a genius and it saddens me we'll never get to experience TxK on the PC."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1439198324, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507435", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "17469849", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198034823626", "num_reviews": 36, "last_played": 1492000990, "num_games_owned": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 71}, "timestamp_updated": 1439198324, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game deserves to be remembered for the incredible classic it is.\n\nIts old school shooter ramped up to the ridiculous by one of the greats of the genre.\n\nThe only problem with this game, and probably the reason for the mixed scores, is that the game doesn't do a great job of explaining how to play it well.

Completing many assignments and even making a few friends along the way. At the end of the first level, Elfie is awarded a space giraffe diploma, and there is a beautiful shot where the player can see Elfie\u2019s parents in the audience at the ceremony. Since the game is made with the same graphics engine that powered Sony\u2019s Afrika on the Playstation 3, the level of emotion that Elfie\u2019s parents are able to display was quite impressive at the time. Elfie finally boards a rocket in level 2 and is shot into the vast vacuum of space, wherein for the first time in his life, Elfie comes to the realization that he will have to spend the rest of his life alone. Over the course of a year, the player gets to witness Elfie\u2019s descent into madness, and as he loses his mind, the universe around him starts to change in colour. \n\nThe rest of the game just rips off the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but instead of a space baby, we get to see the ghost of J.

Not to mention the weird kid at the start screen reading out numbers in Welsh. The text of the game is just as \"wacky\" and \"random\", with references to older games dotted around, intentional misspellings, and the word \"goat\" being shoved into other words for seemingly no reason.\n\nThere's certainly a good game to be had from this, but the nonsensical art direction and reliance on random humour can easily grate if you aren't into that sort of thing.
