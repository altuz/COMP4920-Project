Awful voices but understand what they are saying or more emotional voices but don't understand nothing unless you read the messages.\nCharacters can equip 2 weapons and you can select the skills/animals independently, also you can equip and change the skills in battle.\nThe campaign/story mode of Lu Bu is good.\nAmbition mode, which is a very simplified adaption of an \"empire version\", where you choose a character and start develop facilities and rise bond with the others characters.\nA weapon system similar to the Orochi series, very customizable.\n\nBad things:\nOverpriced DLC\nSometimes problems with the controls (I'm using a Xbox 360 controller) when the button don't answer correctly.\nA random problem/bug that makes the character to change to the defensive stance, it's rare but happens sometimes.\nEnemies when are in guard stance they block all the attacks.\nArchers and ballistae, specially the ballistae, are very frustrating. You can't move since you are stuck and if you are playing in \"ultimate\" difficulty that puts you in a terrible situation because you can die from a \u201cmusou attack\u201d of an enemy officer in an instant.\nVery expensive maximized a character and level up by just playing it takes way more time.\nSome stages that are too big without a good reason since the horde of enemies is always gather in specific spots.\n\nOverall and with all the bad things I will say it's still a good Dynasty Warrior game, if you are a fan of the  Musou serie it's a safe choice but if you are new you may want to wait for Dynasty Warriors 9.
