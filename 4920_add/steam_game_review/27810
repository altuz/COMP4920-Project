I sorta get why, it's not the most approachable despite being clearly designed -to be- the most approachable. \n\nThat said, it's a little hard to grasp as it exists in its own world and with its own language. Exploding suns, flowers, pretty colours yet really, it's a fairly straightforward game to play with a strong scoring mechanic. Essentially, the prettier a pattern you make on screen with your bullets, the higher you score. If nothing else, that's different, right?\n\nIf I had to pull it on anything it's that it locks the best part of the game behind an awful unlock system. You have to wade through a slow and slightly uninteresting group of stages before the high score mayhem can begin in earnest. Again, a clear attempt to draw people in but let's be realistic here, Gridrunner Rev is -for- the kind of people who really enjoy score chasing.\n\nAnd y'know, when the whole screen explodes around you with the Neon effects in the background it's quite the sight to behold. \n\nSo yeah, a bit janky round the edges, attempts at accessibility that fall a little flat but a great underloved gem that given some time to gel makes for a good companion piece to Space Giraffe."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1386023601, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503976", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "7887267", "votes_up": 7, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197968511845", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1450020926, "num_games_owned": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 619}, "timestamp_updated": 1386023601, "received_for_free": false, "review": "excellent shump\n\nit looks weird as hell, and it is.\n\nbut....\nthe control scheme is a work of genius and its one of those games where when you get in the zone your score flies, you end up playing on instinct picking up visual and aural queues that get you through the bullet hell of the later vindaloo and phaal levels.

One is supposed to derive a sense of satisfaction out of curving bullets around the screen to create a psychedelic swath of death, but I've never been able to figure out exactly how this mechanic works or if I'm actually playing it right due to the game's lack of real feedback. I have no idea why my bonus indicator hovers at 10-30 and suddenly spikes to 150+, and am never able to replicate the events that led to it. Giving the player random ships with every life, each with different firing angles and speeds, also doesn't really help one learn much either. It just feels like a big random mess that I'm somehow surviving.\n\nStages never really feel like they get a chance to breathe long enough and the game doesn't really seem to start until well the Vindaloo stages, which is well over half the game. The first 100 stages are just boring and slow, and the last half whizzes by because the required enemy counts to finish each stage feel too low.\n\nI'll just remain content being at odds with critics on this one.
