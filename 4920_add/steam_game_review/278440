Think about it - how many times have you dropped something on your foot, or fallen down stairs? Exactly! Without gravity, this would not happen!\n\nSo, imagine my evil laugh when I discovered a game which would allow me to defeat gravity, and better - use it to fly my little spacetriangle further, and longer in the galaxy of 0RBITALIS.\n\nThis game, is unique. And that gives it a great charm - added to by the really nice art style and audio.\n\nI like puzzle games, and I like space - this game has both things in abundance. The puzzle elements are challenging but not impossible, which is great. \n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone looking for something a bit different, yet strangely familiar in feel, or who like a challenge. \n\nAlso, if like me you are suspicious of gravity, then it's a must play!", "timestamp_updated": 1403455701, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403455701, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "10295643", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508125", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498936129, "steamid": "76561197987075355", "num_games_owned": 1575, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 1022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Very nice game! Pretty addictive, great physics, innovative challenges.\n\nHere are my suggestions:\n\n1. Keep the background music playing while orbiting. No music while watching the particle orbiting feels kind of empty. Maybe the music could also change depending on the action. Example: goes faster as the particle goes faster, or as the time passes; maybe with a special effect when a personal best is reached\n\n2. Put the timer counting somewhere on the screen right after firing. It will be much more thrilling to see the timer going while orbiting than waiting for the round to finish to know the end time\n\n3. If a level has been completed, that the player replays the level to try to have a better time and fails miserably (i.e. before the required time to pass is fulfilled), he shouldn't be treated with a round restart as if he had never passed the level (therefore not seeing the leaderboard and not having the option to go to the next level). He should be brought to the leaderboard so he can go to the next level if he wants as he may have failed now but he beat the level already and therefore has the right to go to the next level if he wants\n\n4. An outer ring that shows where is the limit before the particle is considered lost in space. It would be more thrilling to see the particle getting closer and closer of the ring limit, hoping another particle will have enough attraction to bring it back into the game\n\n5. Of course, achievements. When achievements are implemented, if a player by his previous games has fulfilled one, it should be granted immediately (example: make it #1 on a leaderboard)\n\n6. More levels with specific goals to accomplish, like the last levels where you have to touch lines to make the progress bar move in order to pass the level\n\n7.
