Always a bonus.\n+Threat mechanic is pretty unique\n+Doesn't overstay its welcome\n+\"This man is such a tool, I could repair this airship with him\". Classic.\n\n-Gameplay is a bit generic outside of the Threat mechanic\n-The Threat mechanic itself isn't used as much as one would like - only one of the five characters has the ability to raise Threat at will\n-Things aren't told to the player well in some minor cases\n-No Map Screen, which makes backtracking and exploring a little difficult\n-One of the sidequests doesn't seem to be working properly\n-Graphics are pretty meh\n-Minor difficulty spikes\n-Ending is a bit out of left-field\n-The last area in the game is a bit of a slog\n\nRating: 7/7", "timestamp_updated": 1504660779, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504660779, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35215520", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504146128, "steamid": "76561198140353995", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "My opinion: BUY IT\n\nGraphics: 5/10 (it is OK, nothing more)\nHistory: 5/10 (also OK, nothing great for me but I didn't hate it)\nCharacters: 7/10 (all characters has their unique personality, loved Chaska, that little girl who suffered a lot but keep smiling)\nBattle system: 10/10 \n\nBattle system is why you should buy it, you will feel powerful, really really powerful, status effects can be applied to bosses, you can chain some status efects that will raise your damage to heavens, monsters can kill you really fast but once you get used to attacks, weapons and augments you will be a f**king battle boss, you will want to keep fighting.
