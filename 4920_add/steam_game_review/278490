I feel like this game lacks direction and at times leaves you throwing up your hands tring to remember who wanted what and where that who was in the first place. the quests journal is not terribly helpful and the world map while I think its kind of cute drawn out like a mini pirate map it too is not terribly helpful because it does not indicate where you currently are. you know like the mall map does. ( you are here )  while some of the mini games are a nice diversion the quests are a bit too Fed Ex in that it has you running all over the place. I know it sounds bad but seriously this is one of the best RPG maker type games I played. the story line is solid and the characters are not overly silly or just ruin the story ( hello Jar Jar Binks ) I do think that the classes need more defining roles because you can interchange nearly any char in the game and it does not change much strategy wise the spy need more toys. the mage gets magic at a painfully slow rate and only then if u have a book. healer is fine as is but seriously the character classes need to be more defined. all in all this is an entertaining game for the money I do enjoy it and if this is your thing you could do much worse than this game so give it a try.", "timestamp_updated": 1417250046, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417249866, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "12486246", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493844", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1428240536, "steamid": "76561198052349830", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "love this game really fun especially since it's a old-school RPG style game one of the downfalls is you have to buy first half and the second half separately be able to buy them in a bundle pack was still for the price that you pay it still worth it you can use the Xbox style controller for the game.most of all it's got some really good plots and twists on top of that it's that kind of aversion of the old-school final fantasy in", "timestamp_updated": 1413278547, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413278547, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "14821177", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485455", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1423749885, "steamid": "76561198098129405", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Loved this series.

My biggest issue with this game and the reason I don't advise it is that it's utterly boring to me. I had no fun and the story didn't capture me in the least. That may be due to the fact I haven't played the first one but still. I can't get into it at all. Maybe it'll pick up later. I might keep messing with it but I've given it an hour and a half and it still hasn't caught my attention at all or been interesting in the least to me.
