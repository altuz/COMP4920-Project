So I stuck it in sandbox mode and just practiced building and making timetables and routes and I've never played it as a serious game since.\nThat's not to say it's not a great game. If you are like me and just enjoy planning and construction and making pretty cities and watching them grow then its the best game going.\nI set a big map, started in the middle and worked my way out. It's now months old and the map is almost full.\nIt's a great way to relax for an hour, working on lines and routes and watching it grow.\nIt would be nice if saved maps synced with your other devices. I play both on the PC and on my laptop and I have to copy the saves across if I want to work on a map on another device.\nApart from that it's a great game and one I will be playing a long long time.", "timestamp_updated": 1493024698, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493024589, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 13}}
