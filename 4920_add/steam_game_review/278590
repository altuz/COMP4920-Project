Maybe one of the darker endings in Legionwood 2. Still, you are one of the last living people on the planet. The rest of the world... has fallen to the Darkness, and its creatures, the undead. Based on the description of Taint early on, one could compare it to the Legend of the Five Rings's Shadowlands. You play as one of the last warriors willing to try and save the world.\n\nYou can choose to play as either male or female. Also, each act of Heroes can be played separately on in order. Considering that there are only two acts out so far (there will supposedly be a third), that might stay your purse for a bit. (Though each act costs the same.)\n\nCharacter creation is highly customizable, which can be... interesting, at least.\n\nStill, this game looks to be quite fun.", "timestamp_updated": 1491913705, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491913705, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 8, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 10}}
