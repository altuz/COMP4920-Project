For example, on the spider boss, it is completely impossible to complete the mission. You can not move anywhere, not enough space, too many objects to see what's going on, and impossible. Seriously, I tried this like 100 times, nope. And in that level, there's a point where monsters appear, but they're at such an awkward height you can not shoot them. The spider plus the monsters damaging you, plus the map makes it impossible. 1/10 wouldn't play again.", "timestamp_updated": 1500322159, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500322159, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 53, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 23, "total_reviews": 76}}
