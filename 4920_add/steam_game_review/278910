Especially if you're like me and you like playing LARGE games.\n\n\nThe game has the planning of a turn based strategy mated to a guess-and-check skill system for taking your shots.  Evaluating your shots is fun at first, but a hundred rounds in, it gets rather annoying to still be stuck taking the same shots with the same spotty targetting.  Yes, your aim line gets drawn, but you still get stuck 'guessing' what your rounds are going to do as the planets orbit into your trajectories and gravity plays havoc.  Sorry guys, but NASA was solving that dillema when calculators were still the size of a Buick.\n\nThe game could EASILY solve this by adding a tech field in the tech tree that allows you to see the predicted course of rounds to include future gravitational interactions, not just current ones.  It would definitely make pulling off crazy interplanetary (sic) slingshot trajectories more fun.    But it doesn't.  As such, the most important mechanic of the game, SHOOTING, gets annoying.\n\nA game like this straddles the line of fun and tedious.  It looks clever, but it can't hold my attention when I start zipping from round to round impatiently just trying to LAND a shot while my Turn-Based-Strategy segment suffers from inattention.  Once the RTS portion starts taking on problems because I'm rushing from turn to turn, the game spirals into an eventuall loss, resulting in frustration instead of enjoyment.  \n\nI give this a soft downvote because of this.  Masochists might like this, but I'm disappointed.  It looks good.  It has a good soundtrack that feels epic and gets you in the mood to do battle, but I'm not a fan of frustrating tedium.", "timestamp_updated": 1499664567, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499664567, "votes_down": 9}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 340, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 81, "total_reviews": 421}}
