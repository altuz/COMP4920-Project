Not because it's bad, but because it's pretty underrated and pretty poorly done AT THE SAME TIME.\nI will try to explain it.\n\nThe Story: I think that was actually a good point in this game. While i thought it was somewhat pretty generic, it had some hidden potential. But i really think the story is more conceptual than a thrilling exciting story. It follows the same pattern of Portal 1 (which i will be using as a main comparison for this game). But...Worse.\nThe voice acting is bad. I mean, BAD. Look, i can't ask good voices on a indie game but, at least, couldn't they put a little of EMOTION? I mean, the voices looks like robotic. And not robotic like GLaDOS or something. The characters just doesn't have any trace of personality or anything that make us feel attached to them. Not even the main antagonist or the general that tries to help us. And guess what? We have been following the machine instructions when we shouldn't. We should fight the machine and escape from its rage. Does that ring a bell? Yeah. Story was a good point because i see they tried to do something here with things like only putting talented people to sleep for years and about what future the humanity will face, but i just couldn't be bothered remembering the characters nor the story. At all.\n\nGraphics: For an indie game, they are actually pretty well done. But since the texture variation is not present, you will see more white or grey rooms than anything (again, exactly like Portal). And i swear that i could see more focus on doing models like Turrets and \"the balls of death\" (as i call them) than anything else. And i have to admit that it's a bit strange when you look and see something is more textured than another. If feels a bit strange, but i can forgive that.\n\nMusic: Non-existent. Aside from the game's menu music, there's no music. They tried to follow Portal and put you in a linear path with an narrator, with no song. But as i said, since the characters have no personality whatsoever, it just feels empty. And even Portal 1 had music often. This game just doesn't have AT ALL.\n\nGameplay: Now, here's the big deal. The concept of Twin Sector is pretty simple: You have gloves that pull and throw. Pretty simple. You also have limited energy, so you have to make a fair use of your gloves to get through puzzles. In puzzles, you will have lasers, explosives, fire, turrets and etc. And that's where things gets pretty bad. This game is like \"I Wanna Be The Guy\" in 3D. You die from fall damage. You die if the \"death ball\" keeps touching you. You die from explosions if you are not too far away. And mostly important, YOU DIE FROM FALL DAMAGE. That was the worst thing they could've done to this game. Sometimes the falls are not THAT big and you die anyways. And that wouldn't be bad if the checkpoints weren't a mess. They're just too far away from one another. And there just like 3 or 4 checkpoints per stage. And that wouldn't be a problem if the design of the stages WEREN'T A HUGE PILE OF CLUSTERFUCK. Seriously. Dying in this game is WAY TOO EASY and FRUSTRATING. I can think why games like Binding Of Isaac or Super Meat Boy are frustrating too, but at least they are fun frustrating. This game is PAINFULLY FRUSTRATING.\n\nANGRY. Angry is the definition of this. Your character is slow and it's easy to fuck up. Puzzles are bad because the physics in this game is bad. 90% of times you will die because of bad physics. And the other 10% you will die from the enemies that had to be, like, the worst enemies ever. They kill you with 3 hits and only die with 3 hits too. Easy, right? WRONG! Hitting them with objects is painful. They have a \"recovery time\" and they recovery way too fast. And also, if you don't grab them in time to hit them a second time (which makes 6 total hits to kill them), you WILL get hit by them. They are just boring to fight and are a pain in the ass most of the time. Mostly because there are times when they are ENDLESS. YES! They keep spawning again and again...\nNow, i think they wanted to give you a challenge. But then i ask: in Portal, did the turrets needed to be endless to make sure you die to them at least one time if you fuck up? Couldn't them make the enemies like \"if you fuck up and don't play the game in the right way, you lose\"? Because, the enemies are just something YOU CAN'T WIN. It's frustrating and keeps you away from getting past a mission, and so, from progressing the game. I never finished Twin Sector because it's way too hard from the half of the game on. I just can't win. Really. I gave up. I finished Super Meat Boy 100% but can't do the same with this game. I just can't win it...\n\nBut, remember: i said it's underrated and very unpolished. Why? Well. I liked how this game was supposed to work. The puzzles, enemies, and even the story. All of them could've worked better if they spent a bit more of time polishing it. It COULD'VE been a good game. But it just isn't.\n\nNow: I like challenges. And for me, Twin Sector is a good challenge. It's like playing Spelunky from SNES all over again. And for me, it feels great. I like raging. I like failing. It means that i'm not perfect. But i'm almost sure that almost no one is like me. Believe that.\n\nSo, my final warning is: if you want to challenge yourself, buy this game.\nIf you want to find a good puzzle with a medium challenge and a great community and stuff to do, buy Portal 2."}, {"votes_down": 17, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1422924259, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561976", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 6, "recommendationid": "14304432", "votes_up": 54, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975797010", "num_reviews": 59, "last_played": 1456672935, "num_games_owned": 2164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1080}, "timestamp_updated": 1453073921, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game might get bad reviews, but I really enjoy it and just finished my 2nd play-through of the game.\nI think this illustrates that you shouldn't listen to reviews, and try games out for yourself if it looks interesting to you and/or an interesting setting/premise.\n\nSpecifically some thing I like about the game:\n\n1) Setting and back story about the \"surface going to hell\" and humanity waiting it out in cryo tubes\n2) Texture work, for 2008 the graphics are pretty nice really imo.

There was a small selection of underwhelming titles to be had, though, and Twin Sector could always be found circling the drain of that particular tub. I never knew why or even what it was really about, other than being a first-person puzzle game akin to Portal. A small part of me held out hope that it was just misunderstood or interestingly flawed (I foolishly hold this hope for all of Steam's Weeklong Deal underclass). Now that I've spent some time with it I understand exactly why it has the reputation it does, and why I can tell you to stay the hell away from it.\n\nTwin Sector casts you as Ashley Simms, a lumpy Poser vixen that just happens to be cool and good at everything, from professional sports to saving orphans. The six and a half minute cutscene the game opens with has her being fawned over by some future space military before being shipped off to cryosleep in a station orbiting Earth to wait out the end of global warming or whatever other MAN-MADE disaster boned the planet. She awakens face-first on the floor, suffering from plot amnesia that the station's gormless AI is happy to selectively fill her in on. The place is falling apart and she just happens to be up and about, so get ready to flip a lot of switches in inexplicable positions.\n\n\"Gormless\", by the way, is an adjective that describes something \"lacking intelligence\" and also happens to be the perfect descriptor of this game. Twin Sector is ostensibly a puzzle game, equipping you with glowy space gloves that can push or pull things at a distance and expecting you to negotiate puzzle rooms with them. In practice this means three things: Force-jumping up to high ledges, cushioning long falls so falling damage doesn't kill you, and hucking barrels and garbage balls at switches. None of the halls or chambers of Twin Sector present much challenge in sussing out WHAT you have to do or HOW you have to do it, only in getting your stupid gloves to do what you HAVE to do. Puzzles tend to be little more than finding the hatch or pipe or switch you need to get to to proceed, sometimes requiring boxes to block deadly lasers or explosive barrels to break doors with.\n\nI really cannot overstate how dull and unengaging every aspect of Twin Sector is but by God I'm going to try. Every single one of the game's 17 levels is comprised entirely of featureless concrete or featureless metal, with the occasional pipe or fluorescent light to give any sense of immersion. Rooms make absolutely no sense as actual places, with elevator buttons stuck to 20-foot ceilings and computer consoles on ledges with no perceptible access. Your AI assistant guides you through these depthless halls like he's directing a kindergartner, devoid of any sort of identifiable personality. Ashley is no better, giving vacant responses to simple commands and facts. Your movement is slow, your powers are finicky, and the physics are going to be working against you for most of the game.\n\nThere is no compelling reason to subject yourself to the vapid puzzles on display here. There's no compelling story to follow, no impressive designs to behold, no environments to marvel at, and no great puzzles to tax your brain. The only thing you'll get more of as you progress is frustration as the puzzles introduce more and more ways to kill you for not doing exactly what you have to do. It's all the more frustrating when the answers are apparent and the execution is what, well, executes you, and that's the case for almost every challenge. Twin Sector has certainly earned its reputation, managing to fail every possible test of quality that a fully-realized game can fail.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

The generic looking title, tepid looking screenshots and low metactric score taunted me to play this to see just how bad it is...\n\nIn the emerging genre of first-person-puzzlers enters Twin Sector. Sporting a 49 on metacritic, Twin Sector wishes it was Portal, but it's not.  Twin Sectors sins are numerous but chief among them is it's lack of inspiration. Filled with flat voice acting, second rate graphics and a theme that's about as generic as you can get Twin Sector  simply fails to motivate the player.  Twin Sector does pace the mechanics reasonably well but the actual gameplay is average as best. Twin Sector's metactric score is deserved\n\n(Also - this game crashed-to-desktop about  every 30 minutes)\n\nA dedicated few say they like this game, but for first-person puzzlers there are better options.

I found myself wanting to like this game but it is missing something and I'm not sure what that might be without playing it more. It does have a pretty female protagonist Ashley with a cool idea of Glove's that Push or Pull. That remind me of the Portal game's, the dialog was Bad and some of the fall's kill you when it should only hurt or hurt you a little bit.

Unfortunately, it fails in execution at just about every step.  The main character doesn't feel fast or agile.  The gloves are an interesting mechanic, but charge slowly and thus lose a lot of dynamicism.  The levels are plain, sometimes make no sense, and can be quite frustrating even when you know how they're supposed to be solved.\n\nThe animation quality of the cutscenes is incredibly stiff, and the voice acting has set a new standard for me in terms of how bad it can be, although the subtitles can be hilarious (some are badly translated, and I even spotted a \"u\" - as in, \"what are u doing\").  The story premise is actually something that interests me a great deal, but the antagonist's motives are never explained.  The end cinematic likewise makes no sense.\n\nAbout halfway through the game I just turned on the god-mode cheat and blasted my way through, which proved to be wise because the end level  was indescribably frustrating even WITH the cheats."}]}
