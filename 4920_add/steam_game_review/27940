Deleting and hiding from library to cut down on clutter. This one just barely didnt make the cut to stay in library however, and for a gamer with limited options it might still be barely better than your average flash game\n\nUse space bar to doge away from enemies - aim for enemies - kite - repeat. Frequent dips in performance. Game is kinda moody in the dark with no flashlight but it gets irritating on the eyes, and with the flashlilght on the moodyness is gone and the uglyness increases. Enemy types are very few and the whole process is insanely repetitive. Some progression was added in the form of purchasable weapons and weapons upgrades but these are few and far between and the occasional accidental death can set you back a long time from the latest checkpoint seems I got about 25% of the way through before giving up but I doubt I am missing anything\n\nFor those still interested I recommend you play this instead from same Dev:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/211280/"}]}
