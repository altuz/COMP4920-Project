I still have several of the old game books from the 80s and 90s, so I bought this as soon as it was on sale. Now because this game is based off a book series there is alot of reading. If you dont like reading dont buy this game. The gamer elements ate during combat, travel and puzzle solving.\n\nI found the game to be enjoyable. They story is fantastic and easy to follow. You are always making choices which makes your story unique. When my son made his lonewolf character he was completely different then mine. Leveling the character and its skills and powers are good. customizing weapons, equipment and potions were perfect. Combat system is nice you have to manage your vitality, kai power and endurance to be effective and do the right moves to land your hits. Tons of choices. Puzzles are fun without being tedious. I LOVE the art style in book, true fantasy grit.\n\nI think they could improve the game by making more animation. Combat can be repetive by late game. There are only a few different enemies types.\n\nI think they game is worth the 14.99 but I did wait for a sale. The Lone wolf series should be made into a telltale game. I think that would help its popularity by telling the story rather then having to read it. I dont like to read alot and I still enjoyed this game I give it a 83/100", "timestamp_updated": 1500216030, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500216030, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34396821", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506074", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501371508, "steamid": "76561198017681447", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "If like me you can remember reading the original Lone Wolf books then this will be a very enjoyable experience and bring back some very fond memories of a classics.

It really works (and is probably better) on PC. I also have the iOS version. I really liked the combat even though it's repetive with few different enemies.
