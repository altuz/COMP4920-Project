If you're not a fan of medieval historical fiction, Latin, or truly insane levels of a**holery, don't buy the game, or buy it on sale.\n\nThe Awesome:\n\n[list]\n[*] You can play the whole game in Latin. \n[*] The story. It interested me enough that I have a sudden burning desire to learn Italian just so I can read the novel this was based on (sadly, the novels were never translated into English)\n[*] The easter eggs. I'm pretty sure at least half of the achievements are for finding the easter eggs in the game.\n[*] The main character. He's such a snarky bastard. [spoiler] He was downright happy when he tricked the guard into taking poison. And the levels of snark when he talks to the Inquisitor General are off the charts[/spoiler]\n[*] The scenery. It's truly gorgeous, I guess to make up for the character models.\n[/list]\n\nThe Meh:\n\n[list]\n[*]Clicking on things. Tiny things. Tiny things that apparently are about three inches to the left of where you think they are so you end up madly clicking over the entire screen to find that ONE PIXEL THAT WILL LET YOU FINISH THE PUZZLE. Or you can use the TAB key and hope for the best. [spoiler] This was really only a major problem when I had to inspect the corpse towards the end of the game. Eventually I just madly hit TAB until I heard new dialogue, because clicking was getting me nowhere[/spoiler]\n[*]Not being able to pick things up until you need them for a specific puzzle. This results in a lot of backtracking, but it can be fun because it's kind of like a game of memory. Now, where did I leave that rubber chicken?\n[/list]\n\nThe Truly Horrible\n\n[list]\n[*] The character models. Sweet jesus they're terrifying.\n[*] The final puzzle. [spoiler]Calling it a puzzle is kind of an affront to puzzles. Clicking letters and then click-dragging Greek letters over top of their English counterparts and then scraping gunk off good ol Nick's face is NOT my idea of a good time. It's filler, and I think they would have been better off just ending with a dream scene instead of trying to cram another puzzle in. [/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\nI originally bought this game because it listed Latin as one of the languages you could play in. I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of the game, especially after reading some of the reviews. That being said, if you ignore the little annoying bits and pay attention to the story, it's actually pretty fantastic. Just don't get your knickers in a twist about ugly people and the sometimes-tedious puzzles and you'll be fine.\n\n8/10 do recommend, and I'm definitely playing it again to see what other easter eggs I can unearth!", "timestamp_updated": 1430354194, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417572214, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "15132312", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527708", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1427754128, "steamid": "76561198084894878", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The most striking thing about this game is just how totally unique it is. The setting, the main character, the subject matter, are all things you really don't see in video games. And for the most part, the game succeeds in bringing you into its dark, plague-devastated world of desperation and madness.\n\nOther reviewers have touched on the negatives. Some of the backtracking can get pretty annoying because actions become available that weren't possible in earlier trips through a given area. But that isn't too unusual for this kind of game. Even if you end up having to use a walkthrough, it is still worth it just to get through to more story and atmosphere. But overall the puzzles are not too hard to figure out.\n\nMake sure you play it in Latin! I think it really makes for a totally different experience. The main character is pretty much a reprehensible, predatorial guy from the start, so don't approach the game looking for a warm and fuzzy time. You may not sympathize with him, but you will probably want to keep going to find out what he will do next.\n\nIf you have any interest in medieval times, religious history, or just dark, atmospheric, intriguing adventure games, I really don't think you can go too wrong with this one.

That's not to say it's perfect, but I enjoyed it very much.\n\nAWESOME:\n+ I can play it in Latin!!! LATIN!!! Woot! (subtitles available in several languages).\n+ A drunken guard starts singing In Taberna, from Carmina Burana. 15/10 Whoever put that there, I LOVE YOU!!!\n+ The hero is a total a**hole, he's total bada** at it, and he's convinced he's the good guy doing the Lord's work. Snarky as the best, the way he owns even his boss is superb. Perfectly believable for a Medieval inquisitor.\n\nGOOD:\n+ Good immersion, decent acting in Latin at least, which is not easy to do in a \"dead\" language.\n+ Beautiful scenery and artwork.\n+ Puzzles are rather logical, and you don't go around picking up random shit without knowing what you want it for. This may result in a bit of backtracking, but it makes better sense plot wise, so it's a plus for me.\n+ Some hilarious Easter Eggs, some of which I must go back to find.\n\nBAD:\n- The quality of the characters. That is quite awful, to be blunt. The way their jaws appear weird while they talk, or parts of their outfits poke through other parts... yikes. Sometimes it distracts so much it breaks immersion.\n- Not being able to skip dialogue can be a downer when you're replaying, but the WORST of all for me was... mild (really mild) spoiler: [spoiler]you're looking for a certain book with red back, in four walls full of books with red backs, and to find the one you need, you need to click on every single one of them, and each time you HAVE TO hear Nicolas reciting the same two long sentences just to say \"this is not the one\". After the 8th book I clicked, this became so intensely annoying, I actually went for a walk-through to know exactly which book it was, so he would shut the fuck up.[/spoiler]\n- The last \"puzzle\" was annoyingly repetitive and not really a puzzle at all, and the cursor started glitching like crazy.\n\nI totally and absolutely recommend this game, in spite of the bad things, because the good were so awesome for me, I can't wait to get Book 2 on sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1455287061, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1455286952, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "16948110", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507364", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1436389890, "steamid": "76561197997506993", "num_games_owned": 761, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "What an obscure point&click -game.

There are so many easter eggs it's enfuriating - just as you think you finally found a pixel that's useful it's yet another dev team logo or a pointless Monkey Island reference.\n\nOn the plus side, the story is intriguing, the historical setting is okay, the way they pronounce medieval latin sounds convincing enough, and the protagonist is a bit of an a-hole to say the least, which is certainly something different.
