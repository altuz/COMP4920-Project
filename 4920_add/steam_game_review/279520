In a way, the trench-running pillar-dodging style here is extremely reminiscent of the Death Star section of the '83 Atari Star Wars arcade game, one of the best arcade games of all time.\n\nYou'll find all the usual factors of a great dodge'emup here including very simple and easy to get into gameplay and controls that are exceedingly hard to master, and meticulously designed levels that are meant to push you to the edge and keep you retrying on that one seemingly impossible bit.\n\n What's different here are a number of advanced moves you can use to alter your ship in a number of ways such as rolling sideways to make it through tight fits or slowing down to let traps move out of your way. These add way deeper mechanics than seen in any other game like this, and need to be mastered in order to perfect levels. Merely running through the later levels will not be an easy task, as you'll have to employ every one of these maneuvers in order to make it without crashing. Even moreso if you want a comfortable spot on the leaderboards.\n\nThis is very well-made, looks and sounds great (seriously, the music is really cool) and includes all of the bells and whistles you would want for a Steam release including achievements, leaderboards, trading cards, and the very active developers are even considering Workshop support with a level editor which would add even more depth and replayability to this already fun as hell title.\n\nAt $5, this is pretty much a must for any arcade gaming fan's library.", "timestamp_updated": 1403094731, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1400279231, "votes_down": 18}, {"recommendationid": "20428631", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1451681581, "steamid": "76561198170425038", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I do not recommend this game at the current stage of development since it is really unpolished.", "timestamp_updated": 1452366072, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1452366072, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "19242113", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1448322996, "steamid": "76561198049435128", "num_games_owned": 1077, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "To put it bluntly: There's little reason to play this game for more than a few minutes to get the full experience. You are a space craft in a constant forward run attempting to avoid objects. Any crash and you restart. The game has two modes: \"Endless\" and \"Practice.\" Oddly, Practice is the actual game, or at least what you can consider a game as it has multiple levels and some manner of objective to the courses. Endless is as it sounds, a simple straight track that goes for as long as you can stay alive. In either respect, it becomes quite repetative very quickly. Endless is filled with asteroids and debris along a straight corridor, and Practice is a series of runs through various obstacle courses. The only appeals for this, for me, were the possibilities of variation, something that would make each play through feel like a genuine challenge. Instead, it comes off flat and rather monotonous. The music is fine enough, and the controls are good enough to fly with, but overall the polish of the game is lacking. There also seems to be no further support on this game since it's release, meaning that while there is a large screen in the Game Select Menu for multiple other modes, nothing has been added to it to bring anyone back. \n\nLong and Short, even on sale, save your money on Rage Runner.", "timestamp_updated": 1448322981, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448322981, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "16836192", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500147", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501033021, "steamid": "76561198107678440", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "easily worth the money, even if just for the daily mode... i've only played a little but i had a question and the developer answered it, that impressed me.", "timestamp_updated": 1435799682, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435799682, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "25114892", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494042", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1455764454, "steamid": "76561198148101215", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "wish i could get money back, seeing as i didnt like thegame at all.

Is it an original game? No. Is it well executed? Yes.  It offers a unique enough experience to stand on its own with the use of power-ups and thrusting to give it more variety and allow for great speedruns. :D\n\n Worth a buy if you are into your competitive running games.
