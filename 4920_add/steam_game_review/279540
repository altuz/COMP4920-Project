Pretentious Game isn't a game that I would wholeheartedly recommend to buy, especially not at full price, but it's not really a bad game by any means. At $2 price point, I would definitely recommend it, but at its full price of $5? That I'm not sure.\n\nThe game is short, really, [i]really[/i] short that you can finish it at 15 minutes. Comparing even to the extremely short Sakura Spirit visual novel, the game worth even less than it in terms of worth by playtime mileage and development efforts. There is nothing really original about it, either, other games has done something to this effect and better. The ending is also another problem, as it feels like it came out of nowhere. If the game had been longer, all of the problems with this game would really be solved.\n\nNow, why do I still recommend it? Because I simply really really like the gameplay and narrative's connectment. One of my biggest gripe over JRPGs are that they are often disconnected in terms of story and gameplay, the gameplay feels meaningless and only serve as padding rather than something genuinely fun or challenging (exception exists, of course). Meanwhile, this game's presentation of narrative and gameplay really boosts each other up. The narrative, short as it was, gives a greater meaning to the gameplay as well as be the instruction while still being a story that doesn't break the fourth-wall, and the gameplay boosts the story as it feels like we're enacting the story ourselves.\n\nI like the concept, even if it's starting to get overdone, and considering that sales data are the language of video game financing and investment, I would rather pay for these kind of games to be made more than many other Tripple-A games. Not to mention that it means supporting the developers whom we can see from this game and their next game to be a creative bunch, perhaps had they had better support before, this game would have been longer and better.\n\nAt the end of the day, Pretentious Game is a flawed game, but it is a flawed yet meaningful game that I would definitely prefer to support than mindless games that are neither fun nor meaningful.
