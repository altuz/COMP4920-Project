Folks weren't kidding when they said the Steam version was missing alot of content.  I went to gameboomers and couldn't figure out why the game and walkthrough didn't make sense.  I have only gotten to the very first of the game and already there is a giant chunk that is missing.  I have the first three games on CD and really like them, but this sucks!  Guess I will have to buy Dracula 4 and 5 on CD so that I can play the whole game.  Seems like \"Special Steam Edition\" means bend over.

I have finished both games now. They are REALLY disappointing.\n\nI am a fan of previous Dracula games, but those two are just not in the same level.\nThe narration is extremely bad, while the story is also dull and way too short, which makes these two games like an incomplete demo of a real Dracula game. Even the puzzles in these two are too easy for players to get satisfied.\nThere are also merely any interesting historical reference in these two games like this serie used to have.\nFrankly, these games get nothing to hold players' interests. It is really sad to see this great series now becomes something like the Big Fish kids' games.\n\nIf you liked previous Dracula games, PLZ stay away from these two.
