The main twist to the formula is roguelike elements, but it doesn't feel as refined as other games in that genre. Players must acquire money from monsters, objects and kill bonuses, and said currency is used to purchase continues upon death, as well as upgrades at the end of a level. There are four stages to choose from, and the order they are completed in determines both their overall length and the boss fought at the end of the run. \n\nThe combat is standard beat-em-up fare with some modern additions. Each character has three special attacks that can be used as long as the SP meter is full, and the standard combo breaker move at the expense of a full SP bar. Dash attacks round out the moveset, and each special attack can be upgraded via post-level purchases. There is also a unique kill bonus mechanic where killing several enemies at once with an SP attack yields money and/or healing items. Mastery of this mechanic is probably what causes the discrepancy on this review page in terms of players saying that the game is too easy or too hard. A player who mastered older beat-em-ups will be able to use those old tactics here to get an abundance of money and healing items, while someone newer to the genre will struggle to get a run past the first level. The combat is nothing innovative for the genre, but all the systems work in conjuction with each other.\n\nSadly, the roguelike element of this game needs some work. Unlike other games in the genre, there are no unlockable items in this game; everything is unlocked at the start and there isn't a large selection to choose from either. This indirectly means that the game doesn't have as much replay value as the games it will be compred to. Character builds will always end up quite similar regardless of how many times you play through the game, and there's simply not much to do after unlocking both endings aside from achievements. I played this game for three hours and was able to learn the game, unlock both endings and fight all but two of the ending bosses, and there's not much else to see. I feel that it's best purchased during a sale where one wouldn't feel pressured to get tons of hours out of the game, but it's good for a couple runs. Each run is a little over an hour long, so it would probably only take 8-10 hours for the average player to see everything the game has to offer. Multiplayer runs apparently make the game harder since money management comes into play, but your mileage may vary with that as it's local only.\n\nOverall, I don't regret my purchase, but I do wish the game had more to offer. I have already seen 80% of the game's content, and I've also tried out the majority of the items in just two full playthroughs. Check it out during a sale for sure, but don't expect to dump dozens of hours into this game like other roguelikes.", "timestamp_updated": 1417568535, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417568270, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "15345920", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510252", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1428979757, "steamid": "76561198010267364", "num_games_owned": 982, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is a nice idea with a lot of charm, and I'd been looking forward to trying it for a while, but Devil's Dare has too many problems for me to recommend it.\n\nFirst off, money is extremely important in the game but the only reliable way to get a lot of it is killing monsters with special moves, meaning combat is all about spamming them constantly. Feels restrictive, not to mention that some of them just aren't worth using, or can even miss, since two of them are used by holding a direction and pressing the button. If you die in a stage you can only come back if you spend money, and the cost goes up every time. Don't have enough or an item to save you, and your whole run is gone. \n\nCompounding this is that everything about the game seems designed to punish you if you make any mistake. Get hit by an enemy, and you're stunlocked for a bunch of damage unless you use a move that drains your special bar, keeps you from using them until it completely recharges, and is pretty unresponsive. Die in a stage and you probably won't get a proper upgrade for it. Even helpful things can screw you over, as a lot of the time I got hit because my character decided to pick up money instead of attacking. It feels like they wanted to take everything from the old arcade beat-em-ups, even the frustrating parts that were products of the time.\n\nIt does have an easy mode, but even then the game doesn't really feel fun or satisfying to play. This review is done from the perspective of single player, granted, but it's probably not all that likely you'd play it with others, since there's no online co-op. If they added some, maybe it would be more fun, but as it is there are beat-em-ups on Steam already that do grant that option, like Castle Crashers or Double Dragon Neon.

There are moments in the game (especially bossfights) that really feel like they require a team effort. Or at least somebody to run defense while somebody's on offense. Which in a way, really adds to that old arcade charm. (though it's local co-op only)\nIt also features a permadeath system that's really going to hurt. You can buy an extra life, but it's expensive. On the bright side though coins usually aren't too hard to accumulate before the bossfights, and you can also buy continue tokens. Money management is a big part of the game, so spend wisely. \nIt also has partial controller support, but I was playing with the keyboard so I can't give you much information on that. It's just oldschool right/left/up/down, attack, special. No complaints there. \n\nThey recently added a \"casual\" mode that's a little more friendly for the single player. However, it WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU FOR IT. When you reach the end, it basically just gives you a big ol' slap in the face and says you don't get the real ending because you're a casual. Which is a little annoying because I'm certain there are others like me who'd play this game alone. And alone, this game is frustratingly difficult. \n\nHowever, it's still really solid fun and a great homage to classic beat-em-ups.", "timestamp_updated": 1419660192, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414192692, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "12735612", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497990", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1414891493, "steamid": "76561198002792378", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Pro:\nCombo system / finishing system is interesting\nCharacters have good ability sets\nGood crowd control abilities\nGood art design but color is muted\n\nCon:\nGame is unreasonably difficult even in co op and mocks you for playing casual\n-Like in a classic beat em up attacks are hard to avoid so death is inevitable\n-Lives cost a large amount of in game money \n-Running out of lives is a full game reset\nEasy to activate the wrong ability in combat due to control scheme \nGame is short with small levels", "timestamp_updated": 1414892468, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414892468, "votes_down": 20}, {"recommendationid": "23046907", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499197", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1469419427, "steamid": "76561197971328238", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Glitchy as hell.
