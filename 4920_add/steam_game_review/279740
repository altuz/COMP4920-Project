I love the learning process of learning a piece of software like Maya, Softimage or Houdini.  For $5, I jumped at buying another visual fx tool sight unseen.  After using it for a bit, I can pretty much sum up what this software is and what it isn't.\n\nFirst of all, it should be mentioned this software dates from about 2006.  Little apparent work has been done on it in that time.  The UI really feels it's age.  The app consists of a lot of free floating child windows that don't dock (yeah, 2006) but there's a lot of functionality, curve editors to control particle parameters over time, timelines for layering and sequencing groups of these effects, and so on.  It's well designed and functional.  Particles are rendered in a 3D viewport.\n\nSo what can you *DO* with the app.  Well, it appears this app intended to target the visual effects industry not game development.  There's no way to export particle effects as a resource or as C or shader code, which might be a really useful addon if the source code could be dredged up somewhere.  All it can export is a bitmap sequence (or video file) containig your particle effect.  It does support rendering an alpha channel and depth map which is really nifty if you're hoping to composite this output with some live action footage.  I didn't see a tool that lets you import camera motion though which would be helpful.\n\nWhat you do get for $5 is a tool to experiment with particle effects ideas using standard (if outdated) blend functions but possibly it's best use case is for generating video sequences of ***huge ass-kicking fiery explosions*** with accompanying ALPHA and DEPTH info for your movie production or as MNG icons on your website.", "timestamp_updated": 1428425521, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1428425521, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "15211773", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533320", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1490429708, "steamid": "76561198136547685", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 4, "review": "I know this software is only 5 bucks..but.. I still wouldn't recommend it for doing special effects. The UI and program set up seems to be made for Win 95 or even lower. The file system menu seems to be out of order and needs quite a bit of work done to it. You cant even open up a new project under the File menu.\n\nOn the other hand.. if you would like a  effect  library to just use as a reference to do in other software.. I would recommend it. It does have a bunch of built in effects you may want to view just to get the feel of how you may do them in other software.
