Every story has been fun. Especially NofD because it had Mahjong. Usually finish most of the puzzles by myself, but this one seems to have some really messed up puzzles. One you had some missing rectangle stone pieces, couldn't find them anywhere. Well, they were the round small stone pieces (2 of 2) that had collected earlier. Don't remember them doing this in any other game so far. There was at least one other puzzle that bothered my sanity like that.  So didn't enjoy the puzzles that much in this one, in Grim Legends 1 did. \n\nReally liked the story though, probably one of the best so far. \n\nAnother note: this game uses Dominoes instead of Mahjong, so only did the HOS in here.", "timestamp_updated": 1502671079, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502671079, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33776599", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500922714, "steamid": "76561198080370930", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I bought this and number 3 in the sales after being suitably impressed by the first one, and I must say, I wasn't dissapointed.\n\nJust as good as the first, with a nice fairytale/fantasy story line.\n\nNo major jumping about to complete quests, and fast travel is available via the map.

Although the game itself was decent, I found one thing to be incredibly displeasing: ANIMALS DIE.  I'm an animal lover, so when I have to watch a beautiful white swan get viciously and bloodily killed by another swan, it rubs me the wrong way.  Yes, I know it's not real, but that doesn't mean I want to see it....ever.  You have to kill a fish with you otter, a rat gets scared away when he could have just been given cheese, and the lovely swan boat that you feed sweets to dies as well.  It's just a bit much for my liking.  I can play any hidden objects game and have an interesting story without having to murder animals.
