There are a lot of examples of bad game design, as some levels you must restart in order to reset triggers, and then make your way up a long flight of stairs again. On top of that, there are not any explanations for any puzzles, and I found myself scratching my head trying to figure out how to proceed pretty much every step of the way.\n\nAs a $5 game, especially with the amount of content it provides, this game would be tremendous.
