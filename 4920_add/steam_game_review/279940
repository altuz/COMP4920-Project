You will probably be more than a little confused with the story. Critter Chronicles can be skipped if you want, though I still plan to play it, if for no other reason than I need a third game in this wonderful franchise ASAP.\n\nWhile the narrative is very connected between games 1 and 2, this one takes things up several notches. You can see it immediately in the production value, particularly in terms of the beautiful visuals. In just about every way, the look and feel of the game has stepped up in effort and budget by a substantial and noticable amount. The first game feels instantly dated once you play this sequel. \n\nGameplay-wise, the games are pretty identical. The puzzles are some of the best the genre has to offer, often based on the interaction of multiple playable characters which you swap between freely. There is very little, if any moon logic. But there's just enough challenge to make it cerebral enough for puzzle addicts like me.\n\nThen there's the story. While the first game was a fourth-wall breaking comedy, the sequel is a 'dramedy'; serious and soulful AND filled with laughs. Coming from being a fan of darker stories like Gabriel Knight, I appreciate a story that makes me care this much without resorting to melodrama.\n\nThis is a classic in the adventure game genre, and I cannot recommend it enough. If you ever want proof that these games haven't completely died, here it is.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1496473118, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496473118, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31085830", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1491943327, "steamid": "76561198352248707", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Although a bit pricy (and for me patchy at times; i.e having to load a save game posted in the forums as stuck on chapter 3) I would still recommend this game to aficionados of point'n'click adventure games.
