You want it to look as good as it did in its halcyon days but you want to \"modern\" it up just a tad. You paint the house as you see fit and after the job is said and done you look back on your work. The job is noticably half assed and paint is running onto the ground and carpets inside. Paint bubbles are everywhere and some walls have a thicker coat than others. For some reason a support beam to the house was broken in the process and the structure is noticably listing.

The game introduced the over-cinematic, highly scripted gameplay that everyone unnecessarily cries about when talking about CoD but of course no one cares because it's Valve. Honestly? The game's a mess. It's very short. The difficulty is downright atrociously done. The setting is unique but due to a serious lack of even one single actual character the game can't tell the story everyone thinks it does so well.\n\nI quit the game when I found an itch-...whatever you call the underwater creature thing, flying around trying to attack a helicopter. This game is terrible. A 96 on Metacritic? How about 60.\n\n[b]The Great:[/b]\n++Weapons feel great\n++AI is fantastic, even if many AI details go unnoticed\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+Headshots are especially meaty\n+Great gibs\n+Voice-acting is very good\n+Enemy variety is nice, if not generic or a total rip off\n\n[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]\n+-Sound design is average\n-+Music is decent if utterly forgettable\n+-It's short, but admittedly only as short as Quake II, but this doesn't have the replayability of Quake II\n-+Weapons are generic and some useless\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n-Level design makes no sense. Why would you have a massive pit with hanging crates? Why does Black Mesa have a meat processing factory connected to a sewer?\n-Games looked terrible for 1998. At a time where every year introduced marginal graphical innovations Half-Life was far behind the times. Quake from 1996 looks far better than this at 1080p. \n-Despite having supposedly incredible, innovative storytelling there are no characters other than one who only appears once in the whole game to talk to you\n-The constant set-pieces, while being impressive means this game has little replayability as there are no sandbox surprises or open ended level design, which is exactly why we remember late 90's FPS as being so fantastic\n-Loading screens every 2 seconds\n-Sticky ladders suck\n-Way too much platforming, which is made even worse by how this game has some of the worst movement in FPS\n\n[b]The Horrible:[/b]\n--The game is a joke and ruins whatever atmosphere it tries to create due to unleashing its arsenal of glitches whenever it gets the chance (e.g scientist jumps out of window running away from zombies and says to you \"I see you are from the physical labs, yes.\")\n--Easy and medium is very easy\n--Hard equals bullet sponge enemies. A soldier should not take 4 shotgun rounds square to the head to die, nor should a bullsquid have to be blown up by a grenade directly under him and then finished off with 2 point-blank shotgun rounds for it to actually die.\n--Some story people who talk at you don't a lot of the time because this game's a glitchy mess, even more so in this Source version\n--In a time where arena FPS was king, this had no bots\n--In fact, the multiplayer was utter unbalanced rubbish\n--The stupid slippery movement makes me want to fucking cry\n\nSound: 6/10\nGraphics: 4/10\nGameplay: 7.5/10\nContent/Replayability: 3/10\nOverall: 4/10\n\n[b]Half-Life Review Special[/b]\nThe Praise This Game Gets and My Rebuttal's:\n-[i]\"It paved the way for shooters\"[/i]\nThe only thing this game innovated for shooters was its linearity and non-stop set pieces. The weapon arsenal is generic. Pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, grenades, rocket launcher, a crossbow that has no difference to a normal sniper \nrifle, useless alien weapons that nobody uses. In a time of competitive multiplayer arena FPS', this game had as much of a run of the mill multiplayer as you could possible get. No bots, only a few generic game modes, terrible netcode,\nliterally nothing to set it apart. I find it ironic that people praise this game for having amazing scripted setpieces, and then complain about CoD's non-stop over the top set pieces.\n-[i]\"Spawned many influential mods\"[/i]\nReally? We're praising a game for what the community did with it? Wow, a talented team made a couple of total conversions out of its engine. Good work, Valve. Oh wait, that has literally nothing to do with you since it wasn't the game\nthat made the mods good, but the developers behind the mods that made the mods good. It's not even an easy game to mod. Compare installing mods in this game to installing mods in Unreal. Even a baby could work it out in Unreal.\n-[i]\"The first real FPS story\"[/i]\nYou call a couple of scientists here and there throughout the short campaign telling you to do things a story? I mean, at least Unreal told it though its level design and the numerous diaries you could read. Thief may not be an FPS, but it is\nfirst-person and you can shoot things. It's more of an FPS than Portal, and in that game the story is so prevalent through a large amount of cutscenes, tons of stuff to read, a ridiculous amount of world-building in level design etc.\nit makes Half-Life's narrative look like it was done by a preschooler. \n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nI don't like using the word overrated and underrated as it's all down to opinion and people can see things wildy different to others, which is needless to say, but the very fact that I can glitch this game out in the very first seconds of so-called 'gameplay' (gameplay which involves you standing there doing nothing in a square for 10 minutes) meanwhile everyone complains about the state of FPS nowadays while completely ignoring how this started most of those complaints may be the definition of overrated. This game has been constantly updated by Valve ever since release. You don't see glitches so bad in Unreal, and that didn't get non-stop patches for a decade straight. It's worth one playthrough. That's it. Just move onto the far, far, far superior sequels instead. Hell, even the expansions did more things right than this.\nThis game is the Queen of video games. Decent at times, but no where near as good as people give it credit for. Yes I just insulted Queen and this game. I truly am a hipster and there's no way I won't get a downvote for at least one of those reasons."}]}
