Much better pace! I would highly suggest anyone trying to get the hang of X3 to do X2: The Threat first. It is not so much the story line, but the overall feel of the game. While the controls differ sleightly from game to game, as they are approached differently, what you NEED to do is still the same.\nWith that said, the game is VERY reminisance of FREELANCER in many ways, and not X3. For starters, X3 has no player/NPC 3rd person visuals and comes across more as a serious EVE ONLINE style, where X2 seems to be more story oriented. \n\nThe voice acting is great (above par for the year it came out), however, it can seem diminished by the horrid NPC artwork. - So bad in fact, I did not have difficulty staring at the close-caption in order to avoid looking at them - YUP they are that bad.\n\nBut that does not take away from the game. X3 takes some of the soundtrack as well. So when completed with X2, and you decide to move to X3, it will still feel familiar, albeit more mature feeling. You 'll have a better understanding of the controls and how to move about as well.\n\nIf you're like me, and want to be an X fan, try this one first. It helps a lot to go into X3"}, {"votes_down": 19, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1492097527, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465837", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31118608", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198154113625", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1471490499, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1605}, "timestamp_updated": 1492097527, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Hard to get into, cheesy dialog, dated as hell...everything.
