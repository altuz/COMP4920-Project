The camerashake makes you want to quit and the amount of people you kill for no reason. The story is kinda weird I believe. A guy has a friend who flies in to Shanghai and after just landing and getting out of the airport you imediatly start shooting people in some apartment. Chasing after a naked couple to just shoot the girl and see the guy cut his own throat in some alley. The girl was someone daughter, who had alot of power is now after you. You just have to kill everyone that you see or don't. You can always just run through the enemies and get to the next cutscene."}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506020594, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490662", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35111586", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198020948350", "num_reviews": 18, "last_played": 1420380366, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 342}, "timestamp_updated": 1506020594, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Hello!
