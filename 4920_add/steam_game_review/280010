The feel of the movement - the grappeling hook, walljumps and the dash - is fantastic. Add to that a set of robust weapons and a couple of friends (or strangers) and it all adds up to a lot of great fun!\nIts easy to learn, quick to pick up, but with a lot to master still. Matches are quick and and fast-paced, and the speed-running mode is also great fun.\n\nHighly recommended!", "timestamp_updated": 1438630174, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1438630174, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "34623997", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1464839950, "steamid": "76561198158335566", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fun to kill a few hours", "timestamp_updated": 1504146784, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504146784, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "23178830", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494627", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1464082750, "steamid": "76561197985037445", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "soldat is better....", "timestamp_updated": 1464083009, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464083009, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "17452068", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438442", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1439089879, "steamid": "76561198037114199", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "My first time having sex was like my first time riding a bike.\nMy dad was behind me.\n\nEDIT: My friend and I played this, trying to find something for us to enjoy together.
