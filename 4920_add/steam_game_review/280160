Not one for the hack and slash \"stealth\" games, but a literal silent ninja where everything must be either to decieve, kill without being scene, or even just plain out avoid enemies altogether.\n\nNow, within the stealth game routes, this game amazingly has tons of freedom. You can do any of the afore mentioned tactics, a combination of some, or any other stealth idea you can image. The gameplay feels very intuitive and the shadow arts that you get make you truely feel like a ninja of the shadows; teleporting, sneaking, and transforming the shadows to your will. This is not a game for those who like pure action and beat-'em-up games. But if you're looking for a very high quality stealth game in which you can be in covert missions however you see fit and have the power of practically night its self, this is the best game out there for you.
