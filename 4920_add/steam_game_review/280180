It's not paticularily deep or anything, it's just really good, like, really good. I enjoyed the game the same way I enjoyed games such as Sonic Generations, they're not complex or all that difficult, they're just really fun to play.\n\nThe game has excellent presentation; the game sounds great, with a fun and catchy soundtrack made by Hideki Naganuma (the Jet Set Radio guy) and satisfying sound effects. The game has an eye-catching style, this with the large open levels makes the game look really impressive, even if the game isn't all that graphically intensive. The characters are well designed and look appealing and the user interface is clean and sharp.\n\nThe main strength of this game is the gameplay, which is complex enough to make you feel like you're really good, but easy enough that it doesn't take a while to feel like you're really good. The sliding, running, parkouring and tricks are incredibly fun to pull off, the fast pace of the game is exciting, the multiplayer is fine too; gonna have to deduct points for the stealth gameplay, which isn't very good. To support the gameplay, the controls are intuitive and responsive of keyboard and mouse, it feels satisfying to pull tricks off thanks to the good controls, I can't comment on the controls on a controller because I haven't tried them.\n\nThe game is low on substance, the plot is simple and there aren't many twists and turns, the story is really just there so that there's a reason to do the missions past \"they're fun.\", that being said the world building in the game is very strong if you take time to read the emails, it makes the world feel alive, which is quite impressive considering how simple the plot is. The writing is solid, it's not amazing, but the characters are likable and dialogue is fine.\n\nThe level design is incredibly solid for the most part, the developers are aware that the game's strength lies in open areas that allow for impressive trick combos; they change up the formula in some of the areas, for the most part these areas are pretty good, the underground is still very open but has set out races and lines as opposed to the freeform parkour of the open world, it works, the races are fun. The final area is also quite closed, but it is still enjoyable, supplying much more challenge than the rest of the game, with precise platforming, which is quite awkward with the quick controls, but you get used to it.\n\nHowever, all this praise goes out the window with the prison. Which in short is awful, in slightly longer it's REALLY REALLY awful. The game's weakest aspect is it's stealth, so a level entirely based around slowly stealthing doesn't work, slowly moving through these tight enclosures through the confusing level design is really frustrating, the game is hard to control when moving slow, afterall the game is build for going fast; this leads to lots of restarts due to getting caught, which is really annoying. The prison is pretty ugly to look at, it's quite bland compared to the bright and impressive visuals of Haven City or the Admin District, add to this the grating music and it's just a chore to sit through, it's not all that long but it feels like it takes hours.\n\nThe game is amazing if you can get through the prison.", "timestamp_updated": 1505751024, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505751024, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34940044", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505418807, "steamid": "76561197992581333", "num_games_owned": 959, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is amazing and I plan to spend lots more time with it.

I was especially excited to see Hideki Naganuma take part in some of its production, but it's not really what he mixed up for JSR or JSRF, which were both two ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT soundtracks (hell, I wish Hideki would just start making albums like JSRF's and sell them, my wallet would be wide open for that). \n\n~Not everything is explained really well, particularly the character development. Some people like that, so they can have a learning experience without assistance, but to others it might be frustrating. I feel neutral about it.\n\n~Developed primarily by only three people. Impressive by any standards, and I congratulate them with full respect intended. However, less people means less development, and time for it therefore, so some people may grow impatient. I have no problem with it however.\n\n~Some models might look a little unfinished, but to me it gives a flair that the JSR titles had. This isn't Crysis so don't have high expectations.\n\n~Assorted typos. Since this is a text-based game with no voice acting, it might drive some nerds crazy but it's not too hard to get over it, and you can tell what they're trying to say.\n\n~Small community. Some like that, some don't. I think the game would grow more with an active, larger community, but it doesn't ruin anything.\n\nNegatives:\n-Like in the JSR games, some level layouts and missions will frustrate you, sometimes too much.\n-No borderless fullscreen.\n-General glitches, such as Gameballs falling out of the map and delaying a race, annoying things like that.\n-Hideki Naganuma isn't SEGA, so it's not a third JSR\n\nThat about sums things up, I give it my approval. I haven't tried online yet but I'm sure it's fun as well, as solo has been great. $20 full price is more than reasonable, and I hope the devlopers continue to update the game, and at least add some unreleased characters in the future.

It has potential. The mechanics are decent, but honestly don't feel perfect. But the bigger issue is that the level design is really rough, and at least at a new player's level, really stifles fluid gameplay. I've played Tony Hawk (and Mirror's Edge) games for many years, and yet every time I felt like I was gaining momentum in this game and having a bit of fun, I found that the map punished me for doing so.\n\nI assume that these issues go away at the higher levels of play. But as a new player who was trying to determine if this was a game I would enjoy, my vote has to go for no. With that said, I love what the game is trying to do and I encourage the developers to improve it in the future.\n\nI think I'd buy this game on a sale, perhaps for $5 or maybe $7.50.
