So, I have a guilty pleasure and that is these \u2018creeper\u2019 games and today I\u2019m reviewing Creeper World 3:  Arc Eternal.  If any of you have been following my reviews you may find this odd as it is an older game from my first experience of this series:  Particle Fleet (made by the same developer) but the honest reason is I didn\u2019t know this game type even existed until Particle Fleet and I still wasn\u2019t sold that this wasn\u2019t a one hit wonder so I cautiously bought the game you see now.\n\nI\u2019m doing what:  This game is an odd mesh of genre\u2019s:  Part tower defense, part base builder but all real time strategy when it comes down to it.  However, you aren\u2019t going to see many controllable units (aside from fighters / bombers) and even those you really aren\u2019t micro-managing as they are told to strike an area and generally left alone (nothing in the game can actually damage them).  Your first encounter with this may leave you with a \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d kind of thought but as you keep playing you will find the complexity comes from the buildings themselves and not the core game (as all great strategy games have).\n\nLoud Noises:   Like the later game of the genre (the above Particle Fleet) the music is very good, though I do tend to turn it off after several hours of playing it.  My friends have an overwhelming annoyance with the cannon sounds\u2026not sure why.  To be fair, the gun sounds can be obnoxious from an onlooker\u2019s perspective.  I just don\u2019t mind all that much as I\u2019m usually listening to something else.  In addition the graphics are very simple; but I\u2019m glad they are as the game is about the gameplay not the graphics or particle effects or really even the sounds (though, again, the music is really good).\n\nMultitasking:  One of the amazing things about this game is the \u2018casual\u2019 nature of the gameplay itself with the possibility of improvement to a competitive level.  That sounded a bit word-salad but what I mean is the game isn\u2019t really \u2018hard\u2019 but more of a challenge that can be relaxing like a brain teaser and I found myself using this game as a wind down at the end of a night or after work along with watching a movie or podcast; nothing too intense.  Now, if you are trying for the leader boards then get ready to white knuckle because there is some serious optimization to be had.  In the end, however, I am happy with my slow paced game for the purpose I\u2019ve set for it.\n\nOverall, I make no qualms in that this game is a guilty pleasure of mine.  This game is not for everyone; it can be a bit slow paced (or fast depending on you).  I\u2019d earnestly recommend that everyone gives this a try, especially if you are a management, strategy or puzzle fan.  I also have to mention that there appears to be a near endless amount of content.  I actually forced myself to uninstall this game as I was playing it instead of moving on to other games in my library.  At worse, wait for a sale as the game does get pretty cheap during those.  As always, regardless of your decision I hope you enjoy your gaming!", "timestamp_updated": 1504901727, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504901393, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1131, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "review_score": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 38, "total_reviews": 1169}}
