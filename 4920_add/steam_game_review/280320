Leaving a dungeon using the portal can leave me stuck unable to re-enter it and having to restart from scratch, which in the case of invasions just makes the event disappear and registered as a loss. Invasions have to be turned in at the castle's jester and not at regular city quest givers. The tutorial does not tell you but the graveyard is usually accessed on the Castle screen. The tutorial is lengthy, heavily scripted, cannot be skipped and can be failed which can create a host of problems. The whole game is mouse only with an overland map to select hubs to visit, hubs can be exited by clicking on the roadsigns. Dungeons are a series of connected rooms that you navigate by clicking on screen arrows, a handy diagram is there to show you which forks exist in the road. Objectives are at the top right so you can keep track of what you need done before you can take the portal out. University can teach permanent skills for gold. Great variety of classes. Loot levels up quite high, increasing the base attribute of loot that rarity further modifies. Loot system similar to early Diablo games. The use of fast forward, and management of human ressources and everybody's sechdule becomes micromanagement intensive.\n\nSome of the dialogue. Especially for random events when dungeoncrawling and when picking autoquests are obviously being randomly generated and can read to truly bizzare results, often in a bugged out, jarring kind of way.\n\nLeveling your relationship with kingdoms seems like a pointless grind that feels a gauge for no apparent benefit. The whole monarch/ruler character seems underdevelopped.\n\nNote: Seems like the game is balanced for you to dump in your main classes attribute and then take some ranks of +% to stat as a level up upgrade before picking up active abilities", "timestamp_updated": 1505913438, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500482838, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "33480219", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492387", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499672993, "steamid": "76561198031282454", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "its kinda boring after 30 min and its humor remnds me of a 14 year olds jokes", "timestamp_updated": 1499867924, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499867924, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 194, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 126, "total_reviews": 320}}
