The UI is as bad as the \"x\" to close each window is small, and you need several windows to do anything. The game has way too many glitches to not be supported, combat is clunky, managing your shipmates is nearly impossible, as they will all stand in the same place, and, to seperate them, you have to click off of them, then click on the pile, then click on an open space, and repeat this process until you've moved them all out, then, if you want to figure out who is who, you have to open up the character info screen and check their stats and equipment. I could complain forever about this game, although i would rather it be in a playable state so i can just enjoy it instead.

I really wanted to like this game. But an hour in, I still dont know what i'm doing. I've run into about 6 bugs that basically ended the game, and required a restart. \n\nMy inventory filled with spare parts when i needed new parts for my ship. I got to the first store, couldn't sell it because the game crashed when I tried to open the selling store. In fact, when i tried to open the game again, the store just didnt work.\n\nthere's no trading between characters, so if the wrong guy picks up the wrong item, one guy is almost dead and needs a medkit, but the robot picks it up? you have to go to the ship to put it in the inventory to use the /one/ item slot they have.\n\nI'm even okay with not being able to trade directly, but dropping things destroys them?\n\nLook.
