This game took me little over an hour of gameplay to complete, but it was really fun and challenging while it lasted. There were moments when I thought I'd never get past the area I was stuck on, but it had that sort of 'hard but not impossible' feel about the game. The soundtrack was a real nice addition as well and sounded reminiscent of the 16-Bit days.
