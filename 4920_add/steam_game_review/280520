This game does need a community backing, I feel the game would grow or at least the workshop side of it would, and it would greatly help out where the games standing is.\n\nCons:\nLack of end game\nAfter first boss you just fly through\nCrafting is good, but item drops are random and could use a boost *planned I believe*\nFix the damn dungeons, idk how many I've spawned and gotten stuck in, or unable to do because I'm trapped in a room you can't mine urself out of, I've also pulled a mob into a wall *have to kill all to progress in this specific dungeon* and I tried for 20 minutes to kill it, even checking forums, no luck.\nAs stated by others, dev does seem to be giving up, delaying updates for another game, he promises to update this one, but sadly we do know how that goes, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt as this game is 5 years old, but I feel it just truly came to light. \n\nI feel playing this game with more than like 2/3 people will kill it for you, unless you have major goals, as you can progress very fast, and carry them through dungeons/instances and they will get the xp for it, so there is some catchup for them if they don't wanna be low, but it also ruins the experience. I myself feel it's fine where it's at, but the experience is gone for your friend.\n\nI would prefer this game to linger around a 5-$10 mark with how \"finished\" it is, and the part time coding/programming etc that is coming from the dev.\n\nThe skill tree aspect in this game, makes it worth it alone, it does seem a bit fast to finish most of it though.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1504839334, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504839334, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "34848512", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441151", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504997530, "steamid": "76561198208140260", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "No tutorial.
