It's a game where you essentially play team manager for Ghosbusters! And it has a nearly-perfect blend of tactics and management gameplay! What could possibly be more fun?\n\nUnfortunately, the game is marred by several issues.\n\nFirstly, the art direction is uneven at best. Most of the ghosts have very uninspired designs that won't stick in your mind like those of other franchises involving catching ghosts. Several of the ghosts are just recolors or slight redesigns of the lower level ghosts you fight early in the game, so they're both boring to look at and repetitive. This also makes it slightly harder to tell what you're figthing at times.\n\nSecondly, the writing is just atrocious. This isn't a story-driven game by any means, but there's still quite a bit of text, both in item/ghost descriptions and in the dialogue where you're offered missions. It often tries to be humorous but falls incredibly flat, to the point where you'll probably stop reading it after a while. There are also many spelling and grammatical errors throughout the game. The dev team's native language is obviously not english, which explains this problem but doesn't excuse it, as they should really have hired someone who could do a better job localizing the text.\n\nThe poor writing also affects the central story, such as it is. Certainly, the real story of the game is just managing your team, but there is an attempt at a mounting threat, but it's very bare bones and unengaging, and marred by more failed attempts at humor. Again, a certain other ghost-catching series knew how to build up a supernatural threat...\n\nLastly, the game is just incredibly janky and buggy. Crashes are relatively common, items will sometimes not equip properly, the interface will ignore your input, performance will start chugging wildly after playing for more than an hour, certain items and features won't unlock when they're supposed to, and most importantly, saved games will load incorrectly, switching character positions and stats around willy-nilly. It's a very frustrating experience to try to play a full campaign, as the game becomes less and less stable the more you progress and save.\n\nWhile I would love to recommend this game, I simply can't in the state it's currently in. Some of the problems are down to personal taste, but a buggy game that doesn't save your progress is something that no one should buy.", "timestamp_updated": 1502202267, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502202267, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 44, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 18, "total_reviews": 62}}
