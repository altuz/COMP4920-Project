Got a handful of the most highly recommended and this was one of them.  I love the grazing system.  Im new to games of this type and I read in some reviews that newbies to SHMUP{S (or whatever the kids are calling them these days) should stay away from the grazing system.  I think its a wonderful thing.  It forces me to pay attention to my craft and my 'core' (aka that one pixel that actually takes damange' instead of letting my eyes wander like other games.  \n\nTHe overall theme of this game however seems to be generic.  Generic enemies, levels, music, ship types to pick from.  Very cookie cutter.  However this doesnt deter me.  It does what its meant to do and does it well.  Definitely recommended.", "timestamp_updated": 1498692345, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498692345, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 171, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 8, "total_reviews": 179}}
