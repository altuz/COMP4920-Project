Most of the game play consist of fetch quest where you have to go into  the randomly generated dungeon in order to  get a certain item to continue the story . If you like dungeon crawlers and you like vampire characters you will like blood lust shadow hunter  \n \nThis game was  produced by one person .  \nthe games author gives a more accurate description of the game here  \n \n \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/280600/discussions/0/611698195151510950/ \n \n \nIf you are a bloodlines fan  and are expecting something similar to bloodlines  Do not purchase this game If you do not want or like dungeon crawlers  it is a dungeon crawler nothing more.  Despite all of the various   \" its a dungeon crawler yes but ...\" type excuses  by the author   this one is my favorite  \n \n \n\" the charm in Bloodlust is probably not in its presentation or polish but rather in its exploration, secrets and loot\" \n \n That is like going to  an expensive restaurant and getting a burnt steak for dinner and  the waiter telling you .  The value of the meal is not in the way the steak is cooked rather it is that the steak was sourced  from the most exclusive  cows.  \n \n \n \n \n   If you like dungeon crawlers with endless dungeons then this is good value for you money . If  you want something with more voice acting and social elements like vampire the masquerade bloodlines  Then  if this is what you are looking for you will feel you have been ripped off .

It will work better in MMO.\nLocations are bad. It`s dungeon crawl game. Non-dungeon locations are small and boring. You kill enemies in the dark and move further or should i say lower?\nYou need to buy keys to open some doors in dungeons...\nSo called puzzles are \"Find lever, use Gaze, open the secret door\".\nCustomization is limited to hats / masks visually. You can change rings, pants etc, but i haven`t noticed the difference. Maybe i am blind or it was too dark. \nVoice acting is bad.\n\nDid i forgot something? Hope not.\n\nI like the things i mentioned. Power system with active powers, passive bonuses, reputation etc, but this game is an offspring of dungeon crawl and MMO with bad customization system.\nSad truth.\n\nIt is better than some more popular games, but ain`t that good.", "timestamp_updated": 1499678519, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499626149, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 148, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 30, "total_reviews": 178}}
