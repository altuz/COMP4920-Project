I mean, the other steam option that I've found, Black Ink, has some weird fun options. But this is pretty practical stuff.\n\nWhy then, is this thing so GOSH DANG LAGGY? I've never even heard of an art program with lag! You're just drawing lines! It makes an otherwise great application miserable, since after you draw enough lines, you either have to save and reboot it, or just imagine what your lines will probably look like a second down the road and go from there. Plus, for some reason, only some times when you draw a small shape, a menu pops up, and you have to cancel out of it and redraw your line.\n\nI'd reccomend Fire Alpaca instead. This is a decent art program, but it's not worth the misery you have to go through for the decent selection of tools.", "timestamp_updated": 1502088425, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502088425, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 31, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 12, "total_reviews": 43}}
