It has similarities to Anno in having requirements to upgrade tiles (like needing more than one food type or good) The hours I've spent so far have been attempting to be a completionist with the missions since each campaign mission has a number of objectives to complete.   \n\nSome  of the objectives  are completed by just following the narrative, The one that is a little awkward is the objective that requires you to treasure hunt a particular special resource, as finding it can be simple, getting it in your zone of control however is a different story.  \n\nThere is an online leaderboard for players to compare scores in how well they did, currently the scores look like people have actually be playing it rather than just manipulating it and getting to the top of the board.  I don't know how long that will last though.\n\nCurrently it appears the game actually has a pretty small footprint in regards to download size (currently less than 1Gb) so for those of you that don't want to spend hours downloading larger games, this might well be one for you.
