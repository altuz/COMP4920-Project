It has been a long back and forth between this game and Minecraft. I love both games, but unfortunately Creativerse is all building, and sharing those builds using blueprints. There is so much more you can do in Minecraft, and the redstone system while being incredibly awkward, once learned is ultimately more powerful than anything you can do in Creativerse. In minecraft you can ride things with a saddle, travel to other lands like the nether and the end, and the whole experience is just so much more fleshed out and there is so much to learn and explore. Creativerse has a fairly obvious line of progression. You complete that, and then it is basically just building and sharing the builds. If that is your thing, then cool! However I prefer more actual \"game\" and interesting fun mechanics, instead of just building for the sake of building. I really wish they spent more time fleshing out the gameplay mechanics instead of focusing on making new blocks to bait you in to buying, and the blueprint system that I never once found worth using. There is just nothing CREATIVE about building someone elses design. SO while I did enjoy this game, it just needs more and gets stale rather guickly compared to good old Minecraft.\n\nDevs, make more actual GAMEPLAY instead of reskinning blocks to make money from here on out, and you will draw in more players to actually buy premium things in your game. Right now there is just not enough there to keep people entertained for more than a month straight unless they are dull and really easy to amuse.", "timestamp_updated": 1506651007, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506651007, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 797, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 141, "total_reviews": 938}}
