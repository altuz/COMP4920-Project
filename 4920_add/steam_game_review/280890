I started the game and found the menu options and set up to be confusing. When I was trying to set up the graphics and resolution it was causing the game to do some weird things. I couldn't customise the settings in game which meant I had to exit the game just to see what the changes made looked like. Game play is another thing. Glitchy is an understatement. Game play was terrible and the actual aiming on the guns was rediculous. Trying to kill the first enemy causes you to empty your gun of bullets and it takes maybe 3 hits from the weakest (from what I've seen) enemy. Good points. I played 3 times and it took 0.6hours. That's 20 minutes per game. 15 of which were getting off the initial ship onto the \"ghost ship\" and 5 mins of running away from something I can't kill. This game was pants. Luckily I payed a few quid for it.
