The campaign consists of 3 game modes, a freerun mode, a speed run mode and a drag race mode. On top of these campaign gamemodes there is a seperate mode to play which is the unlimited runner mode.\n\nIn freerun mode, you get full control of your character to jump between the various levels and layers of the pre-generated worlds. You can use all the controlls, boost, slide, jump and double jump to traverse the areas, being faced with obstacles like barriers and walls you can slide under, and speed boost power ups. Freerun requires you to take full advantage of these abilites, by facing you with walls that require precision timing for you to dodge past. This is where the game really shines, as you are not on set tracks and are free to jump away from the path entirely, only to come back in having looped around a tough obstacle. Throughout these stages there are checkpoints, so if you muck up right near the finish line you won't have to start from the very beginning which is a very forgiving bonus. These levels don't require you to take a set path, you can alternate between the many layers of the track at will which gives every replay a unique feeling and keeps the track fresh, for a time anyway. \n\nSpeed Run mode is a more traditional runner mode, reminiscent of games like Temple Run. You are stuck to one course where you must simply dodge the obstacles that are presented. You use the arrow keys to switch between the three lanes, having no option to jump out of the track like you can in Freerun. The tracks are usually straight forward and require you to pick up the collectables to finish. \n\nDrag Race mode requires you to time your boosts, bound to the up arrow, to speed up and finish the course before the time is up. The obstacles in this mode are straight forward, and unlike the other two modes there is no way to switch between lanes. You are bound to the middle lane and must time your boosts with the icons on the track to get enough speed in time. \n\nUnlimited Runner is more of a side mode, you won't be spending as much time on it as the campaign unless you like the feel of an endless track runner. It is a randomly generated track, built on the Speed Run mechanics, so there's not much to say about it. \n\nNow these are my opinions on the gamemodes. Freerun, as I already stated, is certainly the strong point of the game. It is interesting and tries its best to stay that way, and will be the mode you look forward to while playing the campaign. Speed Run is fun, but gets old quickly. It is more enjoyable to play in the form of Unlimited Runner in my opinion because this really extends the longevity of it and allows for high score beating and the like. Drag Race feels like it was thrown in as a filler, because I honestly don't have much fun with it at all. It's repetive, and feels like a grind to complete, and not a unique experience. It gets boring quick and you probably won't look forward to playing it, or not as much as other modes. \n\nFor the price, T.E.C 3001 is an amazing game. It offers quite a bit of gameplay while staying fresh and interesting besides a few letdowns. It has simplistic yet beautiful visuals and a nice soundtrack, and is a great experience. If I were to change anything about it, it would be to remove the Drag Race game mode and try to add even more variety to Freerun (Tracks that curve upwards, requiring you to run on the roof?) and possibly some more variety to Speed Run to make it feel less repetitive. Other than these slight hinderances, it's almost a garaunteed buy for me and a rating of 8/10.", "timestamp_updated": 1397375142, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1397375142, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "9790250", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512389", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1400443397, "steamid": "76561198053885145", "num_games_owned": 1302, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "More fun then i thought i would get.\n\n8/10\n\nGreat controls , Stunning visuals , Nice music.\nA fun concept no doubt.\n\nFor people wondering if they should get it:\n\nDo you like nice visuals?

T.E.C is a 3D linear running game.\n\nThis game feels like it was greatly paid attention to, from the gameplay to the visual details and music. There are three basic modes to T.E.C. The first requires you to run in a straight line and commit to certain dodge techniques. The second sort of works like a grid system, where acceleration and top speed rise sharply and quick manouevers are needed. The third mode consists of free running, where the player is in full control of every tilt their player makes. This last game mode is what makes this game unique. There are levels where I've felt I've barely made the turn but still managed to make it to the end. The free running is extremely fun as you'll quickly be jumping platform to platform (which go in all directions). \n\nOne thing I've noticed in free running is some courses require the player to make 360 degree turns running up a platform. As the joystick is held in one direction, the player finally starts leaning inwards making a sharper turn, while the camera begins to rotate over the shoulder. This is a cool concept, and makes for a great visual, but can make it hard to control the runner accurately. I also have no idea how to reset the camera back to normal when that happens. On top of creative level design and good control schemes, the game offers local co-op on top of multiplayer. Third and first person views are also a feature in the game. \n\nThe visuals are appealing, and game (and menu) colors change with each color-icon you hit. Graphics are sharp but there seems to be more room for improvement here. The backgrounds are quite plain. Level designs are immaculate as there is no one way to go about your business, which makes it welcoming to local co-op. Sounds are few but on point. I like when the runner jumps from a height and that smashing metal sound plays. Music seems to be original and some tracks are quite catchy. \n\nFor future T.E.C games, perhaps make a \"fight\" mode for local co-op where players can run into one another, or perhaps strike each other as a distraction. Also, maybe having an options to designate sensitivity of the joystick would be appreciated, unless the dev's wanted this certain feel. \n\n\nRATING : 7.35/10\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]Gameplay[/td]\n\t[td]B+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Replay-ability[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Overall [/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\n[h1]ScreenShots : [/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462318927] The free form control I was speaking of as well as multiple choices for routes[/url]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462319196] You can slide in third person or first person[/url]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462319448] Proof of the third or first person view options[/url]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462319654] Any game that has double jump, I am a huge fan of[/url]", "timestamp_updated": 1465108408, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434658503, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "10000071", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512438", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1399293203, "steamid": "76561198001933176", "num_games_owned": 798, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Basically you are a terminator that runs through 40 different courses, collecting batteries and power-ups while avoiding objects to run into.

If you're interested in the feel of speedrunning without spending hours plotting your own route or learning the minute specifics of a game engine, definitely check this out.\n\nCheck the screenshots/video on the store page to see what the game's going to look like; if you like that visual style, you won't be disappointed. The visual feel is very \"'80s cyberspace\"...the same kind of vibe as Lawnmower Man, but updated for modern graphics hardware. :) The audio is OK as well; I can only say \"OK\" because the game is so demanding of your attention that honestly I never had time to actually listen to the music. I did sample them from the pause screen, though, so I did notice they were pretty good.\n\nWhen I first started playing, the game seemed overly hard due to the (lack of) responsiveness of the character. To put it another way...you corner like a boat. A large boat...like a cruise ship. It's really frustrating in the beginning, because it feels unfair considering the speed that obstacles are coming at you. Hang in there, though; it [i]does[/i] get easier. Well, I mean, it never gets any easier but you get better at it. You'll learn that the secret is to anticipate what's coming, and already be ready to get into position. Technically that [i]is[/i] a minus in my book, since I don't like when a game requires you to have already played the level to beat it. Having said that, the game is fun enough that it's still worth it.  It occurs to me, after further thought, that perhaps a counter-argument to this would be that if the character [i]were[/i] that responsive, you'd constantly be flying off the map due to over-sensitivity.\n\nGetting all the achievements is a serious challenge. Now, getting [i]most[/i] of the achievements is relatively easy, once you've gotten good with controlling the character. But the last two (\"Marathon\" and \"Unbreakable\") are no joke, and \"Undying\" isn't a walk in the park either (although I did manage to get that one). That said, for those of you that judge games based on their difficulty (Super Meat Boy fans, etc.) shouldn't pick this up for a persistent, serious challenge because the bulk of the gameplay is...well, it's not what you'd call [i]easy[/i] but it's definitely not Super Meat Boy.\n\nFun game, and already one set of free content updates...good stuff!\n\n[h1]If you like this game, check out...[/h1]\n[list]\n  [*] [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/302610]Boson X[/url]\n  [*] [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/262390]Cloudbuilt[/url]\n  [*] [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/253290]FOTONICA[/url]\n  [*] [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/279920]Infinity Runner[/url]\n  [*] [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/17410]Mirror's Edge[/url]\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Review metadata[/h1]\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [th]Date of update[/th]\n    [th]Time played[/th]\n    [th]How far in base game (estimate)?[/th]\n    [th]Cost[/th]\n    [th]Cost per hour[/th]\n    [th]Notes[/th]\n  [/tr][tr]\n    [td]2014-05-10 00:00[/td]\n    [td]15.2 hours[/td]\n    [td]100% storyline complete, almost all achievements[/td]\n    [td]$3.99 USD[/td]\n    [td]$0.26 USD[/td]\n    [td]Initial review[/td]\n  [/tr][tr]\n    [td]2015-03-15 02:57[/td]\n    [td]15.2 hours[/td]\n    [td]100% storyline complete, almost all achievements[/td]\n    [td]$3.99 USD[/td]\n    [td]$0.26 USD[/td]\n    [td]Updated with new review format[/td]\n  [/tr][tr]\n    [td]2015-03-15 05:45[/td]\n    [td]15.2 hours[/td]\n    [td]100% storyline complete, almost all achievements[/td]\n    [td]$3.99 USD[/td]\n    [td]$0.26 USD[/td]\n    [td]Added suggestion for Boson X[/td]\n  [/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_updated": 1426416323, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1399755596, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "11708740", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505430", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1408067236, "steamid": "76561198070305672", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Good game, fun to play and very cheap.
