I think the developers ran out of time and/or funding to properly finish the game which would explain some frustrating gameplay elements and an overall weak story progression and endgame. Because on one hand, you have a game has really good animation, great atmosphere and an awesome soundtrack. BloodRayne Betrayal has some heart to it as well with its attention to detail and its ability to expand the BloodRayne lore. Heck, there's even a code that allows you to switch out the soundtrack to an 8-bit one!\n\nOn the other hand though, the controls and the combat definitely needed some more polish. Don't get me wrong, the game is a compentent and fun 2D brawler, but sadly, it is not the type that is easy to learn and hard to master. Sometimes, you try your best to survive the wave of enemies with great combos and no damage taken, but often the clunky execution of controls and enemy targeting make it impossible to do so. This is especially frustrating when it comes to platforming: you truly need some patience to get through some of the later chapters.\n\nFor the most time, however, the game works and it makes you feel awesome in the boots of Rayne. When the metal songs start to play, and your coffin rocket hits the ground, you kick out its door to slam nearby enemies. That moment right there encapsulates the essence of BloodRayne Betrayal, but I wish that feeling would have lasted way longer.\n\nIf you enjoyed games like the Shank series, do give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

I used to play Bloodrayne 2 on my playstation 2 console and it was soo much fun and I loved it. It feels like you are reading a comic book but its a game that looks like a comic book. The far your making it to the game, the harder it gets. Need a lot of skills to stay alive and beat the game. All my scores are F! But atleast I had fun playing it. At the chapter 10 - 13 I started to rage that I cant stop raging becasue It takes my back to the checkpoint and start the same hard spot all over again and it sucks so I rage quittet.\n\nI recomment to buy this game! It is soo much fun and its sometimes evil. 9/10!\nCharacter: 10/10 as always\nDifficult: Rage!\nFun: yes!\nGive up: For me yes but other players just keep playing.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1503505315, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503505315, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33973796", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498348", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500929461, "steamid": "76561198038743618", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "hahahahah, this game is trash. play a game with terrible  controls and mechanics. Beat a difficult level (all of them) and then get a grade scale that tells you that you played like trash.

You slide when you stop and go from stop to run with no speed inbetween.
