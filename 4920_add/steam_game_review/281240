So don't expect a game where you're roaming around and solving puzzles. However, the game adds some elements like items you need to dust/find in broken containers/behind burnable stuff. In other words, you'll have a lighter, an hammer and a brush to help you. Other items will need specific ones that will be used only in the scene. There is also a \"geocache\" object to discover, with a riddle describing it.\n\nWhile the game can be finished quickly, if you want a 100%, you're free to come back a second time in the scenes to find another list. It's a nice way to invite you to play it completely.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that some objects are little in size or so well hidden that you can't see them without a proper orientation of your screen.
