Rail Shooter\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Its trash\n\nReview: In the land of primitive 3D baghdad, a proud convoy of three vehicles with cell-shaded americans are ready to blow any and all opposition. Firing tank ordinance at a rate of one per second, with a tank turret that floats around at supersonic speed, but with a crosshair thats all wonked out and takes several seconds to catch up, you mow down rednecks in red plaid shirts carrying A.K.s as well as bank robbers in blue pyjamas and black masks. Once in a while some arabs sing arabic sounding songs, your vehicles get blown up by landmines or ennemy vehicles that just spawn right in your field of vision, and you transition to the next vehicle in the convoy. Reach the end of the road, which always goes in a straight line with no turns or crossroads or die first... Will you be up to the challenge?", "timestamp_updated": 1506063538, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493793663, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 22, "total_reviews": 36}}
