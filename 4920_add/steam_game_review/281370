The jumpscares happen so often I became desensitized to them. If you press tab and click you can finish this within an hour.(I left it open to get the cards) The \"puzzles\" are super easy save for one that made absolutely no sense. I was disliking this game within the first 5 mins, I played it through hoping it would get better. Nope. 1/10 giving it a 1 because there was one scene that did make me feel rather uneasy. uhg save your money and time. dont buy this.", "timestamp_updated": 1500924438, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500924438, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34587679", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501273", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504038143, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_games_owned": 4956, "num_reviews": 1973, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Tags: Clicker - Mindless\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Trash\n\nSupposed to be a horror game. You get one or two hotspots per screen and you spam right and left mouse buttons at them constantly to brute force the rigid scripting that gets you to waste time backtracking and clicking on things in weird orders. This will trigger cheap jump scares of various kinds mostly centered around morbid apparitions and fast moving shades. Some of them were very weak like ... a crow flying. The game also has puzzle elements. Such as stiching back together a newspaper article. The bounds of the puzzle screens are not defined and it is easy to cancel the completion while in the middle of it by moving your cursor out of bounds, especially when shuffling pieces about. The pieces did not all align until they locked and when they did they sometimes superimposed each other which should not be happening. All in all this is a rather mediocre experience that clutters the library without bringing any fear or entertainment.", "timestamp_updated": 1504038303, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504038303, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33575724", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.350065", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1420682266, "steamid": "76561198001736413", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "a black man walking towards you is infinitely more scary", "timestamp_updated": 1500175544, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500175544, "votes_down": 5}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 144, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 307, "total_reviews": 451}}
