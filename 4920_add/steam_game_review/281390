The graphics engine is unfortunatley not compatable and it makes the game nearly unplayable. Even with compatability settings. Google has failed to find any fixes before I refunded it.\n\nWhich is a shame because this game seemed like homeworld (A game I absolutley adore), with some interesting twists (Like how they handle mining, research, crew management, and espionage).\n\nI'm sure the game is good, just I don't know how to fix the compatibility issues.
