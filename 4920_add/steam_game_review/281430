Even for when this was released this has very tiny maps all linked together through arrow shortcuts and the whole thing becomes immediately disorienting, when you think games like Fallout came out in the same general time bracket (the original ones) you really start wondering if this much limitation was necessary. The combat was just hit and get hit. Character generation involved dice rolls and the portrait art was fairly old school. Voice acting tone in line with something you'd expect to see in the Disciples series. Brooding voices, grimy medieval people, talk of demons dividing clans. It would had been a great game to try back in the day, but I remember seeing it at the computer store on a demo computer back then and I was stuck in a house for the 30 minutes I played. Today, on launching the game, I was in the countryside and at least got to fight stuff and even received a quest but the gameplay became quickly tiresome. Its hard to understand if you are progressing experience/stats wise. It is also hard to see what the consequences are for dying since so far all that happened is I got restarted at beginning of level with all previously defeated monsters remaining slain. Except for fringe uses cases, nostalgic people and hoarders I think everyone should just ignore this title.", "timestamp_updated": 1503942372, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503942372, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 30, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 26, "total_reviews": 56}}
