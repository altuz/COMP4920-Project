Had some real pc monitor resolutions and game ran correctly. Not too thrilled by whats on offer. Cant seem to figure out what to do. Very aimless and clunky with cryptic and unexplained puzzles.\n\nOver the shoulder 3D engine point and click adventure game in the tradition of Gobl.i.i.ins. Cooperation between multiple characters, by having them combine inventory ressources and unique abilities that are unique to them. The game has no early plot hooks and the weird mix between dwarves, the forest, animals, trolls and ladybugs does not connect for me. The gameplay mostly involves trial and error brute forcing by clicking every ability on every conceivable hotspots, mostly to recover keys that allow further exploration and hopefully progression. The stiff and sudden camera shifts at abritrary points in the scenery are jarring. Still obeys fairly standard point and click user interface standards in the form of little hotspot icons next to each character portrait that you select and use on the environment. The further breakdown of actions between characters makes attempting simple trial and error solutions a multi step process with a lot of clicking taking the pacing of the game donw. Icons seem to have too small of a hotbox and the bottom one in particular is very hard to reach. Game is entirely without dialogue and communicates through icon bubbles. Game has aging 3D engine with lots of pixelation and is unpleasant.", "timestamp_updated": 1505085383, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502848750, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 11}}
