There's just something special missing from this game, that special something that made HW 1, Cataclysm, and even 2 so captivating. I'm sure that for me at least it has a lot to do with the vehicle designs. I loved how varied and exotic some of the ships were in the series, with form taking a pretty large precedent over function. DoK is inundated with very generic looking and forgettable unit designs, and they just are not satisfying to command or spectate in battle. I can understand this is partly due to the ground setting (the types of vehicles used that is) but the unoriginality in their aesthetics is so boring. That's what strikes me most: this game is boring. The AI can be routed with ease and forced into submission with simple tactics, and I never feel a real sense of challenge from the campaign. I honestly would only recommend picking DoK up on deep discount, and as a huge fan of the prior games please set your expectations a little lower.", "timestamp_updated": 1505251717, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505251717, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "35175099", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505423838, "steamid": "76561198081103893", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "YES, for the odd non-believers EVERY other Homeworld game had Tactical Pause, yes I see people arguing they didn't somehow as if you can't just play the games to check. That said IDK why it is so hard for the Devs to simply add a simple OPTION. That one tiny little check box in the game menu (that way those super cool hardcore \"true\" gamers could turn it off) would turn my thumb from down to up in a heartbeat.\n\n\"Why would it have that it's called an RTS\". The previous games were also concidered RTS. Here's why I believe it only makes sense to have one in a game like this. I, as the player, am actually taking on the role of many many people. I, as a human being with one brain, cannot simultaneously make 5 command decisions and carry them out within 1 second. Having the tactical pause allows me to role play as it were and put myself into each units pilot and make decisions for each as if I was in each unit for that second whereas otherwise I could not.\n\nOn top of that I LOVE the art design. I love zooming in on a unit and watch it fire or take hits or whatever. Without pause there simply is no time to appreciate anything. If you aren't fully zoomed out or even in tac map your gonna be screwed. This relegates you to looking at little dots. ???\n\nI simply can't understand how implementing the option could hurt anyone since you could just turn it off or just not use it. I'm not alone, do a google search and you'll see sooo many people are asking for this. If I thought it could be modded in I'd hope for that but can't see how that could be done then again I'm no coder and since the Devs have come on the forums and stubbornly persisted this mindset of making their customers unhappy for some stupid conviction...let's not forget the franchise is known for it. Then I won't help them sell it.\n\nSo, sorry favorite franchise of all time (pretty much) I can't recommend. BTW it's the only game I have ever done so. Sad.\n\nEdit: Oh and you can't re-bind keys. For a left-handed person this is almost deal breaker. Bought a keyboard which allows that but it's hardly ideal and sometimes doesn't work correctly.

Maybe it is not too hard if you are a modern-day fan of RTS and MOBA games, but the last time i played an RTS was Dune 2. I bought this because i heard the story was compelling. The cinematics gave me a really epic Dune-like feeling and made me want to jump back into the genre. Unfortunately real-time strategy games have massively changed since 1993.\n\nThere are a billion buttons and commands you can give your guys, and the enemies come in so ridiculously fast that by the time you have scrolled to the part of the screen where you can see them, your guys are dead. There is no mini-map. I guess you are supposed to set up hotkeys or macros or some nonsense, but for crying out loud. When i bought this i didn't expect to get some twitchy typing instructor. If you just want to watch a cool science fiction story with some simple, slow-paced base building in between, this is not the game for you.
