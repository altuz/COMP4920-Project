The first game had such a unique style and spin on the traditional idea of a strategy RPG that it was always going to be difficult to follow up with something that felt new and inspired.\n\nThere are a few new playable characters, and a couple new enemy types. But it's so largely a copy-and-paste of the first game that it was hard to get excited for the combat the same way I did with its predecessor.\n\nThe meta-game management system was also extremely frustrating this time around. You have no idea what decision will lead to a positive or negative or neutral outcome, so you're largely just guessing with each encounter. The first game seemed to make more logical sense in this department and not be nearly so random.\n\nThe story did move things forward, but it had that middle-entry-in-a-trilogy feel: the characters are moving from point A to point B, but almost nothing noteworthy actually happens. I also wasn't nearly as invested in the characters this time around.\n\nI played through number 1 a second time to make different decisions and get a repeat of the great experience I had playing. The biggest difference with 2 is that I had no desire to play any longer once I finished. The survival mode is the antithesis of what I wanted and a waste of development time: exploiting over-powered abilities and micro-managing the battle system, without a shred of story attached.\n\nI'm still interested in seeing things through to their conclusion, because the story is fundamentally interesting, but I'm hoping for a more fun, epic saga next time.", "timestamp_updated": 1505077273, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505077273, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "34763115", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502614", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504477700, "steamid": "76561198002217828", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great atmosphere, music and visuals.
