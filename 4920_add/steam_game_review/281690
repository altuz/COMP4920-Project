Crushing enemies while bringing balance to the world - Combine it with pms and you're unstoppable.\n\nLegend of Korra is a fast paced 3d fighting game. \nKorra loses her bending abilities in the beginning of the game, and thus must wander out to get them back while getting revenge on the man who blocked her powers. (Who isn't Amon of the Equalists). \nYou'll see the town covered in spirit vines, and you'll venture to the north-pole and in the spirit world. \nMeaning the story kinda takes place between book 1 & 2 in the series, but blends in a few core story-points.\nThe story is in that way original with an enemy independent from the series. \n\n[h1] Thumbs Up\t[/h1]\nI'm actually happy that the game blocks your bending, and introduces them to you through the game - Of course you'll miss just blowing away your enemies with a fire tornado, but it puts some dfficulty to the game - which still only takes 3-5 hours to complete on normal. \n\nThe combat consist of light/ heavy attack combinations, jump, dodging and block-counter attack. \nAfter the first playthrough you get to keep all your bending, and is essentialy where the game becomes really fun. \n- The combat mechanics works well, especially on a game pad. \n- The bending: Earth is slow but heavy damage dealing which stuns easier, water is focused on range, fire for quick hand2hand combat and air for large groups of enemies. - and you can change between them mid-combat with the mousewheel for instance. \n\nGamemode\nYou can play either casual or normal - unlocks extreme mode after - Extreme mode is a challenge, but where the best part of the game lies. - However be prepared to rage. \nPro-bending matches - Basicly your dodge/ block and spam-clicking bending competition\nYou also have the naga-runs inbetween, where you ride your polar bear dog in a jump & slide obstacle run. [spoiler]  (On extreme mode chapter 5, you get to fight 3 robots which will have you stuck for a few hours)\t[/spoiler]\n\nEnemies\nYou get to fight chi-blockers, robots, spirits and the final boss, who only is a challenge in extreme mode. \n\nThe music is well integreted in the game with that special Avatar-feel-alike vibe. However it gets repetitive.\n\nThe graphic is not that detailed, however the cartoonish artstyle compliments the series. \nThe best parts are the cutscenes ingame and after each chaptor, which kicks you back into the avatar-world-atmosphere.\n\nYou can pick and replay levels after unlocking them, even change their difficulties before relaunching. \n\n[h1] MY CABBAGES! Thumbs Down\t[/h1]\nThere aren't many options to configure its cell shading type, but it looks absolutely fine in my opinion. \nI don't recall having a windowed mode option, however I can't imagine it playable in a smaller window either.\n\nCombat\nIt will get repetitive. - The music aswell.\nAnd you can't combine air and fire into a fire-tornado. :(\n\nThey added a small animation for climbing ledges, but sometimes you might see Korra roll instead of pulling her up - Which is out of place, and a bit chunky.\nElse no \"Bugs\" experienced.\n\nThe story is not that memorable, and there's little character development unlike in the series. However I found it decently implemented in a fighting/ hack&slash game, which we musn't forget this is.  \n\n[h1] Closing Comments\t[/h1]\nAll in all a good game. \nVery short if you only play it once. - Normal mode took 4 hours, while Extreme mode took roughly 13 hours (I played Extreme through twice)\nIt would have been better with Aang - Korra scares me when she's angry. \n\nDie Cabbages!!", "timestamp_updated": 1504761634, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504761358, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35287273", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506715134, "steamid": "76561198028059459", "num_games_owned": 454, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I love the game because of the series and the last airbender, but it has a good enough story and it's more avatar.
