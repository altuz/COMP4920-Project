I mean, who wouldn't if they ended up buying a game for themselves? Unfortunately, I was disappointed in this. While the game looks nice and unique and has Norse mythology, there was basically no storytelling. All you do is rotate different parts of the terrain to reach the feathers. To me, some puzzles were easy, some even too easy, while the rest were too difficult to solve.\n\nIf there had been storytelling between the levels or during them, I wouldn't have stopped and asked for a refund before the first hour, but without a told reason for doing it it feels pointless, which is why I gave up on the hard levels so easily. This game has potential but without levels that are challenging but not too challenging, I can't recommend this.\n\nToo bad.", "timestamp_updated": 1503760401, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503760401, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 68, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 19, "total_reviews": 87}}
