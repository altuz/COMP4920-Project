And it definitely pays homage to this genre of games.\n\nYou can see that this game takes elements from classics such as Mega Man X, while still having an unique gameplay in the form of explosions. And those are used in a pretty nice way for both gameplay and stage hazards. You can use explosions to jump higher, move faster, lift objects and of course, annihilate the Aliens that are attacking the planet you were created. On that note though, there isn't really much of an interesting story but it is comedical nonetheless. Explodemon can also be seen as a fun character, because he is a bit sadistic when it comes to exploding.\n\nThe graphics aren't outstanding but they fit the game well. The music is pretty forgettable unfortunately. Also, this game isn't very long. It only has 12 stages which can be completed in a short amount of time. Fortunately, the customization of your Explodemon makes up for it, which comes in the form op upgrades. There are also various collectables and achievements, also coming with rankings at the end of each stage which counts for a nice amount of replayability.\n\nThis game brings back nostalgia to my SNES days and does it in a great way.

But then, when it's about precision, some moves feel immature, like the charge (run+explode). Some of the bonus-areas can be lost by exploding too close to a crate one could have needed. Back to checkpoint, try it again. Some checkpoints are chosen badly: You have to press through a dialogue you can speed up, but not abort. And finally, what pissed me off really hard was the leveldesign of the last world. There were parts, you had to die through to get an idea of how to finish them at all. Especially the last level before the last bossfight. Holy crap. Was this meant to be an homage to Boshy as well?\n\nI really liked the game from the descriptive content here on the storepage. And it began pretty laidback. But instead of becoming more difficult, it just became nasty and unfair in some places. When you have the feeling that it's not about your skill, but bad luck, it's bad.
