It takes maybe 20 minutes to complete, though I bet someone could do it in 5 minutes a second time through. Your interactivity with the game world is limited to walking forward and clicking on a small handful of items, like answering machines and doors. The story is entirely linear until the finale when you're presented with a series of choices, which I assume changes the ultimate outcome.\n\nSo since it's not much of a game in the traditional sense what we have left is the story, and it is an interesting one, albeit clumsy and brief. Without wanting to give too much away your character appears to be a 20-something party girl, and the story is a parable on alcoholism and memory, which is a refreshing change from the constant barrage of orcs and guns and blue haired lolitas that constitute much of gaming.\n\nSince Steam only offers a thumbs up or a thumbs down I'm not recommending it because it's just a little too sloppy in both story and gameplay for 5 bucks, but on a 5-star scale I'd put it more at a 2 or 2.5, worth a go if you find any of the aforementioned elements interesting.", "timestamp_updated": 1405101870, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405101870, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "11180905", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423493", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405101383, "steamid": "76561198043064273", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Exactly what I expected (and I only read the disclaimer on release day!).\nI like the cinematic atmosphere and the whole presentation.

Usually when the term \"short\" is used to define a game's length, it often means a few hours worth of gameplay, not breaking the half hour mark. Some demos for other similar indie games manage to surpass such a time limit and offer even more content. The game itself in my honest opinion isn't bad though it throws you into such odd situations without any consistency that you're basically left sitting there wondering how you ended up where you did. I'm aware that it's a narrative story and you're just in the shoes of Caroline and how she goes through this specific day but there's a lot to work with when it comes to such serious topics of impairment and death. \n\nYou're pretty much paying around 10 cents for every minute that passes with this game and for what it is as a whole, isn't worth it for any price tag.
