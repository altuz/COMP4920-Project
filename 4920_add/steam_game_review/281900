So for a bit over double the price you get a lot of extra assets!\n\nLike those other 2 packs, these assets are NOT meant to copy/paste 1 on 1 into your game (though the platform tiles would allow you to). You do need to put in some extra work to model them into what you want them to be and make the game look more 'your own' than just a cheap copy/paste result with assets that have been used in other games.\n\nCouple of (negative) comments on the pack though\n- Why on earth are there over 1500 assets of crystal gems that are all looking quite the same while it's only 13 different gems?\n- Why are there hammer parts in the weapon creation pack (good pack in general IMO) while there's no wooden stick to connect them to (can make it myself, but WHY?)\n- Why make icon packs and give them all different dimensions?\n- Why make an platform pack that feels incomplete (though in general is well made)\n\nAlso worth to note, the pack is NOT worth the default price of \u20ac135.
