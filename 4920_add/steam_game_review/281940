Level design feels kinda rushed\n\n- Unless youre good with a controller, the controls are likely to dissapoint\n\n- The story is pretty neat, but ungodly short. If you are a noob at these kind of games like I am, then you will finish the main story in about 2 hours. And thats it. Only thing left will be achievements, thats where most of my playtime went into.\n\nConclusion: Its deifnitely worth it if you get it on sale, but otherwise, too expensive for what you get overall.\n\nP.S. I found a video showing that there were other levels planed nad actually made, but they seem to be cut out. Dont know what happened to the devs, but the product here is definitely not what they planned and definitely not finished. The conclusion top still pretty much sums this up.", "timestamp_updated": 1505940238, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505782109, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 176, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 135, "total_reviews": 311}}
