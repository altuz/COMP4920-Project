I will be brief.\n\nSure, the game has lovely visuals and an exceptionnal soundtrack. Being able to genetically alter your species or fully customize every single ship of your fleet, every space station of your empire, was really interesting. Nevertheless, I can't give to this game a positive review, and here is why.\n\n-There is a cruel lack of micromanagement concerning colonies/planets. I'll explain. Every liveable planet is divided into a certain amount of squares. On each square, the player can chose to build a single building and allow a single unit of population to exploit said building. That's it : there is not much else that you can do. To be honest, I was expecting a bit more from a 4x revolving around galactical colonization...\n\n-Diplomacy with the AI is extremely flawed, not to say absent in the game. Apart from declaring a rivalry or war to another empire, interactions are scarce. Sure, you can, theoretically, trade ressources, science or informations with the neighborhood... but it is really unlikely to happen, since their acceptance of any treaty is determined by how much they like you. Since the most trifling action from your part (i.e. : refusing an offer) will seriously and often irreversibly anger them forever, non aggressive diplomacy is pointless. It was lacking features anyway...\n\n-The AI. The AI is overall unspeakably broken. Most of the time, your allies will build ships one after another and ... send them on by one against large ennemy fleets, untill complete destruction of their own fleet and exhaustion of their ressources. Do not waste time building alliances... You don't trust me? Just browse the Steam workshop and look for every mod that consists in a fix for the AI!\n\n-Combat. As soon as your fleet enters Combat mode, your admirals developp a \"brain\" of their own. Indeed, you can't give orders to your ships anymore : everything is administered by the AI until complete anihilation of one fleet or emergency FTL. For instance, you can't tell your fleet to focus down a particular ennemy ship (meaning that your fleet can just tickle an ennemy ship's shield a bit and then switch to another ship without dealing a single point of hull damage to the first one, and repeat, etc.). You can't order your fleet to back off a bit either (meaning that, if your high ranged ships get in range of low range ennemy artillery, your admiral will vaillantly (allbeit very recklessly) refuse to get out of ennemy's range. Thus, you cannot possibly take benefit from your fleet's high range weaponry). Such issues could be easily solved if Paradox was actually concerned about something else than DLCs...\n\n-General lack of content. Although military aspects are quite detailed, there's not much to do in the other domains. My friends and I, indeed, felt the need to deeply mod the game as soon as we finished our second playthrough. That's speaking by itself.\n\n-This emphasizes an other important problem : repetitiveness. After the first couple of hours, once you are in front of your opponents regarding technology and economy, every hour is pretty much the same as the last or the next one, every war is pretty much the same war. The \"endgame crisis\" fail to solve that problem. The Prethoryns often feel a bit weak and the Unbidden will simply erase you if they spawn near your imperial capital (yes, that can happen). Regarding the Awakened Fallen Empires, there is nothing a player or a coalition of players can do. Indeed, Paradox offset the flaws of their AI by absurdly buffin it. So, even if you manage to destroy the Awakened Empire's fleets (and that will take you some time), their civilization will remain a threat solely thanks to its bonuses.\n\n-More or less gamebreaking bugs. When (and I underline the \"when\") these issues are addressed, the fix is often put behind the paywall of the habitual absurdly costly Paradox's DLC. The list is far too big after 100+ hours to be developped here, but I will nevertheless take an example. If you take a planet located in a system where another empire (even if it is allied to tou) already owns a planet, the ressources of this system won't be exploitable, by neither of you. Let's say that you want to build a mine on a random asteroid to gain the minerals ? Ok : you'll have to declare war on your ally and conquer every other planet in this solar system. Pretty dumb, isn't it? And it's far from being the worst...\n\n\nAll in all, I was really hyped for Stellaris, and I still think that the game has great potential. Although, it is far too flawed in my eyes to be recommended in this state and at full price. It can get quite interesting once modded, but mods won't solve everything, and by the way they don't have to ! Finally, I firmly oppose Paradox's policy. Many of the abovementioned issues were indeed addressed in some of the DLC (i.e. : Leviathans). But here is the problem : it's a DLC.

It allows for endless stories to be formed around when, how, and who you are when you react to a situation. \nThe best part of this game is the community, both the players, modders, and developers are quite invested. Patches coming in often to respond to community request, a massive modding community (With overhaul mods for Star Wars, Star Trek, and more), and a large player base full of discussion about the game.

At least, Stellaris have good music and fine moddability. With mods it can be interesting to play with, although mods can't fix the roots.\n\nIf you are going to enjoy a SF strategy game but not modding yourself, I don't recommend Stellaris to you. Here are reasons.\n\n\n[h1]1. Warfare[/h1]\n\nWhen it comes to warfare, seldom any game can do worse than Stellaris.\n\nTo begin a war, you first pick some war demands with total value equal to or less than 100, then battle your enemy, and once you win, you will get a chance to force them to satisfy your demands picked before the war begins. You can never change your demands or add new demands, even if you have already entirely beat up the enemy empire. What's worse, there is a 10 year cool-down and is unbreakable, which means you will have to wait, just ****ing wait.\n\nWhat's that in reality? You first pick an excuse, then battle your enemy, and once you win, you will be able to make your demands. The warfare mechanic is not only unreasonable but also player-unfriendly, because you are expected to conquer only 3-4 planets per war, so it takes you 50-100 years to take down a tall empire or a large alliance. The later game is actually a waste of time.\n\nAnother outstanding defect is that your fleet can hardly do damage on planets. You have totally destroyed your enemy's fleet, you expect to take your reward. All you get is waste of time. The planetary bombardments can do nearly nothing more than decreasing it's fortification health. You must spend your time on preparing armies and then drop them onto the planet. Once you win the fleet battle, you win everything, but the game insist on taking you additional time. This point is also unreasonable & player-unfriendly.\n\n\n[h1]2. SF & Technology[/h1]\n\nThis game calls itself a SF strategy. What about it's SF part?\n\nTechnological advancement in reality is a key to power. However, in Stellaris, it's not. There is no generation gap in Stellaris. A tier 5 laser is just 2x power of tier 1 laser, making technological advancement useless. The only thing advanced components have is that they sounds great. You can't feel any sense of accomplishment while growing into a technologically advanced galactic empire, because you can't feel any power from your technologies.\n\nAll species are nearly the same. Seldom any unique features. Most of the portraits are just combining human with skins of animals and plants from our earth, they look just like those from the Chinese fantasy novel [i]Journey to the West[/i].\n\nAs a SF game, Stellaris has a poor sense of SF. More like a space opera.\n\n\n[h1]3. Game Strategy[/h1]\n\nThe game strategy is simple and boring, just take more and more planets and build more and more ships. Your power depends on the quality and quantity of your fleet. However, technological advancement can't give you that many advantage, so the best strategy is to increase your quantity. And where is quantity from? You need resources to increase your quantity, and your planets make up over 70% of your resource income. No matter if you play a conqueror or liberator-subjector-integrator, the base strategy never changes: to war, to conquer more planets. More ships for more planets, and more planets for more ships.\n\nStellaris have some solutions, however, they never solve the roots: the strategy is okay, but being boring is the fault. What's worse, the solutions made the game even more player-unfriendly, because the solutions are tall empire punishments. You get punished if you play a tall empire, and if you don't, you get punished by other tall empires, because this is the only strategy.\n\nYour technology and tradition cost is increased for every population unit and every planet you own. In addition, there is a direct control system cap, and you get harshly punished if your direct control systems exceed the cap. You will have to divide your empire into sectors to have AI governors help you managing your empire. While non-direct control systems can't be manually managed (they can since v1.8), AI governors play unskillfully and can drive you mad. Your game experience is totally broken apart.\n\n\n[h1]4. Paid DLC[/h1]\n\nI don't mind paying $40.00 for the game itself, but what about the DLC? Most of the DLC are something can be made by skilled modders and put into the workshop as a free content. What's worse, if you don't pay for the DLC, you can't enjoy the game, because the DLC features have creeped into the base game, while the most interesting part is not free. Why should we pay for an official mod or kinda hotfix?", "timestamp_updated": 1506944810, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506696154, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "35126923", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 48, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522246", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506178852, "steamid": "76561197971245216", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 228}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "The game works and I do not encounter any bugs. I have tried to play this game many times, but it infuriates me every time. Here is what happened to me in different sessions:\n\n- There are practically no minerals in my system and the (few!) surveied ones around me are TOTALLY empty. There are dense clusters of star systems further away and when I want to build an outpost there, it already belongs to some other empire (starting conditions)...\n- I develop my empire nicely, I encounter some ancient remenant species, they declare war on me about 5 years later and send 85.5k fleets against my 200 fleet.\n- Most of the time however I build a gigantic empire and make a ton of minerals and any other resources, my research is very advanced and some SHITTY little empire starts colonizing the planets at my borders and steals tons of space from me. So I declare war and guess what. Even though they are much smaller, their fleets are the same size as mine and of course they have the weapons and defense systems that counter mine perfectly. They destroy me! Where do they get the resources from? Where?! And this happens EVERY TIME I play for a longer period of time.\n\nThe combat system can also be very annoying, when enemy fleets keep hopping systems in order to avoid my fleets.\n\nTo me this game is broken. I don't know how other players can find enjoyment. Yes, the early and mid stage of the game may be interesting. That's why I kept playing it. But as soon, as it gets crowded and it's time for war, the AI cheating is unbearable. So I can't recommend this game. Go and play Endless Space 2. I enjoy that one much more. There I can actually successfully finish a session.", "timestamp_updated": 1506084151, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "7", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506084151, "votes_down": 38}, {"recommendationid": "35319169", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506732430, "steamid": "76561198162234689", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2293}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Not really big into 4X games, but it looked pretty interesting and I found it on a good sale, so I decided to give it a shot. I loved it at first. Make your own alien race and government and then explore the stars and expand your empire. You can put in all your favorite aliens from what ever scifi series you like. It's kind of fun to have Klingons on one side of you and the Asari on another. A cool part of exploration is to scan anomalies...the writing for these is great (writing overall, not so much). It makes all the little random events interesting and there were rarely any repeats. It almost felt like I was on Star Trek, listening to the crew explain the situation. Some of these turn into quest chains which is pretty cool..but it seems like you finish all that at the start of the game and nothing happens later, which is a bit of a let-down as anything past the early game bored me to death.\n\nColonization and planet management is not very deep, to my benefit, but to the dismay of some. It's basically a plot-building game. Some plots have base resources they give if worked, sometimes two different kinds. If you put a building on this plot that generates the same resource you get a bonus yield, but if you put a different building on there you lose the bonus. Some buildings have adjacency effects also. Besides base population growth, boosted by your food surplus, you can also migrate new workers or build robot workers to support a growing colony. Simple enough, you may decide \"Okay, I need to focus on getting food and power now, I can replace these later when I have set a solid foundation\", so it's not always set-it-and-forget-it, as I find myself visiting all of my colonies regularly to check and see what changes I need to make. You can set up AI-controlled sectors for your planets to lift some weight off your shoulders. I do this when I've got all the buildings set up and they just need to grow.\n\nCommunicating with other civilizations is..kind of bland and shallow. As they are static portraits and the writing is kind of generic, they don't really have any personality. It would have been cool if there were some sort of quest chains that allowed civilizations to talk to each other, but I haven't found anything like that. There are the basic things to do like sharing research agreements or allowing tourism or trading resources, and there are a number of modifiers that change their disposition of you. In the end it was a very boring and disappointing aspect of the game, and I spent barely any time actually doing any of these things because it felt like there wasn't really any incentive. I let most trades expire and never bothered talking to anyone again. It's not like Civ where you need to manage your income of luxury and strategic resources to receive city-wide bonuses or keep your armies repaired. Everything just felt weightless.\n\nThere are some gripes with basic things such as chaining commands or build queues. There's no way to push a build order up, and you can't queue when you haven't enough resources to make the thing. I just say \"oh, I have to wait a month to do that\" but I just forget to do what I wanted. Why not let me queue up everything I want to build? Or even let me CHANGE the queue...if you make a mistake in the order you have to cancel everything and do it all over again. Same for giving destinations for units. Cant go back an order, just have to chart everything out from the beginning.  Not a huge deal but little details like this annoyed me somewhat.\n\nSo it was pretty relaxing to just explore the stars and get planets I wanted. Early game I couldn't really build up a fleet because I had to send my corvettes out to make sure a system was safe for my scientists, but there are a lot of pirates and random enemy fleets that kill your covettes instantly. I can set my civilian ships to flee, but not my military?? So it took me a while to really build a military up, and as you do this you can customize all of your own ships! Name them what you want, give them a designation, swap out hull modules for different loadouts, customize their defensive and offensive slots, assign an admiral, pretty interesting and flavorful. Feels like there's a fair bit of strategy to this...I wonder what the combat is like!\n\nOh boy, that combat. By this point I was getting pretty bored, so I wanted to see what war was like. It took me forever to build my fleet up to the ship cap it gives you. I had the Vulcans and Turians on my side against the Wookies, Klingons, and Asari. It looks like they just put everything they have in one big fleet and send it around, so I followed suit because...if they are doing it you don't really have a choice do you? Even then my fleet strength was much smaller than some of their fleets, so I built past my cap to try and have the bigger number, but it just snowballs my economy downhill. Granted I am not experienced in this game, but I don't know what was expected of me.\n\nAnyway, two fleets finally collide...and..you don't really do anything? There's no commands to give..can't call somebody off if they are about to die. Can't really tell anyone to focus fire, or maneuver around, or...do ANYTHING. There's nothing, nothing but two numbers. Your fleet strength and theirs. The bigger number wins. And that means loser basically lost everything they had in the one decisive battle. At least it looks pretty when you watch it in slomo..? I don't know, guess that's all there was to that. I tried playing for a bit after...but..it just takes forever to build a fleet again, and I know I'm just going to lose it again, because even at my ship cap my fleet strength wasn't enough to win. I couldn't even surrender after losing a few planets and they clearly had me dominated.\n\nSo it was a cute game to relax and explore for the first few hours, but once a war starts and actually makes things interesting, I just lost all interest. There's no strategy to this whatsoever, just the bigger deathstack wins. A very disappointing outcome, just makes everything feel so cheap to me. Now that may come off sounding like a sore loser, but I am more bewildered than anything. Like...that was it? I thought a bit about games with space combat, like Rebel Galaxy, you can out-maneuver and mess with much larger ships as a little scoundrel vessel. Why not in Stellaris, maneuver your ships to stay out of an enemy's weapon range? Like kinetic weapons have a lower range then laser for example. No such ability to do this.\n\nOr in Star Wars Battlefront 2 you could focus on enemy frigates or systems on their flagship. Why not in Stellaris, destroy a shield generator or their targeting sensors or something? Because ships do have modules for bonuses like that.\n\nOr in another 4X game, Civ for example, an enemy may have a number advantage, it may have a technological advantage, but I can use the terrain and my own tactics to beat them. There is nothing in Stellaris that allows a lesser force to do much of anything against a superior one.

I need to make this point separate, cause this really strikes a nerve with me. Imagine if in EU4, aggressive expansion did NOT decay, and therefore coalitions never break up. That's basically what federations are in this game. If a player joins a federation with the AI, you will be flooded with vote requests on idiotic wars, most of which involve the AI giving away YOUR territory if they fuck up. The worst part about this is that in the later part of a xenophobe/miliarist game, 9 times out of 10 you will have the remaining AI all in a federation together, some members being of completely opposite ethics, just sitting there. I can understand enemies uniting against a common threat, the problem is they are united against you for the rest of the fucking game, and they don't even attempt to attack you.\n\nNow that that's out of my system, let me make my final point, which is overall lack of content. I wouldn't say the base game, or any of its DLCs are worth their price, the game should be maybe $20 max for the amount of content you receive.\n\nIn conclusion, I was really looking forward to Stellaris when it was first announced, as a fan of other Paradox games like Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis IV, but with the road this game is going down, in addition to the latest \"DLCs\" for CK2 and EU IV, I'm really starting to lose my patience with Paradox.\n\nDo not buy.", "timestamp_updated": 1506786081, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506786081, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35238926", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498189", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506829575, "steamid": "76561198012311858", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1934}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Game is fun on most aspect, but the war is idiotic.

For those that do read it all; thanks for reading; hope it helps. :)\n\nI bought this game shortly after it's launch; and now with over 300 hours of playtime, I think I can give a fair review of what I've experienced with it. Starting off; Stellaris can be a little overwhelming to new players; what with all the content that is offered. Between managing your individual planets and fleets to managing your empire and it's overall growth, things can start to get quite involved and you'll find the hours ticking away as if they were minutes as you delve into a playthru. While the vanillia game is great by itself; Stellaris really shines with the plethora of content mods that have been created by the community and distributed via the Workshop and you'll likely find yourself quickly adding mods that both enhance and further complicate (in terms of micromanagement or difficulty) things. With this in mind however, the game itself has included things like sectors and such that help to aleviate some of the tedium of mircromanaging everything, but you'll still spend a lot of time focusing on little things as you also work on the bigger glactic picture, which for someone like me, who enjoys the micromanaging; will make this game one you keep comming back to again and again.\n\nAt it's core; Stellaris is your typical 4x game; you build up planetary infarstructure; gather resources, build orbital stations for more resources; build a fleet to protect/attack and expand your territory. But it goes far beyond something like Sins of a Solar Empire does by adding politics and factions to the player's country that can have both positive and negative effects, it throws in random events that can be both a boon and a curse to your people, the interplay of your nation and the other nations around you can lead to great alliances and federations; it can also lead to great wars and total anniliation. Also; endgame events like the scourge; they can wipe the entire galaxy if not focused on early upon their arrival, seriously; these things add a sense of urgency to the endgame, have you been wiping out everything and taking the galaxy for yourself? Well better get ready to fight alone, have you been forming small alliances and are on the cusp of a fully-fledged federation? Time to get that set in stone and get your allies ready for the endtimes.\n\nLooking back at factions for a second, you might for instance have a starting civ that has the religous and militaristic traits; eventually a religous and militaristic faction forms within the government, being somebody who favors combat and expansion yourself; you embrace the militaristic faction, angering the religious faction to the point that they rebel, and now you have a civil war on your hands, in the middle of an expansionist war against a federation of 4 other civs around you. It's storys and elements like these that make Stellaris such a great 4x game; because it adds so much more to the equasion than just the basic build up -> fight -> build up or build up -> diplomacy -> build up cycle of most 4x titles.\n\nNow praise aside for a moment; lets look at my one major con to this title; Paradox's DLC for this title; or rather their DLC pricing.  The first DLC for Stellaris was the 'Plantoids' Pack; this minor content pack added a new species, new ship design and a few new random events. For $7.99 USD you get this pack....the problem is, community modders have been adding new species, ship designs and random event mods on the Workshop since launch....FOR FREE. Now I understand that Paradox is a game company and they should be paid for their work; but this DLC was, is and will always be worth nothing more than $2.50 tops. The $8 price tag on it is a money grab; plain and simple. 'Levithians' was the second DLC pack and it was fairly priced at $9.99; it added new content and was (to me) the first 'Actual' DLC, no complaints about that one; today's Synthetic Dawn is priced the same; and while I cant say whether or not it's fairly priced at the moment, I'll touch on it some in a moment.\n\nThe third DLC to Stellaris, the 'Utopia' DLC, is just plain mod theft. (and yes I understand that most if not all modding EULAs let game devs use mod content w/o the need to credit or pay modders, but while they made the software the modder did the work but I digress...) Lets look a little bit at Utopia, first off it added traditions and Unity/Unity Perks. These are new content and prior to Utopia there had been no (to my knowledge) mods that added this kind of mechanic; that adds another level of customization to your empire during gameplay, so Good on Paradox there for something new. Then it added megastructures and Advanced Governments. These catagories had been covered by several workshop mods long prior to Utopia, namily 'Megastructures' by TTFTCUTS & Nutsoman and 'Ethic&Government Rebuild' by petruxa. (and yes; there were many others that added or built off of or onto these mods as well; but these two were (at least to me) the most refined.) While Paradox did make various tweaks and little changes to Utopia's megastructures and governments, its clear that in regards to these major changes for the vanilia game; that mods were used as the backbone. Oh and Utopia is priced at $20 US...so I'm paying at least $10 for free mod content and another $10 for the Unity Tradition system...actually no I'm not; ever. Maybe I dont get that system but I get a plethora of other things for free from the Workshop by modders who create works for free; for the love of the game. I'f I'm going to pay anyone, it will be them.\n\nNow I said that I'd touch on today's release of Synthetic Dawn, and while I've not played it, on the surface it seems like a mix of the already, readily available AI civ mods on the workshop. I can't say for sure that it is; but it seems like they've just cobbled AI civ mods together and added in a few new random events; in which case, if that IS the case; stay away from it, you can get all the AI civ mods you need/want from the workshop; FOR FREE.\n\nSo in closing, Stellaris is a great game and with mods you'll keep coming back for more. But stay away from Utopia and Plantoids, they are money grabs for little content. Paradox has historically been bad on it's DLC pricing schemes, and sadly; stellaris is no exception. But Levithians is worth the cash, especially if you can get it on discount (like I did).\n\nTL:DR\nStellaris is a great game worth the buy/play, but stay away from the overpriced DLC that is Utopia and Plantoids (and maybe Synthetic Dawn) since they add little actual content that isn't readily available on the workshop for free.", "timestamp_updated": 1506028682, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506028682, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35197403", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505845", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507166472, "steamid": "76561198034741841", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 11279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3341}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "For damn near my entire life, I have been consuming Civilization games in every generation and iteration.
