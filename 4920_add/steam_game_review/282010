They kind of share some similiarties between each of them.\nIf you like adrenaline games such as Unreal Tournament, Quake or Duke Nukem, you may like this if it doesn't bother you to play using cars, and well, perhaps Postal 2? Same kind of mayhem but with cars instead, difference is, this game is pure quality.\n\n\nFu** yeah!/10   (9.5/.10)", "timestamp_updated": 1501196703, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501196703, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34315792", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499973", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1466939302, "steamid": "76561198067465939", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "lots of fun.\n\nfirst time i played it was on a pc with a pentium 1 processor and 8mb of ram.", "timestamp_updated": 1503006157, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503006157, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 34, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 41}}
