What makes this game good then:\n\n- Still pretty nice damage physics. Seriously. Game is nearly two decades old yet has dynamic deformation of cars, no premodeled damage. You can even split vehicles in half, at any angle..and yet even keep driving depending on how you got split. It's also cool how your driving is handicapped by getting damage. If your engine takes damage, car accelerates slower. If powertrain takes damage, your car will start braking randomly inadvertently. If your wheels get damage, they'll wobble and make your car lean constantly to the given side when driving and steering will become harder. If suspension takes damage, your car will steer randomly on it's own.\n\n- Crazy physics. Instant stop handbrake powerup? Works even in midair. Gravity is always like on moon. \n\n- Freedom. Go at your preferred pace, keeping timer from running out is not hard. Maps are large, with every area atleast potentially accessible. And every place pretty much has something in it, be it APO upgrades, powerups, lots of cash or whatever. Exploration potential to the maximum. Races are completable by either racing through the checkpoints, completing every lap (no need to stay on track and position doesn't matter) which while isn't the focus of game, is actually usually pretty fun since the tracks are just outlandish and interesting. Or, wreck every opponent. Last choice, most time-consuming and difficult to pull off is overrun every pedestrian and animal in the map.\n\n- Powerups. They add chaos, fun and variability a lot. Most hilarious timed one is the pinball mode where every movable object, if given enough a prod, launches into a rather unpredictable direction with great force. Yes, this includes every car too. In indoors, this powerup quickly claims many a driver. Then there is for example one that automatically electrocutes any living being in your proximity..on a certain map, the respawning of this powerup has MASSIVE quick and easy cash hoarding potential.\n\n- Variety of vehicles. In late game, it goes nuts. Combine, trucks, and then more everyday car types but adorned with all a manner of attachments for weaponization.\n\nWhat sucks:\n\nCars in average are sadly more race-bred in carma2, I really don't like that. Carma 1 had perfect theme and feel.\n\nPedestrian sounds are stock sfx..the male screams are especially cringy to hear over and over. While carma1 had great sounds for pedestrians.\n\nThe missions.", "timestamp_updated": 1503479220, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503005810, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33913119", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1455572067, "steamid": "76561198079155506", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Solid granite mother trucker!", "timestamp_updated": 1501445799, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501445799, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34561163", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504015841, "steamid": "76561197966554517", "num_games_owned": 695, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It was less than a year ago, the last time I played Carmageddon 2 all the way through. It was pretty amazing how much fun it still was, despite obviously showing (and feeling) it's age. If you haven't played Carmageddon 2 before, you probably shouldn't. The driving physics are absolute ***. The game is hell of floaty, the cars spin out of control at the slightest provocation, and most of the time races descend into you pushing overturned opponents around, trying to hit trees and buildings to make them explode.\n\nThe difficulty curve is horrible. Some of the races and challenges are ridiculously easy, while some of them are just absurdly difficult (the airport tower challenge springs to mind). Most of the cars are completely useless and a downgrade from the initial one, so there's no real reason to buy any cars before you get to the really big stuff. The soundtrack consists of like four songs, most of which are absolute classics like Aces High and 2 Minutes to Midnight, but there's STILL only four of them, and no way to add your own as far as I know.\n\nThe enjoyment one gets out of this game nowadays is mostly built on nostalgia and tolerance for shoddy game mechanics older folk like myself possess. But for people who used to play the hell out of this back in the late 90's, I'd say it's still absolutely worth the money and time. \n\nThe levels are as expansive and varied as you'd like. The car designs are also varied and interesting, if not exactly useful. There are tons of secrets to be found, and the meat and potatoes part of Carmageddon 2 is still there: the occasional cool moments. The funny things that happen when all the shoddy mechanics combine with the absurd powerups and levels to create the kind of chaotic fun times that few car games since Carmageddon 2 have managed.\n\nCarmageddon 2 is sort of like an old escort: hasn't exactly aged gracefully, but while it's age shows, it still knows many of the old tricks that made it famous; tricks that others have long since forgotten.", "timestamp_updated": 1503951055, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503951055, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 53, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 59}}
