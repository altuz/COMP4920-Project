Ever since that day, I have lived in the perpetual shadow of the inevitability of death, acutely aware of the fact that we are all racing towards oblivion with each passing day. \n\nBefore the episode, I was very much at peace with the fact that one day, I will die. As Roger Waters put it at the beginning of 'The Great Gig in the Sky', \"Why should I be afraid of death? There's no reason for it. Everyone has to go some time.\" That was, more of less, my prevailing attitude. \n\nSometimes, it's not so bad. I can put it at the back of my mind and just get on with things as normal. Other times, I feel like I'm constantly warding off a panic attack. Trying to fall asleep at night is the hardest part. With nothing to occupy my mind, my thoughts inevitably wander to places I'd rather them not go. I can only really fall asleep if I'm watching something on TV or YouTube. For years it's been wreaking absolute havoc on my sleeping pattern. \n\nWhy am I spilling my guts like this? Because SOMA has helped me a lot. In progressing through this game's plot, it deals with philosophical issues like of the nature of conciousness, personal identity and what it means to be alive. It forces you to make difficult decisions about how you relate to these issues, both in game, and in real life; You are made to reflect upon what you yourself would do if you were in the situations the protagonist, Simon, finds himself in. You end up discovering things about yourself that you never knew were there. That is the true beauty of SOMA.  \n\nTo say anything more is to give too much about the game away. I'm not yet back to my 100% serene, at peace self, yet. But each day, I get a little closer, and like I said, SOMA has helped me. It has helped me deal with the fact that I am just a hunk of organic tissue housing a series of thoughts, collectively making up a conciousness that will one day cease to exist. \n\nBecause of what this game has done for me, I cannot recommend it any higher to anyone who has trouble reconciling with just what it is to be. \n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506965318, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506965318, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34761560", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505688", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504570346, "steamid": "76561198023081169", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is quite fun and intruiging - the setting is unique and well though out.

Not sure if the title is based on the greek word about \"body\" but I can not find a better fitting title.\n\nPros:\n+ amazing depressing atmosphere, which is greated enhanced by the dialogs between the protagonist and Cathrine.\n+ story is unravelled beautifully and so effectively that leaves you a desire to continue only to learn what happened to the station and to the world in general. You start by visiting a doctor for a scan only to end up in a sub-water base not being able to understand what is going on.

This is a very memorable game, and for all the right reasons. For years, I've felt the last really good original science fiction story in a game was Portal 2.

It's dark, depressing, ominous, and in terms of gameplay, it's a walking simulator with a couple enemies thrown in the mix.

The former was surprisingly okay with me, despite being the sort of person that enjoys difficult, complex games. That's because I found the few enemy encounters more frustrating than fun, and because the story itself was engrossing, as were the levels with all their little details, making me just want to get back to exploring the creepy world I was in. In fact, this is one of the few cases where I would have enjoyed no enemy encounters, escape sequences and game-over state at all. They were a distraction, and an irritating one. You don't need to remove the monsters. Keep them there, moving around, staring at you, coming up close. That could have made for a better, far more unnerving experience than having them attack and kill you, just to reload and try this certain sequence again. \n\nThat's not to say this could have just been a book, and not only because of the exploration and environmental interaction - which was very pleasing. Like in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Frictional Games makes it very satisfying to explore, with a lot of interaction with the objects spread around the map. It doesn't sound much on paper, but being able to turn around everything you pick up, zoom in, zoom out, toss, pull cables, smoothly move in and out of a computer monitor in the game, these things make exploration much more enjoyable than usual. That's not the main hook, however. Without getting into details and spoilers, SOMA makes a smart union of video games and story. The story and ideas SOMA has wouldn't have worked well in other mediums. It being a video game, without third-person cutscenes, staying in a single, first-person perspective from beginning to end, is integral to this plot.\n\nI had little to no prior knowledge when I launched the game, just some vague headlines - horror, sci-fi, thought-provoking, story-heavy. It's not horror in a classic, grotesque zombie sense. It's spooky and eerie, with a very distinct and powerful atmosphere to it. More Alien: Isolation than The Evil Within. Everything was immensely mysterious and puzzling, and piecing the story together bit by bit was engaging. It's because that process was such a big part of the experience that I want to say the bare minimum about the plot and themes. Just describing them could spoil a bit. Its twists are impactful. I know, it's not too helpful as far as reviews go, but I can talk about how what I felt throughout it. \n\nFor a long while, I was just completely confused. Then I felt chilled, unnerved, uncomfortable, defensive, almost threatened by some of the ideas in the game, as they crawled out of the shadows to present themselves. Because I'm a small and self-centered man, incapable of being larger than life. At the end there was a mixture of sadness, pity and coldness, but mostly just troubled thoughts on what makes us human, consciousness, and purpose. I know how it is to read these grandiose sentences. I'm always wary of them, they sound pompous and self-important. But in this case, I doubt anyone could play through the whole game and not find themselves wondering about these things, because the ideas are straightforward, and made possible by the sci-fi setting. It's not exactly something that you can miss. \n\nThe game is centered around these questions, sometimes to a fault. There are a few moments of dialogue that were a bit on the nose. You could argue that it's just the characters themselves thinking out loud about some of the concepts, but to me it felt like the writers were pointlessly directing our thought process, which has a way of undermining the experience. Speaking of speaking, the voice acting throughout the game was strangely... chipper, almost unfazed, in this scary world. It's probably deliberate, due to what the characters have been through, but it still seemed a bit inappropriate for the protagonist at first. The final scene, however, had a brief and standout performance of bursting emotions that stuck with me, bringing out the best in the actors and convincing me that the casualness in their tone that came before was the director's choice.\n\nSome stories have a twist that feels like the climax of the game in some way (KOTOR), some have powerful moments and scenes that stay with you and make you tear up (TLOU). SOMA has its twists, and they are impactful, but they're more like a punch to the head than a punch to the gut, if that makes any sense? The game doesn't try to give you this single, wonderful, highlight moment that you'll carry on long after. There's no intricate web of events that you'll enjoy breaking down later. The revelations are rather straightforward, and they mostly make you think, after a brief, initial surprise. Some players will probably predict them beforehand. I don't think that takes away from the story however.
