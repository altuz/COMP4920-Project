In any case it follows the story of Gabriel's son and grandson. You will play as three different characters. Each character has unique abilities and has his own act. Expect backtracking, skill unlocks and collectables. The game was originally developed for handhelds I think and the graphics engine is obviously a step back. Why they opted for a cell shaded look in cutscenes only, is beyond me however.\n\nContrary to LoS 1 this game plays strictly on a 2D plane and to be honest that alleviates pretty much most of the issues with the first game, as weird as they may sound. The camera won't dick around, combat is more straight forward, blocking now actually works easier without constantly rolling and special abilities as well as combos are simpler to use and actually do make a difference.\n\nTraversing the terrain is relatively straight forward, once you got used to the wonky animations that make it seem like you've missed every jump. It's definitely not a shiny game and the story lacks emotion...hell, there's barely any story here anyway.\n\nI would get this for a discount, personally, but 12 bucks isn't insanely high for a 8-10 hour experience if you want to clear it all. Took me 8 hours on easy for 84% or so. Higher difficulties will certainly make combat more challenging (though most enemies aren't really dangerous and I'm not sure why the Y move (area attack) was included in the game other than for some combos which require it. You've also got access to a boss rush mode, once you finish the game and the bosses are actually pretty fun.", "timestamp_updated": 1504468099, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504468099, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33330483", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497888", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499393772, "steamid": "76561197977847272", "num_games_owned": 592, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I picked this up because I love Metroidvania games, the GBA and DS Castlevanias in particular.
