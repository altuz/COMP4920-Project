I purchased in the first pre-order and had been anxiously waiting for this game.\nI played during the Early Access, I kept up to date on all the developments, watched the dev streams, browsed the official forums, the works. I truly believed this was going to be the best rollercoaster tycoon game yet.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nI've patiently waited for the massive number of bugs, and just plain bad designs, to be fixed. But the last update Atari released was now over 4 months ago. They have given up on this product after sucking the money from the long the fans of this long beloved series.\n\nThe rollercoaster builder is pretty solid - and so it should be seeing as I believe it was the first feature they designed and the longest tweaked/fixed/improved feature for the entire development and release stages.\n\nThis is where the good news ends. The overall graphics are poor. The effects are poor. The sounds are poor. The \"bokeh\" effect (that was used by the promo screenshots extensively) broke after the second post-release update and they never bothered the fix it.\n\nPath placement is buggy, placing shops on paths is buggy. Setting staff zones is buggy. Deleting objects is buggy. (Hey guys, remember in the dev stream you said the mass-delete tool was in alpha and would be improved? You lied.)\n\nThe game comes with like 4 songs to choose from. You can't customize the colour of your rides. The guests glitch a lot. They walk through objects. They mostly walk around \"depressed.\" Their animations are poor.\n\nThere are no water rides. There are no dark rides. Light passes through pieces from the PxP builder so you can't make a dark room. You can't make dark rides. You can't build underground.\n\nThe water looks like jelly. The water placement and removal is super buggy. Be careful not to flood your whole park even with a milimeter of water or everything will bug out.\n\nI could go on, but there is no point.\nDon't buy this game. Don't give them your $5 or whatever stupid price they put on it.\n\nAtari, you killed RCT.", "timestamp_updated": 1506338024, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506338024, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35334322", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518133", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1490374503, "steamid": "76561198170326290", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Just buy PlanetCoaster", "timestamp_updated": 1506772647, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506772647, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34808239", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512820", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507187108, "steamid": "76561198072876269", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5431}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Keeps crashing, so many limited options, you place paths and the ground beneth it pokes through,,,", "timestamp_updated": 1504847327, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504847327, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34881493", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510443", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502174085, "steamid": "76561198050940195", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "After countless hours on the predecessors I figured I would try this one out despite the bad reviews.
