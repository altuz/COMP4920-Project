There are no complicated controls and functions that serve very little purpose(At least from my experience - this might differ for someone else) and has an adequate story for the price. There are very clearly defined character roles throughout, which I personally thought were well written and served a purpose. \n\nMy only complaint is the lack of control over the 'drift' of your ship and maneuverability, which often results in you crashing into a frigate, something which can result in your instant death depending on the ship you are piloting and the speed you are going at. \n\nOverall, though i've not played much of it so far, I would highly recommend this, especially at the sale price(69p at my time of writing - 02/08/17). Despite my current playtime, I could easily see myself finishing this. For reference I use a mouse and keyboard, not a joystick, and I have had no problems.", "timestamp_updated": 1501680416, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501680172, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33541932", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475557", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1491504732, "steamid": "76561198071348048", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Unimaginably poor, the control setup is complete chaos.
