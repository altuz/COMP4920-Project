This game is absolutely stunning. Fast paced, beautiful art style, intricate level design, and top notch audio. Seriously, in space no one can hear you scream, but you can definitely hear all of the sweet beats this game has. Altogether, this game is a great deal of fun.

I absolutely love it. I find everything about it great:\n\n-Going at high speeds through pulsars and gas giants and gaining even more speed\n-Dodging obstacles left and right and zipping through debris\n-The unique mechanic of being able to go from one side of the screen to the other\n-The variety in solar systems (Thier colors, debris, and art style)\n-Beautiful art style that is almost like a cartoon but is really quite amazing\n-The music in this game is absolutely amazing and fits it so well\n\nOne thing that  I'm really enjoying about this game is the humble story line. I find myself happy whenever a segment of narration is about to occur, not only because the voice acting is phenomenal, but because the story is emotional and interesting and I find myself wanted to know what Atley has to say about Harrison and his humanly ways.\n\nI think that one of the reasons I was compelled to purchase the game was because I am very into anything astronomy. I think that this game stimulated that passion in a Sci-Fi sort of way. It isn't realistic game and it obviously isn't meant to be but that is what makes it so enjoyable.\n\nI highly reccomend this game to just about everyone, especially if you enjoy fast paced Dodge' Em Up games although I'm not a huge Dodge Em' Up guy but I think this game is spectacular.\n\nThere is one and only one negative thing I have to say about this game, and that is the shortness. but other than that its amazing\n\nOnce again I recommend this game to anyone, Its reasonably priced and is so much fun.

I bought thinking it could be fun for a little while...\nAnd indeed, the game is fun, you fly, you die... you try to speed through debris, you die, you race, you die...\nWell, you die quite a lot in this game !\n\nBut outside of the gameplay, it's not what really caught me in the game, what caught me was the story of an unlikely friendship between man and machine ! \nThe story is told from the eyes of the machine yet you control the man who never say a single word by himself but you kind of grow fond of the probe following you and telling the story.\nIt's the only thing that made me finish the game so damn fast ! I always wanted to know what the little probe would tell about our journey together and our growing friendship... I got really attached to the probe and I was sad the game ended... I wish the probe would talk more than it does already because I felt the level was empty when there weren't any speech.\n\nThe voice actor is quite amazing, he does a really good job and this is what gave the game it's beauty and the will to go on to the very end.\n\nIn all, this is a pretty little gem for just 10euros (or your regional equivalent), gameplay is fast yet relaxing, there isn't too much content (story and time trials), the great music goes from calm and relaxing to a more upbeat rythm and the story is really well made yet not too consistent.\n\nThere is really nothing to be upset about this game, it delivers right what it promise and probably a little bit more than expected.", "timestamp_updated": 1431697713, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431697713, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "15963965", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "4.976143", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1432428197, "steamid": "76561197970685913", "num_games_owned": 1417, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Lost Orbit's a fun, twitchy dodge-em-up that sees a lone astronaut and his robot sidekick hurtling through space in search of a way home.

And whilst it may not sound like an attractive prospect, every time it happened I found myself immediately mashing the retry button without even a care - it's that sort of die-horribly/get-back-up-again gameplay loop that Super Meat Boy perfected. \n\nIt feels like a lot of love and care was poured into this game.
