These are my opinions. First of all, I recommend this game for people who like arcade quick platform action shooter mini games. This is a unique platformer action puzzle game with great physics and destructable levels. It kind of reminds me of Little Big Planet and Worm's games but without the strategic timer turns. I have played most of the levels, which we have access to at the moment. And can't wait to play them again. This game has replay value, great music and sounds. Most levels in Story mode can be accomplished in different ways. The level editor is amazing and simple to use. Many cool tools with a UI well implemented. In the level editor mode there is an option where you can test your map on the fly and press back button to continue editing your level. I like the control scheme in the level editor, very organized. Gameplay is fun and entertaining. The graphics are gorgeous and cartoon style. The special effects are beautiful. There are 4 character which you play with. Each character feels different and have there own abilities and special powers. Controls are responsive and intuitive.I play this game with an Xbox 360 controller. Game is playable, Fantastic price. But remember, the game is in early access and there are going to be bugs. \nHere's a view of Stage 2:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HmnGSvYh3s", "timestamp_updated": 1401582547, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1400289944, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "17423358", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502841", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1438915725, "steamid": "76561197993493533", "num_games_owned": 988, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The updates are practically non existant and in it's current state it is generally unplayable.
