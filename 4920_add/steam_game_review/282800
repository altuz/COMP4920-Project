Mario Party is actually a great example of how this game is build; compete with some friends (Or if you're short on those the AI will do too...)\n\nThe goal is to get the more stars than your opponents but also get to the final character 'level' first. It throws in some TCG esque booster pack DLC stuff to get more cards; and they're nice for players who want to get all possible ones (They have really nicely drawn art too.) It has a great OST that really fits the art style quite well. The OJ brand as a whole has lots of characters to love and with plenty of DLC at decent prices; you can't go wrong getting one or two.\n\n100% Orange Juice is very well designed game that would actually be cool to have in a physical copy; not so much as to play but more so to frame the cards. It's great that there is an option to buy a 4 Pack so you can play with friends and the DLC are all of the highest of quality.
