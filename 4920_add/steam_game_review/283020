I read the reviews and was very leery of getting this.  While it is in my wheel house (love hex turn based wargames), the reviews were NOT good.  But when it made it down to under $5, i says to myself why not......\nSo i get it, download it and start to play.  I made it exactly 1/100th of a turn.  I figured out how to move, moved 3 German units, destroyed 1 Polish unit with equal damage to my units......no personality, no hook to keep playing.  That's it, that's all.

It feels like a boardgame from the 70's without all the rolling of dice and math. It looks complicated, but you are really just moving troops around trying to surround, cut off supply, and all the good to do military tactical stuff.
