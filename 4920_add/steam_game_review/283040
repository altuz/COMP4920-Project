I always try to be sympathetic to indie devs, and I could overlook quite a few of these QoL  issues if there was a genuine sense of progression as one moved from one level to the next.  But the gameplay is such that you are for all intents and purposes playing the same level over and over.  The cosmetics change, but that's about it.  Without the gratification of becoming more powerful or gaining loot that really matters, it just feels like a Skinner box of futility.  \n\nA shame.  The concept has potential, but falls short in execution.  And it's not worth anything close to the regular asking price.", "timestamp_updated": 1493653649, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493653649, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 8, "total_reviews": 15}}
