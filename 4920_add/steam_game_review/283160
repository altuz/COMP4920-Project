I beat it in just over 2 and did replay several levels.\n\nI've got my fingers crossed for either additional levels, or opening the game up for the workshop to fill the void.

Well, its not like that.\nIts beautiful, very immersive, but people should understand that it's not just an action space-sim with short levels of 3h worth of content. The game is all about the challenge the levels provide on highter difficulties. Each level is a well crafted puzzle on a time limit. You have limited resources. Your opposition is numerous and ruthless. They must die. This will do.\nIf you arent into repeating the levels multiple times, trying to unravel the way of beating it in the most optimal way, on 3 different difficulties (that change the enemy fleet composition and reinforcements strenght) AND with a challenge of besting the enemy flagship, then this game might not be for you. The enjoyment is in struggle, in besting the superior foe, in enacting the Emperor's edict. \n Also this game has a minor fleet management, you got to load out and order around 7 ships (and 3 of them you can pilot) both from cockpit and from tactical view with tactical pause, and this strategy element is fully gamepad supported. You wont succeed on hight difficulty without telling your ships what to do and where to go.\nAudio in this game is superb: sound effects are very nice, music keeps your adrenaline hight; you can hear constant fleet chatter giving you their sitrep (their shield/armor status, target status etc. I dont even need to check the hud to tell how well my fleet is doing), battle chatter's done extremely well.\n There's a survival mode, that lets you play against waves of enemies of random composition and/or escorts. In this mode a fleet strategy is extremely important, for you cant get replacement capital ships. And i say its simply boring after a while, simply because its not hand crafted. I would rather have 3 hours of art of a game than 50 hours of procedurally generated boredom. \n The game is VR capable, it looks awesome in VR. On youtube because i dont have it lol.\n Tldr: Buy it if you want a challenge/immersive experience. Each level is very well made, everything placed there for a purpouse. But it is short, very condensed, for some it is repetitive (for me it was around 3h for the first run, i have 11h for 3 runs + survival and i would play more if i wasnt such a weakling to seriously try and get all flagships and beat all levels just with interceptors). Some people despise the idea of playing the same level again, even with vastly different enemies . And did i say that highter difficulties kick your teeth in? I think i just did. Do get on sale if you are looking for deep story/sandbox/on your own pace experience.\nPS. The ending was not what i expected.

Well, it's not, the gameplay itself is merely okay. Some things are done well like being able to turn and face your enemy while continuing to move on your original vector but overall it's missing something, the big fleet engagements just aren't fun like they are in games like X and Freelancer. And it gets repetitive very quickly.\n\nI think another major flaw is the mission structure, the missions objectives are almost always \"Destroy Target X\" with a few \"Escort\" missions sprinkled in. What makes these missions worse than similar missions in other space games is that you have a limited amount of time in the area of operations before the enemy flagship rocks up. Once the flagship has arrived you have wrap up quick and evac. I don't like time pressure in my games, I would like to be able to complete missions at my own pace.\n\nAnother thing I have to bring up is the lack of content. The missions are only small and there is not many of them. I have completed the entire campaign while having to redo multiple missions due to failing them and I have played with the challenge mode and all that took me less than 3 hours. The replayability isn't there at all, the challenge mode has a ridiculous \"kill ship to extend time in AO\" structure that doesn't make sense and isn't fun.\n\nAt first I didn't understand why this game has a \"Very Positive\" rating but then it dawned on me, it's a VR game and there is almost nothing to play in VR hence any semi-competent game will get rave reviews. If you have a VR setup, this game might give you a few hours of okayish gameplay, if you don't get something else, this game is poor value even with 50% off.", "timestamp_updated": 1504856631, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504856631, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "35078929", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499120", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1502447027, "steamid": "76561198052277680", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Way too short for the price, 3.2 hours for 1 complete playthrough.

Adding in some cinematics to lay down story beats at the start of the game and at various progression points would make this much better. Also their HOTAS support is bunk, I had to manually configure the game to put it into Saitek mode on every launch of the game, and the controls are very unintuitive compared to Elite Dangerous ao I had to remap some important keys (I think I also had to do that every launch but I can't remember at this point).
