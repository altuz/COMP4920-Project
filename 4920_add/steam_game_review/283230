This games story did not do this for me.\n\nI can't even recommend this as a platformer because in the story you are more or less told which way to platform and that's fine but making me undo things I didn't collect is an annoying concept, I strive for collecting all and I see this character going back missing half the stuff for the sake of what, challenge? Not for me personally but this is just an opinion based review here, nothing I've said reflects how much you'll enjoy the game (or won't) and my advice is get it on sale only.

You start the game and in the first 10 seconds you beat it. Now hear me out, this isn't the end. In this game you have to go back through the whole game and Un-beat every level. This game will require skill, memory, and unlearning all your regular platformer habits. I can not tell you how many times I instinctively killed an enemy, or collected a coin, just to create a time paradox and have to redo the level. My only complaint about this game is the length (The game including the bonus world only takes about 30-45 minutes). I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good platformer and it is definitely worth your money.\n\n\n7/10 Very fun and worth your money", "timestamp_updated": 1496346400, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496345380, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 93, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 59, "total_reviews": 152}}
