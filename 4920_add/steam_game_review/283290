'cause it uses things you won't get anymore from modern games like:\n\n[list]\n    [*]Great atmosphere with sounds to build up these even stronger.\n    [*]Real ingame time (every minute IS a real minute)\n    [*]You basically have nothing to do but waiting for the next day and kick the final boss butt (but you will need equipment and keys)\n    [*]Saving survivor grands you boosts and unlockable stuff like guns, health and ammonition.\n    [*]Random generated castle, you dont have a map but it anyway wouldn't help much.\n    [*]EVERY GUN find it use even the crapy old sword you find at the beginning (different enemies needs different weapons to take them down)\n    [*]Ammo that is already loaded will lost if you dont empty your gun and reload. (gives the game more Weapon management)\n    [*]You also can pickup guns multiple times and carry them. (carry 2 Revolver's or Rifle's)\n[/list]\n\nSo even when the game has it's mistakes i will never start hating it, the game use interessting ideas and actually made them working.\n\n\nThe game may be hard for beginners, not much introductions, rarely a way is lighted to mark where to go, many items are needed to continue throught the castle, you may will have no idea where to go and got problem with fights at the start, but give the game time, its worth it.

Imagine Realms of the Haunting collided with Pathologic and you more-or-less have it. The main hurdle is getting this to run on modern machines (helped by the widescreen patches, although they're not infallible), but once it's working, it's an adrenaline-fuelled, semi-randomised rush through a gothic castle, trying to rescue your various family members before their (fairly arbitrary) death-clock time-limits expire.

Overall a very unsettling experience, although most of it could be attributed to the aforementioned bad programming.\nCharacters will also die if you take too long exploring, creating a sense of urgency that may be offputting to some, or attractive to others. Although it does play into the story a bit, ie: the \"sacrificing someone by a certain time of the day\" trope.\n\nHowever, this game is not very well made.\nI've spent several agonizing minutes trapped in the furniture, or stray planks of wood, occasionally an opening door might push you into the wall, or into furniture.\nAny time you jump, your character jolts suddenly upon hitting the ground at any speed or height. It's extremely annoying, especially when you combine those two things in the thankfully infrequent platforming. Admittedly, there really isn't any platforming at all, but there is the rare occasion when you might try to cross a gap, or climb to a higher level by stepping on some thin planks. You'll see what I mean, especially if you find a way to get the revolver early, or try to climb out of the trapdoor in a certain vampire's room.\nThere is also the fact that most of the time when you climb onto a roof or onto a gently ascending/descending elevator, your character shakes uncontrollably, making any movement extremely stuttered. The way you slide down rooftops could be intentional, but I sort of doubt it.\nThe hitbox for enemies is for the most part fairly consistent, but it's incredibly difficult to determine exactly what the effective range is on most of your weapons.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I still consider Nosferatu to be a very fun and unique game, sort of a Return to Castle Wolfenstein mixed with a bit of Castlevania.\nIf that even means anything anymore.", "timestamp_updated": 1505622983, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505622983, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35449152", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507039657, "steamid": "76561198021800223", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 328}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I bought this for 0,99$ during sale and as much as it had few funny and entertaining moments,\nI don't recommend this game and here's why:\n\nNosferatu is the first person shooter where you have to find and rescue bunch of NPC's randomly hidden all around the castle.\nSome of NPC's can be slain before even finding them due time limit, but saving all of them is not required to finish the game itself.\nYou search for keys to access new areas and rescue NPC's for additional rewards such as items with passive bonus or new weapons. After finding/slain all of available NPC's, dawn starts and you can acces the final boss fight on top of the castle.\n\nThe main idea of this game is randomization of items, NPC's and enemies (yet locations, rooms and overall game progression stays the same) but randomization is in real time which means you can just save/reload save state to re-roll what is inside of room (items, enemies, NPC's) and chest reward (before you gonna open them) kinda ruining whole idea.\n\nThere is no any sort of in-game map and area layout is just beyond confusing. West Wing and bottom of the Castle are simple enough but East Wing and rest of the castle is gonna give you a headache. Not to mention that this game have way, way too many copy paste rooms with addition of auto closing doors behind you will make it even harder to remember what rooms you did already visit.\n\nGame engine is really broken. Visual bugs, flickering textures and weird artifacts all over this game, prerendered cutscenes, getting stuck on every objects, you slide on floor like on ice, sometimes even bounce of from stairs, walls and chests makes yout take fall damage quite often. This also applies to NPC's, which may couse their death at random point. Sometimes NPC may die for just standing still or if you move to far away from them. Quite often I died for no reason by just entering room and I still don't know why or how.\nEnemies can spawn when you revisit rooms, even behind you or on your eyes - getting even more cheap hits on you. Doors are closing itself constantly blocking enemies, allies or you. Heck, opening doors can even kill you at max health. Just instant death from being squashed by them at random points due engine error. Broken UI, mouse wheel changes weapon very slowly makes combat even more difficult. It will even sometimes say wrong number of ammo.\n\nGame mechanics are just beyond terrible: weapon reload sometimes work, sometimes doesn't, both enemies and ally NPC's will constatnly get stuck on everything or they will just straight block your way, sometimes forcing you to reload save state. Stamina that goes down really fast for just walking, running and melee combat may sounds like a good idea on paper but it gets annoying really fast, especially when you fight more than one enemy. \nHidden timer on life of few NPC's is forcing you to hurry up which combined with how stamina works, castle layout and game engine will give you huge, annoying problems while playing.\nAlso when timer will reach midnight enemies will start spawning like 3 times more often will drain your health and ammo really fast if you not hurry up.\n\nCombat is very simple yet broken. Enemies getting cheap shots on you when fighting with melee and range, can't even run away from them to reload your one shot musket because of how stamina works.\nEven weapons are broken: your first weapon available (fists) is one of the strongest weapons allowing you stunlock enemies until they die, Crucifix supposed to repel certain enemies but its sometimes work, sometimes not and Chalice is so strong that it kills any boss with one hit, including last finale boss.\nYou can pick up ammo and health when max yet this couse you to waste them.\nEnemies and bosses deal so much damage that you will die and reload save state quite often in this game, even on easy difficulty.\nYou can have up to 9 save states and you can save wherever you are but loading game may couse spawn of enemies right in front of you in the room.\n\nOverall game take less than 3 hours to finish.\n\nGame runs on very low resolution and there is no way to change that. Actually there is no options menu so you can't even change volume of SFX or music. \nEven keybinds aren't consistent as you can re-bind only half of them for some reason. \n\nFinal verdict: Honesly, this game really need a proper remaster. There is some potential but it's really buried under a pile of glitches and some serious annoying problems. \nIn short: this game didn't age well. I do recommend playing it only to fans of very old, clunky games and only on huge discount.
