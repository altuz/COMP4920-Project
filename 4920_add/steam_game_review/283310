Of course is very old school. Graphics are dated and controls are clumsy. Nevertheless, there are several mechanics that were pretty unique. There're plenty spells to learn and many are quite nice.   Combat is... interesting... Efficient way to fight, but not the most easy way to solve it, but guess by the time the game was released the whole techy stuff was just fine. \n\nThe story is good, a little hard to follow, but good enough. \n\nNow, I do recommend the game, but I must suggest it for very patient, hardcore retro-gamers. This game absolutely challenge your will. Run and run, round and round, back and forward, get lost and struggle to find your way... over and over again. The game doesn't hold your hand, many times you are left wondering: what did I miss this time? Why this thing is not working? Then you do realize you indeed missed something long ago or the stuff will work but much later. Yup, likely you gonna need to use a guide several times.\n\nAbout bugs, not many but some. The music never worked right for me. One or two times the game was irresponsive, not a big deal unless you forgot to save and remember: save very often. You die at any time and you won't even see it coming.\n\nAll in all, there are plenty things to do, several locations, many dialogs (mixed voice acting, some good actors, some rather pathetic), unique features and, well, art and grapics are sooo old that is kinda charming in a way.
