Zooloretto offers a fairly quick, semi-strategic game, with cute presentation.  It is perfect for children and those who enjoy a good, casual board game.  \n\nThe pros: quick easy games, with no setup; a moderately challenging AI; in-game challenges add to replayability; customized items and characters purchased with earned winnings; great \"together\" game to play with spouse and/or child.\n\nThe cons: AI is respectable, but not too difficult to manipulate; no online multiplayer (though this may not matter for some, like me); the soundtrack can get a little bit old after a while.\n\nFor $9.99, this game is a pretty decent deal, and almost anyone who enjoys board games will get their money's worth.
