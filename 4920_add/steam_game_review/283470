The puzzles are challenging enough that they will make you think a bit inorder to solve. And i like the overall designs of the people and environment. And the design for the \"secret weapon\" in particular was really awesome, but thats about where it ends.\n\nThere is very little to the story. direction is follow the little sparkles and arrows, and there is almost no dialogue while moving from one puzzle to another. I feel like there was supposed to be more after where it ended. The ending was so sudden and at a crucial turning point. I thought i had missed a trigger inorder to continue, but since there is zero backtracking in this game i would assume not. afterwards i was just left with unanswered questions. So much infact i wouldnt be surprised if this was made to be a two-part game, but there are no indications of this other than the sudden stop. [spoiler] Are we supposed to assume Abigail used the \"secret weapon\" to defeat her uncle? Where is he keeping her father and this undead army hidden? Also the story in general made me feel like someone took a bad fan-fic of the prologue to Hellsing the anime.[/spoiler]\n\nAs for the puzzles, yes they were challenging at first, but when you reuse the same puzzle with some different tiles, or make them a little longer, that is bad design. Also, many of the puzzles feel random and have little to do with their surroundings. There were some unique puzzles to this game and I feel like they could have done more with them to make them stand out.\n\nFinally, there is minimal amount of interacting with the environment. i think the most i had to do was use a key to unlock some doors and a screwdriver to unscrew a vent to find a key. some items you find in this game simply disappear, like the one that tells you how to navigate the catacombs (kinda important)\n\nAll in all this game made me feel lacking. There was so much more the devs could have done. it was if i asked for a ham sandwich and all i got was two pieces of bread. all filler and no flavor. I wish this company good luck in their future (relative since this game has existid since 2011) endevors but this game was just lack luster 4/10", "timestamp_updated": 1396333831, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1396333688, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "12089819", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517657", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1410643698, "steamid": "76561197970394792", "num_games_owned": 1834, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "There are a lot of really well made hidden object games available on steam.

The same objects are repeated a lot, many are misspelled or completely the wrong word for the object (clocks are called \"watches\" throughout). The other puzzles in the game are more of the same of the type of thing you see in these games and are often even repeated two or three times to pad things out a bit. \n\nIt's also (mercifully) very short but ends on...something?

I usually absolutely love hidden object games. This one, however, has multiple of one item (but you're only supposed to choose one and you have to pick the right one out of the multiple objects). In this case I was supposed to find clothespins. Well, there was a pair of clothespins holding up a cloth, but that wasn't the set of clothespins you were supposed to find, it was the bunch of them in a different place. There's also spelling errors because they didn't have enough space to write the entire item name. They shorten some words so that it could be one thing or something completely different. They are sometimes very specific on items (parasol and umbrella are separate).\n\nThere are also objects hidden almost completely behind something else to where you can only see a corner of it. Then some things are so blatanly obvious, you wonder why they put it there. \n\nThe puzzles are fun. I actually really enjoyed the puzzles part of this game. I haven't made it that far into the game, so I'm not sure if they'll keep changing or if they will just become longer versions of what has already been used, so I guess I have that to look forward to seeing. \n\nI wouldn't even waste my money on this game when it's on sale.
