This is really drawing me away from playing this game because I have to sit there for five minutes waiting for the game to actually start.\n\nMy Logitech G27 is barely compatible with this game. If I move the wheel to the left in 5 seconds then it actually takes 10 seconds for the wheel in the game to move making it hard to drive. This is one of my only bus games where my steering wheel doesn't work.\n\nOverall, don't buy this game, it is such a waste. Buy OMSI 2 instead, it is a much better bus simulator.\n\nUPDATE 1/23/2016: I've been trying to play this game and it doesn't work anymore.
