If you like trains, or basically the Berlin Subway, like me, you have to buy this! I wonder to myself on how I ever first found Berliner Underground. That actually came from a suggested video on YouTube. Autistic exploration is required for maximum enjoyment of this game, just like me! It's a fair price for a generally modern game. Not sure if it works on Mac... It's really tough to learn how to control the trains when you start for your first time, but you get used to it later. For that, I would recommend watching World Of Subways Vol 2 videos before your actual gameplay. Plus, about the trailer - In the beggining, it seems like a \"scary\" game, like Portal 2 (another game). But then, it's a tiny bit more interesting. When you play, and see the damaged or strange looking parts of the train tunnels, or any other interesting parts, that can really spike your senses for the game. The textures are so detailed and basically, every texture is correct! Every texture is exactly the real thing! Like, you tecnically reinvented Berliner U-Bahn! I also recommend that you could make a timetable for a route from Rathaus Spandau to Jakob-Kaiser-Platz, maybe. Except, there's no terminus area for it! The terminus is only for trains bound for Rathaus Spandau at Jakob-Kaiser. You know what else I want you to add to the game? A mode where you can ride the trains all around the subway line! To ALMOST sum it up, without this software, I'd be the most bored person in the world! Thanks for German people!!! C4 Engine, TML Studios, Aerosoft, THANKS SO MUCH!!!!! You have opened my imagination to the maximum! Speaking of that, I imagine that I realistically have an F90 and H01 trains (the two types of rolling stock trains in this game) right in my front and back yards of my house, AND I drive them around the yard! THAT'S how EPICALLY HUGE you've made my imagination grow! I could describe it much more, but I honestly don't even know how, REALLY!!! Anyway, it gets to be real fun and you'll never stop playing!

Unlike later World of Subways editions, this one provides no in-game help, and half the necessary keys aren't even configured! So the game can be a frustrating experience when you first start it. World of Subways 3 by contrast gives you a much better introduction with an in-game tutorial that takes you through the basics, and the new WOS 4 has a pretty thorough introductory tutorial as well. This game could have really used something like that. But if, like me, you're a first-time user, do take some time to read the manual, especially the sections on driving the trains and which keys do what, and configure the keys as well before starting in earnest.\n\nMoving on to the actual gameplay: you get to choose from two different trains: an older F90 and a newer H01. Of the two, I found the H01 much easier to drive. It's much more straightforward to regulate the maximum speed with the push of a button than fiddling with a lever as you have to do with the F90. The F90 just seems to require one or two extra steps in getting started and stopping as well. Of course, if you like more of a challenge, by all means pick the F90, but otherwise the H01 is more user-friendly for me.\n\nGraphics are great and performance is excellent. I have not experienced any major problems with this game in terms of lagging, crashes or what-have-you. One thing I find a little unfair is that the game penalises you for putting up the route monitor. Well I'm afraid I need that for the signals, which are very hard to see otherwise. And why provide that feature if you're going to penalise players for making use of it?\n\nOverall, this is a pretty cool game that is a decent simulation and performs well, but it doesn't cater very well to first-time users, unlike later WOS editions.

It all takes place underground.  You'll never see the light of day (play WOS3 -  London for daylight and weather).  If you've  never played a train sim, I wouldn't steer you away from WOS2, but it will be frustrating.  There is no tutorial  like TS or TZ and unless you read or understand German, (Youtube is no help, all reviews are in German) you're on you own.  After you configure/map the game controls to your liking, it just a matter of getting drive time before it all clicks and the sim becomes enjoyable.  For the current price I paid ($14.99) it gets my thumbs-up.  \n\nThere is a game manual in English and German.  It tells you a little history about the U7 Line and how to get the trains set up and moving.  It's very basic and learning to actually drive the trains is by trial and error.  It'll take about 1 to 2 hours for a novice and about 20 to 30 minutes for an experienced TS or TZ driver.  The graphics are very good and somewhat tweakable.  The audio effects aren't bad.
