I hear they're calling those \"Dark Souls-like\" nowadays. To be entirely fair, a game shouldn't just be judged based solely on what other games it resembles, and deserves a chance to prove itself on its own merits.\n\nJudged on gameplay alone, Salt and Sanctuary is absolutely worth the relatively modest price tag. The game world boasts a wide array of weapons and armor, many of which lend themselves to specific tactics and strategies for overcoming the varied and dangerous enemies that populate the treacherous world. Boss fights are fairly creative and varied, challenging in mostly the right ways and only annoying in a few minor ones. Characters do have oversized hit boxes, leading to a lot of incidental damage taken from attacks that appear to have missed, but after an initial adjustment period it becomes only a minor annoyance. While there are a few enemies which could have been better programmed or designed (the teleporting skeletons and foes who can launch homing attacks from off screen in particular), on the whole it's really pretty good. It even includes local multiplayer, which is a great and oft-neglected feature.\n\nAll right. Time to make the comparison.\n\nUnlike Dark Souls (and Bloodborne, another major influence), Salt and Sanctuary is probably only going to be entertaining for maybe two playthroughs. What makes Dark Souls addictive to me isn't the need to overcome the steep difficulty, gradually adding more and more insane and arbitrary handicaps until I'm finally trying to kill the hidden superboss armed with a tube sock and a bar of soap. That's just something incidental to the real appeal; what I notice in the details of the world that I hadn't seen previous. Catching subtle hints at the greater puzzle unraveling around me as I tread the now worn paths.\n\nThis is where Salt and Sanctuary kind of falls short; the story and the world that are presented are interesting and well crafted, but the delivery is incredibly linear. It tries to draw visually and thematically from real-world religions (again, much like Bloodborne), but doesn't really move past the superficial \"guts and gore\" sort of grotesquerie typical of a cheap horror comic. All of Salt and Sanctuary's best mysteries are eventually explained in perfectly clear english, usually in one or two sentences, and all of the other lore and storytelling concerning the world and the player's place therein are so much padding.\n\nSo definitely play it for the gameplay experience, the explorative adventure design, and if possible bring a friend with you! But understand going in that as much as it has to offer in and of itself, Salt and Sanctuary just doesn't tell as deep or compelling a story as the games it seems to be in tribute to.\n\nSeriously, though, still pretty good.", "timestamp_updated": 1505399767, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505399767, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34926261", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504902", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505257292, "steamid": "76561198052491613", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Salt and Sanctuary - a 2D, MetroidVania, Soul-inspired RPG - developed by Ska Studios... and with some outside help.\n\n1.

The [spoiler]island in S&S itself reminds me of Lost (2004 - 2010 TV-series).[/spoiler]\n\nJust like Dark Souls, the story of the game isn't really all that important. And also just like Dark Souls, the story and lore is visible in the items and character dialogue.\n\nThe Graphics are hand-drawn, 2D animation with creepyness to it\n\nGameplay is like CastleVania: Symphony of the night/Super Metroid... but more of an RPG focus.\n\nCombined together, salt and Sanctuary's combos is a match made in heaven. This game is great.\n\n[h1]2. PC Port.[/h1]\n\nSalt and Sanctuary's transition - from the PS4 to the PC - is handle very well, so much more better than Dark Souls 1's PC port.\n\n-Very stable Frame-rate... with adjustable resolution\n-Keyboard and Mouse support... with mappable keys\n-xbox controller support...alongside with PS4\n\nIt makes me happy to see developers, such as Ska Studios, making very good PC ports.\n\n\n[h1]3. Potential Sequel.[/h1]\n\nA handful of People have been asking and wondering if there will be a sequel... or something like that.\n\nYeah... sure. A sequel would be nice... but... Salt And Sanctuary is a great game. What more do you need to improve upon?\n\n-More brands?\n-medium-type armor?\n-secret Arts from Monster Hunter?\n-Switching the scenario from an [spoiler]Island[/spoiler] to Space?\n-switch from 2D to 3D?\n-VR?\n-motion controlls?\n-Switching your engine to the Crytek Engine?\n-over 9001 monster-types, weapon-types and classes?\n-Quick Time Events?\n\nJokes aside(haha). I can't think of anything else to improve other than small details: more classes, more bosses and more artistic details and such.\n\nLet's take Lords of the Fallen, as an example, that game screams out ''potential sequel''.\nWhen you play Lords of the Fallen, you can tell that that game is a warm-up for an upcoming and far superior sequel.\n\nBut Salt and Sanctuary... is a Natural-born masterpiece.\n\n[h1]4.

Unless it was dropped by a respawning mob, the game doesn't allow for you to re-obtain any item you sell off. Needed that fire resistant blacksmith outfit that you sold off because you didn't think you'd do light armor to defeat the Husk? Tough.\n\nThis is what ended my run in frustration this time around. I've tried this game in two long runs (20+ hours) and both times ended up getting frustrated with design decisions such as this. I won't be installing it again. Despite a ring of fire resistance, and my most fire-resistant heavy armor, the husk still burned me with it's attack for 150-200 per tick. It was unsurvivable. While I could dodge most of it...

You see, in the transition to 2D, a souls-esque clone must get a lot of things right but it's hard to do so. The movement must feel snappy and responsive to counter-balance the limited space one has in two dimensions; every death must feel like it was your fault (yours alone); and platforming must be solid. Now, I get it - this game is going for a \"metroidvania\" style and while I typically love those types of games, a lot here feels cheap. It borrows heavily from Dark Souls 1 in the essence that there is no hub, no teleportation...just shortcuts. I feel like this works much better in a 3D space whereby it is a lot easier to navigate due to your brain orienting itself a bit better - in this game, I constantly felt lost. I died so many times to some unfair mechanics (need to reach an enemy archer that's firing one arrow a second whilst platforming on tiny ledges which, if you fall, you die? Well that little arrow knocks you back midair and you're dead). i gues it's just the platforming that got to me - which I found the most unfair.

Items to upgrade your gear. Yada Yada. I was semi-ok with that. I mean its stupid, but once youre that strong you can just progress through up until end game items in a matter of an hour or 2 really.\n\nWhat im not ok with is certain Key's to open doors to bosses that you have to down in order to progress in the game not being available AT ALL for the \"player 2\" profile. I went back through on solo mode and a key item. (A key) is completely unavailable to me. Meaning i cant fight bosses. I cant progress the game. Just stuck. For no reason.
