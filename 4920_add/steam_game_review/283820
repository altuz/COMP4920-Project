This game is part of the trilogy \" The Tale of Alltynex \" composed of  the games: Kamui, Reflex and Alltynex Second. Kamui is considered one of the best shoot'em ups released for PC, something I have to agree, because the game is really great! Kamui's gameplay is heavily inspired by the games Rayforce, Raystorm and Raycrisis made by Taito  Corporation. In Kamui you have three types of weapons at your disposal: the front gun that can be upgraded;  the ray gun, seeking and hitting the enemy in the lower layers in relation to your ship and finally a powerful, concentrated shot that smashes the enemies, but that depends on an energy bar in a scheme similar to the classic R-Type. The game has a nice and fluid gameplay, very tasty and fun. The controls work very well with the Xbox 360 controller and the music is wonderful and very engaging! An excellent game that has my strong recommendation!

I had never heard of Kamui before, being a fan of shmups that is rather out of the loop on the world's favorite shooters. \nThe ship that the player pilots from start to finish in this game is, if I'm correct, a Kamui fighter: a powerful machine controlled by the daughter of the game's antagonist. The story of Kamui remains very simple throughout, with the game's beginning scene and ending credits being the only points of plot. I don't believe story is usually focused on much when it comes to shooters, but I do wish the plot was at least a bit more fleshed out. \n\nComing from 1999, Kamui's graphics are predictably not at all impressive by today's standards. The game shows its age in this aspect with its pixelated designs - it gives it somewhat of an arcade feeling (though I think its only current platform is Windows). None of this bothers me much, as the dated graphics work well as far as the gameplay goes. One of the most frustrating issues I tend to have with shooters is trying to distinguish just exactly what is going on at all times amidst the chaos. Nothing is worse than dying to one tiny bullet just because you couldn't see it very well, and were in the middle of focusing on something else. During my time with Kamui so far, I have never encountered this. I have been hit by small individual bullets; but they were bright yellow, and running into them was my fault. Overall, Kamui's colors are distinguishable and bright enough that it is easy enough to tell what is happening most of the time without them being distracting and looking out of place. \n\nAs far as sound goes, I really like Kamui's soundtrack. It is hard to focus on it while actually playing, but watching videos of this game gives a great opportunity to hear its music. It doesn't stand up to Ikaruga and Mushihimesama, in my opinion, but the tracks seem fitting and immersive with the game's action.\n\nThe best part of Kamui is, as with all great shmups, the gameplay. Along with movement and pausing, Kamui only makes use of two other buttons in its control scheme, keeping it simple but effective with the game's mechanics. One button is used to fire the main shot and the other is used to release lightning. Kamui uses, throughout the game, a two-plane system: enemies and objects are in either the foreground or the background, and may change planes. The only way to hit enemies in the background is to use the lightning system. A meter at the corner of the screen shows how much charge the lightning has, which will slowly fill on its own or will increase greatly in speed if the player holds down the lightning button. When a bolt destroys an enemy in the background, you will receive a score multiplier of up to x16 based on how full the meter was upon use. The amount of lightning to actually be released is based on a charge orb shown in front of the Kamui ship, which will grow when the lightning is not being used. The third weapon of the Kamui is used if both buttons are held at the same time, which results in a very powerful laser that will destroy most bullets it comes into contact with. This does effect the lightning meter, however: the blue meter will be pushed back until the laser's red meter depletes, limiting the score multiplier of the lightning. Correctly using these weapons is essential to surviving and scoring. Destroying enemy bullets with the laser will hurt your score if used too copiously, forcing you to think and time uses of each power. \nIf there's one thing that I really love about Kamui, it is its difficulty. Kamui is both forgiving and unforgiving, which is something that I usually cannot say about other shmups. There are three difficulties: easy, normal, and hard, each of which starts you with two lives and four bars of shield. Taking a hit will result in losing a piece of the shield, and will destroy the ship if it has no shield left. Taking a hit will also reduce a level of the ship's main shot, which is powered up by green drops from particular enemies throughout the stages, some of which also drop a blue power up that will give you an additional bar of shield. \nThe main part of Kamui that surprised me though: unlimited continues. This is one aspect of this game that makes it extremely enjoyable - I was actually able to play through the entire game on my first try. Of course, getting a game over will reset your score to zero, and very quickly my goal in the game became trying to score as high as I could. A very important part of scoring that I have yet to focus on is (I think it\u2019s called) deathlocking. Certain enemies that you\u2019ve killed in the foreground will have a few frames before they explode in which you can finish them off with lightning, allowing one to get a massively high score if used right.\n\nWith 3 hours put into the game as I write currently, the improvement I\u2019ve experienced has been very satisfying. I still haven\u2019t completed the game without a continue (on easy, too), but I\u2019ve gone down from 6 continues to 1 since my first play, and my highest score has grown from around 2.6 million to almost 11 million. To see such a jump is rewarding and motivational to keep playing the game and improving. I haven\u2019t had it for long, but I would definitely recommend Kamui to anyone that likes shmups, casual or not.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1432602043, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1432602043, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "14894430", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1426386444, "steamid": "76561198022107690", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Arguably the best of the trilogy of shmups mechanic-wise, Kamui is also absurdly short.
