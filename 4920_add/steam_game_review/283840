Very balanced difficulty and mechanics while having much tighter pacing and level design. Stages tended to drag on in Kamui and RefleX but you never get that feeling here.

The fully 3D graphics are understated but the game features excellent art direction and impressive effects in certain places. Music is an unabashed tribute to the iconic rocking themes of Hyakutaro Tsukumo from Technosoft fame. Highly recommended to anyone, not just genre fans.

One of my favorite moments is near the end of the game, where a sattelite is trying to blast the ship with a giant space laser. That's epic. The soundtrack is pretty good too. However, I do have a problem with how the game handles moments where the camera angle changes. The playing area won't change to accomadate the different camera angles, and this can screw the player over in certain sections (such as the stage 3 boss's final phase) because it's not clear where the boundary is. This can lead to the player bumping into an invisible wall while trying to dodge bullets, causing them to get killed.
