It is a wondrous passion project and beautiful homage to Sierra's classic Quest for Glory series. \n\nThe production values are what you'd expect from a professional release in every conceivable way. Players are treated to glorious 2D art, fully voiced charcaters with commendable performances, beautifully orchestrated score and superb writing, world building and overall game design.\n\nAnd it's what I'd call a 'full-length' adventure. So many point'n'clicks nowadays (especially free ones) are quite short, but Heroine's Quest took me 25 hours which provides ample opportunity to feel deeply immersed in its world. And of course there's 2 more character classes should I decide to play through again sometime down the track.\n\nI'm a point'n'click enthusiast from way back and the QfG series, particularly 1 & 4, was my very favourite. Heroine's Quest crafts an original story drawing on Norse mythology and takes all its design cues from the very best of QfG1 & 4, and I couldn't be more thrilled with the result. I dare to say that it's just as good as both of these classic games of the genre.", "timestamp_updated": 1485490675, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485490675, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29603435", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499102", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1438803628, "steamid": "76561198031529307", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "7/10 Like in the old days....", "timestamp_updated": 1485862277, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485862277, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29405646", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499102", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1485079153, "steamid": "76561198146840693", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 257, "playtime_forever": 912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "this looks (and feels) like it was made for DOS in 1995 or something.  really good", "timestamp_updated": 1485027667, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485027667, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "30241722", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423781", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1488293368, "steamid": "76561198013066581", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First of all, I don't find retro point and click games appealing to me, including this one.
