Slower paced and more focused on narrative. Well, it's not like it matters now because the game was released in 2014 and as of today, August 12th 2017, only two episodes have been released. Official announcements from the dev are nowhere to be seen and the game isn't going forward. If it ever gets finished, probably will take a few more years and it's not that good to make the wait worth it.", "timestamp_updated": 1502582418, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502582418, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 22, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 13, "total_reviews": 35}}
