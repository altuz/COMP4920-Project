I might not be a good competitor for racing simulators, but it keeps its title as one of the most realistic soft-body physics games ever to come to public release.\n\nThe physics in the game are insanely accurate and precise, you can replicate real-life crashes with surprisingly similar results.\n\nI would not really call this a game though... I would call it more like a Simulator, or Tool for soft-body physics.\nAgain, for the petrol-heads and car fans, this game can teach a lot on how a car works, both outside and inside. In this game you can answer those weird questions about cars that you had in your childhood. How does a driveshaft work? How does tire-pressure change handling, all of this you can try out here, on any road surface you like.\n\nAfter spending half of my \"precious\" life on the internet, you can see that there are a lot of unanswered questions about cars, and how they behave. Back then in my childhood I used to have Mythbusters running and watched them do these experiments, from which I asked more questions. Like as an example:\n\nA car travelling at its top speed hitting a wall head on! Yeah, you can find this safety footage stuff on the internet with cars going city speeds crashing to weirdly shaped obstacles. But what many of us want to see is... Destruction! And it's true!\n\nYou want to see how small you can crumble a van? BeamNG is for you!\n\nYou want to test how big of an engine you can put in a small 3-wheeled car? BeamNG is for you!\n\nWhat about a drag race between identical cars with different tire-pressures? BeamNG is for you!\n\nWant to replicate popular race crashes? BeamNG... Yeah, I think you got the idea now.\nIt is a great game with good balance in simulation and just having fun. You can not complain it to be too boring, because if that is so, it is not the fault of the game, it's the fault of your imagination. Because honestly? You can test pretty much anything related to vehicles in this game.\nEnjoy the game as much as you can, as there is lots of fun things to experiment with.", "timestamp_updated": 1506379117, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506379117, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34922792", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504898844, "steamid": "76561198236334368", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 7, "review": "IM MAD CAUSE THERE IS NO LANDROVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_updated": 1505320369, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505320369, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35324747", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507096035, "steamid": "76561198091118634", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1230}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Truely dynamic and amazing engine with endless possibliltys!\nI would recommned you buy this game as its only 24.99 dollars now in its early development.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506751655, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506751655, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35246055", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507077398, "steamid": "76561198062438694", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 106}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Such a fun driving game, Very realistic in terms of damage, handles and all that.
