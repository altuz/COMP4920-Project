At its core it's a platformer with (small-ish) sprawling, fully backtrackable levels (all the better to go hunt for any missing treasure) and lots of combat and exploration. The levels start out pretty linear but they start spread out as you unlock traversal abilities like wall-running, rolling and tall jumps (but weirdly enough, no double-jumping or dashes).\n I... guess that's a long-winded way of saying that yes, this is a metroidvania game.\n\n You play as one of three apprentices of varying skill with weapons and magic, which you can switch between in special rooms. They each have customizable equipment slots and unlockeable abilities - I actually needed to plan their builds for different bosses in my playthrough, and that's something I don't remember from other Metroidvania games, at least to this extent.\n Most of the combat is weapon-based. Magic is important, but unless you equip some very specific items the energy regeneration is so slow as to keep it supplementary. The game handles very well (except for Brent's Wall Jump) and doesn't overstay its welcome at a breezy five hours or so (for me, at least and  that's exploring every nook and cranny for secrets.)\n Finally there's a surprising amount of dialogue-based story to go through. The tone is unrelentingly goofy and even if the jokes don't always land, it remains likeable.", "timestamp_updated": 1500067151, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500067151, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 34, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 39}}
