Still not much more than 30 fps, and on a Radeon R9 290 it can run Witcher 3 at a higher framerate.  Either way, original review below:\n\nI saw the screenshots, figured it looked amusing, so I figured I might as well try it out.  I saw salinger06 had left a positive review, seemed like a relatively safe guess that it would be a good game.  Before even playing the game, I noticed that salinger06 had no other games on their account, so it was likely that the developers had set up a fake account to leave a review.  Who signs up to steam to buy just THIS game?  I noticed that user only has 1 friend, Avreus Culter.  I look at his account, and it's full of these \"simulator\" games from PlayWay, I find that suspicious since they have generally recieved horrible reviews.  Now today, Avreus has left a positive review on this game as well!  Hmm!  I click on his review, and there is one comment from seph.au stating \"Yet another dev or family of dev self review. \" Furthering my suspicion.\n\nNow, that aside, maybe the game is indeed fun, so just now I go and try it out.  My system specs:  AMD Phenom II quad core processor, Radeon 7970, 8GB DDR3.  I can play any game on the highest options, I usually hold back on antialiasing (I don't go above 4x on the latest games) but generally any game I can max it out and play it smooth as silk.  I boot up the game, max settings.  It loads and is extremely slow, like 5 frames per second.  I remember seeing people complain about \"Mining Simulator\" being rediculously poorly written and causing people to run it on lowest settings, so that's what I did, get out of the game and try everything on medium.  Same exact performance.  Hmm.  Okay, just for fun, I tried every option on the LOWEST settings...  It was marginally better, maybe 10 FPS, still completely unplayable.  But just to see what the game was like, I tried to struggle through a race.  The game engine is really bad.  There was little to no effort put into this game.  How a person could log more than an hour into it boggles my mind.  \n\nI wouldn't wish this game upon my worst enemies and I think the entire PlayWay catalog should be removed from Steam and those customers refunded if they wish.  This is a scam.\n\nEdit: Apparently someone has said that this game will run on nVidia GeForce graphics cards.  So if you have a Radeon, don't even consider it, if that's the case.  I literally can't play the game to log more time to give it an honest chance.", "timestamp_updated": 1448070146, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "34", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1394908665, "votes_down": 48}, {"recommendationid": "9541756", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 77, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521955", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1395107043, "steamid": "76561198119591291", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "I HATE IT.", "timestamp_updated": 1395154962, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1395154962, "votes_down": 33}, {"recommendationid": "16304385", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553389", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1434370409, "steamid": "76561198060083406", "num_games_owned": 2262, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 10, "review": "4 FPS on low quality with a I5 and 670 GTX , is that normal ?", "timestamp_updated": 1434016759, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1434016759, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "14504430", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536002", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1394871442, "steamid": "76561197985943650", "num_games_owned": 1667, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A bad version of Farming Simulator with 100% more lag!

There were also numerious spelling errors, which I can forgive since it is not an English developer.\nDespite all that, I started a career and entered my first race, and, simply put, I was not expecting the level of sheer incompetence in the driving. On my game controller, the left analog stick controlled throttle, brake AND steering, which was odd, so I chose to use a keyboard.\nMy rig can run GTAV at 1080p 60fps, and it was struggling with this game, which was alarming as it looked like a game from 2006. The game controlled HORRIBLY, and the AI seems to be arguably braindead. There was a point where a rival mounted my trailer somehow, with the lackluster physics engine enabling it to. \nThere are no engine noises, instead the pure lack of anything is filled with a really bad 'country' soundtrack, which I had definitely heard somewhere before.\nA game shouldn't be tedious to play, but halfway through the first race I just wanted it to stop, and that's not what you want from a game in the slightest.
