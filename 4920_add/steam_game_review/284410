You play as a young Viking boy going from island to island searching for the men of his village.  I really enjoyed playing this game despite its bugs and the very basic combat.\n\nI loved the Wind Waker art style, so to me this game was pure eye candy.  The performance is very impressive.  I do not have great gaming equipment (I'm looking at you Intel HD Graphics) but still I was able to play this game with high settings and even anti-aliasing without any slowdown in gameplay.   Unfortunately, the book-style cutscenes went to a crawl no matter the settings I chose, but I noticed that a single core was used at full capacity during those, while all of my cores were put to work during gameplay.  The music was also delightful and helped build the overall experience.\n\nIn my opinion, the developers have captured the spirit of what is an adventure game to begin with.  The locales are diverse and I always felt excitement when going to or exploring a new place.  New game mecanics are introduced throughout the entire game.  The combat is very basic though.  You wait for an opening, which for most enemies can be done by standing still with your shield raised, land a few blows and repeat.  However, it does not in any way prevent it from feeling as if on an adventure.  There are also some platforming elements.  Unlike in many Zelda titles, you can jump whenever you want.  Puzzle solving is also involved and often mixed with platforming.  I found it to be well executed.\n\nThe items you use, such as the weapons, can be picked up or crafted using ressources you acquire.  Ennemies do not respawn when killed, but ressources, spiders and noncritical items such as boxes do.  The state of puzzles and the items linked to them are saved.\n\nThere are some physics bugs.  I sometimes \"double-jump\" when near edges.  I also went a few times through a surface and got stuck when I was going too fast and/or arrived from the wrong angle.  I suggest duplicating your save file just in case something goes wrong.  The dialogs, while not animated, are fairly well written.  They are consistent in showing the personality of the protagonist as a kid with a sarcastic sense of humour determined to achieve his goals.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game!  The art style, the exploration and the general feeling of adventure kept me playing.  It is not without flaws, but then again they do not go against the spirit of the game.  I want to thank the developers for supporting Linux, you are awesome!  I finished the game in about 15 hours.  I tried to find every recipe and upgrade, but it looks like I still missed a few.  As a veteran Zelda player who aims to find everything when playing, this is actually a good sign.  I will come back to it shortly to find every secret. ;)", "timestamp_updated": 1479588764, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467611995, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "29351379", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505337", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1467575262, "steamid": "76561197992337739", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Tutorial goes on forever, combat is clunky, crafting feels wrong, and physics feel wrong at time.

I had to refund the game after 2.5 hours or so because I came across 2 game-breaking bugs that stopped me from progressing, coupled with a few bugged quests/objectives.\n\nThat coupled with a fairly clunky and awkward combat system, meant I needed a refund.\n\nHowever, I think my experience with those bugs weren't the norm.\n\nSo the positive: it's a cute, colourful and interesting little game. You can easily get 20 hours out of the story (based on friends who have completed it), the dialogue is top notch and it really feels like playing an old PS1 type platformer (reminded me of Spyro in a lot of ways).\n\nSo I would recommend to pick this up overall, for the sale price. I'll always remember the game, even with not being able to complete much of it. And if you get the same issues, that's why there's refunds.\n\nBut overall the game needs more attention paid to it, and more people picking it up, the devs did a great job.", "timestamp_updated": 1467048066, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467048066, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "23972173", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501523", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1471924236, "steamid": "76561198008056060", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "5 hours in and I'm really enjoying the game. Feels much like Zelda the Windwaker in some aspects, such as the cel-shaded graphics and the boat travel. One thing to keep in mind...its not Zelda. For one it does not have near the large scale world Zelda has. Its open world that is for sure, but once you get to playing it you will realize quickly that it is sort of on rails with a story.\n\n I see how people are over and over saying how bad the combat is. I don't find it too bad now that I'm used to it. It is a bit clunky that is for sure, but I perfer using steath attacks which seems to be more effective than head to head combat. Combat isn't really the biggest part of the game. Its more about the puzzle solving and level design, both of which are the key features of the game that really shine. The crafting system plays a large role in puzzle solving. The only problem with this is that items degrade over time which is kind of annoying.....like when your sword explodes in the middle of battle and you have to run away and craft a new one.  The physics system actually is really cool, but its not with out its Garry's modish bugs.  Its not perfect but its for sure worth trying!

I imagine if I backed this, I'd be kinda disappointed.\n\nIt's so hard to put it into words.. it's good, but it lacks polish. It also could use more refined controls. Really, if you didn't move so slow, the game might be twice as good. I find myself rolling all the time, and feeling like that's still slow.. it feels like it takes longer than it should to get anywhere, and the jumps even feel like you're kinda floating a bit.\n\nI think all the elements for a good game are here, but the controls could use some tightening, and it could use some more polish in general.\n\n1. Combat feels unfinished with lock-on not facing you towards the enemy, making it annoying to block and do the sort of movements of walking forward and back as you strike that this style of combat system was designed for.\n2. Even facing them, it's easy to get hit while blocking, or standing too close for blocking to help.\n3. More nitpicky, but the lock-on is unclear; all it does is face the camera, with no clear retina over the enemy; nothing but a cursor change. But if there's any message to my review that I want to get across, it's that small tweaks like these would do worlds of good for this game.\n4. Movement feels slow. While that's not a bad thing on its own, once again, the game is based on established mechanics where the player wants to get across spaces fairly quickly. You shouldn't have time to look around your room getting distracted because it takes two minutes to cross the island.\n5. Some villagers you can talk to don't have the button prompt, while some who don't talk once you've exhausted their options do. Another nitpicky point, but again, just a small bit of sloppiness..\n6. Normally you expect both an in-game pause menu and a main menu.. that being said it was over halfway into my playtime before I figured out that you can switch from the main menu into quest prompts and so on. Just feels unclear, and is out of the norm for most games so I just thought there was ONLY a main menu. In fact, I still don't know what those other menus are, because as a player, I was done once I found the quest prompts. I was planning on critiquing the lack of a minimap or even a regular map until it occoured to me that the map may be in there.\n7. I had trouble picking items up. As a player, and as the game is designed very much like Windwaker, I expect to hit the button near an item to pick it up. But you have to have the cursor over the item you want to pick up.. and since equipable items tend to be smaller and blend in with clutter, this means you have to stop and spend a few moments aiming to pick up your sword you dropped because you needed a torch. The crafting system and abundance of supplies make this negligible since you can easily just craft more, but as a player it is incredibly frustrating to have the game be that particular about picking things up, when such precision is completely unnecessary and you just need the character to pick up the closest thing.\n\nI will likely have more to say after I played it some more, but as clunky as it feels, I just can't sit down and give it that time in one go. I want to like it more, but it took me an hour to complete side-quests and open up the other half of the island. While I didn't at first, I figured out the island layout fairly quickly, and where I was going most of the time; that's just how long it took to run from one place to the next and doing what was needed for about four things.\n\nThe map size feels good, while unpolished the platforming and level design is fine, you just move.. so slow..\n\nThat's why the thumbs-up is tentative. I like it, I want to enjoy it more, but there's more things than I probably noticed in one play session dragging it down. I am glad to have it, but this game needs more work, and I would probably respect it a lot less if I didn't know a few things about game development. But as it stands, exploration and combat are 80% of this game, and both have flaws keeping them from feeling solid. It's close, the systems they need are all there, but it just needs more work to feel right.\n\nSo.. I tentatively say that it's good, but should be treated as \"early access\" level quality, and probably not worth the full price as it is now.", "timestamp_updated": 1482690931, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1482690828, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "22753899", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478413", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1462244568, "steamid": "76561198014832701", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I have only just made my way to the raft building.

For example, combat is much less important over all, and many hostile situations can be navigated by sneaking, utilizing the environment, or simply running away.
