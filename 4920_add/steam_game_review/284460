It just so happened to go on sale last week for 75% off so for $2.50. It reminded me of a platforming portal-esque game (and I love portal) so for $2.50 it was a no brainer. Pretty challenging but not in a rage inducing way but I was having fun with it for about 2 hours until they threw in gravity switching. For me this game mechanic just ruined the entire experience. In my opinion I think it was an unecessary addition to an already challenging game. Throwing the gravity switching in to the mix left me disoriented and unsure of what to do next. This would be almost bearable but, of course, the gravity is on a timer which makes things even worse. I know a lot of people didn't mind this gameplay element but it ruined the game for me. That said I can't not recommend it, especially if you can get it on sale. Just be aware that this mechanic may throw you off.", "timestamp_updated": 1505836688, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505836688, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35163722", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501686", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1477917240, "steamid": "76561198254970834", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Entertaining for a few hours but then it just gets too hard and frustrating.\nNot worth the money!", "timestamp_updated": 1506200200, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506200200, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 669, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 105, "total_reviews": 774}}
