Game was boring as a result. \n\nMeant to be played multiplayer. The menu did not offer any obvious local co op option and the online has to be dead. The 3D is firmly tablet grade but has real resolution options and looked half decent given that vague over the top fifties sci fi vibe. Unfortunately the combat mechanics are a floaty hit and get hit affair, the Xbox360 pad was not working even after selecting it in the appropriate menu, without controllers local co op is out the window anyway. The game seemed aimed at young boys age 8-12 given the family friendly kiddish tone and the rather neutered insect and Zamb foes. I am assuming you can upgrade your turrets and build a small base as you farm spawns.
