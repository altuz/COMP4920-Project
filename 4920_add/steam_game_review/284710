The world felt like it took place in BioShock. The atmosphere was fine, the graphics were nice. The puzzles were good, but the hidden object games were too easy (and they were lagging for me during the bonus content). Also, I couldn't always see the reasons behind them. For example, [spoiler]during the bonus, I had to find something, which is okay. But the guy's wife was kidnapped, I thought he would be in a hurry, he only had to grab some small thing, not to paint a plank red, just because the item list told him so. Anyway, he didn't have to use that plank at all, but at least it was painted red. Yay, I guess. Good reason to keep his wife waiting. [/spoiler]The soundtrack is repetitive after a time. The jump scares were a bit lame, the plot showed nothing new, but it wasn't bad, I just didn't care about anyone. All in all, the game is not good or bad, just simply meh.

There's a decent attempt at a story that's actually fairly interesting. It borrows a LOT of elements from Bioshock, especially in the aesthetic, as well as Lovecraft. The story and jump scares were all fairly predictable but it was fun nonetheless. The voice acting and dialog are really bad though to the point where it can be pretty funny. The animation and visual design were really appealing, but rips off many better things. Overall, though, pretty good game. I bought it on sale recently and probably wouldn't buy it for the full listed price. It's definitely not a $10 game, but if you can get it on sale, I'd recommend it.", "timestamp_updated": 1500439627, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500439541, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 126, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 13, "total_reviews": 139}}
