Watch as you get dragged into a supernatural world where you need to solve the mysteries and return to the normal world without letting the evil escape!\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n\u203a The art is great.\n\u203a achievemnts are moslty easy to achieve.\n\u203a the story is great.\n\u203a Pretty good length.\n[h1]Negatives:[/h1]\n\u203a Some items in the seek and find scenes are very easy to pick out.\n\u203a The art is great, but the human models don't match up super well.\n[h1]Community Items:[/h1]\n\u203a The normal badges and foil badge are very well done!\n\u203a The emoticons are half and half some cartoony and others quite creepy, but overall the art for them is great.\n\u203a Even if you hated the game the backgrounds from this game are amazing! None of them are out of place and they are all pretty creepy.\n\n[b]Do I recommend this game?[/b]\nThis game ticks every box for me and is one of the few games like this I would recommend to people who dislike this type of game.
