Its a mix between a hiden object and a point and click adventure. While the animations etc are technically simplistic. The package comes off with an enjoyable execution that feels higher standard than you would expect. If you are looking for a decent and very casual point and click game with a story. This is a good choice. Just be forwarned that the structure of all these games are pretty similar so I would recommend playing one that has the theme you like. Secondly, this series with \"Nightmare\" etc are mainly focused at females. So you, if your a guy that is, might feel you are taking a bit of a \"backseat\" on stuff you would usually do in other games, being \"the Man\" and all, I mean. :D", "timestamp_updated": 1500336435, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500336435, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34635779", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503319369, "steamid": "76561197974105367", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "prettier animations. good looking art style. puzzles are neither to hard nor to easy. relaxing game with an ok story. also the cutscenes look much better than in the first one.", "timestamp_updated": 1504190743, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504190743, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 95, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 100}}
