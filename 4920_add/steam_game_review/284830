I have to admit, this developer has changed my opinion on hidden object games in general because their titles consistently manage to combine an engaging story with puzzles that are challenging but not taxing or tedious, quality artwork, and music and voice acting that suit the story well. Clockwork Tales delivers, and is probably one of my favorites in this genre.\n\nI really like the Steampunk aesthetic, personally, so I thought it worked nicely into the format of a hidden object game. The bad guys here are militaristic fanatics with suspiciously German-sounding accents, so it's pretty obvious what imagery they were trying to evoke, but (pseudo-)Nazis blend well with the Steampunk style.  I was amused by the effort to include a bit of a science/geology theme in some of the puzzles and in the story, and I also appreciated that (like several of the other AM games I have played) the protagonist of the story was female.\n\nClockwork Tales is not terribly difficult or long, and the game probably lacks much replay value, It's still pretty entertaining and I enjoyed the few hours I spent playing. The achievements can be won in just a few hours of casual gameplay, so if that's your thing, then this is your game. It's also a family-friendly game as most of the puzzles aren't too difficult and the theme isn't very scary.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1415402614, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1415402614, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "9961453", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 56, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578038", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1399558652, "steamid": "76561197999732661", "num_games_owned": 2214, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "I've played a handful of Artifex Mundi's hidden object games, and I think this may be my favorite one yet.  Based on a popular series of Polish children's books, Clockwork Tales is an imaginative, fun, curious and enjoyable title who's emphasis is more on casual adventure than hidden objects. Set in a steampunk version of the 1700's, you play Evangeline Glass, an intelligent young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to the brilliant Dr. Ink.  With the help of Ink's clockwork companion, Matthew the bird, you must save Hochwald and the doctor from the machinations of the evil Grand Engineer Barber.  \n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about hidden object games is the beautiful and imaginative artwork many have, and this game is no exception.  Everything, including the characters, have a hand-painted look which gives it a storybook-like quality. Even the characters share the art style, which looks so much better than the oddly rendered/animated 3D models in other games.  \n\nThe game play is your standard IHOG/HOPA, adventure game lite with hidden object scenes mixed in. I always play on Expert to give me a bit of challenge and lengthen my game play, but I found Clockwork Tales to be quite easy, even more so than most games in the genre. This isn't a horrible thing, but considering how much I enjoyed the world that was created, I wanted to spend a lot more time there than a mere 3 hours on the hardest difficulty. Even so, the adventure aspect was very fun with nothing jumping out as being crazy illogical, and the many puzzles were moderately challenging despite most being reused from previous games.  One nice touch was being able to utilize Matthew to collect out of reach items and perform certain tasks.  Most of these aren't too hard to figure out, but it's a nice bit of flavor added to a genre that is very \"cut and paste\" in most gameplay aspects.\n\nThe hidden object scenes are very well done, nicely drawn items without too much clutter, and have a nice range of difficulty, but none of the items were what I would consider unfairly hidden.  Mixed in amongst your standard HOS's are a few FROGs (fragmented object scenes), adding a bit of variety to the gameplay. I noticed, however, that the regular HOS's tend to get more plentiful the further you progress through the game. This wasn't an issue for me as I really like them, but not everyone shares that sentiment.  For those who do not, the number of these scenes are quite low overall compared to other games.\n\nWhile the setting is one of the best parts of the game, the story in the beginning feels a little rushed and can be a bit confusing.  But once things get going and you move out of the village into the castle, the storytelling smooths out quite a bit.  There are no dark, disturbing themes here (unlike so many others in the genre), and the story isn't deep by any means, but that doesn't detract from it's enjoyability.  This is a game that can be enjoyed by anyone but makes a particularly good family game, especially for parents who are looking for less macabre fair to share with their kids.\n\nOne of my biggest issues in previous games from this developer has been the voice acting, but Clockwork Tales is a vast improvement overall, especially with the main characters.  Now I'm not saying these are award winning performances, but they're not jarring nor do they sound out of place given the material, and they don't pull me out of the experience as they would in other games.  Funny enough, the one game in which I find the voice work to be pleasant enough is the one in which we get a toggle for the voiceovers.  The option is still appreciated and I hope we continue seeing it in the future.\n\nThis is the Collector's Edition of the game and comes with the bonus chapter (a short prequel to the main story), replayable puzzles and hidden object scenes, wallpapers, soundtrack and collectible \"steambugs\" that are sprinkled throughout the game.  I'm usually not big on having to find additional hidden items in these types of games, but the steambugs were a treat.  Aside from their imaginative and adorable designs, they're generally not too hard to spot, although it may take you a couple of play throughs to find a few you missed.    \n\nAll in all, I enjoyed Clockwork Tales immensely and am only disappointed in it's short length.  But the little time that I spent in the game world was time I completely enjoyed.  I will definitely come back to this one again and again.", "timestamp_updated": 1398696098, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1398689419, "votes_down": 10}, {"recommendationid": "17910870", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 41, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565832", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1441498167, "steamid": "76561198139328230", "num_games_owned": 1770, "num_reviews": 210, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have to admit that [i]Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink[/i] went and snatched the first place among my favorite Artifex Mundi games so far. I wonder why I haven't played this earlier. I knew I was getting myself a satisfactory HOG when I bought this, but I had no idea that I'll be having this grand a deal in HOG genre!\n\nIn a fictional steampunk version of 1700 Prussia, we take the role of Evangeline Glass; Dr. Ink's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and engineer extraordinaire. We hit the road to meet with the good doctor in Hochwald, part of Habsburg Monarchy at the time, on a letter that we receive from him earlier. Dr. Ink has been making a research on the alarmingly raising number of earthquakes that were dominating the area. He claims that he has proof that a corruption in local authority is responsible: General Engineer is abusing a dangerous machine to create these earthquakes and he should be stopped at once!\n\nAt this point, we all know what kind of game that we should be expecting from Artifex Mundi: beautiful artwork, genuine animations, charming setting, and a curious story. Above all our common expectations, [i]Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink[/i] covers a narration and a period so dark, yet envelops it with fair music and an atmosphere straight out of fables. The marriage of Austrian culture with Enlightenment science gives birth to this amazing game. As a personal favorite, I couldn't avoid to mention the puzzle of Saints during the bonus chapter, which is a direct example of this marriage. Did I mention the artwork? I know I'm trying my chance, but even the achievements interface itself is an artwork, made of stain glass!\n\nGameplay is ordinary, yet the adventure elements of assembling machines are fairly imaginative. There aren't many HOG scenes, rather FROG - fragmented object game - scenes dominating this particular game. There is little to no backtracking, and a full functioning map. Puzzles are the kind that we are used to by now. As a change, in this particular adventure, we have the luxury of utilizing Matthew, a mechanical crow that we send out to gather items out of our reach, which spices the gameplay a bit up. We are also entitled to enjoy a bonus chapter at the end, to experience Dr. Ink's short adventure before Evangeline's arrival. The game is pretty short, being 5 hours or so with the bonus chapter.\n\nOnce I've completed the bonus chapter, I wholeheartedly wished there would be a series of Clockwork Tales games. I usually prefer downright fantasy or at least mythological elements in storylines, but [i]Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink[/i] is an elegant exception that I'll let myself be enthusiastic about. As a side note, I'm in love with the steam machine crow named Matthew!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_updated": 1456331802, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "7", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441541696, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "15484767", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532133", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1429524785, "steamid": "76561198142270848", "num_games_owned": 1103, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Ok..I really don't bother with doing a review with most games..Kind of like \"If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all\"  which was the way I was raised..But anyways......This game is so worth my time to give you feed back..It's one of my fav's far as HOG's go...Which by the way saves me, cuz I play alot of strategy games which can sort of melt your mind in higher levels, so it's nice to have the laid back feel of a HOG!...This has a pretty good story..but where this shines is the voice acting and puzzles, add this to very nice graphic's and you got a winner!..So from one HOG lover to another, this is not a let down (even if you pay full price)..Hope you enjoy it as much as I have, CHEERS ;-)", "timestamp_updated": 1429665269, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429665269, "votes_down": 10}, {"recommendationid": "9931098", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520165", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1399933889, "steamid": "76561198003590466", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "An interesting game of finding objects/ adventure (point and click).

There are a few manipulation puzzles and some hidden object puzzles, and they're all fairly small and well integrated into the storyline: for example, with the hidden objects, you are always looking for something (or parts to something) that you'll need to progress in the storyline. I especially liked the dollhouse puzzle: 4 puppets in a dollhouse are looking for pairs of objects, and once you find the objects, you see a small animation where the dolls actually use them - very satisfying.\n\nThe storyline has voiceovers, the hints do not: I'd recommend the game for anyone age 6 and up if they can read or have someone who can help them if they get stuck (but with the hint system, that should hardly happen). Also, if you ever wanted your very own steambug collection or find the recipe for the Steam Horse drink (\"I'd give up my helmet for a Steam Horse!\"), this game might be for you.\n\nThe included bonus prequel is about an hour, with the professor in the village using the bits that you could look at, but not use, in the main game.\n\nSome small gripes like light beams colliding instead of passing through each other or minor inaccuracies in the \"evil German\" grammar (the German subtitles are very well written!) do not detract from an overall experience that is well crafted, even if it doesn't reach the scope or the immersiveness of a \"big\" adventure like [i]Machinarium[/i].", "timestamp_updated": 1398503909, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1398499584, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "19820283", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518164", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1403458169, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "num_games_owned": 2213, "num_reviews": 352, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Evangeline Glass is called by her friend, Dr. Ink, to the city of Hochwald, after a series of earthquakes threatening the region are detected.

Yeah, true, the plot is enjoyable and I don't mind the steampunk world, rarely visited in HO. But it doesn't have the same magic that goes with the other titles.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is still the same: puzzles, hidden objects, etc.. Here, you'll have also a little companion, a mechanical bird, that can find stuff out of your reach. It's a nice addition.\n\nWhat I loved the most in the game is the soldier's design. I loved the uniform, maybe because it's kinda making me think to Darth Vader or the Combines.

All of the necessary elements are here: sweeping fantasy, maniac evildoers, pipes and leathers and conspicuous gearing, airships and monocles and florid facial hair, evil robots and mechanical tinkery.  What's missing is the kind of lucid, engrossing gameplay I like to see from Artifex Mundi. Instead, this game feels forced and vague. \n\nIt's not bad. I just like my Artifex games to stand tall over the competition, and this one is more of a shoulder-to-shoulder proposition. I hit all of the achievements here in a single play-through, and didn't find much in the way of detail and nuance. The various mechanical insects to spot and collect are barely concealed at all, the hidden object scenes are pretty but blunt, and the mini-games are on the bland, simple side. The main challenges are pretty much announced as flat tasks - \"I need to paint this room blue before I'll be allowed to leave,\" that sort of thing. \"Where have I seen blue paint? Maybe I should make some.\" I don't necessarily love game-stopping difficulty levels, but slipping too far in the other direction doesn't make for engaging play.  \n\nMaybe I'm just burning out on the genre; certainly most HOGs are cast from similar molds, and perhaps I'm just overwhelmed by the constant selection of games right now.

The story is fairly standard fair.

There is a cat in Ink's Story (the bonus episode). You give him catnip. \n\nThis game is exactly what you'd expect from Artifex Mundi-  an entertaining story, fun puzzles, some funny references, and some cute animals throughout! (Wish there had been more of the latter, alas) I enjoyed this game- and there were bugs (hence the achievement \"Too Many Legs\", but they were all mechanical, so I will not complain). Matthew, you're mechanical bird helper, is adorable, and helps out in some silly, but altogether needed ways. \n\nThe game is overall easy, and doesn't take long to complete, which may be a selling point to some. It has a fun story, and interesting characters- one of which sings \"Soft Kitty\" from The Big Bang Theory- huh? All in all, I definately recommend this game! My only gripe (and again, this is a game with robot creepy crawlies) is that at one point I had to throw a snowball at an innocent, bystanding owl. Not cool, Artifex, not cool. Other than that devastating act of wildlife abuse, I was delighted in the overall gameplay.\n\nJust another reason I will always trust in Artifex Mundi!
