Is it the best story telling? No, but I enjoyed it depite the predictability. I think that my 8 year old neice would really enjoy the story though as although it isn't spooky, it isn't babyish. I might wait another year / check with her mum before allowing her to play though as you see a murder victim's body - it isn't graphic or gory but it's still a subject matter that the parents should agree on beforehand. \n\nI bought a few of these games when they were reduced on sale, I'm not sure I would pay full price for them (they seem to be about \u00a36 normally) but for \u00a32 on sale?
