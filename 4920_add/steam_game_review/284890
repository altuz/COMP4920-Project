So there's your typical 'point and click adventure game'-style gameplay where you collect items and use them on objects in the game world in order to advance. And then there's a lot of puzzle-solving, including the genre's typical 'hidden objects puzzles' (HOP) that show you a scene cluttered with objects and require you to spot specific items in that scene.\n\nThe HOPs are 'old school' in that they require you to just find and click on the items listed at the bottom of the screen (whereas newer HOGs mix it up a bit by requiring you to combine items or use one item on another to acquire the hidden object). But [i]Left in the Dark: No One on Board[/i]'s HOPs are of great quality, finding that golden mean between requiring the player to go pixel hunting and placing the 'hidden' objects so plainly in sight that no searching is required and the player doesn't feel challenged at all.\n\nThe other puzzles of [i]Left in the Dark: No One on Board[/i] are very decent. If you're looking for puzzles that'll have you stumped for hours, this isn't your game. But most puzzles do offer a challenge and will require some thinking to solve them, at least.\n\nAs is typical for HOGs, you can select a difficulty mode for [i]Left in the Dark: No One on Board[/i] that determines whether interactable spots in the game are highlighted from time to time, or not. The difficulty mode also determines how often you can use a 'hint' if you're stuck in the game or in a HOP, and whether or not you can skip a puzzle entirely.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nYou play an unnamed female detective who's asked to investigate a ship that went missing but has now reappeared without its crew or cargo. The game adds elements from a classic ghost story and from a classic slasher story to the mix, and there you have your mysteries to solve.\n\nThe story won't win any awards but it's decent enough to keep a HOG going. Or, in other words, to keep the player motivated to keep on puzzling. The writing is also decent, although I do feel I should mention one gripe I found with the writing, because it's just so strange: people call you 'Madam Detective', ok, but you're also [b]referred to[/b] as 'Madam Detective', even when people write about you in a newspaper. That's just strange. Even the developer refers to the main character as 'Detective' in the game's description, again as if that's a name and not a profession.\n\n[h1]Graphics and sound[/h1]\n\nThe graphics of [i]Left in the Dark: No One on Board[/i] are fine for a HOG. Like in most HOGs I think the scenes look very nice but static. I don't understand why they don't add ambient moving objects a bit more often. It would lighten up the scenes so much more with so little effort, really.\n\nThe music is atmospheric and of high quality. The sound effects are sharp and spot on. The voice acting is mediocre, with the exception of the protagonist's voice actress who sounds a bit more convincing than her male colleagues. Turns out she's Kristin Price (although credited in this game as Kristin Price-Wilson), the same actress who voiced the protagonist female detective in the Artifex Mundi HOG series 'Enigmatis' and who did a terrific job in those games, as well.\n\n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n\n[i]Left in the Dark: No One on Board[/i] has 6 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.\n\nThe 13 Steam Achievements are a nice mix of some story-related achievements, a few achievements awarded for not skipping puzzles and not using hints, and several missable achievements that are awarded for various optional tasks, so a completionist will want to use a guide.", "timestamp_updated": 1503591864, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503591787, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 67, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 18, "total_reviews": 85}}
