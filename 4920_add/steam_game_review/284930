Super easy learning curve. Usually 3rd to 1st place all the time. Not sure what all the Negative Reviewers are complaining about, bunch of whiny babies I guess. \n\nThe Camera angle is limited, but it makes things more intense and I would say it's a great boon to gameplay not a problem at all. The whole point is not to see your enemy from miles away, but to boost/nitro and not even have to worry about them. When they come into view, drop an oil and keep going. Learning the maps is simple enough and I didn't find there was such limited time to make a turn due to camera angles. I never failed a turn. \n\nNegative reviews have to take something about the game that is actually done poorly. Otherwise they are personal opinion pieces where someone just wants their own game or is missing the point of the game. The Camera view is part of the point of the game, it was designed this way intentionally, it's not some flaw. Find another game if you can't cut it.\n\nYou don't need to see your standing mid race. If you do, that's probably why you are losing. You're taking focus away from racing to look at your standing in the race. Am I third place? first? second? First of all it's really easy to predict what place you are when you've seen the race starts with so many cars and you passed three already. Secondly, just race and you'll find out at the end. \n\nPeople complaining about top down only view. Really fuck off. That's like saying you bought Divinity Original Sin and you're upset it's an RPG and not an FPS. I grew up on games like this. Top view is what the game is. If you don't like top view, don't play it. If you don't like platformers, don't play those. Seems pretty logical? GTA2 was by far the best game of the series and it was top down only view. Thank god. When they came out with that 3D crap they called GTA3 I wouldn't touch it with a 1000 meter pole. But at least I didn't buy the game and then complain it's 3D and first person view only, and whine that I don't have a top view.\n\nLastly this game is literally $1 on sale. I already knew the negative reviews were persoanl preference pieces and not good criticism of the game just by reading what people were saying. But a game with 90% negative reviews that were legit would still be worth buying at $1 because thre's no way i'd not get my money worth playing it. \n\nNow something like Pillars of Eternity, which is $100 for the game and all the DLCs, is not worth playing despite having less negative reviews. First off the negative reviews for Pillars are way better and have way more merit and actually show flaws with the game. And secondly even if Pillars had no negative reviews and was perfect i would still never get $100 back in playing it. Never. Maximum for a perfect game is $50, and because Pillars is not perfect, has major issues with a bad/boring storyline, and crap stat mechanics, and poor loot/treasures and small tiny maps the game is definitely not even worth $50. Max I'd pay for that Pillars of crap is $25 with all DLC included.", "timestamp_updated": 1505674706, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505674264, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 11, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 12, "total_reviews": 23}}
