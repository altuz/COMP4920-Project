What is Pixel Puzzles: Japan about? How does it work?[/i][/h1]\n\nActually there's not much to say as the gameplay obviously consists in a puzzle to complete, so you have your central field where you can place the spare pieces floating on the upper and left side.\nPuzzles are divided in 5 difficulty levels with a decreasing number of puzzles each. Difficulty lies in the number of tiles and their dimension as well because the higher difficulty level brings smaller tiles. Besides, each puzzle set has tiles with their own shapes and harder difficulties bring more odd and irregular shapes. A small advise: play this game on the biggest screen you have.\n\n[h1][i]GRAPHIC. Engine And Artistic aspects.[/i][/h1]\n\nThe entire game is animated in 2d so I can't scream \"miracle\", yet it doesn't look bad anyways, and despite the game's title it doesn't look that pixellous.\n\n[h1][i]SOUNDTRACK. Themes and Accompaniments.[/i][/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack in the game consists of simple sporadic strumming of the Koto (a japanese typical instruments) with the water cane snapping from time to time, so it's mostly an atmosphere sound. I personally like it but some friend of mine just find it irritating for no reason at all... Bah...\n\n[h1][i]LAST NOTES. What doesn't work?[/i][/h1]\n\nOnce again I've noticed the difficulty in catching the floating tiles with your cursor because the cursor itself seems to be programmed to pick up anything but the highest and closest tile you're pointing. I don't understand it but this will cost you lots of time just to catch the desired tile. The same problem is present in the undeadZ variant of the Pixel puzzle collection, and now I'm kind of expecting to find it in other releases as well... Oh And just like in the UndeadZ version this glitch/feature magically diasppear as you're trying to complete the final biggest puzzle.\n\n[h1][i]TL;DR. Pros And Cons[/i][/h1]\n\n[h1]+++PROs+++[/h1][list]\n[*][b] PUZZLE.[/b] A simple and relaxing puzzle game. That's it.\n[*][b] MUSIC.[/b] There isn't a real soundtrack playing continuously but there will be random strummings of Koto (A Japanese instrument) to keep the Japanese mood.\n[/list]\n[h1]---CONs---[/h1][list]\n[*][b] CURSOR.[/b] For some odd reason the cursor seems intentionally glitchy as you will struggle to pick up the tile you're aiming while you will attract any other tile nearby. Pretty annoying.\n[*][b] DIMENSIONS.[/b] You should play this game on the biggest screen you have because on higher difficulties tiles will get really small.\n[*][b] SAVE GAME.[/b] There's no way to save the game, meaning you have to complete the puzzle you're working on or you will lose the progress on that puzzle. This is definitely odd as it might result a useless feature to use with the first puzzle but becomes very useful in the latest ones that might take long time to complete (almost two hours for the final one)\n[/list]\n\n[i]I played this game on this machine:\nLaptop Lenovo Z50\nIntel Core i5-4210U\n8Gb RAM DDR3\nGeForce 840M/Intel HD Graphics 4400\nWindows 10 Home x64[/i]", "timestamp_updated": 1506073633, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1506073633, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 169, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 49, "total_reviews": 218}}
