It was one of my favourite top-down \"sandbox\" shooters from the early 90s. This game harkens back to that era, both in terms of difficulty and gameplay. Be warned that if you are not experienced at this type of game and in particular, twinstick shooters, even on easy you will find this game an exercise in frustration. It is quite unforgiving...\n- Missions last between twenty minutes and an hour and there are no checkpoints! Run out of lives, back to the start.\n- Power ups seem to drop at times when you either don't require them (two repairs when I am already at full health, really?), or when it is practically impossible to pick them up without being destroyed. They don't hang around that long either.\n- Enemies fire from offscreen, many projectiles will track you for a long time and later enemies lean towards a bullet-hell style. These traits combine to make the airspace very crowded and sitting still for even a moment will be enough to make you very dead. [i][b]This is where the game really shines[/b][/i]; the flawless control and responsive movement of your ship make it a joy to play. It is possible to avoid practically anything, using a good sense of placement and understanding from which direction the next salvo of enemy fire is likely to approach. Unfortunately, the lack of on screen prompts and lacklustre radar make this heavily reliant on the player's intuition. Irrespective of that, there is a real sense of skill and reward, both for careful and ballsy play styles.\n\nThere are a decent variety of enemies that are slowly introduced as the game progresses. There are both air and ground targets, which need to be destroyed with an appropriate weapon, similar to both [i]Zone 66[/i] and [i]Xevious[/i]. Each enemy variant represents a particular threat and they do force certain responses to deal with them. When you get many types mixed together, the game is at its most difficult and hectic. There is an experience system that awards points at level-up. These points can be used between missions to upgrade your ship. However, even fully upgraded your fire power always feels underwhelming. Players are better off focussing on upgrades that increase agility; this is the main means by which you will stay alive!\n\nThroughout, the graphics are decent and manage to keep up a good frame rate on a mid-spec machine. Enemy designs are standard fare and borrow from just about everywhere, but provide good variety. Explosions in particular are pleasing to the eye. Sound is a little bland, but does the job.\n\nA few minor technical issues cropped up while playing...\n- I was unable to confgure my Logitech F310 gamepad. Trying to change the controls in either mode (XBox 360 or F310 Direct Input) just didn't work. I ended up using the default XBox 360 control scheme, which did the job. You are basically forced into a twinstick control scheme to make the game playable anyway.\n- Steam achievements didn't work. They are awarded as in-game medals, but the corresponding Steam achievement wasn't activated.\n- Enemies occasionally get stuck in the scenery and cannot be shot. Usually not too annoying, but once the enemy was an objective and I couldn't complete the mission.\n- I had only one crash to desktop in seven hours of play, which isn't too bad.\n\n[h1]In summary:[/h1]This is an enjoyable but slightly repetitive game that rewards skillful play and will be appreciated by top-down shooter fans who are [u]not[/u] looking for a quick fix.", "timestamp_updated": 1411788332, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1411787223, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "10012534", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 88, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560007", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1399168156, "steamid": "76561197977110183", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Projectiles from off-camera behind you make this game quite frustrating, no matter how good your reflexes, if you can't see the bullet, you can't dodge it.\n\nThe game is not bad, but always having one eye on the radar and off the action to avoid surprise instant damage seems out of place for a fast paced bullet-hell shooter.

Horribly broken menus (not that you can actually access the options in-game, because apparently this is 1995) and the inability to even fix it yourself because the player configs are in encrypted binaries. Menus are both slow to respond, and hard-coded to use xbox360 controller icons, regardless of control preference (oh yeah and the controls menu causes the game to grind to a halt). Which is probably just there to foreshadow the fact that the mouse controls in-game are abysmal and pretty much unusable. The ship will continue to rotate long after you've actually stopped making any input with the mouse, regardless of sensitivity settings - high sensitivity only results in massive over-compensation from any input, and low sensitivity results in the feeling that you're stirring tar. The standard troubleshooting (vsync, pre-rendered frames, etc) will offer you no remedies here, this is all game mechanism.\n\nThis could have the best gameplay in the world, but it's completely irrelevant thanks to an atrocious input interface with the user. Of course in reality, the gameplay is nearly as poor; it's marred by the usual suspects - invisible walls (with enemies that can shoot at you through them, but you can't shoot back - oh and they can do this with some standard geometry too), backtracking and just painfully bland & repetitive gameplay. \n\n4/10", "timestamp_updated": 1399488445, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1399488445, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "12142685", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504455", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1411071509, "steamid": "76561198027086818", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I wanted to like this.

I was enticed by what I saw, bought it on sale, and merrily jumped in.  20-ish hours later (which was in Offline Mode and thus not displayed here), I was done waiting for it to become worth my time OR money.  It's got a good arcade-y feel to it, the objectives are (most of the time) clearly marked, and the game DOES work as intended.  HOWEVER....it is heavily marred, and I shall focus on those details.\n\nThe English is sloppy.  Even one as pedantic as I can forgive the occasional mistake, but this is pre-high-school level, and it grates on me.  Some of this is presented in pre- or post-mission cutscenes that alternate between two ugly character stills and an uninteresting story poorly presented through text.  The rest of this mess is given by all the text frequently sprawled across the bottom during the action.  This is distracting at best, and often meant I had to back away from all combat to catch what was going on before the text rapidly vanished.\n\nAnd the controls....I don't know about keyboard/mouse, but I played this on a controller, and it was not fun.  There is never a need to stop shooting.  You should be shooting during the majority of the time.  You need to be holding down a button to shoot.  These missions are upwards of 20 minutes each.  That makes 20 minutes or more of holding down a button more-or-less constantly, which gets uncomfortable, and the ensuing cramps disuaded me from that third mission in a sitting.\n\nBut what about aside from that, what about the gameplay?  Well, there are upgrades!  Upgrades that don't necessarily explain what they do.  \"Elite kit: Rockets\" doesn't tell me much.  And these felt minor, easily forgettable, and like the points on \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\"... didn't really matter.  Honestly, the game should've just left out the upgrades altogether.\n\nThe view feels too zoomed in.  If you want to avoid getting shot from off-screen or rushing past an enemy nearly as soon as it appears, you need to keep your eyes OFF of the scenery and on your mini-map.  The shooting and the dodging just don't feel GOOD this way.\n\nNow, some of you may like the idea of infinitely respawning enemies.  Keep the pressure on as you go for the objectives, right?  Well even that just feels clumsily done in Project Root.  I found one of the spawn points.  A ship appearing in air right in front of me, and another instantly appearing right in front of me as its predecessor died in fire.  I should not have been able to see that.  That aside, the constant enemy spawns are just an aggravating nuisance during the boss fights, which go on too long anyway.\n\nThis game's graphics and settings are also subpar.  It felt a little sluggish on my quite-decent machine, despite not looking the part of a modern game.  Reducing the graphics settings yielded a result, and smooth play...but the distant background went from fog to black abyss.  A black abyss that sometimes swallowed or spit back out varioius terrain features of this background layer, based on which direction I was facing.  There's a difference between giving a game a more basic graphical style, and just poorly-executing your visuals.\n\nIn short, if you want a budget version of a modern-day imagination of an older-style shoot-em-up that has a very open area, you could probably do worse than Project Root.  There's a gulf, however, in between that and a recommendation from me.

The levels are way too long, with many \"primary\" objectives strung together one after another - by the time I reach the end of a level, my hands and arms are strained so bad that I can't continue.  I think each level could be split into two, or even three, separate parts - as it is, it makes the game more difficult than it needs to be, even on easy.\n\nOne of the biggest flaws with the game is the fact that no achievements you earn will show up on Steam.  Reading through the discussions will show you that dozens, if not hundreds, of people have reported this issue but the game has long since been aboandoned by the devs in order to pursue their recently Greenlit game \"DOGOS\", which seriously looks like nothing more than an update of Project Root.\n\nWhile Project Root has all of the potential of a truly excellect twin-stick shooter, it feels like it's only 95% finished.

I guess it's been too long for Valve to refund my money, but I was trying to give the people that made the game the benefit of the doubt and time to respond.\n\nDon't support broken-ass games and teams that don't fix them.", "timestamp_updated": 1435805845, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435805845, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "10418031", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499886", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1402859858, "steamid": "76561198037695240", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Get shot every time I try to read the mission text from the lady with the muscle boobs.  9/10 would get shot again.", "timestamp_updated": 1402415140, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1402415140, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "11162972", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496405", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1404979640, "steamid": "76561197961118987", "num_games_owned": 547, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I so wanted to like Project Root...But there just to many bugs and not enough variety\n\nPros\n1. You get to shoot stuff and blow it up\n\nCons (its a long list) From my experience of a play through on easy\n1. The explosions feel a little underwhelming, maybe its the lack of a decent level of soundeffects audio (its maxd out but you can barely hear it)\n2. Not enough variety in the nme's, there must be about five or size types of flying craft and the same ground based...Its all very samey\n3. Lame upgrade system.  You earn xp to spend but do the upgrades do anything?  Havent a clue as you are stuck with the same dual shooter and rocket combo for the whole game.  No variety\n4. The special weapons dont stack, they just replace what you had....annoying\n5. the nme's will happily spawn right next to you, at one point I sat there shooting an auto spawning ship two inches in front of me\n6. nme's (and your own ship) occassionaly gets stuck in the scenary making it impossible to kill.\n7. The GFX are bugg'd to high heaven.  I fully upgraded by firepower and now all the shots I fire are completely invisible....To top it off the nme's are now firing barely visible black projectiles at me....and on occassion great big squares will come at me...most odd\n8. No options mid game\n9. Bearing in mind the levels are quite long there is no check point save system.\n10.  After fighting my way through to the final end game boss for some reason my ship became invulnerable...I just stood there and shot it happily absorbing every bullet on the screen....what an anti climax.\n\nMaybe if they fixed the bugs in this game it would be a whole lot more enjoyable and I could change this to a positive.", "timestamp_updated": 1404980213, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404980213, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "10192299", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501349", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1490318775, "steamid": "76561198125411417", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "the more you play it the more you gonna like it\ni love this game \nbit hard to play in the beginning ...once you know how to play it becomes more easy to play\nif you like shooters ...this one you must have\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1400712934, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1400712934, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 19, "total_reviews": 34}}
