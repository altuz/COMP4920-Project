With virtually no dynamic aspects to the game, a $5 million basic sound set costs the same regardless of whether it's 1927 or 2020, staff do not age (just random retirements and a few new ones at the start of each year) and movie income will be the same regardless of the era. \n\nThe process of creating a movie is as basic as it gets. Buy or write a script, throw a director, producer and some actors into the mix, set the budget and wait a few months for it to complete. After this, you spend a bit on marketing then release the movie. The month of the release you get 3 screens. One tells you how much money was made, the next gives a percentage out of 100 for your film score and the final one shows the ratings of the staff. \n\nWant to know why an actor, producer or director got a bad rating in your movie? Want to know if they were mismatched to the genre, are totally useless or just had a bad filming experience? TOUGH! There is absolutely no feedback regarding their performance so good luck figuring out why they bombed.\n\nThat pretty much sums up the entire gameplay. Just keep churning out movie after movie with the only apparent way to get a better movie score is by just throwing more money at it. That's if you can be bothered to keep playing through the boredom and CONSTANT runtime errors that will result in CTDs.\n\nA tedious snore fest that requires no skill or strategy and has as much depth as a dry puddle.", "timestamp_updated": 1499873375, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499872777, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 136, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 72, "total_reviews": 208}}
