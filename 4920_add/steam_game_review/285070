A nice colour palette compliments the games implied points.\n\n- Soundtrack; whilst very limited, the soundtrack plays where it matters most, and is generally welcomed during the seldom times it does play, be it the chilling pieces during encounters, or even the sombre main menu.\n\nThings the game doesn't have going for it:\n\n- Gameplay; heavily leaning on point and click adventure with some puzzle elements, there were multiple occasions where I became frustrated with the overwhelming array of useable items, most it seems which have no value or use at all other than to persuade the player to experiment. The school section is the largest offender by far here. Some of the puzzles are logical, whilst at other times I disappointedly had to refer to a guide. There are times too when you must avoid particular 'enemies', which soon become more of a hassle then a genuine threat. The forced combat levels are a chore; combat is seriously lacking, and there's almost no actual need to block any incoming strikes (I took about 10 direct hits and my character didn't die, and in the nature of this game, I'd say that's enough to kill the character.). They are completely straightforward and seem to only serve as symbolism as maybe personal growth.\n\n- Game length; Following everything to the letter, you can have this game done in an hour, maybe a bit more. $15 is a steep asking price for something with not a whole lot of content to offer. Especially when most of your play time comes from trying to find a use for every single item you are capable of picking up.\n\n- Plot; I'll be straightforward here, the plot is nothing short of vague and perhaps pretentious. From my understanding this is supposed to represent the developers personal experiences, hinted at by means I won't discuss. Without knowing this however, the game tries to communicate to you a greater sense of value, and I think it fails in a sense because of the very nature of its gameplay. One goes looking for significance in places it does not exist. \n\nOverall Verdict:\n\nI can only honestly recommend this game at a heavy discount. Whilst I can appreciate the effort and intentions behind this game, I unfortunately cannot recommend playing it. Between the mix of frustrating gameplay elements, confusing, almost non-existant plot, and very inflated sense of self impression, I can only say this game is a rather bold attempt to make a game with required deeper sense of understanding, but it falls short with frustrating gameplay, short game length, and when considering everything... a very demanding price.", "timestamp_updated": 1485816425, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485756542, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "25948962", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501782", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1475478951, "steamid": "76561198049061232", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I genuinely tried to play this game, but the overall gameplay doesnt seem worth to me.

It's a quite interesting game and art design. It has a unique flow of a story as the kid dreams his insane worlds and create things with his mind. Yet that the kid love video games as much as his parents, the house and world will take shape of any unrealistic and childish mind of a young boy.\n\nBesides the good art design, the game pulls you deep into the story for exploring since you have options to intereact objects and many other interesting things to either save in his pocket or \"quest\" objects. The objects can be anything that might lead on with the story, which you can either do with controller or keyboard. Any object that is interactable has a description, which lead us to the point where the developers are adding more intel to the game, which makes the game more alive.\n\nYet the price point is high for 30-1 hour gameplay in it's current state, then we are looking at something quite unique and we have much to see forward too. So, if you want to see some fantastic art design and follow a young boy while looking through his eyes to either describe his loneliness or what makes him complete, then this game is for you.\n\nHere is the current available content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXSQvw_8wP0", "timestamp_updated": 1441873704, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1441872972, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "20887961", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.995006", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1454302308, "steamid": "76561198046075508", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I like this game.\n\nThe positives are:\nThe backstory is very deep and introspective and looks at the sturggles a person faces over a lifetime.\nThe scenery is absolutely GORGEOUS.\n\nThe drawbacks are:\nDespite being $15, it was (relatively) short with only three main levels. I did end up spending 6 hours on it, but mainly because I spent a solid two hours trying to solve one puzzle.\nThere are still some glitches in the game. Sometimes animations or pictures would screw up (eg NPCs disappearing, animations being triggered inconsistently, my sprite disappearing when attacked at an unusal time, an inventory item containing the wrong image for the object).
