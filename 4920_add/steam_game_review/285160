It's not terrible, but a minor charm that the older games had was how all the characters would just grunt, and the rest would come from body language. This is also more friendly towards foreign children who don't speak English, just like I once was.\n\nThe game's story plays like a cheap very cut-off version of the hobbit movies. In fact I find this game to be way too connected to the movies, you aren't getting anything new, just a shittier version of the movies with some awkward humor thrown into it. \n\nThe game tries to implement some sort of trivial, bad crafting system, where you have to collect resources to create things to progress. Essentially this means that sometimes you'll have to look around in the level to find the right resources, but other times you might just have them already. Overall the system just feels extremely unnecessary and dumb. Why not just have like two items that you need to find and pick up to craft whatever you might need? Why add to the already annoying \"smash everything to find coins\" thing that exists in every lego game ever?\n\nAlso, the game is INCREDIBLY poorly made and glitchy. You'll constantly get half-stuck in places, leaving you having to mash buttons to get out, I once jumped off a dock into the water, but it turned out the one spot I jumped off left me standing at the bottom of the ocean instead of being flung back up, and as previously stated, I had to mash a few buttons to get back. It's not gamebreaking, but extremely annoying. I also got stuck with my boat between some white rock things, and you can't even get out of the boat without being at a dock. After mashing some buttons, the boat started spazzing about, before launching itself through the air and doing several flips, almost landing ON LAND, which I don't even want to know what would happen if that were to be.\n\nOne of the worse glitches I found, was in the first boss-fight against the white orc, the backstory one where Thorin gets his last name, Oakenshield. Me and my brother had fought through most of the level and were right at the end of the boss-fight. Somehow (I don't remember how, it was a while ago) I managed to get out of bounds of the map. There was no way for me to get back to the map, and if I remember right we ended up having to quit the level. We never bothered to progress any further than that.\n\nThe only credit I can give to this game is the fun we had exploring the main lobby area. This was also a glitchy experience, but it was way more fulfilling and honestly a much better adventure than anything the levels have to offer.\n\nLastly I also want to mention, some of the levels in the game are just fucking stupid. Why create a level out of the party at Bilbo's house? Why create a level out of feeding your fucking horses? The game is trying way too hard to stretch itself out, and it's just fucking dumb. Just make them fucking cutscenes, nobody cares about some dumb minigame about throwing plates around Bilbo's house.\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\nVery good in game lobby, had lots of fun exploring it and dicking about.\nCons:\nToo connected to the movies, yet so much is cut out so it feels like a dumb, cheap version of the movies.\nExtremely fucking glitchy. Made it super hard to enjoy.\nThe level themes are fucking stupid, for example the dwarf party at Bilbo's house.\nShitty, unnecessary, crafting system that just adds to the typical lego game grinding.\n(I prefer the older lego games where characters were just grunting instead of actually ripping audio from the movies.)", "timestamp_updated": 1505153979, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505153979, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 518, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 277, "total_reviews": 795}}
