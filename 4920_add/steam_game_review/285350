It's good to see it make it onto Steam where it will get a lot more exposure/recognition. \n\nAnyway, its basically an MMORPG party strategy simulator, taking you and a mix of adventuring classes and abilities through waves of nasties. Positioning, timing of abilities, and party composition all play a part. Tanking, healing, ranged dps, off-tanks, aggro management, crowd control, its all there. If you enjoy MMO raids, and the way different classes can meld together to make something much more powerful than a lone solo session - then you'll be right at home with this game.\n\nThe humour is an added bonus, the graphics are not spectacular, not even current generation, but they are functional. The action is hectic in real time, but luckily theres a pause facility that lets you plan your next move or attack - so you can constantly react to changing tactical events, and take the battle on at your pace.\n\nI think its been polished up a lot more than the original release, and it seems more accessible than I remember. The \"campaign mode\", allows you to progress through the game, unlocking different classes and different skills, using the currency of victory (unlock points) and fixed gold amounts to build up your custom party of adventurers to try out on the next wave of enemies.\n\nVery enjoyable, and certainly good value if you enjoy a short burst of class based fantasy tactical action.\ufeff", "timestamp_updated": 1399458008, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1399458008, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "12510201", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495310", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1413464912, "steamid": "76561197970441688", "num_games_owned": 535, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Cool concept, broken game.
