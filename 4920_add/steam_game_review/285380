It doesnt feel like a simulator at the moment. I would love to see an improvement to the overall FPS and graphics (I have a pretty decent PC with good specs and it doesnt run well at all), the following things could be considered to be added in future updates:\n- Ability to move the third person camera with mouse and joystick so you can see all angles of your lorry\n- Add more lorry makes and work on interior\n- Fix the issue with the shadows being fuzzy and flashy\n- Work on the avatars and lorry company icons as it makes the game seem very, very unprofessional (dont use clipart use proper gfx art)\n\nThanks for reading!", "timestamp_updated": 1505301566, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505301566, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 18, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 16, "total_reviews": 34}}
