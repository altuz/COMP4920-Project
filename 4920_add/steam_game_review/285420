While the story may be a bit on the average side compared to the best RPGs in history, for an RPG Maker game, this game goes above and beyond. Let's see some ratings:\n\nGraphics: 8/10 (for RPG Maker, of course)\n\nMusic: 8/10 (Some really nice tunes here, great work Harmonic!)\n\nSkill System: 7/10 (It's pretty good, but not ground-breaking. Being able to refund and reuse points is a nice touch, though. Any customization in an RPG Maker game is welcome!)\n\nQuesting System: 9/10 (Seriously, I really like the quest tracking system, and TONS of side quests!)\n\nAugment System: 9/10 (More of this in future games, please!)\n\nBattle System: 9/10 (This is where the game really shines, in my opinion, paired with the ability to augment your gear. Being in \"complete\" control of your enmity, or \"hate\", and really pimping out your tank character to take all the hits, aside from AoE, is very MMO-ish, and I found it quite enjoyable!)\n\nBonus: Monster Node Crystals. When you find these, they give you a shard you can use on any character to earn a skill point. Also, when deactivated, you stop getting into random encounters in that area! You can turn the crystal off and on whenever you want if you feel like getting some experience, otherwise you are able to explore without stopping every few seconds to fight!\n\nOf course, everything isn't rainbows and gummy bears, though. I have 3 gripes with the game, 2 are very minor, but one is pretty bad.\n\nMinor\n1.) No steam achievements\n2.) No controller button remapping (could use a remapping program to do this but meh)\n\nHuge\n3.) The end dungeon/boss (spoiler free). I'm all for a challenging, decently sized dungeon to finish off a game, but when your final dungeon is about as time consuming as 1/3 the total gameplay time it took you to reach the dungeon in the first place, its a bit overboard. I'll say that there are 4 or 5 \"areas\" that you have to clear, in order to open up a path that you would ASSUME leads you right into where you fight the boss. Well, you know what they say about assuming, it makes an ass out of you and me. After opening the path, you're met by ANOTHER huge, sprawling area filled with tough random encounters and enemies that love instant death moves. Didn't buy accessories to avoid this situation? Tough luck, son. Finally, you reach the area where the final boss is hidden away. After some dialogue, right before you fight, you're given a chance to access your menu, which I did, and chose to save. \n\n....Maybe that wasn't such a good idea. After being unable to defeat the boss due to a mechanic I won't mention here, I decided \"well, I'll just go grind some more\", even though I couldn't bare the thought of walking out of that annoying area again, even without enemy encounters (by disabling crystal). So, I loaded up my save, but to my dismay an invisible \"lol f-you\" wall blocked my path and pushed me back. WHY ALLOW ME TO SAVE AT A POINT OF NO RETURN?? If I hadn't (accidentally mind you) made a 2nd save about an hour previous, I would literally have had to play the entire game again, just to be strong enough to beat the final boss! \n\nTLDR - The final dungeon/boss were almost enough for me to give this game a negative rating, even after I enjoyed the hell out of the rest of the gameplay/features. (I've heard this ridiculousness existed in the first \"Deadly Sin\" game as well, with an end boss that was, at least at one point, impossible to beat under certain conditions)\n\nRegardless, this game is still above average, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a nostalgic trip down RPG memory lane. The added features were really unexpected but definitely help to set it apart from other RPG Maker games. The end portions of the game are a bit poorly executed, but the rest is darn good. Hopefully there will be a continuation of the series in the future.

I couldn't have been more wrong. It's not a [u]little[/u] improvement, it's a BIG one.\n\nDeadly Sin 2 has a better story, the game mechanics are improved and for someone with experience in RPG maker i can tell this game is seriously awesome. It's literally the first RPGmaker game that I could play for more than one hour.\n\nI have devided the review in some topics for you to further understand why I really like this game.\n\nStory 9/10\nCurrently at the end of chapter 2 and it has been an amazing story to follow.\nYou are Carrian Iblis (or whoever - Iblis since you can change some of the main characters first names! That's a neat feature to be honest), and you play the role of the son of the hero of veridia. Not going to spoil too much but I can say it took some time for this story to develop. It's enjoyable to follow this development and play the role of the main characters.\n\nMechanics 8/10\nSure this is RPG Maker, nothing too special but it works... One really neat feature is the battle in chapter two where you can command your partymembers in 3 groups, switching inbetween groups to defend the castle of the invading dominion. Really enjoyed that fight, maybe you could do something with this in future games aswell? Loved the strategy involved in that battle!\n\nArt 6/10\nHey it's a 2d sort of game so you can't get too much out of the art in these types of games... Deadly Sin 2 uses most of the basic items in RPG maker so in my opinion they could've done just a bit more customization and making their own textures (shouldn't be too hard for RPG maker). But it still does the job in keeping you...more or less satisfied.\n\nCharacter customization 9/10\nEvery character has unique skills and equipment, all of these are upgradable by buying new gear at the armor/weapon smith. You can name some of the main characters giving you an even better experience troughout the story. The skill point system is great, just maybe ruby is a little bit....underrated or maybe that's just my run trough the game as I haven't used that much gold to improve her gear. Just her magic is a little weak for someone described as one of the best mages... (then again could really be me messing up skillpoints for her).\n\nQuests 8/10\nI like how there's some extra quests here and there, and the variety of them. Some quests involve just walking and talking to some characters building up some more story, other quests involve going to dangerous dungeons to retrieve an item.\nThe main quests is what it's all about but the sidequests really add up in my opinion.\n\nPrize 7/10\nNot too expensive, but not cheap. However you can easily look for sales as I got this game quite cheap trough retail sellers like g2a, kinguin and such. Not sure wether it's worth the full 4,99 just yet as I have only played for 6 hours. Would be some expensive hours for its genre but then again I'm sure I'll be spending some more time on this game.\n\nOverall 8/10\nLike I said, for a RPGMaker game this is the first game that kept me entertained for more than an hour so it's definitely worth checking out. Lovely combat system, enemies are balanced, skillsystem is great, story is amazing and overall it's an enjoyable game!\n\nHope this might help you consider buying it ;)", "timestamp_updated": 1479996900, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477925781, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "14285765", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499925", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1429567200, "steamid": "76561197990194469", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A very solid JRPG that I enjoyed quite bit.
