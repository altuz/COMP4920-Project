I knew that an arcade version and WORLD IGNITION came out a while later, but I didn't think too many things changed from the original outside of a new ship and a couple of game modes.\n\nTurns out I was dead wrong and I was a filthy casual. I thought it was hard then, but this right here is something else completely. I didn't know you can make something more challenging than it was before, and even though I'm consistently getting my sphincter torn apart 10 minutes into arcade BOOST mode and 3 stages into UNLIMITED mode, the bigger numbers, the extra breakable parts, more manic patterns, and autistic routing has definitely made it more enjoyable and satisfying compared to the first time I went through it. Crimzon Heart's second form also feels like an actual TLB now instead of some sad attempt at bullet spam. Being given a taste of my own lock-on attack was a damn nice touch, really added to its ridiculous killing intent in its final desperate attempt at survival. Its patterns, combined with both original and arranged music, gives me goosebumps everytime. Out of all the TLBs I've fought, this one really makes it feel like you're both trying to kill each other, especially so during its final attack in which the bullets get faster and more dense the longer you let it live.\n\nIf I could refund it and purchase this game along with all its DLC at full price, I definitely would. Restart Syndrome relapsed in the worst imaginable way, and just like Sisyphus, I'm bound to hell.
