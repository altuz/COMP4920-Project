I figured I'd refund it if it was really bad.\n\n90 minutes later, I was wondering why I thought I'd have to.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun, like 7.62 High Calibre meets Mad Max.  In short, you drive a truck with guns on it, and shoot bandits in gun trucks and take their guns and sell them.  There's all sorts of weapons and modifications, so keeping your arsenal updated is a constant task - but it's hardly difficult. You can also mount a Deadly Assault Octopus on your truck, and this is a good thing.\n\nThe translation is terrible. Utterly awful. And hilarious. Your character will say \"There should be only one!\" after a kill in combat. Also Alice = Lisa so don't get them mixed up because the name changes from time to time.\n\nThe music is either alright  or pretty good - except the Hel overland theme which is (imo) amazing.\n\n\nBuy it on sale.
