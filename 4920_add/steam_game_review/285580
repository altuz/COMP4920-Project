My teammate clocked in 146 hours and I'm over 50 so perhaps ignore the positive reviews that show the person installed it and ran the title screen over people like me that actually put some time in. Sadly the fact this game is even still listed on Steam reenforces the feeling that over the last 2 years Steam has gone from a solid platform for good games into an unchecked and uncontrolled shovelware factory for novice made indie garbage.\n\nFunny a friend introduced me to this game maybe two years back because he was friends with one of the devs. Comically over time said unnamed dev grew tired of some of the BS going on with the leads decision making which becomes a large part of this review.\n\nWhen I first played the game it was actually fun. There was a lot of potential despite being extremely rough. I was part of one of the first teams to play the game for cash as competitive eSports players, something I hadn't done in a long time. However despite the potential the net code alone made even simple practice with teammates brutal if not impossible.\n\nWe gave feed back, the team ignored it. Each release the game got worse and worse with a clear focus on skins, visuals and other garbage they planned to monetize rather than making the game work. Believe it or not the net code got worse as it became clear the team really had no idea what they were doing when it came to networking. So rather than fix the match making and network issues they changed the menus, added new sounds and other pointless crap that didn't matter because you rarely could join a game and when you did you'd probably get disconnected at some point anyhow.\n\nThere were so many problems and I wrote about them on my teams website and various other places for the devs to review but jump ahead it looks like they gave up much like the majority of the player base who they alienated during feed back sessions and the tournaments they put on.\n\nAll in all it's quite sad to have seen the potential and then to watch them flush it. More so it's incomprehensible they would charge you $208.96 even if the game was complete and rock solid. That's like three or four triple A games or a crappy beater car for an unfinished no name game!", "timestamp_updated": 1486810009, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486808447, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "29907263", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489183", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1486223978, "steamid": "76561198293274065", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "its crap", "timestamp_updated": 1487013605, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487013605, "votes_down": 6}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 2}}
