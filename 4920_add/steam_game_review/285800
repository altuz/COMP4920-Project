Yes, it is a watered-down version of 'Heroes of Might and Magic,\". . . but I really like Heroes of Might and Magic.  Certainly the mechanics are familiar to anyone who has played HoMM or Kings Bounty: you fight turn-based battles while continuously leveling up your General and moving your troops around.  It is faithful to HoMM-1 in that you have 4 stats on your General and those 4 stats also beef up your troops.  It is more like the original Kings Bounty (the one from around 1990, not the current series) in that you just move around one single General, stopping at taverns to replenish your troops.  You don't have to worry about conquering gold mines or garrisoning castles.  Think of this as a single scenario map, and decide for yourself it you want to try it.  It has a free Demo if you're not sure.  Personally I had a blast playing it, and I got many hours of playtime out of it.  And I still haven't tried it at the Hard difficulty.  \n\nOne note for those of you who hate bugs and crashes: this game ran perfectly on my very old system.  No crashes, no bugs, no problems at all.  \n\nThe only negative is the lack of replayability; once you've played through on each difficutly level, that's pretty much it.  But then again, if you're on Steam, you have at least a dozen games in your account that you've played once and forgotten about it and a half-dozen you haven't got to yet, so be honest with yourself if this is really a negative for you.", "timestamp_updated": 1501360496, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501360496, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 196, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 60, "total_reviews": 256}}
