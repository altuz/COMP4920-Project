After rainbowing all of the original levels I fell away from it for a few months. Then with the introduction of the new levels and multiplayer I have not been able to stop playing this game! I'm now in the top ten and have a WR on a level and have no intentions of stopping as there is so much I can do and play.\nThe multiplayer is perfectly done, you can chat, throw in a taunt and see what others are doing. If you were good enough then you can gloat from the podium. I haven't even mentioned the level editor that allows you to make your own levels that are downright devious or just flat out fun!\nThe level designs are fun, yet challenging. The earlier levels are easy to play hard to master, and the later levels are just plain challenging. It is vibrant with lots of colors great animations and environments, and tons of amazing eastereggs. The developers of this game obviously made it as a passion project. It is a hotwheels meets speedrunners and is just incredible. BUY THIS GAME!

It only has a very limited amount of controls, only run, jump, reset (to start or checkpoint) and, in some levels, hook. That means you don't have to remember much. Finishing the track at all isn't hard at all (excluding the very last set of levels). But getting a time good enough to beat the gold medal (for beginners) or the rainbow medal (for more advanced players) gets very hard very soon. And even IF you manage to beat all normal tracks with the rainbow medal, defeat all your opponents in challenges and collect all the coins of the bonus levels in time, that doesn't mean that the game doesn't offer anything anymore. There is still an online multiplayer to play with friends or meet new ones. You can build your own tracks or play some of other members of the community. You can try to further improve your time on tracks to reduce your combined time of all tracks to get a better rank on the global leaderboard, or to get a top 10 time on a track, or maybe even a world record. Once you master all the little mechanics that might be hard to pull off, but save you alot of momentum and time when done correctly, you can spend countless hours grinding levels to get a better time. And when you think you got everything done, then someone finds a new mechanic, a new route or a skip, and it starts all over again.\n\nCOMMUNITY:\n\nThe members of the community are all awesome people. Never have I found people that are more friendly than the Action Henk community in any game. Once you reach a certain level of play, and you get in touch with some of the higher ranked members, you get tips and tricks on how to get better times pretty much daily. \n\nOn top of that, the developers are extremly supportive in every possible way and really try to give everyone the best possible experience. I've never seen devs so nice anywhere (thanks for the awesome time at Gamescom while I'm at it <3)! \n\nWHAT IS BAD?\n\nSadly, multiplayer is pretty empty most of the time, but that's not the game's fault. Also, if you are not into grinding, doing stuff over and over again until it's perfect than the game doesn't offer much to you after a while. \n\nSHOULD I BUY IT?\n\nIf you are impatient, get upset easily and can't stand doing stuff over and over again, then it's questionable. Getting the rainbow medal everywhere is certainly not easy and will take quite a long time, so if you only want to go for completion, this game offers you probably between 30 and 60 hours of gameplay, depending on how good you are. If you like getting stuff as perfect as possible and if you are a competitive person, then this game offers you at least 200 hours of gameplay, but probably more, as more routes and strats are getting found weekly. For the little price of this game you get more gameplay than in alot of AAA titles that cost 4 times as much, so I would definatly say: Buy it!", "timestamp_updated": 1444051713, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1444051713, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "13752313", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547295", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1420108816, "steamid": "76561198025301599", "num_games_owned": 4208, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Amazing Running game, so much fun to find the best way to gain as much momentum as possible.\n\n+ you can choose to play against a ghost with either Bronze, Silver or Gold medal.\n+ the hookshot is really amazing and so much fun to use.\n+ Steam Workshop means infinite levels to play.\n+ replaying a level is fast without any loading time.\n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_updated": 1420086234, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420086234, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "12308514", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509871", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1412229047, "steamid": "76561198023167031", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Trials HD/Bike Baron gameplay, with a Toy Story aesthetic.
