The idea of being able to take over any ship in the game and use it? Awesome idea! It's just the every other aspect of the game is mediocre at best.\n\nThe waves are fine, not unfair, but not very much thought went into them. Just clusters of enemies put together because, well, it's a wave of enemies. The controls are *terrible*, at least for mouse and keyboard, and it limits what buttons you can bind to in such a way that there's no reason to even try, because the convenient buttons aren't allowed. And nowhere was I informed it was meant to be played with a controller until I loaded up the game, which was irritating sinceI don't own a controller and wouldn't have purchased the game had I known. \n\nTo add insult to injury, every time you run out of lives you have to restart the entire game. Each death puts you at the start of the wave, but every game over restarts the entire game. That sounds fine, and it's not the worst thing, but it means that after a couple game overs it's not even worth slogging through the same mediocre waves over and over to get back to new content.\n\nThe story is vaguely interesting, but not enough to keep me willing to slog through the levels over and over after a game over to try to get new story. It's 2 sentences of story per wave beaten, which doesn't motivate me to go through the same levels to get the next tiny clip.", "timestamp_updated": 1501956726, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501956726, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 52, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 14, "total_reviews": 66}}
