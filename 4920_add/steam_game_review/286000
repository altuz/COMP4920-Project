Strip away the need for unnecessary spamming to increase APM and you have Tooth and Tail. To the less experienced RTS player: rejoice! And to the more experienced: also rejoice! Do [b]not[/b] let the lack of mechanical requirements discourage you, behind the simplified exterior is a beautifully crafted and in-depth experience.\n\nInstead of having a set loadout of units to build, each player must pick from a list before the game starts to create their \"deck\". Any combination can be chosen, but how well you use your combination is the true test of skill. Neither player can see the other's deck, so knowing which units to choose is based completely on player knowledge and confidence. On top of this, every map is randomly generated on match start. Without the distractions of misplaced APM, you are free to gain information on your opponent and the terrain. With your chosen deck and the map presented by the game, all your gameplay efforts are regulated to reacting to what is in front of you.\n\nQuickly reading the map is one of the greatest nuances of the game. With the popularity of perfectly symmetrical maps in most RTS games, we rarely see exciting plays early in the matches, but with Tooth and Tail's system, anything can happen. Sometimes the map generation is not always in your favor, so you must use your experience to overcome any disadvantage.\n\nIf the gameplay itself has not sold you yet, just take a moment to admire the stunning pixel art and inspiring sound track. And how about that 10+ hour campaign? From a distance, I was intrigued; and as soon as the controller was put in my hand, I fell in love. If you are looking for an RTS experience that does not require APM spam, but exemplifies the need for a strategic mind, pick this game up as soon as you can.\n\nUndisputably the best; Good Game, Deadbones. <3", "timestamp_updated": 1505236494, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "13", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505235707, "votes_down": 45}, {"recommendationid": "34939819", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 95, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629753", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507161125, "steamid": "76561198040884867", "num_games_owned": 1196, "num_reviews": 618, "playtime_forever": 499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 260}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "[b]Absolutely remarkable RTS game here.[/b] I'm quite blown away by how addicting and fun [i]Tooth and Tail[/i] is.

The random generation of maps leads to it becoming ridiculously difficult to get the 'heroic' achievements. Barring you have many various flaws such as defend orders/wait orders spreading a unit far too thin, sniper units immediately stopping if in range of an enemy after you let go of retreat button forcing you to guide them all the way out of combat, ranged units not attacking units on slopes even if theyre visible, barbed wire being very annoying to deal with. While the multiplayer is fun and the inuitive control scheme allows for new-to-RTS players to hop right in, the lack of many basic things such as patrols, halts and others fails to cater to long-time RTS players.

And after i played the game very intensive in the last days, i think i have now seen enough of the game to make a final statement.\n\nThe controls of the game are very cool and very unique and i havent seen anything simular in any RTS game so far: While in all other RTS games, you scroll with the mouse over the map, to send your troops or to build your buildings, here you take direct control of a commander, who functions as a mouse cursor in other rts games. This leads to the situation, that your view is fixt and you cant just go from on side to the map to the other with one click to see whats going on their. And with the left and right mouseklick you are sending troops to your current location of your commander to attack enemies. This results in a very basic and simple control of the game: While in the usual RTS-Games like Star Craft 2, a good player has to develop a very high APM (Actions per minute) to compete against others, since the faster you are, the more things you can do, which resulted in the situation, that if you want to become good, you have to learn to move your fingers around your keyboard as fast as a professional pianists, and also older people could never compete with younger people, since they cant reach such high APM`s anymore. In Tooth and Tails, the basic control (you can even play it with a controller without having any penalities) take much of the huge hurdle away that you have to overcome, and the difference of a good player and a bad player is now only the logic, like which units to buy and when to attack where, rather then the micromanagement like it is in the other RTS-Games.\n\nThe Plot of the game is very unique. In the animal world, food sources are getting lower and lower, and so, the animals did develop an interesting solution to overcome this problem. They become full carnivores, and while they theoreticly could eat vegetables, most of them prefer to starve to death before they would do something so \"uncivilised\" like eating the foog of beats (everything that is not meat) But with this new food-culture, their comes a nother problem. Their are disagreements who should get food...and who should be food. So 4 factions did develop, loosly based on the russian revolution and everyone tries to be the last side alife to feast on the corpses of the fallen enemys. \n\nThis is the mainplot in the Campain in which you play as every of the 4 faction in their deserate fight to decide the war for them. Each faction has a very interesting lore behind them, (the blue longcoats for example are capitalistic revolutionarys who produce illegaly alcohol to finance their revolution, the red commonfolk are the communists of the animalkingdom, poor, but many animals, that dont want to bear the oppression from the upper class and the Civilised, are the old religios leaders of the land who think that only their religion should decide who should life and who should become food. \n\nThe missions of the campain are well done, while they begin very easy they become very hard later on and you really have to develop a specific tactic for each mission. Also very well done is the design of the mission. While their are also some \"build your base and destroy every enemy\" missions, their are also many missions where you really have to think from zero, missions in which you have to survive a certain amount of time, or to rescue allys from prisons as quickly as you can. Also their are \"Heroic quests\" that are optimal quest that you can fullfil to get achievements. And while the missions will get very difficult at the end, i have to admit that the heroic quests are some of the hardest challenges i have ever overcome in any videogame, expecially some of the last heroic quests are almost impossible to fullfil if you are not lucky with your map.\n\nAnd here we come to a VERY big negative point of the game (in general, but especially in the campain) Because every map in the game is made by a map generator, it will generate the map on some fixt points (like the enemy will always start with three bases, of their are 5 possible mills that you can conquer in the map etc. but the layout of the map is randomly made. And this leads to the situation, that when you are lucky with the map, and you start at a location that is easy to defend while the enemys location is very open, you will win even the hardest levels with ease, while when the situation is the opposite, then the heroic quest, if not even the mission itself is impossible to win. Because of this the later (harder) missions become very very RNG based, you can have a perfect idea about how to win the map, but if you are not lucky you can play as good as you want, you will not get it. So especially if you want to finish all the heroic quests you need a huge frust toleration and you have to restart the map over and over again, until you finally will get a good map. \n\nI understand that creating such an map generator is a very complex and difficult thing to do, but honestly i wish they would just have made balanced hand-made maps in the campain, because their was non RTS game, that i have every played that had sometimes so ridiculous bs maps like Tooth and Tails. But thankfully the developer are aware of the problems and try to fix the issues with the maps in the campain so i think the chances are very good, that in the future the campain will be a more enjoyable experience. \n\nWith the easy control i was sceptical that the Multiplayer will be to casual, that you didnt improve yourself and it will be more a luck than a skill game. But after i have played the Multiplayer for some time now, i can see that my concerns where unfoundet. You have to improve to get better rankings, their is a huge difference between a beginnger and a good player, and while the skill-gap is of course not as high as in \"real competitve\" games like Star Craft 2 or AoE, it still takes time and practise to become a good player. The matches are all short (between 5-10 minute) that makes them very action intensive but also not to stressfull since you can just join a new game in a few seconds if you have lost, and try a new tactic again.  The only complain that i have, is, that the most games are decidet with only one base, since it is to risky and expensive to expand in the most cases, since the maps are very small and the enemy can reach your base in just a few seconds. And with the low income that the players has to work, many games will have only Tier 1 units (the cheapest but also the weakest) since you are vulnurable for a very long time when you try to build higher tier units, because they need a very long time to recruit. I think the Multiplayer matches would be even more enjoyable if it would be easier to expand to at least two farms, since Tier 2 and Tier 3 units, that need a better economy to really becoming cost efficient, will play a higher role in more games. \n\nAll in all i have to admit, that i really didnt have so much fun in a game in a very long time. I often say to myself to only play a few games only to play for many hours! The game idea is very good done: it is simple to learn, but hard to master, and while you always have to do something, it managed to never become stressful. And while both the single player campain, as well as the Multiplayer, have a few downsides, the good sites are outweighting the bad sides. The community is very friendly, the developers are very active: Lets say it: I would recommend the game for both RTS-Veterans as well as people who didnt enjoy RTS-Games so far, since it is enjoyable for everyone.\n\n\n\"Let the ruling classes tremble at a animal revolution.

The gameplay itself is fine from what i can tell. You control a single unit that acts like a mouse cursor with restraints. It represents the commander of your army. If it dies, you may not interact with the world for a few seconds. This commander builds your buildings which either produce units or food. Units cost food in mainentance as well as production (which happens automaticall every x seconds). \n\nFood production buildings deplenish fast and for this reason battles are quick and snappy. So far so good. Where the game failed for me was the AI and ramdom map generation. The latter can produce a mission of varying diffliculty with some of them being impossible. Since there is no restart mission button, you may then either quit to the title screen or search something that can kill you. Not a deal breaker, but annoying. \n\nThe first problem is far more significant: The AI. The enemy ai commander will move randomly accross the map and build wherever it can. It's units will search the quickest way to your buildings and throw themselves against them. They don't need the commander to move like your troops do, which means the enemy does not play by the same rules. Not only takes this away from the experience when the enemy commander constantly strolls trough your base and dies, but you can also exploit this behavior, making the regular missions quite easy. Allied AI behaves in a similiar way, which can lead to frustrating moments. Though it seems to be more likely to join you when you attack.\n\nI really, really want to like this game.

When you select some they all follow the order you give !\nAlso  if you want to defend a position you MUST put aside one unit type just for this role !\n\nAnd you bet what is the other option ? Global rally !\n\nMax defense or Max attack. And guess what ? You can't set rally points without moving your character....\nSo if you need to keep the pressure with your cannon fodder while you try  to sort the mess somewhere else... your units will just wait around their spawn iddle....\n\nCome on !\n\nDefending relies only on 1 type of turret and mine or even the gathering \"unit\" who can shoot at the enemy.\nAnd units AI won't help, completly dumb, if you are not with them they just run to their death.

Too many times you have no way to improve but only to prey that the next map will be in your favor.\n\nStarting bases are too close when you need to survive or too far when you need to kill a certain amount of enemies with a unit (KASHA I HATE YOU!)\nToo much trees/rocks/cliffs so you can't find your way fast in timed missions.\nStarting defense layout that sucks. \nWater tiles that can heal your units but they too small or too far from the fight... ect... ect...\n\nI stop here the list is huge.\n\n\nIt just ruins the pleasure to get the best of every missions, making gameplay tedious and disapointing.\n\n\n\n\n\n[u]The word of the end;[/u]\n\nI didn't pushed that much in multiplayer but frankly i think i will pass until an overhaul of the selection/ organisation of troops [i] (Modification: no actually it's the contrary and I want to play more in MP instead of solo. This games seems to offer a lot on this point. So yeah saying that was totally dumb because i want to love Tooth and Tail )[/i].\nBecause at the moment it's a real pain. And again absolutely horrible in solo mode with the random generation of maps.\n\nAlmost everything is good in Tooth and Tail but these two features poses a real problem.\nThat's why I don't recommend it .... for now [i](Modification: Because i must have a full Multiplayer experience.

There is a lot of fun to be had in its clever game design, cruel world and fantastically drawn sprites but if you're here for a single player campaign that lets you really flex your stategic abilites, look elsewhere. I've put most my time into the single player so far, and most of the 'challenge' has come from the AI ignorning rules, Random map lay outs making second playthroughs of a failed mission just as frustrating as the first and to top it all off no selection of your units.\n\nThe best example I can find is the mission, The Hungry Face a Stiff Wind. In this mission you're attacking a single Mill that is behind lines of barricades, artillary positions and you face a timed wave of 'Winged Demons' that hit your base. Its a lot on your plate sure, but should be managable. However, when the enemy can constantly send waves of hero units at you while ignoring the economy that you're strictly adhered to you quickly become overwhelemed and the winged demons spawn behind your base. So if you run out of ranged units, which hit by a single arty round can kill tons, wave goodbye the mission is done. On top of all this, your main stationary base defense is landmines. LANDMINES to stop mostly aerial units. I ended up beating the mission in under 30 seconds by walking the starting stealth units in and promptly ambushing them.\n\nSo in short, its a game for the multiplayer where the opponent is forced to play like you do. The AI is either too dumb, or simply ignores the game mechanics to bring challenge. Its a shame, because I'm interested in the story but not enough to base my head against the wall continually until either dumb luck or a cheat tactic is found.

The game is very very simple to learn, but seemingly quite difficult to master. I'm only 3 hours in and I already feel like I got my money's worth. This game mixes the perfect amount of simplicity with actual strategy in short bursts that I think pretty much anyone can enjoy. \n\nThe game is captivating because it is so simple, yet it's filled with interesting little complexities and synergies that could take dozens of more hours to master. The best part? You hardly have to focus on macro game as your entire base can be built with the click of a button or two... You get to spend more time focusing on strategy and killing your opponent rather than jumping back and forth between all your units and buildings making sure they are all doing exactly what you wanted them to (I'm looking at you Starcraft); it's all very straight forward, making the game much more enjoyable for the average player.\n\nThe different \"factions\" are really just your preference of hero as you get to select the units you want to bring in prior to each game. All units are available for selection regardless of the hero chosen. I think this is a positive feature as it allows people to really synergize the units instead of just picking the most broken faction. This is also a huge benefit to the devs as well because it means they don't have to spend their time trying to balance different factions and can focus on the game content instead. \n\nAs far as performance I have not had a single issue other than one minor input issue when trying to play with friends, but we figured out a work-around for the time being and the devs have already recognized the issue and are expected to fix it soon.

Where to start? TL;DR at bottom.\n\nThe Good: It's Animal Farm/Redwall - The Game. Clever story, great simple gameplay, great amounts of strategy, all units available from the start, no pay-to-win stuff, cross platform and splitscreen multiplayer. Being the fastest keyboard masher means very little in this game compared to most RTS games; you get to focus on the fun strategy parts and not on the mechanical stuff. The story is clever and poignant. PvP matches are brief but intense, you only need to dedicate about 5-8 minutes to play a solid match. It plays equally well using a controller or keyboard + mouse. Developers that are listening to the player base. This game came out only a few days ago and they've already rolled out some nerfs to overly difficult story missions based on player feedback.\n\nThe Bad: RNG. Every single map, whether story missions or PvP is randomly generated, so no two matches or missions will  be the same. Sometimes this works to the extreme in your favor, sometimes it's the extremely bad for you. This makes every single game require different strategies, which can be very fun, but it is possible to feel the the deck keeps getting stacked against you. The counter point to this is that matches are so short, so if you get a difficult map just keep playing and one will fall in your favor. This doesn't mean  it's impossible to win if you get a challenging map, it may just require some quick thinking on your part, but not everyone is going to be a fan of the randomness and you may not be either. Opinions... man. You gotta have 'em.\n\nTL;DR: Very fun game, easy gameplay, lots of strategy, controller friendly, crossplatform and splitscreen multiplayer, brief matches, devs that listen, however random map generation will not be for everyone.", "timestamp_updated": 1505596057, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505596057, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "35270704", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519499", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507133385, "steamid": "76561197993428611", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1816}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "First of all a little bit about my gaming experience.

It is, to me, a simpler RTS than something such as, Company of Heroes. You essentially have to capture Mills and spend your food (which is basically your money) to put farms around them, then you defend those and attack your opponents mills. That's the very basic premise of the multiplayer, at least. \n\nThe campaign does offer matches such as that, but they also offer different takes on the game, like modes where you have to defend merchants without being able to build farms or \"defeat\" the enemy; you just have to keep at least one merchant alive until the timer runs down.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game is that it seems to have poor lag compensation. Or, perhaps, it has amazing lag compensation. The internet I'm currently on is satellite internet, so it consistently has one second worth of lag. When I try to play an online match, I can get in and play, but it takes me forever to move around--That is, I can move constantly, as in I don't rubberband, but it's much slower than other players. It's basically like I'm moving in slow motion while others are going in real time. I don't have this problem when I play something like Company of Heroes, I just have a slight delay in troops going where I order them, so I can't see myself getting too many hours in this game after I beat the campaign unless that changes.\n\nThat being said, the majority of people have a stable connection with a low ping, so I could absolutely recommend this game for someone who is looking for a lighter RTS.", "timestamp_updated": 1505366731, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505366731, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 363, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 60, "total_reviews": 423}}
