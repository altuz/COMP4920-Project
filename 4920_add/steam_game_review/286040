Buy when it's a couple bucks.\n\nThe storyline isn't much to bring home, and the voice-acting cheesy.  But I've found it enjoyable for a few hours of gameplay.  \n\nI like upgrading stuff, and this game has that.  I'll note that pausing between missions in the campaign to play the special modes of timed and wave battles is an option if you start finding the missions too difficult.  \n\nThere's two currencies - credits and gold.  You use the gold to buy regeneration for your character, plus 3 special weaapons.  Though powerful, the special weapons are somewhat nerfed - the pistol has a relatively slow rate of fire, and the two large weapons take longer to 'spool up' and begin firing.
