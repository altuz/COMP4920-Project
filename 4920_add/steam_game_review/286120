Looks great, seems like it would be a nice game judging by its concept... but it's just not fun. I couldn't get into it. It's just the bare-bones of a battlesystem, and nothing much around it.\n\nWhat really kills it for me is how you're just assigned seemingly random heroes for each mission? Why is that? What RPG would just give you a bunch of heroes for each battle with nothing to improve, no possible preparation, no growing, leveling...\n\nSomeone else put it best: it's like the \"lite\" version of an actual RPG.", "timestamp_updated": 1503017051, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503017051, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 21, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 41, "total_reviews": 62}}
