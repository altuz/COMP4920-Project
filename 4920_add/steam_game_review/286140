Because you'll be doing a lot of walking in Eidolon.\n\nIt's not hard to figure out the basic gist of the game: walk around Western Washington and pick up little tidbits of information that paint the story of what happened to the world. It's post-apocalyptic but doesn't really feel like it in most places. It's like camping.\n\nThe key to enjoying Eidolon is to buy into the atmosphere and storyline. Explore! See what's over that hill over there. Learn, through trial and error, the limitations of your human form. Like it or not, this IS a survival game. Cold water will eventually kill you, as will starvation, disease from eating bad food, injuries, and wild animals. But none of those things are immediate-- it does take work or carelessness to \"die\" and even when you do, you respawn in a safe place. This is a great game to play when you have a lot of free time, because the more time you spend in this world, the more real it seems. I found myself getting genuinely frightened by a bear sighting and the sometimes-discordant music contributed to it, while other times I felt giddy because the weather and views were so astonishingly beautiful. I experienced several vivid dreams that brought me back to Eidolon's universe in sleep.\n\nWhile I appreciated the variety of the fragments, the sheer number of them made it hard for me to follow a cohesive storyline and eventually I got frustrated. For me, some fragments were impossible to reach without \"cheating.\" A simple code allows you to fly, but i strongly advise against using it unless you absolutely have to-- maybe to cross a large body of water or reach a fragment floating high above you. Relying on the flight cheat completely ruins the point of the game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is that there is no ending. You just run out of fragments to find. I am someone who likes completing things, so this really left a sour taste in my mouth. I would have loved some kind of profound or emotional ending that ties everything together. But maybe that's the point: for the character (me?) there is no ending. There is only what will happen tomorrow, and the next day, and the next.", "timestamp_updated": 1502338186, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502338186, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33585325", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500246442, "steamid": "76561198028467100", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "IN EIDOLON\u2014by meta4, 2017\n\nTo walk with aching bone and burning mind,\nacross a landscape long of humans void;\nto struggle some\u2014till food, tools, shelter find\u2014\nby scraps of desperate record charmed, annoyed.\n\nLet wilderness post-modern tantalize,\nso close to high technology, so far;\nsee forest taking back mankind\u2019s damned guise, \nand hints of magic once again made par. \n\nThe walk is long, and ignorance breeds fear,\nas clumsy choices cost hope\u2019s precious time;\nstill following the tale of greed\u2019s blind weir  \nphilosophize, obsess for whom bells chime.\n     \nThese truths may be what minds will linger on,\nto reap full joy and pain through Eidolon.\n_____________ \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1500212818, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500212818, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 76, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 23, "total_reviews": 99}}
