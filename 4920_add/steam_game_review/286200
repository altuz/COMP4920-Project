Basically you build and upgrade a village to provide power-ups for the Match 3 combat game.  Then you use the money from the Match 3 game to purchase upgrades for your town.\n\nOccassionally you'll get popups in town about a random event and you have a multiple choice decision you can make. Depending on your choice you may unlock other power-ups.\n\nSeveral of your buildings are for gathering resources - ore and wood that you use to build and upgrade structures. A farm to feed your people. A blacksmith to research new weapons and an armory to store them in.  You use the weapons as power-ups in the match 3 game. \n\nYou can build and upgrade an Academy for spells to use in the match 3 game, A City Hall to hire workers for your buildings or as power-ups such as an Archer or Boulder tosser to fight off the encroaching enemy. And finally a Grainery to bring in more settlers.\n\nCombat is a road map of towers on the continent. Once you win a match 3 game in one, you can advance to the next tower or redo a battle at a solved one to grind money.\n\nIn the combat sequence you have enemy forces coming at you randomly in rows. As you make matches in the match 4 game it sends out energy beams from the matched gems out into the enemy ranks of those rows. You can also use your archer/boulder tossers/loot gatherers/healers as power-ups to help defend the walls or keep your troops healed.\n\nAs you defeat enemies, they may drop piles of money that you can click on as you're  making your matches. \n\nAll in all it's an interesting twist to your standard Match 3 game. All the standard Match 3 obstacles are there - as are the power-ups. Just that now they have to be researched from your village before use, and some unique power-ups like archers and such running around shooting the approaching waves of enemies as you make matches to send out energy beams to blast them away from your ramparts.\n\nOther than that nothing terribly unique from any other Match 3 game - just its presentation.", "timestamp_updated": 1397697922, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1397697922, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "9837743", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 33, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507011", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1401937250, "steamid": "76561198048505490", "num_games_owned": 772, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It has the most basic of town building mechanics.

The point is, I've seen it all.  Aside from the things I have not seen, of course.  So what does ReignMaker bring to the table, that makes it good, or even gooder?  Well.\nThere is the match three, of course, which is a very clear cut genre, but yoiu see, it is also a tower defense, as your matched blocks create magical bolts that fire upon the waves of attacking, um, evil things.  You can also learn spells that bolster your ability to blast molten death upon the deserving heads of the aforementioned evil things.\nIn between bouts of match three tower defense, you can return to your village, where you as mayor, or whatever, get to improve buildings, hire workers, research items and spells, and even respond to situations by creating government policies, which can sometimes give bonus items, or cause new items to appear in your town.\nOverall, I find enough variety in ReignMaker to keep things fresh, and the only complaint I have is that lumber production is so slow it can actually slow your progress, as lumber is needed for anything you want to build.  That is fairly minor though, and the developers are actually responding to people on the forums, which is pretty amazing in this day and age where so many games are in early access, or simply released and abandoned, or abandoned in early access.\nAnyway, good game, check it out.

Here you train units to help you in your battles, create equipment and research spells. And you produce the resources with which to do all that. But more than that, you make decisions that will make the town feel unique: whenever you beat a new level, a policy decission will be presented to you, asking you to guide your town. How do you handle crop failure? Do you let that reknown berserker settle in your town? What do you say about theatrical plays that corrupt our youth?\nAll these decission will affect your town one way or another. You may get a free scholar to help your reseach.

Lots of little goals plus achievements is a great bonus. It is similar bto the Puzzle Quest series, and fans of that series should  pick this up. It it really simple but the battles can get pretty complex. It seems to have been built for a touchscreen and not a mouse though. Its overpriced at $14.99, $4.99-$9.99 seems much more reasonable. Overall though, its fun if you like puzzle/RPGs.\n\n\nWhen I first saw this released, I ignored it. It looked like a casual puzzle game that was a mobile port. And it was pricy for that style of game. Then I saw a friends review who liked it. I've been really hard up for ANY games lately due to the deluge of mobile crap, so I grabbed it. Yes, I know, counter intuitive. But hey, I can't hate on something Ive never experienced.\n\nNormally I'm not a fan of puzzle games, but I did love and play the hell out of the Puzzle Quests (the first one was better than the second and Galactrix IMHO, but all are good), and also liked Puzzle Chronicles. All of those had some sort of strange addictive quality, even though without the RPG component, puzzle games are boring as hell and pointless in my eyes.  So I grabbed ReignMaker.\n\nFor starters, the graphics are appropriate. They are bright, colorful, and cartoony 3d images. It lends the game a good feel that fits well with the game style. The music is cheerful and the sound is decent, although the doo-do-DO-DOO (the typical \"charge\" horn noise) that starts a battle is annoying as hell. \n\nOther than that, I laughed at the *very* badly narrated intro that starts the game. The images are cool, a stained glass style picture scrolling by and explaining the backstory. But the voice..oh god. It sounds like a wanna-be old man with a bad head cold attempting to do the stereotypical \"fantasy world king\" accent. And failing. I had trouble understanding some of what he was saying, and it sucked cuz there was no subtitles.\n\nSo the gameplay. Its like an *extremely* light city builder/resource manager, mixed with a match 3 puzzle that is also a tower defense game. The city builder is simple. There are places you can buy using resources and the places help you. Theres also policies, which are little events. You have 4 different choices of how to deal with the event, and the results of the choice affect your city. I have havent really explored too much of the city building aspect yet, so I will update when I do.\n\nUPDATE: Its really simple. Half the buildings generate timed resources, the other half researches itemss. You can upgrade the buildings to get better battle items, spells, and troops. I hesitate to even call it a builder. More of a resource manager.\n\nThe other aspect of the game is decently fun. Its the battle. You start, and you can earn items from buildings in your city that help you. There are many of them all with different effects. \n\nSo its a tower defense meets match 3. On the left is your tower, filled with different elemental shapes and other icons that you match. Walking in from the right are enemies, many different types. They dont move up and down, but travel in a straight line towards your tower (at least at the stages im at now, dont know if they do later). When you match 3, a bolt of the associated element spits out of your tower and travels right, hitting any enemies in its path. Thing is, the bolt travels in the row you matched it in. So if theres an enemy in the 2nd row down matching an element in the 3rd 4th and 5th row down wouldnt hit it because the elemental bolts would be flying in the 3rd 4th and 5th row. There are also many other icons, both helpful and harmful/annoying. You can collect \"scrolls\". Each scroll creates an entry in a book where you can see the stats of each enemy and a brief description and images.\n\nIn addition there are little challenges you can do to gain resources, such as \"match 4 fire elements\" \"use a heal icon\" ect. All of this plus a ton of achievements and other little things makes this overall a fun lgame.\n\nIts a little pricy for 14.99, but any fan of the puzzle quest type match 3s will love it.

The meat of the game is in the battles, where you play match-3 on one side of the screen while monsters attack on the other. The matching is pretty straightforward (you get some spells you can cast to shuffle or destroy tiles, you get bonuses for matching 4 or more at once, there are locked and frozen tiles, etc) but the combat side is pretty interesting - at first I just ignored it and focused on making matches at the bottom of the screen so that matches on top would happen automatically, but it's actually worth paying attention to where monsters are and trying to line up matches in the right place, especially against later bosses when you need to keep them stunned to avoid being hurt. Also, items can be used on the battlefield side to deal with monsters, and they drop a lot of loot and collectable scrolls that are worth getting.\nThe town part of the game has good parts and bad parts. Resource production happens in real time, so you can just leave the game running and make as much ore and wood as you need (though money only comes from battles). This is where windowed mode would have been nice. After every new level you beat, your town faces a new dilemma you have to choose the outcome of. The dilemmas are well written but don't seem to have any actual gameplay consequences.\nSteam says I've played 4 hours, and I've beat almost half the levels, so I'd guess the total playtime will be 10 hours for one play-through. There are different towns you can play as but they have only minor differences so replaying with a different town wouldn't be too different of an experience.\n\nUpdate: Frogdice thoughtfully contacted me and corrected some screw-ups I made. The big one is that there IS a windowed mode, it's the last option on the options screen, and I managed to completely miss it. Another one is length: I've now done 34 levels (out of 50) with 8 hours played, so the game could end up being around 15 hours in one play through, not just 10.
