(wouldnt be a problem, but the movement in the game is realy bad for this. tried 3 different controllers and keyboard also, it didnt make any difference)\n\non the other hand, the soundtrack is mostly pretty nice, the graphics for that type of game is decent (i didnt like the maze struktures, even the most towns are mazes) the combat system works for me, even if its slow paste. the characters are well done and the story also. but at the end its pretty basic and missing some depth. \n\ni can only recommend the game for oldschool jrpg lovers, who are able to get through the frustrating parts without killing there beloved people arround ;) then you will have a fun time and maybe call it a gem. its not my gem tho\n\n\n(i also have read alot of reviews here and im kinda shocked, that people seem to realy love the game, or realy hate it. then i watch how much time those peeps spend with the game... so many people not even an hour played and give an bad review. also not even 10 hours played and give an good review. you guys havent even beaten the game at all! \nbelow 10 hours you havent even seen those minigames. and below that.. you guys know what my point is. \ncould be, that you have played it on a different system, but in the most cases, i dont believe you :P \nim actualy kinda happy that i didnt spend the money for the megadrive/genesis version, even if it would look good at my collection)", "timestamp_updated": 1505140908, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505140908, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 25, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 12, "total_reviews": 37}}
