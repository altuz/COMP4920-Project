I cannot get the music out of my head. I haven't even spent that much time playing this game, but the music is amazing and more some reason it just keeps popping into my head throughout the day, even if I haven't played the game in a few days.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay itself, it has a good mix of player skill (such as aiming certain actions properly) and character skill (selecting dogs properly and enhancing their abilities). It is a little shallow when it comes to customizing your dogs, there isn't much you can to improve the race itself beyond making them tire less often and run a little faster.\n\nOverall I'm enjoying myself. This is one of the few games I actually wish I could get the soundtrack for, it is so upbeat and pleasant.", "timestamp_updated": 1499572833, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499572833, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34052725", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504508158, "steamid": "76561198069056188", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I was actually hesitant to buy this game, and so I waited for it to go on sale. However, I would say it is worth full price! It is a cute, fast-paced, fun and addicting game. You start the game and have to build your team, so you choose three dogs to hire. I got lucky with my three choices, since one is a great Lead dog, one is a great Middle dog, and one is a great Wheel dog. Perfect. You race, earn money, and can spend that money on hiring extra dogs, hiring extra help, expanding your kennel, and even breeding your dogs. Don't forget to pay your bills though! The more dogs you have, the higher the league you're in, and if you have any help, will increase your bills each \"month.\" It did start to get tough and I went into the negative balance for a few days. I tried to find a guide online, which said I could take dogs off my team, but I didn't want to do that. I love my virtual doggies! So I stuck to my guns and won race, after race, after race. Then, I just ignored the messages to hire help, hire dogs, or change leagues. I just kept winning races until I had a nice amount of in-game money and then I decided to move forward. I now have nine dogs, two that I bred. Speaking of breeding, it isn't detailed. You choose two dogs you would like to breed, and pay a fee to the breeder. Those two dogs will be gone for a bit, so don't be surprised. In about 2 weeks, I think, in game time, you get the parents back, and you learn what the puppy is...boy or girl, and their breed. Yes, if you breed a Labrador Retriever and an Alaskan Malamute, you will get either one or the other, not a mix. You then have a couple more weeks to try to get their traits (which is randomly assigned from either parent). After that, they arrive in your kennel and you train and race them as you would your hired dogs. Overall, I really do enjoy this game and I think the developers did a good job.", "timestamp_updated": 1501995275, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501995275, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34378723", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503404484, "steamid": "76561198262737463", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Cute fast paced game you can easily become lost in.
