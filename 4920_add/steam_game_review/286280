Really, the only choice for that is Steel Beasts Pro, which carries a hefty price tag and has very little in the way of singleplayer content.\n\nIn walks Steel Armor: Blaze of War. SABOW is an armor sim (you aren't required to memorize startup sequences, but everything relevant to combat is simulated as accurately as it needs to be) set primarily during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Iraq is equipped with the Soviet T-62, Iran has the US-produced M60A1. There are other scenarios in different periods, but they always use one of those two tanks as their player-controlled units. The game is really broken into two components: A turn based strategy segment, where the player moves around groups of men and vehicles around a large battlespace, and then a real time segment which plays out the engagements set up on the turn based map. The player is responsible, in this real time segment, for controlling units under their command to fight whatever enemy they've encountered, all while usually also commanding their own tank and tank platoon.\n\nIn the real time segment, the player can choose to occupy any position within their tank and assume the responsibilities of that crew position. Usually, though, you'll be playing as the tank commander, giving orders to your driver to move to different positions, searching for targets and then ranging them for your gunner to engage (there are no laser rangefinders in SABOW- the M60A1 has a optical coincidence rangefinder where a lens on either side of the tanks turret is focused on the target, determining its range, the T-62 has a simple stadiameter), then searching for more targets. SABOW gets across very well how difficult armored combat is without high magnification independently-traversable optics, thermal imaging systems, and precision fire control and stabilization hardware. Often times, in a tank versus tank engagement, whoever sees the other first is the one who wins, and the greatest danger to your tank are anti-tank infantry hiding in bushes with RPGs, or recoilless rifle emplacements which are only visible from range when they fire. Likewise, SABOW does a good job of conveying how horrifying it is to be in a tank under fire, hearing rounds thud off your armor plate while you desperately search for their source. Even being on the winning side is pretty horrific, watching the tank you just perforated with a sabot round creep forward for a few meters as gouts of flame pour out of its hatches, the crew climbing out while burning alive, put down by a merciful salvo from your tank's coaxial MG.\n\nSABOW has a lot of content, if you're into this sort of thing. Dynamic campaigns, an easy to use mission generator, as well as fixed single mission scenarios. You can even try your hand at night fighting in a tank, using your horrible gen 1 night vision to try and spot targets that are within arms length of you. If you're at all a fan of semi-modern armored warfare, especially if you enjoy either of the two player tanks modeled (keep in mind the M60A1 is a base model A1- no AOS, No TIS, maybe a RISE kit but that's mostly non-combat stuff), SABOW is worth the asking price.
