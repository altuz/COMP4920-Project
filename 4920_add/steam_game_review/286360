This is a four game series two of which have been released.  (Shadows of the Vatican Act 1: Greed and Shadows of the Vatican Act 2: Wrath)\n\nStoryline: James Murphy left the priesthood in 1996 after the Vatican's investigation into his mentor's death was less then effective and the Vatican proved to be even less interested.  In present day he is a medical doctor in Chicago, IL (USA).  He has returned to Italy at the request of his friend Father Cristoforo who has urgent and vital information for him.  Before Cristoforo can impart this information to James, Cristoforo is nearly killed when he fell (or was pushed) down a flight of stairs.  In Act 1, James is trying to find out what Cristoforo wanted to tell him by following the clues Cristoforo left for him.  \n\nGameplay: Classic type point and game with a strong linear storyline.  The space bar brings up small magnifying glasses for search areas or areas of interest.  Since it is based on a book the storyline follows the plot of the book, and dialogue is essential to follow the story.  \n\nDespite the 3D graphics most of the game has, the cutscenes are drawn comic book panels.  This in no way detracts from the gameplay and a simple picture or two progresses the gameplay quickly and concisely.  \n\nThere is only one actual puzzle, a maze more concisely, in this game.  It is a car chase! \n\nMystery, intrique, greed, deception and quite possibly murder, what more could anyone want from a thriller?", "timestamp_updated": 1451107456, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1451107283, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29250940", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528166", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1484395252, "steamid": "76561197997240220", "num_games_owned": 2076, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I deleted my first review and thought, ok I will give the second part a chance. \n\nStill have the same feeling the developer does not know how to make an adventure game.
