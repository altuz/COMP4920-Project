Its sound design effectively communicates success and failure in a manner befitting the 'zen puzzler' mould it is trying to fill. Its minimalism extends to interface in a way that promotes the kind of 5 minute drop-in gaming that makes these games so addicting. Still I can't recommend this game because it fails in the one place that really matter, it's a weak puzzle.\n\nFor the first 10 minutes or so I really enjoyed Strata, a simple but engaging puzzle format that seemed to have a lot of room for variation ahead of it. Then it hit me, there is a simple mechanical stratey to solve literally every puzzle of this format regardless of the size or number of colours. However complicated a solution may be it is always trivial to solve in reverse, this leads to the game quickly evolving into  busywork. Even for this low price with all the pretty packaging a bad puzzle is a bad puzzle and a thorough waste of time.\n\nI kept hoping that in the later sets the game would through in some new spin or twist on the mechanics, unless it appears in the final 6x6 it never comes. I feel like there is something hidden within this concept that could be saved, maybe a block type that is set by the bottom ribbon or requires a particular ribbon combination? In its current state the game is nothing but dissapointing.\n\nMINOR ISSUES: the game had a few navigation bugs in the level select menu which require a restart to make the game playable again.

Levels are sorted into 7 sets. Each \u201cset\u201d has its owns sub-categories. (4) One as an appetizer to start slowly and the others going wider and wider from a 2x2 size up to a 6x6 size. A sub-category can have 9 levels up to 36 levels!\nThe game is relaxing: it has no time limit for beating a level and the music is relaxing. The only thing that makes not the game too relaxing is that you can\u2019t undo your last move: you need to restart the whole level. Another relaxing thing is that the game plays a different sound every time you make a move.\nNow let\u2019s talk about the game\u2019s concept: the aim is to fill the canvas with the right colors in each cell of the table. To do so you have different colored ribbons to use in each row and column. To color a cell you need to overlap two ribbons, the last ribbon colors the cell. The game is pretty easy while playing a 2x2 size but become more tedious (impressive) with a wider size.\n\n(#) :\nDespite the great potential of that game, there is no new concept along the game. So after you\u2019ve mastered dozens of levels from each size, there is not much to play with to be entertained unless doing the achievements perhaps.", "timestamp_updated": 1468598410, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1468598089, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "11127254", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500615", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1402954684, "steamid": "76561198046036928", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Peronally I'm an avid fan of games that tease your brain and give you that \"Aaah\" feeling when finally figuring out the puzzle you're presented with.\n\nSadly I have to say that Strata disappointed me in that regard. Strata was fun for the first ~5 minutes while I still got to know the game mechanics and figured out how it works, but then it fell into a state where the levels got bigger and bigger, but I just kept repeating what I did before, again and again. Strata is very static and does not offer variation whatsoever. It is possible to complete a level in many different ways, but repeating a level over and over again just to find all possible solutions, from which many of those barely even differ doesn't sound very appealing to me.\n\nIf, on the other hand, your goal is to find a game that simply keeps you busy while progressing through it with time, but doesnt really present any difficulty, you might find Strata interesting, but for me the things that Strata has to offer were not quite enough.", "timestamp_updated": 1404784510, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404784186, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "10293690", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506237", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1416462547, "steamid": "76561198110942970", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Did you love Lyne?

It's a very simple game: draw lines on a grid, so every square is covered by the same coloured line. But here's the twist: the colour needs to be the same on the top. What starts off as a simple, easy game becomes a mind-boggling addictive puzzle. I could spend the same amount of time into Counter-Strike as i could with Strata. It's that good. Soon, you'll be matching up lines everywhere!\n\nBut gameplay isn't the only thing. Strata is beautifully designed, with clean, neat, paper-like formatting that is both relaxing to the eye and wonderfully complex. In addition, the sound is well done. Timing right with the game, it eases you straight into a position of comfortability and easy-mindedness.\n\nBeware!
