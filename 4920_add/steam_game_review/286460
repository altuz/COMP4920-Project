A lot of it is \"hidden object\" type of gaming and the objects are sometimes unfairly hidden IMHO. But something about the old style of this game makes it even more creepy, possibly more than the next two in some ways.\n\nBM II and III were produced around the same time and are more modernized, with better graphics. They are a bit more fair and a walkthrough is not quite as necessary as with the first. The protagonist can be somewhat unlikeable if you don't like happy-go-lucky drifter kids with Boston accents. There's an option in BM II and III where you can show all clickable areas on the screen.\n\nOverall good stories and puzzles, and a bit of a sense of humor. But mostly these are mysterious games where you are constantly looking for something, or someone. The endings of BM I and II are  very good, the ending for BM III is of course more final but also somehow less satisfying than you would expect (given we are dealing with dark magic stuff it feels pretty made-up.)", "timestamp_updated": 1505568298, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505568298, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34845153", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504974833, "steamid": "76561198006954043", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The game can pretty much be summed up like this:\n\nClick. Meet a beautiful woman named Angelina.\nClick. Take photos of Angelina.\nClick. Dream about Angelina.\nClick. Combine two objects in order to get to Angelina.\nClick. Go out on a date with Angelina.\nClick. Save Angelina.\nClick. Combine two objects in order to get to Angelina.\nClick. Break into Angelina's hotel room.\nClick. Search for Angelina.\nClick. Combine two objects in order to get to Angelina.\nClick. Read Angelina's diary.\nClick. Talk to Angelina's mother.\nAnd so on until Angelina shoots you.\n\nThe autosave-before-unexpected-death feature is a major improvement. It saves you the 7 hours of progress you would have lost in Black Mirror 1. I can even say that this is an effective anti-rage quitting feature.\n\nSome of the elder's voice-overs are still bad and slow. They are forcingly clinging on every word, talking slower and slower with every breath, sucking the life out of you. You will be a skeleton by the end of the dialogue. I recommend reading their lines fast and then click to skip to your lines, if you don't want to die young.\n\nThe game would have been a little more realistic if you would have had a truck instead of a pocket inventory. You can only store and transport items like chains, hoses, dinghies, ladders and clothes dummies in a truck.\n\nThe buildings and interiors are nicer than those in Black Mirror 1.\n\n7/10, passed my test, so I recommend it.\n\nIf you want to read the review I made for Black Mirror 1, you can find it here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexandrapripu/recommended/292930/", "timestamp_updated": 1505838707, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504986085, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 57, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 60}}
