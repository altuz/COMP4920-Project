The gameplay mechanics are simple to understand and easy to grasp, and I believe can be a great game for the family (relatively non-violent, fun, simple). \n\nThe purpose of the game is that in each level you are designated to help the Viking Brothers proceed on their mission by solving obstacles by gathering certain amounts of resources. The faster you do this, the better the 'rating' you get at the end of the level. The further you go, the more challenging the puzzles get. The story is fun, quirky and a bit funny at times. The character art in my opinion also is simple, cartoon but amicable. Because of the game's simpicity, it is an easy game to pick up and start playing.\n\nOverall I would give it a 7/10. It is a perfect, family-friendly puzzle adventure game that is great for the casual gamer, or to plug into a HDMI port in your TV and give it to guests or family for entertainment. It's also fun for the casual gamer who doesn't have too much time to spend playing games, but likes to play a little puzzle after work. \n\nThe downside is this game costs $10 (isn't too bad but really should cost $5-7 - try to get it on sale), and can be too simple for the hardcore gamer because it is not extremely challenging or detailed. The game also does not have Steam Workshop, so after you finish the puzzles there isn't much incentive to go back and try them again (except for getting a better rating, or reliving the storyline). This can mean your purchase has a certain life to it depending on how long it takes you to finish the game (but they could always add Workshop additions to the game, if they wanted to).\n\nIf they added the option for Steam Workshop to work with this game, $10 would be worth the pricetag. This game has alot of potential for Steam Workshop, mainly because people could create custom puzzles for the Steam community to have fun on, and create their own stories for the Viking Brothers to go on. If this happens, my score to the game would be 8/10, because it would have potentially unlimited replayability. \n\nBut as is, overall its a fun addition to Steam if you're looking for a fun puzzle-adventure game that is easy to understand and play; but don't expect something that will last you forever.", "timestamp_updated": 1404819467, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1404712751, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "15497109", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531574", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1429833321, "steamid": "76561197988012862", "num_games_owned": 3564, "num_reviews": 220, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First impression after 21/50 levels: the game is well done. Each level takes about 10 minutes to do once, more attempts if you want to beat the clock challenge, which is reasonably difficult.\n\nYou start each level off with a single worker who can collect resources that are lying around and don't regrow, and who can build resource producers: farms for food, mines for stone, sawmills for lumber, barracks for fighters, and upgrade his own house for more workers. Since building costs resources, the order in which you collect and build your stuff matters if you want to be quick.\n\nDo you want to be quick? If you are, you'll get \"gold\" on the level, and it is marked completed on the map, but you don't need that to progress. Most of the time, I'm getting silver on my first attempt; getting gold requires a second or third attempt with some thought about strategy and a learning process. But do I want to? Initially, I did. But there's no reward other than the satisfaction of having met the challenge (no Steam achievements, either). And you know, doing build strategy against the clock sucks for me -- one reason I'm not into RTS much is that I want time to think, to puzzle out a good strategy, but to do that I'd need to pause the game and review the data and issue my orders, but the game doesn't have a \"tactical pause\" like that. I do tolerably well without that, but I don't really feel in control enough for it to feel fun, and I'm not invested enough to go all out analytical and make charts of the resources required for each upgrade and so forth. So I stopped going for gold after level 7.\n\nIf you feel you'd enjoy doing real-time build strategy without the fighting, this game will provide a wide variety of reasonably difficult challenges for you, and you're likely to get a lot of joy out of it: for you, to complete the game \"all gold\" might be rated at 15 hours or more, unless you're a bit better at strategy than I am. (And you could still try to beat your times.)\n\nIf you just like to see small toons scurry about the screen at your beck and call whilst progressing through 50 very varied challenges (the map design has really been nice so far), or would like to have a game to come back to that you can play in 10-minute-installments, you can expect about 8 hours.\n\nMy playtime so far amounts to an estimated 4 hours, which is fine for the 1.50\u20ac it cost me. If you see it on sale or in a bundle, you could do worse than to give it a try. Recommended.\n\nThe game is DRM-free and runs without Steam.", "timestamp_updated": 1429746189, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1429743590, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "9974837", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510992", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1398811246, "steamid": "76561198044924596", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "This game was incredible boring without any challenge or pressure at all - even toddlers would get bored.
