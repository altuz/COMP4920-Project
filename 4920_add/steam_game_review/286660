It is not bullet hell either.\n\nIt is a runner? \n\nThe controls are kind of floaty and the pits you can fall through have strange hit boxes allowing me to pass through when I thought I would fall... \n\nThey gave the visual presentation some serious attention for minimalist neon look but it still comes off as somewhat cheap and underwhelming. \n\nThere really is little to recommend this for, so even though it runs as intended, it should still be avoided in favor of better games.
