A title which is based on novel book called Metro 2033 by russian author, Dimitry Glukhovsky. Later on, developed by 4A Games and published by THQ. Through my experience, i could say Metro 2033 was an auspicious for me. Because this inflicted an immersive experience to me which i enjoyed with very amusing mind. Now let me share my thoughts about my experience in few aspects.\n\n[i]8.9/10, A fierce survival experience with engrossing atmospheres - Aaron[/i]\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nSeemed like story is one of the iconic features of this title. I would say it's story wasn't that strong but kind of welfare. The story has been featured with post-apocalyptic theme. A journey of lone soldier who was grown in fierce and horrific atmospheres. Afterwards, he became a soldier and found himself in an immersive and survival journey which we are gonna experience. I thought the story has been represented flanks of distressful person along survival experience. Alongside, i could see the human nature through all the actions of all characters. This story has showed me what human has been doing for decades like excruciating innocents without even knowing their reasons. Even innocents can be noxious to protect their own lives because situation makes them. Human always sacrifices for their own reasons but not for others. Like other creatures or kind. That's been very unusual occurrence. So i found this is very artful in this story. Still this story has more segments to conceive and that would lift your spirits.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nGameplay, totally the major feature of this title. Honestly, i really loved the whole gameplay. Like surviving through an immersive atmosphere with variable creatures and hostiles. Alongside, there are some cautions which would make your experience more complex and aggressive. About combat, i got very tactful weapons to execute hostiles like AK-47 and Shotgun. You'll have more weapons to buy and use. Also you can dominate with melee attack when you'll be in more difficult situations. In game, you can easily compete with your objective from your given compass and map directions. Also you got lighter to find your way in dark situations. I guess lighter's really one of nonpareil things in this title. You won't be alone all the time though. You'll be accompanied by your allies in few counted chapters. But they'll be gone eventually. Like in most competitive situations. Through your experience, you gotta be very discreet about your ammo and other stuff like filters of gas mask, medikits. Most of the time you'll be using your gas mask to survive through that post apocalyptic atmosphere. So you need to carry out plenty of filters with you all the time. You gotta keep your eyes on ammunition as well. You can buy your ammo and survival stuff in very few spots. This is what makes your survival experience far more complex. So guess your survival experience would be very prodigious.\n\n[b]Visuals and more[/b]\nVisuals seemed really astonishing. In very motions, visuals looked so excellent after their remaster work. Guess this would compete with this generations's realistic creations. About characters, they were looking more absolute. Designed with gentle affable expressions and moves. About atmospheres, creators has put their very astute efforts to make a detailed and dull looking atmosphere. Like an atmosphere what would creep you out. All those whispers and roars of dark creatures used to scare me out. Because atmosphere used to become aggressive and even more dark whenever i heard \nfearsome whispers around me.\n\n[b]Performance and more[/b]\nI had flawless performance on this when i played it. Truly, i didn't find any kind of bugs, errors, crashes or any thing else you might face. Tell you what, i rarely face crashes and errors in any game but i won't say the same for bugs though. By the way, i'm getting unbreakable 60 FPS with highest presets. But i played on downgraded config like Intel Core i5 4590, R9 390 STRIX and 6GB Ram. Still had no deficiency. Just to be informative, Download takes 6.2 GB and then installation requires 8.1 GB of space.\n\n[b]Soundtrack and scores[/b]\nThis title has apprehended some spiffy background scores. All those scores has been perfectly matched with their dull and horrific atmospheres. Those scores would surely make your survival experience more intensive and immersive.\n\nSo folks, if you are still beware of this title then just put your eyes on it. As always i personally guarantee you that you wont be disappointed by this, only if you push yourself into an immersive and fierce experience like this. Obviously this is worth of it's price.", "timestamp_updated": 1506558541, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506555216, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34889873", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510963", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503323193, "steamid": "76561198296603950", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of the best singleplayer games i ever played!", "timestamp_updated": 1505162097, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1505162097, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35246636", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1496498919, "steamid": "76561198311434106", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is one of the best action horror games I've ever played ' Very in depth storyline and great gameplay .

The story is interesting, it engages you and you want to understand why everything has had a consequence. It happens in Russia where the humans were forced to leave the surface and now take refuge in tunnels (meters), consider the meters as their home and protect it, fight for it. All the problems that humanity already possessed, mainly social and political, are still in the subway. In addition to having to worry about the safety of the people you love within the subway against the evils there, you should also be concerned with what inhabits the surface.\n\n[MECHANICS AND GENERAL]\nThe mechanics of the game are simple but enjoyable to play.

On one memorable occassion a flying \"demon\" mutant swooped down to carry off an NPC, but they got stuck in one of the car wrecks littering the ground and froze comically mid-air.\n\nA couple of concepts aren't telegraphed very well. There is one point in the game where your progress is blocked by mysteriously inpenetrable spiderwebs and you're supposed to bring out your lighter to burn them away - something the game never tells you and is never encountered again. Another time a key piece of dialogue failed to play properly leaving me without vital information for dealing with a particular type of bullet-sponge enemy - if you maintain eyecontact they leave you alone. These and other frustrating moments had me Alttabbing our of the game to check guides which is never a point in a game's favor!\n\nAnd finally, the game has a good ending and a bad ending based on tiiiiiny moral choices you make along the way, which is in no way telegraphed!

Lo \u00fanico que no me gusto fue la masa verde que te encuentras al final del juego, es algo muy simple.\n\n[h1] Jugabilidad: [/h1]\nLa jugabilidad es lo que mas resalta de este juego, ya que el juego te da varias opciones en las que puedes  progresar en el juego, puedes ser silencioso y pasar por los t\u00faneles sin que nadie te detecte o puedes arrasar con todo sin que nadie escuche un soplido, tambi\u00e9n puedes jugar al estilo Rambo y abrir fuego a todo el que se te ponga en frente.\nEsta clase de libertad es lo que hace que el juego sea tan bueno, ya que Artyom, tu personaje, solo es un joven que tiene que entregar un mensaje, el no esta involucrado con las facciones, no es un asesino, pero tampoco puede dejar que lo eliminen, asi que esta en ti decidir el futuro de las personas con las que te encuentras.\n\n[h1]M\u00fasica:[/h1]\nLa m\u00fasica en este juego es excelente y se adapta muy bien a la forma en la que estas jugando. No se siente fuera de todo ni repetitivo, y puede llegar a aumentar el todo de suspenso en algunas partes.\n\n[h1] Historia: [/h1]\n[spoiler] La historia se basa en entregar un mensaje que te encomienda Hunter, este mensaje era una petici\u00f3n de refuerzos para las orillas del metro en donde se encuentra el hogar de Artyom, ya que una fuerza misteriosa esta resultando ser una amenaza para la humanidad, al entregar este mensaje al comandante Miller, este hace una reuni\u00f3n para enviar refuerzos, pero la petici\u00f3n es negada por los conflictos recientes con las otras facciones, entonces Miller te env\u00eda en una misi\u00f3n con otros hombres para buscar la localizaci\u00f3n de una base perdida con el fin de encontrar una forma eficaz de eliminar la amenaza.\nEs una buena historia, la cual te da a entender que aun hay esperanza para la humanidad incluso en momentos de destrucci\u00f3n y desesperaci\u00f3n. [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Veredicto: [/h1]\n\n3/5\n\nLa historia tiene sus fallas pero esto se compensa con la buena atm\u00f3sfera que te proporciona y la gran atenci\u00f3n en los detalles, aunque me hubiera gustado que Artyom tuviera alg\u00fan dialogo ya que las \u00fanicas veces que habla es en medio de las pantallas de cargas y unos comentarios en algunos libros que te encuentras esparcidos en los cap\u00edtulos, un dialogo directo con los personajes hubiera estado mejor en mi opini\u00f3n.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506646529, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506646529, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35463189", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500070", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507092792, "steamid": "76561198022255289", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 519}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "this is deffinetly better than than last light and i played that one first, i dont usually write reviews but the story had me emotioal at certain points unlike last light.
