Nothing more, nothing less. The features are identical and the gameplay a slightly polished version of what you know and love from your childhood. The scenarios are rather boring but you're not forced into playing them, and the custom gamemodes let you start off with max cash and just have fun designing your zoo!\n\nI do miss some elements I remember from the old Zoo Tycoon games I used to play, like being able to play with and clean your animals individually, but this /isn't/ the old Zoo Tycoon, so what can you do. \n\nIt satisfies your nostalgia itch perfectly, but it doesn't offer much more. It's addictive for the first few weeks you play it, but there's not much sense of reward in the long run.\n\n5/10. Probably not worth the full price, but a fun game short-term nonetheless.", "timestamp_updated": 1500357584, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500357584, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 15}}
