While I enjoyed the experience, I thought It could have been better if the devs added blood, swears and made the maps a bit more open.\n\nIf you are to buy this game, I'd strongly recommend you to play around in the .ini files to adjust the mouse settings and increase your resolution. \n\n+ Runs fine on W8.1\n+ I liked the story. It felt like an action movie\n+ good, entertaining ending\n+ good cutscenes\n+ Although it looks a bit dated, I liked the graphics and the sounds of this game\n+ oldschool medkits\n\n-- No blood nor swearing.\n- You have to edit some .ini files to really enjoy the game unless you like to play with mouse acceleration or a low resolution.\n- no checkpoints nor any possibility to save. You have to finish the whole chapter to be able to advance in the next gaming session. Luckily, the chapters are short.\n- You can't swap weapons\n- too linear\n- game is only about 3-5h\n- objects are popping up out of nowhere\n- too many intro videos\n\nFurther information:\n- Resolution and FOV fix: http://www.wsgf.org/dr/shadow-ops-red-mercury\n- Mouse acceleration fix:\n1.
