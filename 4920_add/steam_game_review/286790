Hell, it recommends Win 10 and a 1.8 GHz CPU. This is the original game and does not need that much power.\n\nI don't have a working flight stick at the moment, and was hoping the game would run with the Steam Controller. I messed around for a bit, but didn't get it working satisfactorily.\n\nYou may have some luck with Steam Controller with the following instructions. Thanks kalirion.\nSteam Controller for DOSBox: https://steamcommunity.com/app/353370/discussions/0/490123197951615840/ \n\nCan be mapped as keyboard+mouse.\n\nI have DOSBox, and run plenty of old software with it. For this game, the Amiga version was vastly superior. If I going to have to mess around with an  emulator, I'll go for Amiga. On Steam, I was looking for a quick and easy way to replay a game from my youth, without having to put a lot of effort into getting it running. So, for that reason, I don't recommend this title on Steam.\n\nIf you haven't played Falcon and/or don't mind messing around with DOSBox through Steam, by all means, get this game. It was a defining title in the flight sim genre.\n\nOriginal review below.\n\nI played the Amiga version when it was new. I was interested to see Falcon titles available on Steam. I purchased on Steam so that I could use my Steam Controller. However, the game actually launches and runs in DOSBox. The Steam Controller stick is not recognized as a joystick and cannot be used.  I tried remapping the stick to the arrow keys, but the game is unplayable with keyboard input due to key ghosting - you can't bank and pull up at the same time.\n\nNostalgia value, yes, however, not worth it to me, if it's run through DOSBox with no controller support.", "timestamp_updated": 1466814292, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1462234668, "votes_down": 17}, {"recommendationid": "23597407", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501459", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1466089523, "steamid": "76561198201057691", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "\n[h1] What is \"Falcon A.T?\t[/h1]\n\nFalcon A.T is a flight simulator game, players can choose from several different missons, and \"ranks\" as I will call them such as Colonel, Captain, and Major. Apparently according to the game this was made in 1988, the year the Sega Genesis came out in Japan and NES late era. The reason I brought this up is because the graphics look like early NES or Atari, but the more close up view which can be angled if you press a number on your keyboard are highly detailed and look 16-bit. (IMO) \n\nThe game can be a good game to kill time or if you have a laptop with nothing else to play, I would pick this up for 97 cents, I wouldn't spend it's normal price (6.99) to buy it though, Thats just a bit too much for a flight simulator made in 1988, but either way, I think this is a good game,\n\nMy score: 7.7 out of 10", "timestamp_updated": 1466089780, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1466089780, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2}}
