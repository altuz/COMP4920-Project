And it was kind of funny.\n\nLet me start by pointing out that the gameplay is shamefully shallow. You have pretty much one attack and will spend most of the game kiting (the melee mechanic is useless, and will get you killed). The color coded-enemies are a nice gimmick, but not enough to make you have to think about which button to mash.\n\nYou have to mash the button, by the way, you can't hold it down. It made my hand hurt.\n\nThere's also some elements that are really just lazy. Semi-random enemy spawn instead of custom-built levels. Enemies deal damage to you as soon as their animation starts, instead of having hit detection, which looks and feels really cheap.\n\nThe rpg elements are VERY poorly implemented. You get xp and level up, but that isn't meaningful because the game is linear and you can't grind. At least, I don't think you're supposed to be able to? \n\nNone of that is the real reason I couldn't bear to finish the game. Enemy spawns are based on movement, or something, which you have to do to kite your enemies. So occasionally you'll just get clusterfucked out of nowhere and wind up with a ton of enemies on the screen, and you with NO crowd control ability.\n\nWhat happens next is gimmick number 2, which locks you in one screen whenever there's a bunch of enemies around, and only lets you out when you've killed them all. This will often happen when a wall or a pit or something is taking up most of the screen, making you pretty much doomed.\n\nIt's not even stable. If a bunch of enemies spawn behind a wall (trust me they will) they'll glitch into it and become unkillable. You'll have to restart the level.\n\nMan, the bosses were GOOD. Like they came from a different, better game. But they really phoned it in for the rest of the game, and that's where you'll spend most of your time.

I didn't notice any upscaling option for the graphics, so Neo Geo quality is what you get. Keyboard controls are customizable, however, and there is an option for coop on the same keyboard.\n\nGameplay consists of color-coordinated top-down brawling that borders on the insanity of a bullet-hell shooter. You must chose whether to play as Pony or Biki (AKA boobs), and after the barest of tutorials (you can walk right past it) you are thrown into the game. You can throw blue shurikens and red ones, and will encounter red, blue, and purple enemies. Red shurikens kill red enemies, blue kills blue, and purple is immune. However, all enemies can be killed at close range with kicks. Any shurikens thrown at the wrong color will come flying back at you, so coordinating in the chaos is paramount. There are additional powers, coins, and watches to collect, and a constant timer at the top of the screen adds pressure that isn't really needed but dosen't really detract either.\n\nMy only gameplay issues (I actually find it fairly easy to ignore some of the worst \"humor\") stem from how easy it is to dodge INTO a group of enemies instead of AWAY FROM, and the extremely low frequincy of health pickups.\n\nSo far, CPHD is very intense and very fun.

I don't know much about them so I'll go off their word, but here's why I don't like it.\n\nMy biggest gripe is you can't strafe, you can only shoot forward so you have to be facing the enemy. This is fine with one or two enemies, but when several attack you at once, some shooting multiple bullets/arrows, you can't run and gun. You have to run and dodge and wait wait for a brief moment to turn and get off one shot, two if you're lucky. Then repeat until each enemy is dead and hope you don't take too much damage in the meantime. So common encounters of low level enemies become frustrating, especialy as most are bullet sponges taking about 6 shots each.\n\nThe controls are slow and lumbering. It feels like even moving out of the way of an arrow is harder than it should be. The combat doesn't feel satisfying at all and I only played level 1 but it was so boring! You just shoot slow moving shurikens against slow moving enemies and the kick is mostly useless unless you can finish an enemy in one go coz any more and you -will- take damage. \n\nThe difficulty feels hard not because the game is hard but because the controls are bad. I'm a fan of bullet hell shooters and the like so I don't mind extreme difficulty etc but with this I feel my skill is restricted the slow controls so I can't enjoy the game as I do with others. Just on the first level I felt I had to put much more effort in to get through than it needed. Again this might be coz it's from the Neo Geo and you're used to that or want that and that's fine. But with some extra work it could have been a much more enjoyable game.\n\nTL;DR - it's funny, got lots of pervy stuff, slow/dated controls make it frustrating and boring to play, is a Neo Geo port, can't srafe", "timestamp_updated": 1420308959, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420308959, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "18642730", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501025", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1414393707, "steamid": "76561198050719411", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "When this game was first released onto steam I wanted to give it a shot.

It's a beat-em-up in the style of a 90ies arcade game. Since Le Cortex was aiming especially for that style, the options menu is simply a display of the controls for player one and player two, as well as showing how to toggle fullscreen on or off. Concerning the controls it has to be said that when you play it with the keyboard it feels a bit like an arcady/neo-geo controller. So they nailed that really well.\n\nThe combat is fairly simple, but not that easy. As a ranged attack you have \"H\" with which you shoot red Ninjastars and \"J\" with witch you shoot blue ninja stars. In melee range both buttons can be used to take out enemies. You have to shoot the enemies with the corresponding color of the shurikens or else they will be rerflected and deal damage to you. \nThroughout the levels you can gather 3 powerups for the shurikens: Power, Speed and Fire. Fire incinerates and instakills your enemies, Power increases the damage of the stars and Speed increses your firerate. Sometimes you might also stumble accross a jutsu-pickup. You can activate it by pressing \"U\" in order to instantly kill all enemies on the screen. \n\nThere are 3 game modes, story, survival and battle. The story mode is the straight forward gamemode in which you progress through the levels as you gain xp for killing enemies. Each level is straight forward if you want to wander towards the end of the stage, but exploring will be rewarded with easter eggs and random chests that drop coins for which you can buy powerups in the shops which are spread across the stages. \nAnd if you think about just running past the enemies towards the end, it won't work, because as soon as you engage 7 enemies the so-called \"arena mode\" will be activated. In this mode you have to kill all the enemies there are, otherwise you won't be able to progress in the level. In my opinion it's a good way to prevent you from stumbling to fast through the levels. If you want to go fast, be careful or be quick at killing the enemies.  \nJust having played 2 stages I can say the enemy variety is great and will become even better when you go after the promotional video.\n\nSpeaking of enemy variety, we come to the second game mode which is the survival mode. In this mode you will be put into an arena with constantly respawning enemies. You will start out with the speed power-up on your ninja stars and 7 enemies running towards you. This mode is inherently more difficult than the beginning of the story mode, so I would play it after having completed the first chapter or so. \nBoth the story and the survival mode can be played in co-op, so if you want to have a little fun in retro style with a friend, it surely worth it. \n\nIf you want to beat the crap out your frind, though, you will have to fight him in battle mode. Having played some battles I can say this gamemode is really fun and definitely worth a try. \n\n\nSo, are there any complatins about this game? Yes, there are.\n\nFirst we have the anime style graphics. Some might call it \"anime bs\" or immature, some might find the humor and the artstyle appealing. I didn't find it that appealing, but this is more a matter of personal taste rather than factually bad things.\nAnother thing is, as stated above, the level design. As far as I have seen there is only one way towards the goal. Even though everything in this game says \"retro\" and there are a lot of areas to explore, having only one way towards the end loweres the quality of level design in my opinion.\n\n\n\nAnd finally the tl:dr/tl:dw... Is the game worth it's price? I'd say, it's a definite buy for fans of the genre as well as people that want a straight forward beat-em-up experience. Other than that I'd consider it buying if you have someone around to play it with. \nFor everyone else it might be worth grabbing at a sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1423346486, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405429216, "votes_down": 20}, {"recommendationid": "11305128", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498221", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1410231383, "steamid": "76561198009897749", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It looks like a heap of fun and the basic concept is.

Or they just didn't change much when they ported it to PC, however you want to look at it. I didn't mind it too much. You have an unlimited supply of blue and red shurikens. Red for red enemies blue for blue. Hitting objects or enemies with the wrong colour causes the shurikens to bounce back to damage you. Didn't really like it personally but it's different I guess. But after playing for a few minutes I found that I kind of liked the gameplay. However when I died I respawn back at a checkpoint which was kind of far back. I would have preferred that you just expend a life and respawn where you died. Even entering initials for a high you can't just type in. You actually actually have to scroll down the alphabet for each initial. Just old arcade games.\n\nAnyway I think if your a big fan Neo Geo stuff you are more likely to enjoy this game.
