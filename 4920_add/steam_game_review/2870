The team at Egosoft made a commitment to fix it, and they really did.  Unfortunatley, many players jaded by the initial launch are so angry about the initial launch they can never give the game a fair chance.\n\nThis is really one of the best space sandbox games that you will find.  Such a massive universe to explore.  So many different ways to play.  A few tedious and repetitive tasks, but there are plenty of mods to help eleviate that.  You can log hundreds of hours (obviously since I'm at almost 800) and still find new ways to enjoy this game.  Operate a fleet of traders, battle fleet hunting down bad guys, build a pirate fleet and destroy and loot merchant ships, setup your ship like a sniper with guided missles, or build an empire of space stations, or try to do it all.  This is as open ended as a space game can practically be.\n\nThere is only one significant flaw that still exists, and there is really no way to fix it.  One of the best parts of a space game is customizing ships, different ships, etc.  Do you want to fly a tricked out fighter, heavily armored destoryer, or man the bridge of your carrier?  You get one ship in this game, the skunk.  You can customize to an extent, but you just get that one ship.  Some mods allow you to sit in your capital ships and use them like a bridge/headquarters, but it's still limited.\n\nBuy this game and keep an open mind when playing it.  It is not X3 (the predecessor).  It is an ambitious game that had a rocky start that really clawed it's way back."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504904745, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509100", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34823147", "votes_up": 13, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198049386937", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1504900398, "num_games_owned": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4296}, "timestamp_updated": 1504904782, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I tried to play this at launch and it was unplayable.\nAfter the X4 Announcement i downloaded it again just to play through the story. this time it was playable.\nUnfortunately, because it meant i would play the game...\nThe UI is absolutely horrible because it's designed for a controller first and for actually getting used [strike]second[/strike] [strike]third[/strike] [strike]fourth[/strike] last.\n for example, the trade menu is pretty much setup in 6 buttons. \nB - to return\nX - to switch mode\nY - for details\nA - to confirm/progress\nRB and LB for switching ships\non keyboard that is assigned to 1 through 6 in that order. \nthe map is the same, just that 2 is zoom out, 3 is \"comms\" on a selected ship and 4 is zoom in....\nFighting is the entire and sole purpose of this game.

A lot of people don't like the addition of highways (inter-zone streams that allow fast travel), but I think it gives the game a faster pace and actually make the systems seem bigger (without having to crank up the SETA).  Being a light gamer, this game is perfect to pick up and play for a few hours at a time.  The universe feels huge and alive, I love that you can hire crew, see them physically and interact with them directly...its not the best first person experience which people complain about, but this game is mostly about flying in space and it is just meant to add depth to the gameplay.  I have been playing since this game launched, and yeah it wasn't perfect but they have made HUGE improvements that have made this into a great game.
