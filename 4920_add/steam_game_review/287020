Not because of the gameplay, but the subject matter. This is an adventure game for the first 2/3rd's of it. The game uses FMV videos so you will see very campy acting from human characters, however I think this fits perfectly with the games unsettling tone. The sound is fine, nothing stands out, but nothing bad does either, it's perfectly fine. \n\nThe gameplay starts as a point and click game and a good one. You click to navigate and to pick up and use objects. It has nice puzzles and although it can be hard to know where to go next, the town is small enough that it won't be for long. The last 1/3rd of the game is the stumbling block though, as it focuses on action. It's really bad. It felt too random, like I wasn't in control of the outcome. To be fair some of the best puzzles are in the last parts of the game, I just wish it wasn't bogged down by awful combat. \n\nThe story is the real star here. It was so interesting that I kept going even in the worst parts of the game. Everyone was weird in their own way and I really wanted to know why, as the town gives a weird vibe from the moment you step out of your room. And without spoiling anything the game dives into subject matter that can get...uncomfortable. While the game isn't the goriest ever, it was still hard to get through some of it. But it wasn't for tacky shock value. It's trying to make a point. And that point is probably more relevent now than it was when the game first came out.\n\nOverall this game is worth playing for the story. Just know that this game will test your will power because of the content and your patience because of the last 1/3rd of the gameplay  \n\n8/10", "timestamp_updated": 1500933448, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500320293, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33645892", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505438", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500446919, "steamid": "76561198150108179", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "definetly hits that weird part of the 90's where the media was really trying to push buttons on censorship.
