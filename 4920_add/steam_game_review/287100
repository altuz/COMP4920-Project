There is a bit of float but its nothing horrible...theres just nothing special about the game, it looks great though.  very standard side scrolling platformer/shooter with nothing stand out about it.  very hard to play more than one game over which is why ive got like 12 minuets total playing but i swear ive played this game maybe 20 times.\n\nA good game if you can find it dirt cheap just to have it.  Not worth more than $4.", "timestamp_updated": 1501264330, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501264308, "votes_down": 3}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 13, "total_reviews": 17}}
