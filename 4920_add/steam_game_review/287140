I'm a big advocate for these sorts of games but I just couldn't get it.  I know what was being attempted with this social experiment but it just wasn't engaging enough. I understand this is not meant to be a traditional game but it didn't give me enough of a reason to keep at it to experience what this game was meant to do. I support everyone who did understand and liked this game, I just wish I could have been one of you.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506304264, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506304264, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 39, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 15, "total_reviews": 54}}
