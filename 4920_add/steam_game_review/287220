However a few things i have come across in sandbox:\n1) Landing gear dont want to retract\n2) Cant disable pitch/roll on wings which made it harder to takeoff with a plane\n3) i dont seem to be able to get spinners to spin quick enough for a helicopter, they seem to reach a limit which isnt enough\n4) Parachutes dont seem to do anything when deployed\nIf these things were fixed then it would be quite a good sandbox game. if its just me being stupid with the things above and its just me not doing something right please point it out. thanks.", "timestamp_updated": 1505990243, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505990243, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35070143", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503441", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505846244, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_games_owned": 4956, "num_reviews": 1973, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Tags: Adventure - WS - Creative Walker\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Not much to say.

I assume this was just a showcase/test project for their sandbox vr title that they released much more recently.\n\nYou get to walk around a few untextured premade areas with flat coloring and mostly barren environments that float in mid air. Not too compelling. Placing premade objects is done through a surprisingly clunky and unsatisfying interface that constantly leaves you stuck in the interface.
