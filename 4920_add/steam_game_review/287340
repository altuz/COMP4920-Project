This is a good game but its not Colin McRae Rally.\n\nThe Physics are good but the collisions are weird.\nThere is not really a carreer mode, there is a campain but this is not enough for me.\nThis is a remaster of a older game, In a remastered game i don't just expect fancy graphics, i would have loved to see the collision model improved. Whats wrong with the collisions? you may ask. Well the problem is that if you hit anything you're brought to a complete stop and don't bounce off or something (Yes i know this is a remaster of a old game but, can't you fix stuff in a remaster? Yeah you can.)\nThe Graphics sure do look good, i love the reto style it has but it also keeps it fresh and modern in a way, the Hud is spot on and very clean looking.\n\nI rate this game a solid 6/10. But i do not recommend it because of the lack of gameplay and the collision model.", "timestamp_updated": 1501623014, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501623014, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 178, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 295, "total_reviews": 473}}
