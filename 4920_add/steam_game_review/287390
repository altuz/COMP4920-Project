Great story based on some really good books, a near perfect atmosphere between the underground metro systems and horrid landscape of the ruined surface and to top it all off excellent replay value. Each playthrough, this game manages to stay incredibly fresh. Note, my first playthrough was on the Xbox 360 release and I've played three playthroughs on the PC Redux version. There aren't many changes over the original, save for better graphics, tighter controls and some improved gun mechanics. However, the AI seems a little dumber than before, unable to detect the player in several situations. However, when you are spotted (depending on your difficulty) this game can become quite the fierce challenge. Even on the normal non-survival difficulty, this game can have it's trying points to the uninitiated.\n\nYou play as Artyom, the main protaganist in the Metro series and you take him on his continued journey after a friend of his, Khan, finds a surviving \"Dark One\" in the ruins of the botanical gardens that you unleashed several warheads on in the first game. No spoilers though, you find this all out in the first few minutes. His journey is much like Metro 2033, slices of lives and the hanging knowledge that the metro isn't just the last possible bastion of mankind, but how alive it's become with both the little lives of the people who inhabit it and the mutants and anomolous events which haunt the deeper parts of the Metro.\n\nThis brings me to both the atmosphere and graphics style of the game. Everything is perfect for what the studio strived to complete. You want an oppressive post nuclear world in which simply travelling to another station is a life or death situation fraught with terrors and unexplained events? Metro is for you. There are even points that rival some big horror games, if not almost out match them. Vivid hallucinations of the past, repeating endlessly, reliving the final moments of the nuclear apocalypse. Shadows linger in ruined homes, neither living 'nor dead, but trapped in the Hell that man has created. As Khan once said, \"When we set fire to the world, we atomized Heaven and Hell along with ours. The dead have no where to go, but to wander the Metro.\" Okay, I'm paraphrasing, but the gravity of this world is intense. Old world ideologies still pulse in the minds and heart of man, man against man, all the while the world slowly crushes the souls of the surviving human race.\n\nBetween the metro and the daunting surface, you can find yourself become almost lost at times. Not due to bad level design, but the confusion of cities that have been taken back by what nature is left. The environment works against you, blending together like the chaos it has become. When this game gets dark, it gets DARK. Assuming you set your gamma levels to a lower setting. The darkness of the metro is pronounced and oppressive, beyond it's already deadly passages.\n\nThe gunplay isn't anything special, but is assembles it's pieces well and that's all it needs to do. You can find a decent variety of weapons, between revolves and pistols, shambler shotguns and auto shotguns and a decent selection of assault rifles, along with some other goodies such as pressurized weapons that fire steel balls or a crossbow. However, the sneaking system feels almost OP. Enemies, even on more difficult settings, seem to have a hard time spotting the player, making sneaking much easier than it should be. But, this is corrected in the trademarked \"muck up cascade.\" When you screw up, you can screw up big and every enemy between you and possibly the end of that level knows your there and they're coming for you.\n\nNow I should note, there are two main difficulties aside from difficulties such as normal, hard and et cetera. Spartan and Survival. Spartan is more in the taste of a traditional shooter and much more forgiving than survival. Where Spartan you'll find a decent amount of loot caches and the such, Survival limits the amount of ammo and loot you'll find. On the harder difficulties, things like hints are gone and further up, your HUD can be either limited or removed entirely, providing a very immersive and realistic experience. You can die VERY easily on the Survival hardest difficulty, but weapons respectively do much more damage. Shoot an enemy in the chest, he isn't going to be doing very good. Shoot a leg he may limp off and bleed to death, begging for help as the life slowly leaves him.\n\nNow a more nuanced game mechanic here is the moral system. You get an unseen amount of moral points for completing hidden tasks, most are simple, such as listening to people chatter, finding stashes, going non-lethal and finding alternate routes through areas. These moral points also effect the games ending. Like Metro 2033, Last Light has two endings you can experience which manage to make you reflect on your actions throughout the game. Don't think like a gamer, but immerse yourself in Artyom's shoes and think about what really divides you between another ruthless killer or a good hearted samaritan. Many are nuanced, but some moral points are very straightforward. You know when you get a moral point, the screen flickers a small amount with a recognizable almost positive sound.\n\nIn the end, I've had an immense amount of fun with Metro: Last Light. If you enjoyed the first Metro game, or even like the STALKER games, I guarentee you'll love Metro: Last Light. It's worth every penny!!! And hey, you can get both Metro games in a dual pack as well if you're new to the series for only $30(USD). As said, I GUARENTEE you'll love this game. If you don't... well shoot, I don't know what to tell you other than you don't like video games.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Get this game!

Compared to its prequel, Last Light offers many more stealth opportunities in the later levels - giving you the choice to either sneak by enemies, kill them all silently without triggering an alarm, or just go in all guns blazing. \n\nWe also see a return of the 'Survival' and 'Spartan' game modes, of which the latter I am yet to attempt.
