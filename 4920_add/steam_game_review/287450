Despite its age RoN has held up well, especially when I am in the mood for a quick Strategic War. A full-scale 1 v 3-or-4 game typically will run 60 minutes {game-time} or less. I take longer than that because I <Pause> a lot to peruse and consider new developments; effectively making RoN a TBS.\n\nGamer may choose to play as one of roughly a couple dozen Nations {each with a unique set of units/advantages} and, in single-player mode, may select from among these nations which & how many, opponents to face.  [u]OR[/u] Gamer may let the computer assign the nations randomly. Difficulty level may be adjusted from \u201cpush-over\u201d Easiest to \u201calmost impossible\u201d Toughest. Pick a Map Style & Size and if the \u201cStandard\u201d settings are acceptable that's all you need to start. Otherwise in advanced settings, there are a large number of options including different victory levels, resource levels, technology cost & speed, beginning City status, population limit, etc. Also there are numerous Mods that may be added through Steam's Workshop. I like one that permits more farms per city & options for higher population limits. Gamer may create individualized maps or scenarios with a map/scenario editor.\n\nWhile RoN may not be quite as \"in-depth\" as Civilization, because of that RoN is a quick-to-learn game. Still, Gamer must develop and manage several types of resources & decide where and how to best build and expand one's Nation. There are various types of Victory depending upon the gamer's preferences or play style. There are Territory {% of world controlled}, Wonder {margin of Wonder Points over foes}, and Conquest {capture & hold all enemy capitals} Victories. Additionally, there are several special scenarios under \u201cGame Rules\u201d that set up alternative types of war; such as \u201cAssassination\u201d, \u201cPeaceful Tech Race\u201d, or \u201cMusical Chairs\u201d. RoN includes several Tutorial and Exercises style sub-games that are enjoyable to play separately for a quick RTS fix.\n\nRoN also includes what I categorize as a [b]RISK[/b] card-play style of war called \u201cConquer the World\u201d that has several scenarios. The gamer may attempt to match the feats of Alexander or Napoleon. You may want to win the Cold War as either the CIA or the KGB!\n\n[u]Cities[/u]:  Start with a capital plus 4 Villagers, a Scout, farms and a library to do your research. An alternate start is \u201cNomad\u201d in which you have only 3 citizens and limited resources with which to found your \u201cEmpire\u201d.  Cities are used to create new Villagers who farm the farms, mine the mines & cut the logs to fuel growth of the  gamer's Nation.\nGenerally more cities should be founded to grow Gamer's Nation. A standard Territory Victory requires control of at least 70% of the \u201cWorld\u201d.  The percentage may be adjusted. \nAdd logging camps, mines, more farms, caravans, fishermen, temples, universities with scholars and eventually oil wells to facilitate the RISE of [b][u]your[/u][/b] nation.\n\n[u]Maps[/u]: Depending upon one's preference, the  RoN World can range in size from [b]Arena[/b] {good for a 1v1 war}, through [b]Standard[/b] {suggested for a 4 nation conflict}, up to [b]Huge[/b] {after all RoN was developed by [b][i]Big HUGE Games[/i]![/b]} for up to 8 players. Basically if you want early conflict {like Ancient Age \u201crushes\u201d}, go with a smaller map as opponents find each other sooner. On the other hand, a larger map with fewer opponents would tend to result in later attacks due to delays in discovery.\n\n[u]Geography = Map \u201cStyle\u201d[/u]: There are 2 dozen map Styles available; from \u201crandom\u201d to Great Lakes, Amazon Rainforest, Australian Outback, Himalayas, Mediterranean {always popular for historical play}, or New World, etc.\n\n[u]Military[/u]: Build the barracks, stables, seige factories, forts, towers, docks, air bases, and missile silos that will enable your Nation to overcome your implacable foes. Start with slingers, hoplites, and light horsemen and gradually upgrade them through \u201cresearch\u201d to assault infantry, anti-tank missiles, and main battle tanks. Air warfare begins in the Industrial Age with biplanes that may be upgraded to stealth fighters in the Information Age. Bombers are added in the Modern Age and these eventually may be upgraded to stealth bombers.\n\n[u]Warfare[/u]: Create and field your army, air force & navy. Assign Generals with special battle enhancements to lead your armies. Send Spies to infiltrate and learn your foes' secrets or bribe their best units to join your side. Take advantage of the high ground or rough terrain. Dig in your troops on the defensive to reduce \u201csplash\u201d damage. Ambush an infiltrating force. Engage the enemy's army with a variety of \u201cformations\u201d to best take advantage of the situation. Gamer may allow an engagement to proceed on automatic or may choose to \u201cget down in the dirt\u201d and manually assign combat on a unit-by-unit basis to take best advantage of unit strengths versus a foe's unit weaknesses.\n\n[u]Resources[/u]: Food, Wood, Metal, Oil, Wealth, & Knowledge basically are limitless and renewable. Output depends upon the number of production {e.g, logging camps or farms} and enhancement facilities {e.g., saw mills or granaries} created, and the number of Civilians assigned to a given resource. A given source point does not run out but may be lost to an enemy that expands its territory to encompass it.\n\n[u]Time Line[/u]: There are eight stages of advancement from \u201cAncient Age\u201d through \u201cInformation Age\u201d. Optionally, gamer may start and end at any Age within that range of basically 4000 years. Each age brings with it unique new features and units.\n\n[u]Technology Research[/u]: Building and unit upgrades, as well as Age advancements, are accomplished through research done either through the Library by Scholars at gamer's University or at the various production and military buildings.  Effective management of this research is a key to building a successful Empire. Each type of research requires a different mix of resources and is progressively more expensive as the Ages advance.\n\n[u]Multi-player[/u]: RoN may be played MP on-line. However the latest version{1.20} appears to have made this difficult if not impossible. Version 1.10 still seems to function OK\n\n[u]Graphics[/u]: RoN has excellent 3D graphics for its units and architecture. The styles are different for each Nation  and are varied for each change in \u201cAge\u201d. Units and buildings are attractively and effectively displayed in 3D.\n\n[u]CONs[/u]: Army engagements may require gamer to micro-manage units to get the best results. Otherwise, the gamer may fall back to letting \u201cAutomatic\u201d handle the engagement.\nDiplomacy is rather simplistic. It does allow trading of resources among allied players in Multi-Player games and it has a cute set of 99 verbal Taunts to send to other players {or listened to for your own amusement}.\nAmphibious warfare is a bit complex {not unlike the \u201creal thing\u201d}. 'Phib Ops requires selecting units within an assigned-numbered \u201cGroup\u201d, moving that 'Phib Group into the water, moving the Group to the landing site with adequate naval protection, and ultimately transitioning the Group ashore in formation ready to attack/defend any opposing foe. Complicated but it can be quite effective when you pull it off !\nFor the time-being, Multi-Player with the latest 1.20 version is Borked. However, some players in the Forum say they found a way to make it work.\n\n[u]Recommendation[/u]: If you enjoy Strategy games RoN would be a good add to your Library; Easy to learn, Quick to play, Wide variety of play options. Build your Empire from the stone age up to the Information Age!
