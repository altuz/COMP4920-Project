The best part of the game is customizing your unit designs with newly researched technology and adding new buildings to your cities. Medicore Recommended 7/10, with the DLC which adds some stuff. catch it on sale. Not as diverse as Alpha Centauri nor even Beyond Earth but not a bad game either.  I had/have no bugs/crashes (so far) and I've never played it without the DLC so cannot judge the base game alone.\n\nThere are mods you can get for more factions and there are cheats you can find for the rediculous AI. And playing the base only vs playing with DLC is  amjor difference in the AI. But it is a beautiful looking game and you can work around problems to suit your taste and make it what you need it to be.
