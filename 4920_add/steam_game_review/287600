This game was frustrating.  Aside from creating horrible motion sickness if I played for more than 1 hour, the game treats you like garbage. \n\nMore than once I found myself unable to complete an objective regardless of having done so on previous weeks simply because doors were closed or the items needed were not accessable. I can't decide if that was the entire point this game was trying to make at how utterly useless you are that you cannot 'set the table' using a table cloth found elsewhere in the flat.\n\nI was genuinely interested in seeing this play through as a story, but the game mechanics were so distracting due to how unpredictable they were. Maybe I couldn't achieve all of these things unless I went back and did things differently on prior days, but there is no way I will ever try replaying this game to find out. \n\nI think this is one example of a game that would have done much better off as a novel.
