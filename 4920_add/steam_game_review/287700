This franchise has one of the most interesting and engaging writing that caries through from game to game. Without getting into spoilers I felt that Phantom Pain was some pretty dang cheesy writing ... \"Hamboogers\" that's basically all I'll say for now. There are HUNDREDS of tapes that you're supposed to listen to to get bits of the story and side stories that usually I wouldn't mind taking the time to listen because usually i enjoy the story, but these tapes are absolute CRINGE. Phantom Pain's story is pretty lame, and overall a let down compared to the intense nail biting cut scenes you'll get in other Metal Gear games. \n\nOK, now let's get to the gameplay. \n\nIt's great! Probably one of the best 3rd person stealth games on the market. The mechanics are fluid and you'll find yourself challenged in missions but not to the extent where you're smashing your keyboard in frustration like some other MG games. Theres a ton of content in the game too, staff building and weapon development alone is a huge chunk of the game. Side Ops get a bit tedious, but end up being a fun way to make money and add to your base/staff. I actually enjoyed the base building system a lot, although this may be something that could be critiqued as well as a bit of mobile phone money grab type of system (MB Coins) but hey this is the direction a lot of games are going, maybe if some people WOULD STOP GIVING THEM MONEY for this stuff, eh hem. \n\nFOB missions where you attack other online users' bases end up being the main interactive part of the game, but these are fun as well. I find myself looking at different ways to defend and developing certain technologies to improve mother base, so theres a lot more to this game than the main storyline which I enjoyed. \n\nAnyway, enjoyed the game and still a fan of the franchise.", "timestamp_updated": 1504628239, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504628171, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34787667", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500658", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503327769, "steamid": "76561198098017577", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is stunning.
