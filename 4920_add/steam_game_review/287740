I thought it would be something akin to a visual novel, and it sort of is.  The major flaw is that the story is just not that engaging--you're a witch opening a yarn store.  Okay, so it says that in the game info, but I expected lots of humor, absurdity, etc. given the concept.  Those aspects do not exist, and what story there is is very dry.  The game is set up to play like you are creating a movie, but you're really not.  Instead, as the other reviewer mentioned, you are just tediously clicking little icons of each character at the top of the screen.  Then you wait for them to pop in at odd places in your yarn store, a cartoon-like bubble of their speech pops up, you read it, and then repeat.  Over and over again.  In the screen shots, it looks like you get different settings, but I never made it out of the yarn store before uninstalling.", "timestamp_updated": 1397221837, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1397221837, "votes_down": 12}, {"recommendationid": "16209630", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500357", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1433531091, "steamid": "76561198152031977", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game has a cool idea, but it's too slow and it's a bit hard to keep interested in it.
