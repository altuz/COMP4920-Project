I\u00b4ve played TY-2 back then and this is a totally different game, so do not expect it to be like it\u00b4s prequals at all!\n\nAs a stand-alone it is pretty solid though and does not need to hide behind other 2D platformers. It is basically a fast-paced action platformer with alot of collectibles. So you basically kill-jump-collect. Sadly though this is getting boring pretty early, as the levels differ from each other just by their graphics, not by any new mechanic that appears. There are a few passages that will challenge your dextery, but over all this game is too easy in my opinion. \n\nThe graphics are toony with much love for details and I totally LOVE that! I LOVE toony graphics! So on my site, this game looks realy pretty. There could\u00b4ve been some more animations thought to increase that toonyness, but well...\n\nOverall, its a pretty valuable 2D action-platformer with toony graphics in the TY-universe, which has nothing but the characters, region and backgroundstory in common with it\u00b4s prequals!\nDue to repetitive tasks of collecting this and that without much difference, it gets boring pretty early.\n\nTo sum it up in a PRO/CON-comparison:\n\nPRO:\n\n- Fast paced action-platformer with smooth mechanics\n- The detailed graphics, expecialy the landscape and characters\n- 30 Levels with about 10-15 hour of gameplay plus 4 Minigames\n- Many collectibles\n\nCON:\n\n- Tasks get repetitive and dull pretty early\n- The story is more then crude\n- A few bugs that make the game crash or getting stucked\n- Overall the game seems \"unfinished\" or unpolished\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1505771036, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505771036, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35119612", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507073301, "steamid": "76561198064808866", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 277}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "looked fun and it is.
