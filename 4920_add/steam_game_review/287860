You keep weapons after restarting a level. Switching weapons is way too complicated\n\nOverall, the price of 2,99\u20ac is acceptable", "timestamp_updated": 1506005583, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506005583, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 13, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 23}}
