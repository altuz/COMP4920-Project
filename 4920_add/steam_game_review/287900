There are some classic pinballs where shooting ramps always requires momentum, but they usually have steeply sloped flippers so you're not screwed if you're playing from a standing start. This table tries to have the gently sloped flippers of a slower table and the ramps of a fast table and it feels poorly tuned as a result.\n\nThe goal structure differs from your typical '90s Williams solid state in that it's unusually long and serial. There are lots of time periods to reach and each requires charging the time machine with several T2-esque ramp-to-ramp shots and then locking 3 balls for a multiball mode. Time periods are gated by collectible crystals so that you have to do them in order. Seeing all the content would require a really long play session. So I guess if you're so good that your ramp-to-ramp flow never falters and you get sick of running out of goals on other tables, this is for you.\n\n(BTW, the video mode is excellent)", "timestamp_updated": 1504578550, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504578413, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 36, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 47}}
