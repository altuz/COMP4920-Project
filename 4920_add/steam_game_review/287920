Are you tired and/or burnt out on all the MMORPGs out, or coming out, on the market?\n\n2.  Do you want to play a game where EVERYTHING you do is an accomplishment and reinvigorates that sense of discovery you had when you played your first MMORPG?\n\n3.  Does the idea of an open loot system (you lose everything you are carrying when you die) fill you with a sense of excitement and adventure?\n\n--------------------\n\nOverview\n\nMortal Online is a Fantasy Sandbox MMORPG that takes familiar elements from games like Ultima Online and Runescape, and takes them to a whole new level.  The entire game is played in first-person, and there is no functionality to change the view to third-person.  All combat and actions within the game are based off of targeting with your reticle, so if you want to hit a boar in the head then you need to aim for it's head.  Character progression is based on skill points rather than levels, and you only have so many skill points to use.  You aren't safe anywhere, not even in cities, so always be on your guard, but don't turn into a jerk, just be wary.\n\n--------------------\n\nSkills\n\nSkills are broken down into a ton of different categories that are based on Parent and Child relationships, so a player would need to learn Armor Crafting (to a certain skill level) before he/she can learn Soft Armor Crafting.  Many skills you can begin learning just by attempting to do them, such as chopping down a tree or mining for ore, but other skills will need to be learned by reading skill books.  Skill books can be obtained from Libraries (for a price) or from the Auction House, players can begin reading these (some can take 8 hours or more) and the reading timer will continue to countdown when the player logs off.  \n\nI mentioned that you have a finite number of skill points to use, and in the beginning, you will burn through over half of these pretty quickly.  Don't panic!  You can lock skills that you don't want to increase anymore and you can even decrease skills you aren't going to use to get the skill points back to use on something else.  This can be confusing at first, but this really allows the player total freedom in choosing what their character does without letting characters become masters of everything at once.\n\n--------------------\n\nCombat\n\nCombat is based on using your aiming reticle and blocking or dodging the attacks of your enemies.  I haven't done much of this yet, besides slaughtering herds of innocent pigs, but I think it is very engaging, sort of a melding between Skyrim and Mount & Blade combat, but better.\n\n--------------------\n\nMagic\n\nNo comment at all on this, but it is very in depth, with required components for spells.  Healing magic, for instance, can require water.\n\n--------------------\n\nCrafting\n\nThe crafting in this game is intense.  I repeat: the crafting in this game is INTENSE.  There are spreadsheets and emulators online that help players calculate the required components to create other components to finally (maybe) create the item they want to create.  There is more than one way to make a particular piece of armor, and some components will make the end item heavier or cooler etc.  I think this is an amazing part of the game, but it is not for the faint of heart.\n\n--------------------\n\nPvP\n\nMortal Online works on a flagging system.  Here is the breakdown:\n\nFledgling: Yellow\nInnocent: Blue\nCriminal: Grey\nMurderer: Red\nHidden Criminal: Grey with Blue Stripe\n\nBasically, if you do something negative to someone then you will be flagged Grey, unless that person was already Grey.  The flagging system is one of the most important parts of MO to understand, so check out this Beginner's Guide for more information : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=519329793.\n\n--------------------\n\nConclusion\n\nMortal Online is a really in-depth game, but it is most certainly not for the casual player, and I don't mean the time-casual player, but the player that is more instant gratification.  If you want your cake and eat it too then this game is not for you, but if you want to bake your cake, eat some of your cake, then sneak around to hide your cake in the bank until you can share it with your guild mates then this game is for you!  \n\nYou can try the game for free, and all F2P Accounts can use skills up to skill level 60.  What that means is that you can raise your skills above skill level 60, but you can only use the skill at skill level 60.  I highly recommend subscribing to the game if you are 8 hours in and enjoying it.  The subscription costs less than other MMORPGs, and it is well worth it to support such an awesome game.\n\n--------------------\n\nGrimstein's Personal Tips\n\n1.  Buy the Reading Skill Book (yes, that's an actual skill book) and begin reading that right away.  That will allow you to read other skill books more efficiently.\n\n2.  Find a Guild on the official MO forums.\n\n3.  Get out of the starting city.\n\n4.  Turn up your graphics and other options as high as you can.\n\n5.  Only keep what you immediately need on you.  Bank your money until you need to buy something, and keep your skill books in the bank until you want to start reading them.\n\n6.  If you are going on a long journey, such as to join up with your new guild, bring along some food and bring everything you can with you.  Banks are localized, and if you store something in Tindrem, you will have to go back to Tindrem to get it.\n\n--------------------\n\nI hope my review helped you make an informed decision.  There is so much more to Mortal Online than I touched upon in this review, but I hope it gives you a taste of what's in store if you play.  Good luck, and I hope to see you in Nave!\n\nEvris Grimstein", "timestamp_updated": 1485795464, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1485795167, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "29951315", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508879", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1488336597, "steamid": "76561198099670667", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "LOVE THIS GAME!\n\nWhen you start off, the game feels dated, ugly and just a big buggy;\nBut when you get into the game and start to dig, you realize that the depth that it holds compared to other MMOs out there right now is unbelievable. \n\nThis is not a game that you can just jump in and casually play.
