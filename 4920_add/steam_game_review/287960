My friend has four character decks ($35-40) which he brings when we get together to play board games. This Steam app costs less than half as much but allows me to practice with 10 character decks against AI. Recommended for people who are looking for board/card games on Steam to satisfy that urge in between getting together with friends.", "timestamp_updated": 1503409724, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503409724, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 53, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 8, "total_reviews": 61}}
