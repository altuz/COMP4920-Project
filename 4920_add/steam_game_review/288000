I would for now put this game at a 4 in that it is a solid game with lots of improvement that can be added to make it a super strong game.\n\nps to the gamemaker you should make a zombe survival single player campagn like dying light or the new nighmare zombies mode in black ops 3. As that would make a great new game\n\nThanks to the new update i have to add some updates to my review. The new map is god but the old one was ok there should be 2 maps but i recomend this game now and the rating is a 4", "timestamp_updated": 1451753077, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448163280, "votes_down": 14}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 4}}
