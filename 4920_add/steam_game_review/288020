The game gives you lots of different guns and tools (which feel pretty varied) and expects you to use all of them if you want to win. The action is pretty solid, the platforming is extremely solid, and the boss designs are excellent. (My favorite boss is a human-sized opponent that constantly teleports around a room where the only ground are slowly rotating patforms, and mostly attacks as he comes out of a teleport). Music and visuals are also pretty solid.\n\nThis game is very hard and unforgiving of mistakes. Enemies and bosses do a ton of damage with every hit, and usually one slip-up in a platforming area will insta-kill you. Checkpoints are mercifully frequent, but you can forget about doing the game in one continue (and thus should pretty much ignore the lives). And if you aren't really good any one of the bosses might be a brick wall.\n\nMy only real complaint is the controls jump (though general controls are pretty tight). You can extend your jump by firing your gun downwards and double-jump by firing a charge shot downwards, in addition to a regular double-jump and a walljump. That means complicated platforming sections require doing way too many things at once--you have to double jump and wall-jump while holding down+attack, releasing attack to do another double jump and then immediately press+hold attack again to charge another shot. It's way too easy to do the wrong thing with the wrong button. It also means hitting enemies at the peak of your triple jump is tedious, since you need a fully charged shot just to hit them with 1-2 normal shots.\n\nIf you're ok (or happy) with extremely high difficulty, and willing to overlook the complicated jumping controls, I'd highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1496021734, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496021734, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "31833882", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504941056, "steamid": "76561197999567094", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A fast, slick retro platformer.
