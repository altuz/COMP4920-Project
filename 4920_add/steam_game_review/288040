I've been in a high-functioning state of depression for a number of years now, and find myself doing my best to plod along, taking each day as it comes. \n\nThe gameplay in Actual Sunlight is very linear, but that mirrors the way I feel on days where I'm not functioning so well. Those days are broken down into simple, often repetitive tasks, which I can find myself doing for sometimes days on end. The ending is relatively obvious very early on, and was emotionally difficult for me.

His work, like all our work, is meaningless and absurd, and only there to enrich the rich. He, like all of us, is trapped in cycles of debt and consumption. He, like us, is no longer a person, he is a consumer or a comodity or a tool. He is in despair, not because of depression, but because his society has sold him out. \n\nFor me, the saddest thing is that he didn't have the tools/resources he needed to build the life he needed and escape.
