Though you shouldn't have too high expectations. \n\nI would not regard this strongly as a horror game. Given how much of the game involves talking to ghosts (many of whom are disfigured), it unsurprisingly is a little dark with (no shortage of) murder in its story. A couple of monsters have an element of jump-scare factor when they attack for the first time, but it wears off into irritation. Initially the atmosphere made me uneasy, but after a while I relaxed as it became apparent there wasn't much concern of nasty surprises. Some of the time as she examines some of the items in the mansion Elena seems to be enjoying herself. More adorable than scary at times really.\nSo it's not trying very hard to scare the player, which can be good or bad depending how you feel about the jumpscare-fests some games that do try are.\n\nRegarding the issues I've found most noticeable, at least once the game has become unresponsive and the menu screen consistently has been slow to appear. How much of this is down to my own computer's limitations is unknown.\nI'm not sure why, but one puzzle involves setting a clock to a particular time. For a while I struggled with only getting it half a milimetre away from 'on the dot', only to seemingly accidentally have 'four minutes to' be accepted by the game as the solution (as opposed to what was very clearly said by the hint-giver). I've seen a video where someone managed to get it on the dot, so it's not a consistent issue.\n\nIt's pretty short (a handful of hours), which I think is for the better. Most of the game roughly follows a fairly simple pattern of exploring and backtracking to find objects or what they're needed for. So the shortness partly helps in that it means there aren't too many places to check if you've forgotten what needs a particular item. Then something tries to kill you once an area is complete. There are puzzles in the game, but they aren't designed to be all that difficult. I only missed one of the notes that tell the story, but from looking at the achievements there were optional hidden things I missed.\n\nThere are details I found likeable, such as the moment of blurring as you 'switch forms'. There is also a painting which markedly differs in appearance depending which form you're in (it's in the guest house). Although I found the gameplay irritating during the final chapter (there are four in total), the chapter was a pleasant surprise in a number of ways to me, which helped in the positivity of my final impression. \n\nThe soundtrack was okay and the art style quite nice, but overall I feel like the focus was on story and gameplay. I enjoyed picking up notes and reading about the experiences of the characters. Although it's not immensely intriguing, this together with the snippets from some of the random ghosts and examining objects give the world flavour and (un/)life. The idea of helping spirits of the dead find peace is something that appeals to me, so that's one aspect of the story I like. The explanation for the origins of the monsters and the malice infecting the place is also a decently interesting one.\nIt's more the puzzles that give the gameplay variation. Although I found it a touch tedious at times, the methods of progress overall aren't complicated. A highlight is the mechanic of possessing objects to move them (like a vase or a table), which I find a fun idea.\n\nSo.\n-Not much in the way of horror \n-Decent gameplay but would become repetitive if the game were much longer\n-Expect backtracking\n-Puzzles aren't very complicated\n-Story isn't stunning but isn't bland\n-Some nice ideas\n\n\nLinguist nitpick: does this look like morning to you?

That said, it's a very nicely done adventure game.\n\nOne thing I love is that the plot seem rich and well done, with the gameplay written to fit it rather than some wonky game concept with a plot thinly stretched over it. I was quite pleasantly surprised how well the plot was tied together. Granted, you play as a teenage girl so there is some awkwardness there in diary entries that felt a bit clunky to this middle-aged man, but I'm pretty sure I'm not the target audience.\n\nThe game itself is a side-scrolling adventure with *very* slight horror elements - and I felt they were well done.\n\nOn the downside, I play with a controller and this isn't the most controller-friendly game. Problem 1: it is absolutely impossible to change the game resolution with a controller. You can bring up a menu to choose the resolution, but once you do, you're stuck. If you're streaming the game to your TV (as I am), it means a trip into the other room to un-stick yourself.\n\nSimilarly, you can only navigate up and down in the menus with the dpad on your controller - the sticks will not cut it.\n\nFinally, all the in-game prompts show up as keystrokes, not buttons, so I had to experiment a bit with pressing buttons to figure out that \"[E]\" to bring up my inventory was the yellow Y on my Xbox 360 controller.\n\nThat said, the controller issues were not game-breaking by any stretch, once I sorted out the game resolution business.\n\nThe game is not terribly long - maybe 3 or so hours. There's not much replayability either, but that's to be expected.\n\nThe only other complaint I have is the cutscene artwork. This is where the game really looks its budget. The in-game graphics seem well-done and I love the presentation of the mansion, but the cutscene artwork is not up to the same level, and it's disappointing given that the rest of the game is solid.\n\nAll told, this is a good game with a few drawbacks. I'd rate it a solid 3 out of 5 if you set your indie expectations accordingly.", "timestamp_updated": 1504662459, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504662459, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 136, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 22, "total_reviews": 158}}
