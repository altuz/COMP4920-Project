I like Runners. I do not like MechRunner. \n\nI thought this game looked awesome from some clips of it and especially the screenshots, so I'm disappointed that actually playing it isn't an enjoyable experience, if not a complete mess. \n\nWhereas other runner games are fluid and you can rapidly dodge or take out enemies while racking up a ton of points, I found this to be incredibly clunky with a strange stop/go/stop/go gameplay to clumsily line up shots at enemies who are obstructing your path from you progressing past them, which kills most all of the momentum and enjoyment of swiftly dealing with enemies when the controls and abilities themselves seem pretty weak or inaccurate to do much with. \n\nI imagine you can unlock better abilities later but the game seemed to want the player to grind the same areas and enemies in order to unlock the cooler stuff you could later customize your mech with. However, what I had used of the mech's equipment all felt pretty bland and some of the enemies also felt incredibly generic i.e. \"mini tanks\" just plinking away at you with no real standout effects. The game when I played it didn't seem to have any massive boss type encounters as you might expect to find in other mech games, instead you're just kind of skating along dilapidated streets, stopping intermittently to plink away at the boring enemies and then be stopped again to do the same thing a few seconds later. \n\nSeeing its asking price right now (and I had gotten it on sale) I don't find myself likely to recommend anyone else bother to spend their time or money with this -even diehard mech fans-as it's more of a chore to play and its effects and overall pace are pretty wack.", "timestamp_updated": 1496912104, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496911531, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 6}}
