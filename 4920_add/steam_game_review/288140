However, that's where the good ends.\n\nI could not get to grasps with the motion swing at all. Too many variables to get right to hit a 'perfect' swing and the smallest of errors with timing or mouse movement cause a hook shot of note. I even tried the 'ruler' trick to try to get the movement staright at least but timing issues again produced nothing but hooks.\n\nSo 3 click swing it is. In 'begginer' and 'amateur' 3-click is manageable. You do really need to be close to the mark on the downswing of the meter but I found it quite playable. Pop the game up to 'pro' and this changes completely. A pixel either side of the marker on the downswing and its off into the bush, rough or water. I played through 9 holes and hit the fairway once. Totally frustrating gameplay.\n\nOk, so I'll stick to 'amateur' then. After having completed quite a few solo rounds I decided to have a look at the other game types. Tournaments looked promising at first. I liked the idea I can play at my own pace and compare my score to others. However, for the 20+ hours over a few days I have played this, only one tournament has been available on a course that is not included with the game that I would need to purchase. Nope.\n\nRight then, multiplayer. Lobby is almost empty each time. Max 30-40 players while I am checking (UK GMT day time). Most on courses I dont have or need to pay for. There simply aren't the numbers playing to make it viable for a range of play types and players.\n\nIt's a shame, I played TW from TW 99 on Windows 98 through to PGA Tour 2008 and the multiplayer stroke play was great fun. I was hoping I had found it again but alas, no. The golf club with no click swing and inconsistent swings is no better either.\n\nSo that's that. I had really high hopes on my initial play through but as I delved deeper into the game it became overly difficult making it unplayable at the level I wanted and I don't want to have to pay for every additional course.\n\nNot recommended, sorry.", "timestamp_updated": 1504011160, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504011160, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33434985", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501823", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1499704118, "steamid": "76561197970225416", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I wouln't want anyone to suffer this game, not even Hitler. \nNo proper tutorial, no proper customisation, micro (and no so micro) transactions. \nGTA V is 100 times the golf game this is.", "timestamp_updated": 1499704194, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499704194, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "33577864", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506404", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507102206, "steamid": "76561198370083324", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 174}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is better than it's  reviews may entertain. When your talking SIM, this is as close as you can get with any golf game on the market. The ability to score takes skill, knowledge of golf, and desire. After playing 18 hrs I have finally begun to get down to just about par. \n\nAfter playing wgt, twg, and other games, this one by far takes golf SIM to new heights with their new swing motion. I am enjoying playing this game more and more, and have over 130 courses at my disposal. I can understand why some get frustrated, they do not have the patience nor will to gradually become better. Instant gratification is what most desire in today's fast pace world. This game definitely evens the field up, and people don't like that as well. \n\nBall effects for differing course agriculture may be better in the future, hopefully. I have seen that cart paths do not quite bounce the ball enough, ruff tends to slow the ball down a little but not enough. Trees do very well in deflecting balls correctly in this game, I love that aspect. Greens react quite well, and I am yet to see an animal exploded from my launched ball. The courses that others have made are first class, and there are many of them. Options for in game settings are awesome. \n\nOverall, this game takes some time to get good at.

I'll try to explain why concisely;\n\n- Simple, functional, easy to use multiplayer lobby system.\n- Tons of downloadable courses that are as good or better than the ones that come with the game's original install. 98% are free! Just takes a bit of time and work to download them.\n- Different control schemes available, as well as different difficulty settings for them -- this critical feature absent in some other big golf games allows you to learn and enjoy a course, the physics of the game, and playing with friends independently of your progress at mastering a particular control scheme or mechanic. This makes the game accessible, allowing you to up the difficulty yourself as you improve and learn the game -- players just need to take advantage instead of playing at too hard a difficulty level and then blaming \"bad controls\" which I see a *lot* of in other reviews below. Some seem unable to stomache that \"Amateur\" is actually a hard difficulty level just because of the word.\n- Great overall gameplay & physics, good enough graphics [gameplay is just far more important].\n\nWhere it has room for improvement:\n\n- Stability; game has crashed a few times at the end of a multiplayer round, and less frequently but a few times have run into freezing/can't-continue type issues in the middle of a multiplayer game.\n- Speed/smoothness of online gameplay; there are endless \"click to continue\" type popups after every shot, every 9 holes and etc. This mechanic just slows down the speed of online gameplay and becomes more and more of an irritation over time.\n- Speed/smoothness of online gameplay; there are just numerous delays between everything in this game and no attention at all in general paid to making the game run smoother, faster, and have any respect for people's time during multiplayer play. You should be able to at least enable an option to skip or speed up the viewing your own shots, and the time inbetween shots is just gratuitous sometimes. Even 18 holes with a couple friends can often be a 2+ hour affair.\n- Progression? Stats? Career? Online ladder? Ranking system of some kind? Unlocks based on achievements and ranks? \n- Why not incentivize using more difficult control settings via the non-existent but hope-for-in-the-future systems of progression, achievements, rankings, and unlocks?\n-Looking through the negative reviews a majority of them are frustrated because they simply cannot figure out how to set the difficulty of the swing to a good balance that challenges them a bit without being overly frustrating, and can't figure out/can't-be-bothered-figuring-out how to download and install the many popular 3rd party courses, the vast majority of which are free. Why not integrate a course-browsing/rating/viewing/downloading system into the game? Why not integrate a feature that adapts your difficulty settings for swings to a point where you can semi-consistently hit fairways but it still leaves some substantial difficulty there so you can improve?\n\nI'm really looking forward to the sequel to this game. Hopefully it can make the gameplay smoother, faster, more stable -- and even add some elements of progression. I think that would be a huge success and very popular.
