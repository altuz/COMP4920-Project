It is both bonkers and brilliant, as entertaining as it is unique. People who love to explore genre smashup are in for a treat. RTS and flicking seems counter-intuitive but Conflicks pulls it off brilliantly. \n\nThe game is polished to perfection and slickly presented. Despite the absurdity of the setting, it actually offers compelling strategy and tactics. There are lots of diverse units and terrain with truly unique powers. \n\nMost games tread down all too familiar paths. Conflicks boldly blazes a trail into uncharted territory. The result is a smashing success, not is sales numbers, but is pure game design brilliance, excellence and innovation.", "timestamp_updated": 1499807839, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499807839, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 27, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 34}}
