Game is not bad, but it's really ugly compared to the original with washed out colors, low resolution shadows & an ugly blur effect.

The core game remains intact from the story to the gameplay & visual art direction but muddy colors & low quality textures & shadows make this one seem like a lazy mixed bag.  The 3D models look great, but not a ton better than the original.  It's a lot better looking after I spent time figuring out where the ini file was on win10 (it's not in the wellingtongame folder btw) & tweaking it then getting sweetfx working, but seriously why do I have to do all that stuff just to get a decent remaster on PC?
