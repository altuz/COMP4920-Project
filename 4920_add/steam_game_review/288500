The game is a reasonably decent, old-school point-and-click puzzle adventure, but most players aren't likely to find the puzzles much of a challenge, to put it mildly. I tend to be easily flummoxed by puzzles and these were cake. Gameplay is very basic and it's all super linear. (Though to be honest, I didn't play the game on the highest difficulty setting, so they could be much more challenging there.)\n\nMostly I think the game is going to be slammed with charges of racism, which won't be entirely unwarranted (however much the developers might not have intended it). You play a white blonde woman whose destiny is to save the world. All the black NPCs are portrayed as feather-and-loincloth wearing savages \u2014\u00a0even the ones who live in a city on a floating airborne island with magical technology (that for some reason only White Girl can use).\n\nSo it's an okay puzzle-fest with fairly nice graphics, but one that's likely to be slagged off for reasons having little to do with its gameplay.
