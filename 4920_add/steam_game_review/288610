I some how feel while i played this game that it belongs on my Facebook, and i keep expecting to sign into Facebook book and see my timeline spamed with Kingdom Tales 2 propaganda. If this game was made by anyone it was the North Koreans.. simply because they have no idea whats going on outside in the real world and live in 1999. \n\nWould i advise you to waste any amount of money on this game.. NO.. this game is for a 3 year child that is just entering the world of RTS games. Sometimes i wonder how steam allows crap like this on their system, its like getting robbed of your hard earned dollars for recycled crap.", "timestamp_updated": 1407422607, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1407421471, "votes_down": 37}, {"recommendationid": "16612727", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489866", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1435036617, "steamid": "76561198052385302", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "This is a fun little game. Takes 3-4 hours to beat it, but if you pick it up for 2 or 3 dollars its worth it. You could definitly go back through it to master it on expert if you wanted to.
