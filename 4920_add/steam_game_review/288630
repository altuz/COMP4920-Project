If this was part of a series I might consider recommending a package, if it was cheap, but for the moment, I would say don't buy.", "timestamp_updated": 1405461835, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405461547, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "19420678", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524268", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1448996538, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "num_games_owned": 2214, "num_reviews": 352, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Taryn Sharpe was tasked to interview a chief in Paris and ended up to investigate his murder, along with the photographer George Haske. In the end, well, she will live the adventure of her life!\n\nThe plot, while interesting, is missing something: good writing. I was bored during all the game because of a love triangle, then, which is in reality more complex, without forgetting the great names that were chosen for the characters (come on, Chou as name?). By the way, why have two characters icons if you can't switch between them?\n\nI don't mind list of items on list of items as I'm used to this gameplay but after a moment, when the plot is boring or when you're passing from scene to scene without a lot of search, you're suffering from that. Some items aren't even easy to spot and the rare minigames are too easy.\n\nAlso, the game is too short too. More or less one hour. For the price, it's too little.\n\nI wanted to give the game a chance but in the end, apart the correct graphics, the correct soundtrack, the rest is boring. I'm sorry for the thumb down but I didn't really enjoy the game.", "timestamp_updated": 1448998914, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1448998914, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "11252953", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498433", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1405490192, "steamid": "76561198032161980", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First impressions:\n\nI've played it for just under an hour. It's not completely terrible, I'll recommend it but It's not that good.\n\n(optional let's play footage - you can skim over this if you want to see what the is like)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X15XljNSYM\nYou are supposed to be investigating a murder, you undertake this by searching for random objects for some reason (probably because it's a game lol). You have to do some pretty silly things to progress. For example you come across a man distraught after the murder, who you need to find a drink for. What do you? Well you find some lemons from the dumpster combine them with a jug of water also found in the rubbish. Viola! you have a nice drink for the poor guy lol. Occasionally there are other kinds of activity you need to undertake such as mixing liquids to get the right colours. I actually had to skip that one because I couldn't figure out how to get it to work.\n\nThere is basically no animation in this game, everything is static. The closest thing are people of interest who slightly expand and contract for some reason lol. The actual random object parts are an ugly mess to be honest. But what can you do? The developers have to make it difficult for you to find objects. One thing I could say about the presentation that I kind of liked at least at the start was the music in the game, it was nice but I think it became a bit repetitive.\n\nSo this was actually my first time playing one of these random object games. I've watched Total Biscuit play them before. He wasn't too fond of them. I'd say he's about right in feeling that way, I didn't really like this game. And for what it is, I think they should lower the price.\n\nThere are other sort of point and click adventure type games that I would prefer to play over this. My favourite of all time is Full Throttle by Lucas Arts games, you play as the leader of a bikie gang. I loved that game. But it's pretty old now and not available on steam. Another game that comes to mind is the recently released (on steam) Soul Gambler. That game was really good and is an interactive graphic novel based on the classic tale of Faust, but it's pretty short.\n\nClick [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032161980/recommended/313020/]here[/url] for my review and let's play videos of Soul Gambler. I think most people would like that better than this game and it is only $4.49USD right now.\n\nClick [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SatanovichZ1/videos]here[/url] for more let\u2019s play videos =)", "timestamp_updated": 1405489664, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1405460113, "votes_down": 8}, {"recommendationid": "17687712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492066", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1487474699, "steamid": "76561198232989056", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "TO SHORT AND NO VOICE WHEN THEY TALK.
