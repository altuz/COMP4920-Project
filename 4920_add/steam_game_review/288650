It has the sound and feel down plus a lot of the recognizable cars from my youth are recreated without the licensing. The only negative to the game is that you use the mouse to adjust the throttle (by clicking and dragging a notch on a powerbar). It works but the trigger of a controller would be much more natural and there is no option for it unfortunately. In fact, this is so much fun that I wish they offered a USB classic slot controller to use with the game. While this is an extreme nostalgia niche, I think they will find a loyal audience and I hope they open up Steamworks so people can mod in their own favorite content like favorite car bodies and glow in the dark track sections, zero G cars and the track accessories like lap counters, timers, cops and robbers sets, etc. $12 to revisit my youth and remember many good times with my brother is absolutely worth it.

First off, it's fun. Single player mode offers some neat tracks and they have interesting scenery as well for slot cars. My wired xbox controller works great (feels just like a slot car trigger) but the mouse can be used with some success as well. \n\nTriple screens work fine for me, albeit in 768p, no 1080x5760 available for 3 monitors - still the game looks good. I've played through novice mode which was preetty easy once i got the hang of it, but the good news is medium and advanced have all new tracks! I should note some of the menus were a bit scrambled in 3 monitor mode - not the most intuitive interface but i was able to do what i needed to do.\n\nThe track editor works, but was a bit aggravating to use. I still managed to complete a large track and share it. \n\nThe music is great! If you are a modern metal fan you'll enjoy it, and even if not it suits the subject matter well.\n\nOverall for $20 i'd say this is worth it - fun little game, fun to watch, my son enjoys sitting with me while we play this. Its a little rough around the edges, but in the end works as advertised and has a nice fun factor.
