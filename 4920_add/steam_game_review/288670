The areas were well done, it actually felt like something was at stake in the game. I had to skip some of the puzzles because the controls were a bit wonky, but it's a small quibble for something that was otherwise quite fun. \n\n...is there some rule I don't know about that a casual HO game must contain two pieces of flint that start a fire?  If all you needed was moving flint, mountain ranges would be spontaneously combusting death traps. Oh, well.

Immersive, with a storyline that added just enough purpose without being intrusive (I hate games that have tons of dialogue). The animation is beautiful, a cross between cartoony and realistic. It was generally clear what to do with objects and how to progress. The mini-games were great, too -- it has the traditional mix of create-a-pathway, do a puzzle, follow the pattern, etc. but has some different twists. Just challenging enough to make me work, but not enough that I gave up or resorted to the walkthrough (okay, I did that once, but because I missed a hot spot...my only complaint is that the \"hot spot\" areas are very big, like an entire wall -- so if there are two close together, you might not find the second one because you're thinking, \"that magnifiying glass will give me the same close-up I've gotten 10 times already, so what's the point?\" but that's minor). I liked that you could customize your difficultly level. Unexpectedly, this HOG/Adventure game has four \"boss\" levels where you have to mix speed, accuracy, and problem-solving. Definitely got my heartrate up! Decent length, too.
