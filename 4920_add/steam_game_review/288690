I started the story mode on normal difficulty, skipping most of the text to get to the puzzles I want. Most of the time, the grids were only missing 1 or 2 numbers a box which made it seem kind of redundant for a challenge. \n\nAfterwards I decided to go into free Play, and tried to play a \"Hard\" sudokuball puzzle, I was able to complete it in about 20 minutes which disappointed me being a sudokuball puzzle. Essentially solving one of the 3x3 grids made the rest of the puzzle just fill in the blanks. \n\nAs a detective game, there isn't even any challenge, just solve the sudoku and you pretty much solve the game. \n\n3/10", "timestamp_updated": 1400289677, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1400289677, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "10165376", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511451", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1400458397, "steamid": "76561197967680889", "num_games_owned": 639, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Oh God... I wanted it to be good, but it's baaaaad.\nOn the surface it's a little like Safecracker or Puzzle Agent in the, you're a detective of sorts, solving sudoku over puzzles to unravel some mystery, shenanigans. However, the comparison stops there.\nThe resolution options are low, medium, high, wide. I mean come on. What century is this?\n\nOk, so I only messed around in story mode for a short while but the story was pretty uninvolving if I'm honest. The controls are a bit dodgy too. I dropped my mouse sense to 800dpi and it was still difficult to get levels and puzzles to lock into place.\nThe final nail is that the puzzles are laughably easy. Maybe it gets harder later on but I soon grew bored of facing yet another grid where there's really only one square to solve.\n\nIt just feels a bit lacking. More could have been done with this.\n\nAnd then it hit me. How can you get a simple click and drag control system so wrong? The only possible explanation is that this game was never designed to use a mouse as an input device. The evidence starts to mount up and now I feel like an actual detective. The resolution options, of course! This game was never built for PC. It was built for a smartphone, that's why the cutscenes use still images and have no voice acting.\n\nIt all becomes clear. This is a half-arsed mobile port and suddenly, the price tag that seemed reasonable starts to feel like a massive ripoff.", "timestamp_updated": 1400499952, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1400459236, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "10140473", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494083", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1400270072, "steamid": "76561197960332616", "num_games_owned": 4480, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Main Story is beatable in 1-2 hours. very easy for a Sudoku game. There's few gamemodes within Sudoku in Story mode:\n Clue find - Regular Sudoku without time limit, fill the big square with ? marks.\n Inspection - Fill the entire Sudokus(9 big squares, 81 tiles) several times Within time limit.\n Lockpick - Fill the center tile with correct number(4 wrong number to fail), Within the time limit. \n Chase - Fill the tile with red footprint. Taking more time = more tiles to deal with.\n\nThe ball rotation with RMB is hard to control, thus it would frustrate you in timed levels.\nOther than that, control is quite generic for sudokus(number keys and - key work and recommended)\n\nI've been a fan of connected sudokus(those are connected at corners), but in Main Story mode they haven't fully used its goodness.\nIn Classic mode it's used well, and plays better than 4 minigames Story mode offered. \n\n7/10, Get it only if you like Sudokus.
