But somehow, i was still disapointed by it\n\nIf this game was a \"early access\" games, i would probably forgive it for its multitude of sins. But apparently THIS IS THE FULL GAME. The full game has only a campaign mode that plays kind of like the game \"Simpsons Hit and Run\" if you took out EVERYTHING that made that game charming. All it is, is a \"do various flavors of a driving mission, dont collect X, collect Y\" and attempt to keep the brain damage at bay.\n\nAfter beating a mission you are rewarded with a handfull of currency, in which you can buy all of 2 or 3 things TOTAL. You can upgrade your (stat-less) tractor with \"quicker engine\" and \"better brakes\" OR you can drop ungodly large amounts of moeny and get a new (still stat-less) tractor.\n\nThe power-ups are mostly \"power downs\" as you can get spun out (oil can), reverse your steering controls (whiskey/moonshine bottle) OR can speed you up with what is probably supposed to feel like turbo (a barrel). \n\nAlso, the \"hillbilly rock\" soundtrack gets very old, VERY quick\n\nOnce you grow sick of the campaign (which will happen VERY quickly) you are left with nothing else to do except exit the game and try to come to terms with wasting 2 bucks on such a game that would only be suitable as a FLASH game.\n\n\nTL:DR\nDo you like racing games? If so, dont buy this game as you can go to a flash game site and get much more enjoyment out of a free game. \n\nIf not, really really do not buy this game\n\n\n3/10", "timestamp_updated": 1398705884, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1398705827, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "9968594", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532126", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1400670019, "steamid": "76561198022927031", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "This game shouldn't exist.
