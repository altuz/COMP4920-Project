While Hotel may have soothed my craving for a good PNC, by no means did it satisfy me. \n\nPros:\n1.) Graphics are pretty decent (which you love to see in a good PNC).\n2.) There are a few unexpected twists.  \n\nCons:\n1.) The puzzles are so easy that you don't have to think very much, or at all, to pass them.\n2.) The story goes from \"weird\" to \"wtf\" really quickly. Plus, the character development is very weak and predictable. \n3.) This game is SO short. I completed this game is 2 hours and that's with me taking my time. Look at the other reviews, no one takes very long to complete this game. \n\nAs a rule, I think that PNC games tend to only be worth as much as: (1.) Hours put into the game, (2.) Strength of the storyline.

It is a low budget game from a company that uses to publish low budget games in general so...\n\nIn graphics the things are like a little older from the starting 3D games. At least you'll see curves. The sketches are allright and the photos very good. The game does NOT support widescreen resolutions and actually NOT HD quality. Moving around is in good motion, not perfect but good and now the actions are common to the most adventure games, like things taking etc. Few videos will be seen and their quality is very low even for the of 2010 year that Steam published it. But anyway it's an adventure.\n\nThe sounds and music are good. At least they used a studio for making it. It is not the greatest quality in music but still sounds good and it matches in the scenes. Though you'll see sometimes a little bit time difference between music and motion or the dialogues. Always remember that is very low budget game.\n\nThe story plot is good but NOT for children or early teens. You should try this game as older. It is a very short game that in solving time I would compare it to the Blackwell series,still not to their complexity and better story plot. It is a very interesting story that includes themes like what about the soul afterlife, egyptian prophecies and rituals covered by classic mystery of a detective's investigation through a murder case. Really interesting and the only thing that will keep you playing this game because...\n\nThe riddles are very simple and the things to take and use from the scenes the ONLY interaction. You'll not get frustrated by this game. It's very easy. It's just someone tells you the story but to learn it simply interact with it like asking the questions how things happened.\n\nSo... If you want some free time listening to a story to clear your mind or take it easy this will be a great escape. BUT if you want more from a game of this kind(at least in the riddles thing and complexity) don't even think to buy it. I am an adventure fan that I play games depending of my mood so... I found it like reading a lite book.\n\nI hope I was helpful!", "timestamp_updated": 1430135573, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1430135184, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "14828907", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494239", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1426025941, "steamid": "76561198011727438", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Ruined by the lack of voice acting.
