Gosh, looking back to those couple of sentences that I scribbled and called as a review, I got embarrassed. I decided to run the game for a second time after a year - it's not that lengthy of a game anyhow - and write an appropriate review. I remember getting startled the first time that I've run the game, watching its eerie loading screen. I wondered if I've misread the description and bought myself a horror adventure instead of a HOG. Nope, this is a HOG nonetheless, and also a brief horror story.\n\nOur protagonist is a young woman who finds herself in front of an abandoned Asylum called White Haven at the middle of the night. That's about it, that's all we know about our \"Jane Doe\". She doesn't remember anything. A little girl greets us at the front gate and invites us in for the doctor who would know what to do. As we step into the old building, the girl flees away and leaves us with a somehow distorted reality. Suddenly, a creepy voice that belongs to a young man echoes, calling us \"his rats\". Creeped out yet? I know I was.\n\nGraphics and animations are fairly good within the genre. Background art works are cleverly designed to establish a unique atmosphere of \"something's quite not right\", and boy, do they manage to do so! The music is annoyingly creepy and background noises such as whispers, cackles and buzzing are always there to play you like a string. The atmosphere is the strongest feature of the game, creating the tension and thrill of the unknown successfully.\n\nHOG scenes are usually quite alright. Nothing is too hard to notice, and items are always clearly displayed. But there are certain phases of the game when our character becomes \"a bit off her head\", then even HOGs turn into nightmares. Those games, I wouldn't ask for my worst enemy! Puzzles and mini games are not often, but the ones that we encounter are quite good. There was one puzzle near the end of the game, asking for us to arrange moon's phases in order as observed from earth. Quite neat, huh? Oh, fair warning: there is no map to track but the game tells you when there is nothing left to solve in an area that you are standing in, so backtracking isn't much of an issue.\n\nI should say that I admire the effort put into making this game. It gives you a 3-4 hours of a HOG and a thrill that drives you insane alongside your main character. Does the ending worth it? Oh, I wouldn't know. It satisfied me enough, but I believe there would be people who'd call it a good story cut short. Maybe. We are used to unsatisfactory endings in this genre, so comparatively, it was great. Sadly, this is not the Collector's Edition, which would have a more complete story consistency, probably.\n\nIt might be important to mention that the game hails from Gogii Games, and their games are always either A+ or a big F. There is no in between. [i]White Haven Mysteries[/i] was an A+ on effort, atmosphere, narration and HOG gameplay. Pick it on sale and have a few hours of HOG + psychosis thriller that you'd wish be longer.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_updated": 1461311657, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442261057, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "12700233", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525764", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1414680103, "steamid": "76561198036702700", "num_games_owned": 1735, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[b]Impression[/b]: A [i]HOG[/i] that excelled in atmospheric and the hidden object aspects but umimpressive in the puzzle and features department. \n\n[b] Recommendation[/b]: Thumbs up.

The biggest problem with this one was it really had the potential to stick out as unique HOG (even without the expected bonus features you get with HOG's on Steam), in that it really drew into the horror/thriller world. The whole game was dedicated to scaring you and keep you guessing to the end. Unfortunately it doesn't keep the momentum going and the ending ends up being a plot hole on its own. Another missed opportunity, is the feature of hallucinations which really tied into the story but again never panned out. Solving puzzles to change the environment to 'reality' was really entrancing, but the game only used it twice (the second being only half-completed). This, with no replayability, is why I recommend the game, but only when its on sale. \n\n[i][b]For people who are new/casual to HOG's (Hidden Object Games): [/b][/i]\n\nThis is a game where you tramp around a massive property, finding items to help you as you work your way through the story and the locations. It has sections where you have to find everything on a list (hidden-objects) or have to solve puzzles to proceed. \n\nThis HOG is one of the better ones I've seen, because it incorporated horror and thill so well, whilst many other games in the genre often skimp on. The hidden objects in the game are challenging but not frustrating and same could be said for the few puzzles you do find. Unfortunately, it has none of the bonus features that are now becoming standard on Steam, including trading cards and an epilogue.
