Finding keys, turning the corner and being spooked by ghosts or inanimate objects; all these things plus a great selection of sounds really paired well with the graphics of the house and yard to give you suspense each time you opened a new door. \n\nWhat I didn't like: Let's start with the worst of it, the ending. You spend hours playing through all these clues and rooms and it's all about finding your lost wife then you get to the end and it makes ZERO sense and ties in with the house and story in no way. The ending played out really fast and gave no explanations and I was let down big time. Another thing, the darkness. Almost no game play is done in any sort of daylight or house lighting. The dark really becomes monotonous  after you've already established a creepy, empty house and you have to work nearly the entire game in the dark with very very poor light sources (that you must renew, so good luck with that). Also, my particular version had a glitch about it that I was unable to pan and travel at the same time, which was really annoying. I had to move forward, stop, pan to whatever object I wanted, then move again accordingly. That could have been updated, not sure. \n\nIn general, the gameplay isn't terrible. If you really like a suspenseful and creepy game that's mostly all exploration and collecting things, then you will really like this, despite its terrible ending and eye straining darkness.", "timestamp_updated": 1496804911, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496804911, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 46, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 31, "total_reviews": 77}}
