Her lines are related to the towers you use as defense but she uses them out of context and they play seemingly randomly and there is not enough variety in them. The pacing of the game is all off, with unlocks coming in way too slow which makes the game feel padded out. You can basically copy and paste the same tactic over and over. The enemy variety remains very low and new enemies are introduced very slowly as well. Difficulty is fairly low and as long as you spam enough money trees early on you will have more than enough money to cover defenses. Keeping the motivation to do so is the hard part. The user interface for upgrading plants is clunky and unwiedly, you will often save up and upgrade a bunch at once to avoid that. You can harvest money while the game is paused. The game does not have high resolution options and the overall polish of the visuals is somewhat lacking, disappointingly. The flavor text for the enemies in the encyclopedia is not as consistently humorous as Plants VS Zombies, it is very hit and miss. The music is insanely limited, loops way too much and renders the game unsufferable unless it is muted. The change in scenery when you beat 10 levels often does not introduce anything new to the actual levels\n\nThe groupies that you make flee by frizzing their hair, making them stink, botching their makeup with water blocking them with bodyguards and the money tree are all conceptually interesting. However without even looking too close you can immediately think up of which plants from Plants vs Zombies each tower is mechanically copying, and it copies them almost exactly, in terms of duration, area of effect, cost and whatnot. Same thing with the enemy types although to slightly lesser extent I would say.\n\nConclusion: If this had a lot more polish than it currently does and addressed all the previous issues I would probably be bale to live with the mechanics copying PvZ but as it stands this is an all around inferior version and the reskin does not shine enough in terms of flavor to even earn its place in the library.
