I like how the world looks and feels.\n\nCons:\nUnfortunately since day one this game has been simply terrible. Most of the games I've played follow the same pattern: I establish a few cities, thinking it may be time to get my trade network up and running and start spreading my religion. No, a t least a couple of other countries declare war on me. They do not bother to show up for quite a number of turns and when they finally do I can usually take them all out with a couple of ranged and one close combat units.\n\nThe AI is extremely unreasonable when it comes to trade, there is absolutely no point trading, much much easier to just take the resources you want.\n\nWars are generally a slow and painful process. What you need to win almost any war are: 2 - 3 close combat units, 4 - 5 ranges units including two siege units and possibly a general. AI puts up little no resistance. The painful bit is trying to move this collection of units. How on Earth can a unit of archers or warriors occupy the same space as an entire city?! Ever since Civ 5 this has been bugging me. That's not all. Further down the tech tree you start combining units into armies... okay, but why could I not combine them right away? and why can I not combine units of different types? Would make sense, no?\n\nMoving on. Diplomacy is a joke. One turn AI is your best friend, the next turn it's declaring war on you because your fleet is not strong enough. The fact that you don't even have access to the sea and have a land army that can crush them in a few turns does not seem to impress them. Then there are frequent splash screens with AI leaders delivering \"important\" messaged. My favourite is when Gorgo has been popping up for 10 turns in a row asking \"Where's the honour?\".\n\nIt is painfully slow, especially at the later stages. I've stopped playing on huge maps because after gunpowder I found it can easily take 5 minutes for one turn to complete. My rig ain't the fasters thing around but it's a reasonably modern machine that's capable of running GTA 5 on good graphics settings.\\\n\nReligion... this is a pain in this game. From my experience, even if you manage to establish your religion first you will be invaded by a horde of missionaries many turns later. But then again you can ask the AI to stop converting your cities and it works. For about 1 - 5 turns. So you are left with no other option but to go to war to stop those pests from converting your cities. Usually you want to completely destroy the country to never have their missionaries again. Well, okay, that may be fitting for middle ages. But what of the modern age? Why can I not adopt a policy that would allow me to have multiple religions coexist in my country?\n\nAir units are a joke. Firstly you need an airfield that occupies the same space as any given world wonder, mountain, lake, district or anything else. It holds a very limited number of air units and is practically useless. At least in all of my games I've either had to conquer everything well before airplanes could be useful, or did not actually even need to use them.\n\nThis game manages to reduce governing an empire to the most simple and primitive of functions. There is absolutely nothing challenging in it. Riots, shadow politics, plots, social reforms, government crisis, miner strikes, crime and syndicates, nationalism... those are just some of the things that will never be in the game.\n\nI realise some of these thing might have been partially fixed, and there have been some improvements, but the majority of these problems are still there. Instead of fixing this game devs just keep adding new civs for unreasonable prices. The last straw for me was Germany saying that nuclear weapons are the future well before any civ even discovered iron...", "timestamp_updated": 1504902411, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504902185, "votes_down": 35}, {"recommendationid": "34964484", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 105, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573422", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506493585, "steamid": "76561198030849935", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 71514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 175}, "votes_funny": 4, "review": "\n\nI've been a civ fan since civ 3 and have easily played 1000 hours for every installment.  So it is with great sadness that I say this game is terrible.  My hope is that the next expansion 2k/Sid Meier decide to release (and I hope much sooner than the year it took to make War of Chosen for X-Com 2 which was great) will fix alot of the issues plaguing this game.\n\ntl;dr if you look at steam stats civ 5 is being played far more than civ 6 so wait for a sale and buy that game for $10 because 6 is no where near as good.\n\nA few issues off the top of my head are: \n\nPacing - its terrible.  Eras and units are far too short and this maybe due to the eureka mechanic in the game.  I like the idea  of playing around these bursts of science and civics but they affect the pacing of the game so much.  For instance you could finish a game in 1700AD with stealth bombers on Emperor (3rd hardest difficulty) which takes away from the immersiveness you might want.\n\nUI - The UI is terrible at the moment and mods are required to make it playable.  There's no production queue, trade routes are better with the most recent patch but still awful.  Diplomacy tab is just cumbersome; to see the quests required to complete to get an envoy is painful to scroll through.  All cities status requires you to click through 3 tabs instead of pressing one god damn button and even then to change production queues quickly you have to zoom onto the city EVERY TIME.\n\nDistrict removal - I love the concept of districts and playing around it.  Really makes city building and perhaps going tall interesting but lack of district removal is a severe oversight.  Even in the real world parcels of land get re-zoned all the time so why can't we remove districts.  The only time a district might not have the right to be removed is through some grandfathered idea (like 50 turns perhaps longer).  Especially due to populations limiting your ability to make new districts its crucial in strategy game to re-appropriate the land as you need it although it should be at a great expense.  Adding this feature could change the game alot and how you adapt and if tied in with government it would diversify your playstyle greatly (for ex. communists governments could remove districts with fewer penalties).\n\nAI - This is probably the issue most people complain about and with good reason.  AI is incredibly difficult to program especially in an intricate strategy so I can understand there will be hiccups.  However, diplomacy is just a joke and often times just SPAM so much damn spam.  Refusing a deal only to have the same deal pop up 3-5 turns later is infuriating; ALL SPAM IS BAD.  The combat is questionable.  Sometimes the AI has clear advantage and walks past your city while your at war witht hem.  Their units are spaced out all over their land when it should be fighting on whatever front it should be fighting on.  Barbarian spam is unreal and can overrun you so fast even if your constantly building units.  The fact that barb camps can overrun you so quickly with horseman and slow down your progress so damn much can force a re-roll.\n\nThis game has so much potential to be great but it pains me to say that this is the worst civ game its released in awhile.

The fact that wonders now take up a tile slot adds to this, and the result is that turtling isn't as effective a strategy anymore and one city can't house literally 90% of the world's wonders. District management means planning is paramount.\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\n\nThis game launched with few leaders, some of whom were near reskins of existing ones. Firaxis has decided that it's okay to ship the same civ with a different leader, which only changes [i]one[/i] of the unique characteristics of a civ, and call that differentiation. The game is also unbalanced. If you don't have DLC, you will always square off against either Sumeria or Scythia in the late-game, because they are extremely powerful civs. If you [i]do[/i] have DLC, you will face whatever civ is a DLC civ.\n\nEach game feels hardly different than any other because the civ variety is so low. Each game feels like you're fighting the same seven enemies with the same two always coming out on top.\n\n[b]The Ugly[/b]\n\nCiv VI employs a predatory system of DLC release. DLC civs are objectively more powerful than base-civs, making Civ VI essentially pay-to-win. A [b]single civ[/b] will cost you $5 since it comes bundled with a bunch of useless crap like scenario packs that you'll never play. FURTHERMORE, and this deserves its own paragraph:\n\n-----\n\n[h1]Sid Meyer's Civilization VI frequently encounters frustrating crashes with ANY form of Workshop DLC, INCLUDING UI mods.

Here is a list of bugs I have had that is in no way complete, but what I can remember off my head:\n\n* Crashing from launch screen\n* Build/Culture/Bottom-Right button not working at all\n* Units not moving to the space I click on\n* Almost every single patch to this game will require you to not only disable, but UNINSTALL FROM THE FILE FOLDER every single piece of Workshop DLC content you have ever downloaded, and chances are you still won't be able to use DLC content even with a reinstallation.\n* Unit icons not displaying\n\nAnd lastly, the single most ugly thing about this entire game, worse even than the frequent crashes, predatory DLC policy, and inability to use Workshop content:\n\n[h1]After an entire year and two major updates, this game does not have production queues.[/h1]\n\nEvery single time you complete a production, you need to do another. It's incredibly micro-intensive. \"But wait!\" I hear you say, \"I can just get a UI mod from the Workshop to fix that!\" To which I say, no, you can't.

I won't list them all again here, there are already many reviews that list the details. But it is time for Firaxis to prove to their loyal customers that they care about them and take a break from their content updates and concentrate on a patch that just includes bug fixes. They should also take some time to work with Aspyr to resolve the cross platform issues that stop the Mac and PC communities from playing the game together.

And the civ border colors bleed out past the coastlines so you can even tell what is water and what is land. It is hands down the worst mini-map ever in the entire 40 plus year history of video games. Completely and utterly useless. Don't even get me started on the horrible AI, complete lack of meanful diplomacy, or the balance issues because we would be here all night. I have gone back to CIV 5 and really enjoying it.

I was comparing it to all the previous games and not just looking at it as a standalone game. \n\nAfter many hours of play, without the comparison to other versions, I still can't decide If would recommend this game to others. \n\nSome Pros: The districts concept create a fun new way to think about cities and I enjoy being able to see each individual building in the district it belongs to. One note I do have is that in old civ games I felt a more tangible reward from buildings, and in many cases, the most tangible reward in this civilization is the little graphic fun building you get to see. Which is no comparison. I\u2019d rather know the specific benefit of that building and have it be worthwhile then get a cute building graphic and have a vague understanding of what that building is doing. As I\u2019ve played the game I\u2019ve jotted down specific things that I believe may be holding Civ 6 back from being as satisfying as the other games. These random notes are below. I apologize in advance.\n\nI should also note that I have not purchased any expansion other than the Aztecs. This is so because of all the flaws in the game. The usual gameplay overhauling expansion is what I want. Not a map or a new civ with a new wonder. \n\n[b]Civilization notes and flaws in no particular order[/b]\n\n[b]Spies[/b]\n\nUnequal distribution of turn worth. 18 turns for spy mission yielding 4000 gold when my civilization makes over 1000 gold per turn.\n\nSpies have 3 promotion levels with benefits, then they claim to have more as they complete missions BUT there is no option to pick another upgrade and the actual level and effectiveness of the spy doesn\u2019t seem to change at all.\n\nLies about spy promotions\n\nSpy cannot see the cities current production.\n\n[b]User Interface[/b]\nThe \u201cvictory progress\u201d world rankings gives inadequate explanation to why science victory progress bar is slowly increasing in stage 3. Also spies are unable to gather relevant information too\n\nPiss poor unit filter. No way to quickly look at all your units. Makes it hard for large scale wars, upgrading the army to the latest unit, and finding idle units.\n\n[b]Dumbing down of Civ? Are people afraid of details!?[/b]\nThere are very vague building benefits in both the civlopedia and when you hover to discover more information. Ex: what does \u201cfaster\u201d fleet and armada training mean? (Also says 125% combat experience to all naval units trained in this city. +2gold from costal tiles, which are specific)\n\nSubjective district project yields. (what does \u201clarge amount of gold\u201d vs \u201cgold\u201d mean?! Give me Numbers!)  \n\nUnclear tile range modifiers. It says +6 and then under it says +3from mod. Does that total 9 or total 6?\n\nThere is no useful filter for trade routes, unable to sort them by most gold or most of anything, just if it contains that thing\n\nDoes one uranium create infinite nukes? Same question for all units that require strategic resources.\n\n[b]AI problems[/b]\nAI doesn\u2019t understand how to use naturalists. Their naturalists wander the globe aimlessly for all eternity.\n\nAI does not understand how to use inquisitors, they seem to believe that they can also be used on a foreign city and will send them there in mass.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nCannot make a joint war and use a Casus Belli to declare war. \n\nGreat people are far too limited. I consistently run out of all great people before game is over which renders a major part of a good number of building and districts useless. (Accumulating great people points for nothing)\nNot nearly enough great artists, musicians, and writers to even fill a fraction of the buildings that house them on larger maps.\n\nOn lower difficulties I constantly run out of techs AND civics to research. On harder difficulties most the AI players and I run out of techs and civics and just \u201cfuture tech\u201d it up until the game resolves. \nThis means by the endgame, all buildings the create science and great people points are obsolete.\n\nWhy does a national park have to have all tiles owned by the same city? This is ridiculous.\nMany wonders are very much underpowered comparted to how much time to take the build. It makes for some easy choices when picking between units/buildings or wonders. \n\u2022\tThe amount of tourism from a fully upgraded theatre square district with a themed archology museum dwarfs wonders into obsolescence (16 tourism for big ben vs 157 for upgraded theatre square with all buildings and themed museum. \n\nRelics apparently are limited so if you built the Mount St. Michel wonder, all of your apostles will still say they will create a relic if they die on religious combat, but that is a lie. You will just stop getting them at some point with absolutely no explanation or substitute.\n\nView gallery button in the great works menu is broken and only displays the very first item in the top left hand side of screen\n\nTHE CITY PRODUCTION STATUS DOES NOT GIVE ENOUGH INFORMATION.\n\u2022\tYOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH TOTAL PRODUCTION A CITY MAKES\n\u2022\tYOU CAN SEE THAT CHOPPING A FOREST OR IMPROVEMENT DOWN WILL YIELD A SPECIFIC NUMBERS\n\u2022\tYOU CAN SEE HOW MANY TURNS AN ITEM WILL TAKE TO COMPLTETE\n\u2022\tIT DOES NOT HOWEEVER TELL YOU HOW MUCH TOTAL PRODUCTION AN ITEM NEEDS\n\u2022\tALSO IT APPEARS THAT REMOVING A FOREST WILL DRASTICALLY SPEED THE CONTRUCTION OF A DISTRICT, BUT ONLY KINDA HELP MAKE A UNIT (EVEN IT MAKES SENSE THAT WOOD WOULD HELP THIS UNIT, LIKE A CATAPULT). I CANNOT BE MORE SPECIFIC BECAUSE I AM NOT GIVEN THE DETAILS.\n\n[b]My personal nitpicky things[/b]\nCity state benefits take a turn to reflect when you become their suzerain\n\nInquisitors are overpowered. My two 4000 faith apostle should not be able to be undone by one measly inquisitor\n\nGame doesn\u2019t understand what 75% of existing religion means. Or I don\u2019t understand.  But it reduces religion by less than 75percent of current religion. \n\nVery effeminate horn honk for the missile cruiser. A very powerful late game unit.\n\nThis is the first civilization game that I could be drunk and still kick the computers ass. (Up to Immortal difficulty)\n\nEvery time you purchase a unit with gold/faith, the next one becomes more expensive (workers, apostles, inquisitors) plus they will just get more expensive as the turns go by.  I understand this is for balance purposes, but it is a bit to dramatic for my tastes.\n\nAt the end/beginning of the turn, notifications scroll across the screen quickly. This blocks some combat that is happening, and in order to see a list of what scrolled through you have to go through and click the diplomatic screen of every civilization and they may or may not have had something on that list from the turn in question. It is very inconvenient, and I like to watch the battle and would rather just have one stagnant list at the beginning of the turn that has all of the information instead of trying to rapidly read 7 to 10 notifications at once.\n\n\nSorry for this laundry list of things!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1507008614, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507008614, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34770252", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503073", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504989124, "steamid": "76561198105696856", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "STAY AWAY!!!

While it has plenty of fun mechanics that have been revamped from civ 5, such as the new wonder system, the game all around does not compete with it's predecessor, especially in terms of the DLC policy. This game has been out for nearly a year now, and all the people who bought the Digital Deluxe edition feel scammed. Why? Because unlike civ 5, which was pumping out a plethora of great dlc, that expanded the mechanics and added more civs for reasonable prices in nearly every one, we are getting severely overpriced civilization packs, that include underwhelming civilizations, with no clear priority on the more important or interesting ones throughout history. A lot of people hated the Poland DLC, because all it added was a civ, but I felt it was well needed, however, later in the DLC line, we have gotten nothing but scenarios and civilzations. We have Australia, which is an underwhelming choice for a civ, as they have only been independant for about a hundred years. I could forgive this, however afterwards, rather than releasing an in depth, well made dlc, they made a dual pack with Persia, and for some reason Greece for a third time. That's right folks, Greece is in this game 3 times, but it's ok because Alexander's greece is \"Macedon\". And lastly, we have the Nubia DLC, which adds Nubia, an extremely vague, and odd choice for a civilzation in a game that is missing some of the most historically rich countries in history, such as the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, and Austria. Even though I do have 140 hours in the game, and have forced myself to have a positive outlook, on it, the DLC is making me more and more pessimistic by the release. Absolutely not worth the $80 I spent on the digital deluxe.

To be fair, the other reviews don't really reflect the game accurately enough, in my opinion.\n\nIn other Civ games you start with your settler, found a city, and start making units.  You can micro manage somewhat, deciding what tiles you want your citizens to work, but for the most part you get to worry about the big picture.  With Civ VI they've introduced districts for the cities.  Districts are basically an additional resource you get to micro manage as part of your city, but it doesn't live IN the city, you have to place them on tiles around the city and they override any resources that tile previously granted.  Your city also cannot grow in population unless you have proper housing, gained by making buildings, some of which also take up tiles and precious resources.  You also have amenities now, which you have to accumulate according to your city's population.  You have x number of citizens so you need y amenities.  If you have too few amenities your people get mad at you and threaten to riot...so you get more amenities, then you get more people, and now they're ready to riot again.  The amenities, districts, and buildings are also dependent upon certain environments or landscapes existing, such as a nearby mountain or river, so you have to plan your city out before you even have access to the resources.  If anyone has ever played Sim City you'll be seeing a lot of similarities.\n\nThen there's the AI...   My first playthrough I was overrun by barbarians.  You can make workers, just like before, but the workers are only good for three projects.  You can get more out of your workers later on, but early on you spend a lot of time making workers so you can build and progress.  Any time you spend making workers is time you don't spend making military units to protect your city, which you need to combat the barbarians...  My second playthrough I turned the difficulty all the way to the easiest setting and turned the barbarians off so I could get a chance to learn the game.  Within 10 rounds I had met three of the other world leaders, two had declared war on me (for no reason), and one already had four military units approaching my city.  At this point, I didn't even know where they were on the map and barely had enough time to create a builder and a second military unit (you start with 1) let alone have time to march them anywhere...\n\nTo summarize, the other negative posts are not wrong or incorrect, but they do give the impression that this is a buggy game that should not have been released.  This is not a \"buggy\" game, it's completely unplayable due to how it was built.  There's way too much focus on micro managing your cities and not enough time to look at the big picture, assuming you ever make it to having more than a few cities, and while I can't confirm exactly how the programming grants the AI its units, I can only surmise the game spawns the units just outside your view in the fog of war instead of having them built in the city.\n\nIt's not fun, it's not relaxing, it's not playable.  Even without the AI, the system they use for building cities is setting you up for failure.  You keep your cities happy by granting amenities, the number of amenities needed is directly related to your city's population, and you have a finite number of amenities.  Logical conclusion:  You can only have so many citizens...but the city will continue to grow beyond that number, your citizens WILL eventually riot, and everything goes downhill.\n\nUnplayable, terrible design, cheating AI.  0 of 5 and I'm sorry I bought it...even on sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1504834024, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504834024, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "34994117", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503166", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501192270, "steamid": "76561198107265662", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Go and buy CIV V instead", "timestamp_updated": 1505560393, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505560393, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35323612", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504126", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506748672, "steamid": "76561198032490830", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "It is more beautiful than V, but the AI is so stupid the game isn't fun.
