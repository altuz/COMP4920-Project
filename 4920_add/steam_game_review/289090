Yes, its that hard aswell, but surgeon simulator more player friendly, more playable and include more content.\n\nThere is one goal in Ampu-Tea: yes, to make a cup of tea. Sounds easy right? yes it is IRL. If it would be this hard to create a cup of tea irl then the brittish empire would have never interested in colonizing/conquerion indian ocean region including India.\n\nThe engine is bad, buggy and some of the achievements are annoying. Also, its way too expensive for the content and gameplay it offers, i believe review would be still negative if it would be 0,99 tho.\n\nAs your Average Achievement Hunter ill share some informations about achievements:\n11 steam achievements and most of them annoying. i mean, most of them awarded for creating a cup of tea, some of the awarded to trying to create but in wrong order, but the point of the start the game 500 times is just stupid. Its still not a hard game to perfect it, but definetly not a fun game.\nTime to 100%: 2-3h", "timestamp_updated": 1501841711, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501841711, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33541283", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495165", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500928867, "steamid": "76561198046184992", "num_games_owned": 473, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "AAAAAAAAHHHHHH!\n(\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b\n*deep breath*\nEEEEYYYYAAAAAHHH!!", "timestamp_updated": 1500055424, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500055378, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 259, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 151, "total_reviews": 410}}
