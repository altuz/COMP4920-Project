Probably one of the best in the genre lately. For those unfamiliar with the genre, it is somewhat similar to games like Civilization, Stellaris, Fallen Enchantress and others: a turn-based strategy where you build an empire from the ground up.\n\nThe asymmetrical factions make for various styles of play and great re-playability, as well as creating interesting situations during the game. It has a great UI and is generally a beautiful game, with a very distinct flavor and story that is communicated not through campaign missions but rather through in-game quests and the very progression of the game - the lengthening winter, the names of the techs from later eras, the rewards you get from quests and so on. It is also interesting that the factions don't quite follow the usual fantasy clich\u00e9s - it takes some pages from sci-fi to add survivors of a spaceship crash, crazy machine cults and old biological experiments alongside ghost armors that feed on souls, weird forest people and dragon people.\n\nIt has some interesting mechanics that make it stand out from other 4x games, like the active use of luxury resources for different benefits, the marketplace where you can buy and sell resources and units, the cycles of winter that drastically affects your plans, the various minor factions that you pacify and assimilate for several different benefits (including new unit types and empire-wide benefits), the unique mechanics of factions and other minor things. Most of the mechanics are well-executed, with few exceptions (stockpiles, for example: an entire system for something very minor). Combat isn't particularly good either, a bit hard to control, but is good enough (and much better than in Endless Space 1 or 2, other games in the same series).\n\nThe DLC is also quite cool, in particular the new factions (that each bring new mechanics to the game).", "timestamp_updated": 1506105968, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506105968, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35071079", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502611", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507073389, "steamid": "76561198063178637", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 818}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is an in depth 4X game with unique mechanics and a fascinating lore.
