I decided now to revisit the game and spent some time on the forums to get it to work. a simple download is all it needs http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=265182801\n\nSo happy as Larry I tried playing the game again. The problem is the missions get bugged out and often my ship refuses to move rendering me a sitting duck. Re-starting the game usually fixes it but sometimes you have to do it 2 or 3 times. \n\nI reckon it would be a good game if it was working properly but as it is I wouldn't recommend spending money on it no matter how cheap.", "timestamp_updated": 1491673686, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1491673686, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "32785741", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506597980, "steamid": "76561198075538860", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I bought it for the nostalgia and because it was on sale for a low price.\n\nThis game did not run well on my laptop but it was quite smooth on my desktop computer, though I had to turn the graphics level down or it would lag in some places. I could not play the tutorial as it crashed when I tried but it didnt matter to me since I've played it before so I skipped the tutorial. Make sure to run it in compatibility mode for Windows 98/ME and run as administrator. The game has worked well so far and I have encountered no bugs(apart from the tutorial crashing) which was quite surprising. \n\nAIM 2 clan wars is a game where you take control of a glider as a mechmind and explore different sectors of the world. You can change or upgrade your glider in many ways which is quite fantastic. You can perform a variety of missions and earn energy crystals which are used like currency.  The player belgons to the fifth generation of mechminds who are the only ones who can create clans and travel between sectors. \n\nThe player can 'convince' other mechminds(make them join your side) by spending energy crystals. The greater the rating of the mechmind, the higher the cost of convincing. You can use these convinced mechminds to capture bases and eventually control a sector once your clan becomes dominant. \n\nThe combat of the game can be a little furstrating but challenging since the enemies tend to jump around and evade your attacks and aiming is a bit difficult. There are a variety of weapons to chose from which deal various amounts of damage and use different levels of energy. You can also puchase and use rockets, bombs and mines which deal a lot of damage. \n\nOverall the game is quite fun and can be addicting once you get the hang of it. I highly recommend you try this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1498419663, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498419663, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33063655", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484968", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498873055, "steamid": "76561198073389550", "num_games_owned": 778, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I like the concept and the combat, but the controls just ruin the entire game.", "timestamp_updated": 1498873113, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498873113, "votes_down": 8}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 15, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "total_negative": 12, "total_reviews": 27}}
