Somewhere between what you would consider a modern game and those old dungeon crawlers like Lands of Lore. Cannot seem to progress completely lost! (e.g. to go from one to the next neighborhood in this city, the only way is THROUGH a tavern. Using and exiting through different doors)\n\nI am so confused with this game. I am dumped vaguely dressed as a roman in some kind of bronze age sand city. I carry a silvery rim. I talk to the mage, the shopkeepers. All my journal will ever update about is a silly fetch quest about a dog in the streets carrying a bag. Everyone is a clone of each other with clone conversations. Most areas are just cardboad cutouts that you cannot visit or go into. Very few assets streched thin over large pointless rooms. The camera was fixed but could be rotated which mostly worked as intended. Staircases were notoriously difficult to navigate. Eventually I finished the fetch quest and had looted about 50 gold in stuff I stole and sold and had a knife but still had found no way out of the sand city nor did I seem to unlock a main quest. Thage mage was not interested in the quest item. No performance issues per say. Akward pathfinding and stiff movement animations but thats forgivable. The 3D looks vaguely like neverwinter nights 1 along with decent lighting and decent audio. Although some tracks clash, notably one with too modern instruments. I could not see a character sheet in the UI. Progress seemed centered around spells and equippable inventory. There was a skills tab but it only seem to control resting feature.\n\nI couldnt even get to a place where I could fight stuff! :/ Trying to attack guards in the streets did not seem to trigger and I would just stand there with my fists up doing nothing.\n\nNote: No crashes - No frame issues - No clipping or anything. Game ran alright for what it was.\nWin1064bit Ryzen+Polaris", "timestamp_updated": 1504225499, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504225218, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 3, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 12}}
