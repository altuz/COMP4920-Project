Expect around 3 hours playtime.\n\nNot entirely bug-free, I did experience it crashing (only once) and other than that, just a few poor translations.\n\nTo be honest, I enjoyed the quick-fix it gave, I got the product on sale (bonus) and I roughly rate it a 7/10.\n\nShame there is no achievements/cards though but that is a personal preference.\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1495401648, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495401648, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 12, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 16}}
