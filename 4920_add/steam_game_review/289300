Since you do not have the ability to build a base or produce units like in most other strategies, Faces of War provides some challenge at higher difficulty settings if you try to finish it quick.\n\n[b] Gameplay & Story: 5/10 [/b]\nThe story is based on 2nd World War events where after picking a faction you want to fight for, you try to fulfill different objectives to gain some advantage for your fighting side. The campaign is seperated by single missions that do not have any connection to each other, besides some story description. The story is supported by some details about the events that supposed to have occured during WW2. The gameplay consists of only managing your squads and units that you receive to finish the mission.\n\n[b] Combat & Challenge : 5/10 [/b]\nThe combat itself is simple but some missions require micro-management to use your units in most effective ways. There are some different types of equiptment that units can use, so adjusting to different objectives and situations helps with progression. If taken slowly, the game does not offer much challenge since you can always re-draw units, heal them up and re-capture strategically important positions.\n\n[b] Graphic & Interface : 4/10 [/b]\nThe graphic look quite aged but the graphical details that most fighting scenes have are fitting the game really well. There are a lot of spots where units can take cover, destroyable surroundings and even the weapons and other gear dropped can be seen and picked up. The interface ingame is a bit overloaded with icons so it takes quite a while to figure all needed actions and commands for managing the squads.\n\n[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 4/10 [/b]\nThere are no mini-games and the whole progress is done by completing missions for different factions. Since the missions are not connected, it does not feel like you are progressing through the whole game, instead you get focused on single missions losing the big picture of the war.\n\n[b] Audio & Immersion : 6/10 [/b]\nThe audio gives a nice feedback during the battles where the biggest fire fights happen, where the heavy weapons and tanks are placed. The music provided a nice background sound without being too intrusive. The immersion during the missions was definetely on a high level, but sadly goes lost once a mission is finished and the campaign window is displayed until the next mission is started. \n\n[b] Side-Notes [/b]\n[list]\n[*]This game is single player only.\n[*]This game contains no achievements, nor ingame neither steam.\n[*]This game offers none to minimal replayability. If you played it once, you will most likely never touch this game again.\n[*]This game is fairly short, if you speed up the combat regularly.\n[*]This game is often sold in bundles or being discounted.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Summary [/b]\nFaces of War is an enjoyable blitzkrieg type RTS game and will most likely gather your attention for at least few missions. It is quite fun to finish each mission once, but since the game is fairly short and offers only minimal replayability, it is only advised if you enjoy older RTS and especially blitzkrieg and WW2 games. \n\n\nI hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game.
