What content I did play was not very engaging nor motivating enough to find hotfixes for this game. I played about half an hour worth, with an extra hour spent trying to fix it. \n\n[b] Recommendation[/b]: Thumbs down due to developers not patching the game to make it compatible with systems later than Windows XP. Not worth buying in any department unless there is a fix. Even if it was working, I would not recommend it at full price unless the gameplay improved past the first 30 minutes I was able to play - see below. \n\nThe Good: \n[list]\n[*] Interesting premise/story which appears to have strong historical basis (i.e. based on an old Scandinavian folk tale). \n[*] Mildly non-linear in that you can explore locations that clearly have no use until later but were interesting nonetheless. \n[/list]\n\nThe Bad: \n[list]\n[*] Voice acting presents as if for children, but with no guidance or hints, I can imagine this would be difficult to maintain a child's attention. It is also in American accent, which I found a poor choice for a game clearly focusing on a Scandinavian environment and it's compelling story. \n[*] Resolution was lousy and the art used is dated even for a year 2000 game. \n[*] No skipping or speeding up walking from A to B. \n[*] No tutorial or interactive help. \n[/list]\n\nThe Ugly: \n[list]\n[*] [b] Not compatible or patched to work with systems later than Windows XP.[/b] There is no error catchment or user friendliness regarding said compatibility issues, resulting in crashes at frequent points in the game. This can be bypassed with a partial fix with compatibility mode however many users have complained that the game required further hotfixes and changing of registries (with warnings that it will cause security leaks) - see [url=http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Fairy_Tale_About_Father_Frost,_Ivan_and_Nastya#Issues_unresolved]here[/url]. \n[*] There is no resolution options besides (?)800x600 and its forced Full-Screen - leading to resolution changes in background programs.\n[/list]\n\n[b][i]Conclusion: [/i][/b]\n\nI usually separate my reviews based on user's background of gaming in the particular genre ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/diseraph/recommended]here[/url] for examples), however I was unable to play this game long enough to really explore how this game represents point and click games (or any genre really).
