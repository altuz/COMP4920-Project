Not worth the 1.5 gigs of HDD space\n\nCheap 3D. Overwhelming UI. Tutorial locks everything down and is very strict with progression and ended up trapping me and leaving me stuck. Sometimes clicking on obvious tabs to open the correct windows will not work and you gotta click a shortcut instead. You open the user interface by pixelhunting building icons on the minimap, right clicking them, and then somehow you must open another child window to buy a car and drag and drog the car from window to window. The UI was so clunky that I could not perform this operation and the tutorial was not cooperating. The concept itself does not fetch me and the nineties style tycoon execution is shivers-inducing", "timestamp_updated": 1505085403, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502844809, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 51, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 38, "total_reviews": 89}}
