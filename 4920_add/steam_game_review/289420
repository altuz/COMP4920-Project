The next guy took a few punches into his faces, but I won. I took their clothes off and put on a poncho. Suddenly, a man without pants crawled towards me and told me to finish him off. With the words \"You like that, scumbag?\" he received a kick into his head. Then, I took out my recently acquired meat cleaver and started hitting him, but I kept missing. Finally, he was dead. I proceeded my journey and suddenly there were another two men who wanted to see me dead. They were strong, but luckily I could eat three potatoes just before I died and so I beat them. I carried on and reached a village. The guard in front of the gates shouted \"My spear overcomes yours!\" and he threw his spear at me. It pierced me but it didn't stop me, and so we ran at each other and with a single hit in the head he went down. Afterwards, I entered the village and I stood in front of three men with assault rifles and shotguns. Even my potatoes couldn't save me this time.\n\nSo far, I had a lot of fun.

You're an imperial soldier sent as an undercover convict to a penal colony on Planet Alzatraz with a mission to sabotage a spacecraft the convicts are building to escape the planet. The landing pod crashes, you are separated from your teammates, get captured and thrown in a labor camp. Because of your excellent build and opportunistic tendencies, you quickly rise through the ranks and become the go-to person for many Planet Alcatraz inhabitants, who have 25 hours' worth of quests for you.\n\nThe RPG-style 3rd person game lets you build your skills, as well as those of the members from your old squad which you pick up along the way. Overall, the game offers 2 major mission campaigns with dozens of places to investigate and clear out, and a final push through 3 extremely difficult areas to reach a shuttle and escape Planet Alcatraz. At one point, you're required to find item F for person E who has unfinished business with person D who first wants person C dead, but they turn out to be dead, and the trail is found with person B last seen at location A but it turns out he's actually held captive at location Z... this is just an example.\n\nPros - Immersive storyline and missions which get you really enthused to level up in the right skills. Fair hit system, smooth gameplay (although the animations are quite wooden), generous XP and money rewards for quests.\n\nCons - The storyline is pretty linear. It gives you the illusion that you can play both sides, but in the end you're left with no choice with regards to your loyalty. The developers could have spent more time developing alternative endings. Graphics aren't the best since the game came out in 2009.
