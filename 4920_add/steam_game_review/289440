It has its own crowd. It's NOT a game for many...\n\nWhy really? I explain...\n\nPerimeter is like playing an RTS chess game. You play both for capturing and keeping the ground and assault all the time. But now you'll ask.. That's what we do in strategy games,isn't it? The answer is NOT exactly.\n\nBefore you begin playing the game... Read the manual. I explain some things but I can't cover everything. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120665353/recommended/289240/]Here[/url] you can find another's guy review for the expansion and he explains many things, too. The games campaign is designed in a bad way I would say. While it tries to exhibit the game and show you some strategies it fails to the point that pusses you to deep waters without leaving you take a breath. Nothing is explained. It gives you the new units and it's up to you to test and see what they do or WHAT they CAN do. So, if you ever TEST this game have those in mind as there are very few videos even on the internet. A great strategy but ONLY with its own crowd. The men that kept playing and learning it.\n\nA small introduction...\n\nThere are 3 races: The Empire , Exodus and HeartBack. It is supposed that the human race expanded many centuries but their civilization got to the zenith. A great nature call came to bring destruction and stability to the human technological advancement and that was the Scourge.  The Scourge are animals or supernatural forces to that attack the civilization. So the humans made Arks, the so called Frames. People live to those GREAT moveable cities and are born new all the time. The purpose of their travel is to find a world without Scourge to inhabit. Off course the game would be completely out if it was ONLY for the Scourge and Human Kind. The 3 races fight each other because there is great distance in their opinions. Like large Nations, their councils decide of them which path to take. The Empire tries to keep things as always were. Trying to keep the power to the Emperor only. The Exodus mission is to find the new world while fighting the Scourge. The Heartback lost their mission and mind and used the Scourge to fight all the others who never let them to get back and see their mistake.\n\nEnd of the story and start the strategy. All depend on the ground. The ground is the source of energy and it has to be terraformed flat to give the energy to the so called Energy cores.As much area an energy core keeps so the better. The Frame is the King in Chess. If it falls, Game Over! The frame has very little power to power up devices around it as it is installed to earth. If it flies it powers nothing. If the ground has cracks you have to terraform it to build upon it and if cracks occur while there are buildings on it they will start being destroyed. That's why the game keeps telling for attacks even if the attack has finished or after it started. Because till the crack occurs takes time. Your eyes have to be peeled to the map all the time for threats. The terraforming is automatic as much the auto repair. That's why while on attack you'll see the energy drain in vast quantities. The buildings try to be autorepaired and the broken land to be terraformed again while at the same time your gun installations hit the opponent. Everything uses power here. You have to produce this power or have to stop it from draining. Because NO energy = Game Over.\n\nYou can produce many unit types but you have a population cap of 250. There are 3 type of units to produce which can be transformed to any type of unit you want dependant of the quantity of the starting units. There are the soldiers, the officers and the nano technicians. The last can heal every unit because everything is mechanical. eg. If you want a plane it may take 5 soldiers and 3 officers and 1 nano technician for each one. You can make up to 5 squads. Every energy core can have an independant shield or you can call the Perimeter, that is the shield of all cores at the same time. The energy consumption is vast. However the game will teach you how to play chess with it. You'll lose many times to understand the game logic. But after that you'll see it's a great game. The HARD core types of units are the Scummers, the Bombies and the Special units. Yes, every race may have the same types of normal units BUT it has its own special ones. Those units are the worst because they do tremendous damage mainly to the ground. If the ground falls, everything upon it will be destroyed while the base loses great energy to keep it alive. GOT THE POINT?\n\nFor all the above that noone explains the game has very few followers.\n\nSo now... Graphics and sounds are great for this game even after many years. CodeMasters is the company and that is a Great publisher of quality games. As for the story, I made the introduction. The difficulty of the game after a point is HARD to VERY HARD. So..\n\nARM yourself with patience and learn the game, because I think it deseves it!

It\u2019s an old game, but it\u2019s a good game. I remember, I couldn\u2019t beat the campaign years back due to the need to distribute your attention, to dispense it on the different tasks. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s good: you must be in absolute control of situation, of every part of yours and enemy\u2019s forces. Some may call that babysitting, but I think it makes you think, adapt, be fast and precise in your actions.\nThe storyline, its campaign, the world itself together reflect these concepts well, I think. The Spirits, priestly like people with advanced knowledge, discovered the new dimension \u2014 The Psychosphere. They said, they found a promised land, full of happiness for humankind, but the way here would be long and hard (as usual, of course). The Psychosphere contains all human thoughts and desires which are embodied into the Scourge: strange and dangerous creatures that are attracted by the human mind itself. \nTogether with the other people Spirits created a floating cities \u2014 the Frames. Frame is a home for the piligrims and the way to travel through the Psychosphere in search of the Promised Land. As I said above, the Psychosphere is very unstable, chaotic and creates the Scourge due to the chaos of thoughts and desires. So all pilgrims must be controlled, must be whole and should control their mind in their dangerous travels. And it takes several years to build new portals and travel to new undiscovered worlds.\nPlayer begins the game as a Legate of the one of the first Frames. As a Legate you need to watch this chaotic world and protect your Frame and your people. You must terraform every possible place to gather more energy for your next travels, defending yourself from the Scourge, finding new worlds and new, different and heretic and hostile visions of situation from the different Frames.\n\nWhat I can mark as distinctive features of this game:\n\u2014\tterraforming is one of the main concepts of the game: you need it to gather the energy, to build your structures from the so-called zero plane; zero plane can be damaged what makes this approach very interesting from the tactical side;\n\u2014\tyou have a robotic army that contains three basic types of units: soldier, officer and technician; if you\u2019ll build according laboratories, you can transform you squads into new types of units, even on the fly; it creates some possibilities like digging your way underground and then transforming your squad into bombers for heavy damage;\n\u2014\tthree different factions with three types of special units each, with different views and philosophy;\n\u2014\tparanormal bubble-chained world with its unique atmosphere in couple with the futuristic technologies;\n\u2014\tsome very hard missions that need from you full concentration and distribution of your attention;\n\u2014\tyou need to use community\u2019s workaround to play multiplayer at the current state.", "timestamp_updated": 1403693727, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403693510, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "9742779", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 40, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485143", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1397214427, "steamid": "76561198124836521", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "good game old but fun at times", "timestamp_updated": 1396779212, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1396779212, "votes_down": 15}, {"recommendationid": "16891278", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526836", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1435401028, "steamid": "76561198036978480", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "More of a puzzle game than an RTS.

There is 3 factions in the game and like... 2 tracks per faction in total. So, I would recommend listening to your own music.\n- Game has no widescreen options and doesn't support multiple monitors properly, so your mouse is going to fly out of the screen if you happen to have multiple monitors.\n- No online multiplayer. You can still play LAN though and the campaign is good.\n- There are definitely some balance issues with the game - After playing this game for a while I found that Harkback's Scrourge Shark units are pretty darn OP :D Although it is not a real issue if you are going to play the campaing.\n\nOn the other side this game has:\n- Fun terraforming and combat. The goal is to not destroy the buildings but destroy the terraing that these buildings are standing on. Really unique gameplay.\n- Interesting squad morphing mechanics. The idea is that you can transform your army into entirely different units right on the battlefield.\n- Good variety of different units: land, air and underground.\n- Interesting but sometimes stupid mission objectives. You will see what I mean.\n\nOverall this game is worth a purchase.

First time I played, it, I had no idea wtf I was doing. I lost the third campaign mission more times than I care to recount, then I quit the game. About a year later, I came back to it with a clearer mind and figured it out, peice by peice. Each part of this RTS is unique and great. \n\nResources:\nYou have one resource, energy. The main source in the beginning of the game is by having an area of space filled with your \"Perimeter\" (hence the name of the game). Not by the NUMBER of energy producing buildings you have, like I first thought when I played this game, but by the amount of terraformed AREA covered by them.\n\nTerraforming:\nYou have to terraform the land to be able to construct buildings, which allow you to make different turrets and units. Buildings that are on ground that was previously terraformed but is now damaged, either by earthquakes, or other units' effects, they start to take damage. Also, damaged terraformed ground cannot support your \"Perimeter\" so you lose that amount of energy production.\n\nUnits:\nOne of the most important aspects of the game to learn quickly. To start off, there are three types of units. These units in and of themselves are pratically useless, they do very little damage and have very little health. However, through the act of combining them, you can transform them into vastly different more powerful units. Some shoot lasers, some launch missles, some hurl rocks, and some even tunnel underground. Each of these larger units takes a certain number of the smaller units.\n\nBuildings:\nThere are 3 main types of buildings: energy related, research, and turrets. Energy related include the energy producing building, which also can generate a sheild (for a substantial amount of energy), and energy storage buildings. Research buildings allow you to building bigger and better units and turrets; all you have to do is upgrade them to the proper level and the unit/turret unlocks. Turrets are turrets, they shoot stuff. \nThe important thing about the buildings is that they can be captured. In order for a building to be considered \"yours\" it has to be connected to your HQ building, either directly or through relays or the energy producing building. So, if your chain of relays on the way to the building from your HQ is broken, then the building loses power, becomes neutral, and is up for grabs. I love this in games! You can capture your enemy's labs so you don't have to make them yourself, and you can get labs your race can't even build!\n\nThis is a very different and unique RTS. Requires a huge amount of testing to figure out the best units and best strategies to use and which labs to get first and where to put your defenses and the ratio of building production to terraforming speed and the amount of energy you need and everything! My god this is a complicated game and I love it! This game is well worth it if you're willing to muddle through the non-informative campaign and figure things out for yourself.\n\nP.S. \nI will say, if you have the opportunity to by Perimeter 2, don't bother, it sucks. It's a completely unimaginative RTS that they shat out into the stores. It's NOTHING like this one, nothing at all. It has a very simplistic \"make dis den upgrade dat and you wins\" strategy. Just spam energy producing buildings and you'll never run out of energy. Not to mention it's a completely unbalanced broken PoS.
