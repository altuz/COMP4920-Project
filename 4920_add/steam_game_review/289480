The devs could have gone with an alternative artstyle that could helped them make the game more attractive while staying within budget.\n\nWhen it comes to sound I'm neutral to not very fond off. When it comes to voice overs, they are terrible. Music is uninspired too.\n\nGameplay is kinda average if not clanky, and rather unremarkable, and doesn't do the rest of the package any favours. \n\nI suggest you get it on a sale for under 3 euros.", "timestamp_updated": 1492790630, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492790630, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 13, "total_reviews": 18}}
