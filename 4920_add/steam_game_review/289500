HIGHLY underrated. Worth every penny with TONS of replayability. You could easily spend thousands of hours in this game. However, it is CRUCIAL that you look for and apply the 1.3 fan-made patch. It has several HUGE bugfixes that many people complain about, including some gamebreaking ones. With that patch, the game is absolutely in a class of it's own in the strategy genre. Top 3 of all time without a doubt.", "timestamp_updated": 1494689493, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494689109, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 18, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 27}}
