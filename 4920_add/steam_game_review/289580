There is also a decently basic RTS styled fighting system where you can watch buildings blow up in graphical detail and lead your tanks and infantry to vicotry! This is an interesting feature beacuse it easily breaches the gap for gamers who cant play Risk styled map games without a little bit of breakup with action, Like myself/\n\nThis game takes place in a period of history very rarely displayed in video games and i think this is will the core audience will come from. it goes from 1910 to 1950 yes thats right you can be france in ww1 and ww2!!! omg ft 17 renaults and Schneider tanks and sweet sweet interwar period vehicles.\n\n\nIn conclusion you will  feel like the master of your nation during one of its most interesting periods of history.

If yes, you might enjoy this game. I've heard a great deal about Aggression's depth, and even with my limited playtime I managed to experience some of it.\n\nHowever, to say Aggression is an unfriendly game is an understatement. While not the buggiest game I've played, Aggression is prone to crashes. The tutorial is easily broken, but this is actually due to poor design rather than poor code. Multitudes of information windows are lacking important information or hold no information at all. In game objectives suffer from the same bad design as the tutorial, ensuring they are far too easy to fail (if you don't have, say, an exact number of troops exactly close enough to reach an out of the way area of the map by a very short deadline).\n\nI don't usually play large-scale strategy games, so perhaps when I say resources were uncomfortably limited I mean that it would take an expert or a person willing to fail over and over to really learn the ins and outs. I never had enough resources to feel comfortable with the economy, and I set all of my cities to auto-construct to compensate. Unfortunately, if your not invading or managing your cities, you really don't have much to do beside moving your ministers around (your ministers effectively being agents of your will). The most interesting part of the game is therefore management, but as I said many features and windows are either poorly explained or missing information completely, so you really have to research outside the game to figure out what it all means.\n\nCombat is the weakest point of Aggression. The AI is some of the worst I've ever seen, and while the enemy can usually figure out how to kill you, your own units will struggle simply to follow your orders without getting slaughtered or running in front of tanks. This means that the second game mode, \"Missions,\" which consists only of combat, is entirely a waste of time. the campaign mode, the only real mode, features an auto-resolve button that should be used unless you're confident of overwhelming superiority or have put in the time to figure out how to abuse the system.\n\nNot fun and not worth it, even on sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1413013376, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413013376, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "9779265", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517760", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1407050463, "steamid": "76561197986131070", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Ok, really wanted to like this game, love the concept.

It has that mix of grand strategy with tactical battles that is tipical of the Total War series, but spans from before WW1 to after WW2, which is a period that very few games explore. \n\nBesides that the game has a great variety of units, decent graphics, most of the important historical figures and many character skills that give more depth to the grand strategy aspect of the game (just don't expect it to be like Hearts of Iron or any of the other hardcore strategy games). \n\nIt has to be noted that the Ai is simple, the game has no multiplayer and you can only play 4 factions (Germany, France, UK and Russia), but considering that this is a game from a small developer I don't find these limitations a problem.\n\nIn a nutshell: it is a fun \"Total War\" style game set between WW1-WW2, definitely worth the buy. \n\nA piece of advice: PLAY THIS GAME FROM THE TOP-DOWN VIEW ON THE TACTICAL MAP OR IT WILL CRASH CONSTANTLY. Also try to avoid pausing the game during the tactical battles because it seems to increase the probability of crashes.\n\nIf you are interested I've created some mods to correct some of the game's bugs and to tweak gameplay a bit:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/289580/discussions/0/357285562493973871/\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/289580/discussions/0/357286119116351240/", "timestamp_updated": 1464235049, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464223576, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "14754471", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502324", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1425615044, "steamid": "76561198007543336", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "For anyone looking for a real time strategy game covering the turn of the 20th Century, keep looking.
