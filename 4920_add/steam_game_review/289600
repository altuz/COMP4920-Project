At first I wrote a sarcastic and mildly humorous review, but realized that it might confuse some who read it.\n\nThe game is not worth its price as its a lackluster with no replayability value. To sum up the game in one long sentence: \"Its a really buggy, visually dated and barely playable tactical action game with a really short campaign, midly humorous eastern european scripting, inventory micromanagement, occasional crashes and a heavy emphasis on save-load mechanics\" or \"Akhmed and his buddies getting 360noscopedandnoclipped from the hip by shadowdancers.\" I don't know if its 1C/Aperion/Whoever or if the russian standard for games is lower compared to the rest of the world, but somehow the games get buggier and buggier even though they pretty much use the same engine. This is the sequence:\n\nBrigade E5: New Jagged Union (buggy, but playable)\n7.62mm (buggy, but playable with community patches)\nMen of Prey (Marauder) (buggy, almost unplayable without altering the configuration files, glitches, etc).\n\nTHE EPIC:\n\n* Ragdoll Physics (you rarely see people somersaulting straight up in the air following it up with mind bending contortion routine after getting shot once in the face with a 9mm pistol, seriously, this is some next level stuff).\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n* I like tactical action games.\n* Ability to modify the weapons (adding silencers and stuff, even though they didnt matter at all).\n* Ability to shoot people in specific body parts (though its far from Fallout Tactics complexity, where you blinded and crippled), shooting people anywhere will just stun them anyway and you keep shooting at them until they stop being alive.\n* Defending your safehouse on few occasions.\n* Nostalgia (played this game when I was young and impressionable).\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n* Buggy, Lag & Crashes.\n* Clunky Controls (this comes from a guy who is content about Dwarf Fortress controls).\n* Short (you basically do few missions, loot shit, sell shit and repeat few times, once the game starts getting interesting its over after few missions).\n* AI is beyond handicapped. (dudes run around randomly, you have to set your dudes to fire at them every time you lose sight with any dude that is aiming which is tedious af, AI noclips through stuff).\n* Tedious (gameplay and the high frequency of save-load required when the protagonist randomly gets 360noscopedwithapistolfromthehipat50meterseventhougheverybodylookedatthatdirectionandsawnoenemies).\n\nI got the game from a bundle, but had played it before and knew what it was about.\n\nSpoiler:\n\nhttps://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/781524-man-of-prey/faqs/72394\n\nLets Play, So You Wouldnt Have To:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpobIqXwKarHv_AZ7J7dInyl9r9BA1Cnx", "timestamp_updated": 1496363330, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1496185485, "votes_down": 9}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 76, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 60, "total_reviews": 136}}
