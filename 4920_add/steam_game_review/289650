The amount of hate and negativity this game gets is very undeserved for the clear amount of work that went into making it. I would go as far as to say, beyond the somewhat questionable performance and glitches here and there. Assassin's Creed Unity is the most detailed and fully realized AC game in the franchise.\n\nThere's a lot of things I really like about the game just from the get go. The French Revolution setting is an A+ already in my book, it's one of the most under represented settings in video games. They went above and beyond with trying to capture Paris during this era. They spent 2 years just building Notre-Dame cathedral. Beyond the gorgeous architecture you see things like peasants revolting in the streets and mass executions regularly throughout the map. It makes the world feel extremely alive and allows for lots of opportunities for very natural stealth during missions.\n\nBut that's not all. The developers also enhanced the gameplay of the Assassin's Creed formula to an extent I didn't think was possible. The player can now customize almost every part of their outfit. Not only that but different outfit parts also change the player's stats. The game now includes fairly broad RPG elements ranging from skills to stats of the player's health and attack power. This makes the open world side of the game feel much more motivating to do because it's directly tied to making you feel stronger and look cooler. The game also has coop missions and thankfully allows you to do them solo if you want.\n\nBut by far the best aspect of the game I've seen is the enhancements done to combat. Unity is by far the hardest game in the series. Part of this is due to many changes done to the enemies and overall gameplay. Enemies in AC Unity now can do multiple attacks. And depending on which attacks they use the player must either counter or dodge them. They also modified enemy AI so that when you are fighting multiple targets they will often pull a gun out and shoot the player while you are distracted. This makes combat feel much more tense and requires you to actually pay attention to what is going on since you can lose health very quickly. Many of the missions are very open ended in this regard allowing you to either engage in combat or more safely engage in stealth. SInce your health doesn't regenerate it makes it so you are very fragile and actually encourages sneaking around much more. It's somewhat shocking it took this long to make a competant combat system.\n\nWhile the performance and frequent pop in leaves something to be desired, the actual minute to minute gameplay is nothing short of steller. It's somewhat depressing that this game didn't do very well critically because later Assassin's Creed games ignored many of the improvements this game offered. It's a rare example of a sequel that improves on everything and yet doesn't get the attention it deserves.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1151974165", "timestamp_updated": 1506843335, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506837792, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35214906", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509555", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507055135, "steamid": "76561198259397838", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 488}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "pretty game after all the bugs that it previously had has been fixed, but controlling and its smoothness is still not satifactory when u try to jump down the charactor just keeps going backwards and sometime when u try to stealth the way out, ur are aften stuck by something like walls, he just cannot move or so, maybe you would say that a personal issue but I been playing ac franchsie for long time( not in this accout for previous games) that i never seen an ac game can be that good like ac brotherhood back in the time. but still it is a game worth-playin due to it has a mediocre storyline nut amazing graphic although the game has been sometime. the atmosphere is pretty nice\ngraphic: not exactly the same the video of e3 shown, but still good after downgrade.\ncontrolling: sometimes buggy.\nSTORY: SOMEWHAT CLICHE BUT STILL WITH SOME ATMOSPHERE.\nENJOY DIVING INTO THE CITY OF A NEXT-GEN GRAPHIC SHOWN.\n\nPLEASE JUST FIX THE CONTROLLING PROBLEM IN ORIGINS CUZ PLAYIN SYNDICATE I CAN STILL FEEL HOW BUGGY IT IS TO MAKE THE CHARACTOR JUMP UP WHILE IT ACTUALLY GOES DOWN MAN, AND THE WALL EJECTING IN 90 DEGREE CAN NO LOOGER BE PREFORMED IN THIS GAME, WHICH WAS LIKE W+SPACE+RIGHT CLICK HOLDING BACK IN ACBH AND ACR EVEN AC2", "timestamp_updated": 1506396297, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506395691, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35231883", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507192", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506882031, "steamid": "76561198055025761", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1723}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I am really enjoying it, the game is gorgeous and the music is probably my favourite in the series.

Sadly, some of which needs improvement, especially the problems that were present during launch.\n\nThe game had a bad launch. I was expecting it to have a more polished release, but Ubisoft decided to release the game because they had a deadline to catch up. A lot of players gave a really negative impression on the game and the company as well because of numerous bugs and glitches that were present during release. I pre-ordered the game five months before its release because I was hyped for it and I'm also a hardcore AC fan. It was so disappointing that the game was half-baked, so I decided to refund it when Valve added refund systems on Steam.\n\nAfter nearly two/three years, I decided to give this game a chance and bought it when it went on sale last week. I already finished the single player campaign, and I can say that the whole story of Unity is pretty forgettable in my opinion. Still, it's a pretty fun game to play. The Dead Kings DLC is pretty boring and annoying, especially when you explore the ruins. Pretty much you'll be surrounded by numerous thugs and probably end up dead in minutes. Multiplayer is fun as well. I tried two multiplayer missions and it's really cool that you get to complete missions with other players with different play styles. I'm glad that Ubisoft really did fix most of the bugs and glitches, and they also gave the Dead Kings DLC for free, which was supposedly be available for those who pre-ordered the game or purchased the season pass.\n\nHere's a breakdown of my Pros and Cons of the game:\n\nPROS\n+ beautiful graphics\n+ parkour is more improved and really fluid\n+ multiplayer is fun\n+ a lot of side quests\n+ music is good\n+ most bugs and glitches fixed\n+ combat is easy and looks really cool, especially the finishers\n+ stealth is improved\n+ story is okay\n+ you can choose skills and buy equipment that fit your play style\n+ Paris is fun to explore\n+ Weapons are really good\n+ Dead Kings DLC can help you grind more money, especially when you loot chests\n\nCONS\n- controls are really annoying. I can't perform double-assassinations easily even if two enemies are close and whenever I free-run, sometimes I go the wrong way even if I'm facing a certain direction.\n- AI is sometimes overpowered. They react easily even if you sneak.\n- you cannot complete all skills even if you finish the single player campaign. You can earn more points for it on multiplayer.\n- story is really short and forgettable, and you can finish it maybe in a few days\n- a companion app may be required if you want to grind a lot. You can also pay for a premium upgrade if you want a \"full experience\"\n- the characters speak English with a British accent instead of a French accent. It really ruins the immersion in my opinion (at least the crowd speaks French).\n\nIn its current state, I recommend you buy this game when it's on sale. I feel the current price may not be worth its value, but the game is really fun to play, especially with friends on multiplayer.\n\nP.S. I guess this is my first \"serious\" game review.

The graphics are wonderfully bright and makes France seem super vibrant, the towns are heavily populated giving the world an alive feeling. The parkour like most of the games in the series is always a bit off and sometimes you get climb things you don't want to. The new stealth aspects are real refreshing to see and I thoroughly enjoyed the stealth sections. I really don't understand why this game gets as much hate as it does other than for glitches. \n\nDon't know if anyone really played co-op but I have no experience in it. \n\nSide note: Played most of this game on console but bought it again for those sweet maxed out graphics\n\nAlso Personally never had a problem with Uplay\n\n8/10", "timestamp_updated": 1506870468, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506870124, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35322871", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507062034, "steamid": "76561198136558993", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 722}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "for 10$ its well worth it.", "timestamp_updated": 1506746327, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506746327, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 2465, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 2785, "total_reviews": 5250}}
