Some quest items are missing also, ultimately cut out to make game simpler. \n\nAside from this, graphic bugs are common, with items reappearing in places you take them. Also, I have encountered a bug where I have a duplicate stuck in my inventory permanently because I managed to take it two times from the same place.\n\nDo yourself a favor and find an original version somewhere else.
