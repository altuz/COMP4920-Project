I ain't lyin'!\n\nThe game is messed up on an atomic scale. ALL of the immersement is gone! Even talking to the NPCs has been watered down to freakin' speech bubbles... SPEECH BUBBLES!

It'll save you a lot of money.\nI may have gotten this for less than a dollar, but hey, that could have gone to a much better game.\n\nIn Conclusion: THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF MONEY.\nI'd advise you to NOT purchase this game. At least until Steam finds that ONE piece of their brain they lost when they let this piece of garbage be sold. If Steam can fix this and put the REAL PC version of this game up for us to enjoy, purchase it when that day comes.
