If you are hoping to have found a construction simulator you will be dissapointed. It is not! So far this is a transport (and digging) simulator. In the ten hours I have been playing this now, all the \"construction\" contracts are mostly just shoppinglists of construction materials and equipment you have to transport to a construction site. Things like bricks, cement, wood, roof tiles, generators, waste containers etc. The only thing that might be considered part of construction work I have done so far is digging holes, but that gets boring real fast.\nWhen things get boring there is an option to let an employee of the company do that for you, but then what is the point of playing the game at all?\n\nAnd when you start to notice that there isn't any actual construction to do, the whole game is a dissapointment.\nThe game could still be ok if the driving was ok. After all that is what you mostly do in this game. But the driving is bad. Steering response is never right, either too slow or too fast. Sometimes your truck will go flying away for no apparent reason. It landed in a tree. Luckily vehicles won't get damaged when you hit something so I could just teleport it back to the office. The controls feel very amateuristic and for example when using the forklifts the materials, even the heavy bricks, slide around on the fork like empty cardboard boxes.\n\nAnother thing that is bad is the tutorials. A tutorial for a vehicle with a lot of controls should teach you how those controls work. But the tutorial of the flatbed truck with crane didn't do that. It just tells you to move stuff form one place to another. And you don't need a tutorial for that, as that is all you will be doing in the game anyway.", "timestamp_updated": 1507169821, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507169821, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35230711", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496954", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506891010, "steamid": "76561197965286330", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 477}, "votes_funny": 16, "review": "Multiplayer prove that this is a true construction simulator! 1 player builds stuff 3 watches him working! 5/5", "timestamp_updated": 1506461539, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506461539, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "35231743", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497451", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507173736, "steamid": "76561197996378428", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1998}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A fun game, sarts to become redundent but then adds workers and such.
