This sim is all about processing data which you receive from your various sonar sensors at your 688 improved Los-Angeles class attack submarine. You should really ignore the graphics in these kind of sims because of the fact that you sit inside a steel tube trying to listen for enemy surface threats, evading them in order to accomplish your mission.\n\nThis sim starts to get even more interesting if you do every part yourself:\n- Listen and detect contacts with the broadband sonar\n- Use the narrowband to identify contacts (a big database of collected \"fingerprints\" during peace times of almost every ship)\n- Determine the speed in the DEMON (Demodulated Noise) with a pre-set Turns per knot (TPK) values for the identified ship\n- Use all data (bearing, range, speed, course) for the Target Motion Analysis (TMA) to get a good solution on the ship\n- Assign the solution to one or more tubes and fire.\n\nTo support some of the above mentioned steps, you can use the periscope as well as the electronic surveillance measures mast (ESM) to identify nearby contacts (only bearings), use your radar to receive more detailed data but blowing up your cover and merge this information with the available sierra contact => making it a master contact since more than 1 sensors provide data on one contact.\n\nBut you want to receive a mission first right? Go shallow and either raise your radio mast or deploy a cable which swims on the surface and wait for your orders.\n\nImagine having 5 contacts, you get really busy. \n\nYou have training missions, single missions and campaigns as well to test your skills. This is the best entry to modern submarine simulations if your computer is able to run that older sim!\n\n\nIf you liked it:\nSonarlysts - Sub Command (688(i), Seawolf, Akula)\nSonarlysts - Dangerous Waters (688(i), Seawolf, Akula, Kilo, Oliver Hazard Perry FFG, SH-60R Seahawk, P-3C Orion)\nSonarlysts - Fleet Command (from the strategical point of view)\nUbisofts Silent Hunter 5 - Battle of the Atlantic (World War II but not without Mods's!)\n\nPlease visit my channels if you are interested into oldies (startup project!):\nwww.twitch.tv/tertius_oculus\nwww.youtube.com/channel/UCtoN73hHYN0oTlqknOwxIUw\nwww.twitter.com/Tertius_Oculus"}]}
