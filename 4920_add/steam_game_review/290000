This was so fun to play, and the music and art style were perfect. It never felt too easy, and it never got to a point where it was so hard you wanted to quit. This game was the bomb!\n\nNotice those key words; Was. Were. Past-Tense Verbs. For those of you that don't know, they had an update, and it SUCKS. The game is way too easy now, the difficulty/endless modes are gone, the game is incredibly buggy, and the art style is totaly different. And, most important, the lasers and weapons are different. That was the main reason I got this game; because it looked so cool. Now, I regret buying it. It isn't worth the price (which was a problem from the begining. $20 for a game in BETA? Really?). If they could do one thing to make this game better, it's this: CHANGE IT BACK.

This level has a amazing feature where theres 2 ships at the start and whichever ship you shoot at first your ship turns the color of the ship you didn't attack and the ship you did attack starts to aim after only you. But this system is broken because whenever you die your stuck on which ever side you choose your glitched on that side and you have to restart in order to be able to choose the other side, theres also another broken feature which would have allowed you to destory parts of the ships (doesn't matter which side your on you can destory both ships whenever you please), but this feature is broken because whenever you \"destory\" a part of a ship you see a little sqiggly line over the that part you \"destoryed\" the line looks like it was drawn in MS paint, there's also a glitch where your weapons remain firing for 8 seconds after you restart from dying.\n\nEclipse: So I didn't find any bugs with this level but there things I want to comment on.The creepers are finally killable. The new spawning system for this level is floating dungon at spawn in creepers and spiders, but I do wish there was a way to destory these dungon because they do tend to spam my screen. There also these astroids at are floating that can be broken into smaller pieces and smaller pieces and then destory cool system but theres no effect when breaking apart/destorying these astroids and I do hope that gets added in soon.\n\nTough Guy: This level should be re-named \"Non stop lasers\" because this level is full of the same laser spam before at least it was a lighting like effect but now it's just lasers. Also the laser in the center on the level just pops into view the first time it appear and doesn't fade it like it does all the other times\n\nOVERALL: This update had lots of content but it seems rushed, unpolished, and untested and it seems as if they tried to do too much in such little time. But this does show this game has a lot of potential in the furture lets just hope the devs don't add in too much with out first making sure everything works first", "timestamp_updated": 1412737205, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1403218646, "votes_down": 12}, {"recommendationid": "13083612", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504691", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1453251880, "steamid": "76561198074875201", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Dubwars is a game that is okay. Let's start with some pros:\n\nWeapons: WOW, the weapons are extremely powerful and are different every level! They are in sync with the music, which is next.\n\nMusic: Well, it's Dubstep, but it's good. Even if you hate dubstep, you will like at least one. Mine is Eclipse, but the others are pretty good as well. \n\nThe Loading Screen: While loading, you get to hear another piece of music, which I have listened to fully, and it's not half bad.\n\nNow with neutrals:\n\nEnemies: They are pretty cool, but are easy to kill. For some of them, they have ranged, others charge. They're pretty generic.\n\nThe Radical Change: About a few months ago, DubWars changed drastically. Everything was different but the music. I like the new and fresh look, but hate that they took out features like a leaderboard, gems to continue, and a difficulty.\nIf you're new to this game, however, it won't really change anything.\n\nNow the cons:\n\nEnemies: There are some complaints I have, like when you press play again, the enemies still on the board from last game are not gone.\n\nLocked Playing: If you decide to play a game, don't press cancel, cause you'll be stuck in limbo. :(\n\nVaried difficulty: As I said, there is one difficulty now. On some levels, it's incredibly easy, but on others impossibly hard. Not good.\n\nAll in all, the pros weigh out the cons for this review. It's not complete, but it's worth a try.\n\nI recommend this game. :)\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1416957994, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1416957994, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "12428458", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514070", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1469853532, "steamid": "76561198137980084", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I am truly disappointed with the new update.

This game is so much fun to play! The graphics are stunning and super vivid, the music is incredible, the controls are super easy, and the concept of the game is one of a kind! I sit down to play a level or two for a couple minutes and end up playing for 2-3 hours. \n\nThe graphics for this game are very satisfying to say the least.  The weapons are so well done, each beat shoots a different type of laser or missile.  I learned pretty quick to use my 2 or 3 major beat drop weapons wisely!\n\nThe songs that make up the 10 levels are so enjoyable.  I've heard each one at least a dozen times already and still love playing every song.  Some are loud and crazy others are a little calmer and require some serious skills to survive with no guns firing but are all very well balanced.\n\nI love the upgrade system, my weapons get better after every attempt at a song. The different difficulty settings make each play through even more challenging than the last!  My favorite level so far I would have to say is Synergy, I can listen to that song and blow up enemies all day.  \n\nOverall a fantastic game!
