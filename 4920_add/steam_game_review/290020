Unfortunately there really aren't that many levels and they get very hard very quickly. I wih there was a help for each level which could even give you the answer to finish it. I've played the first chapter and the half of the second and one thing I have realized is that if your bot does not succeed the first time, but you know it should, retry without changing anything a few times, often you will see an even dramatic change in your bots performance. I wish I could give a thumbs up but the mechanics really need some working on and I'd really like to see a better help system on each level.", "timestamp_updated": 1502027559, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502027559, "votes_down": 4}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 44, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 53}}
