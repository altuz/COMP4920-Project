These games also strike a good balance between being challenging enough to be engaging, and easy enough to just pick up and play.\n\nThe best part about these games is the design:\n- Real levels. Maps are clearly designed, not randomly generated segments tossed together\n- Real goals. Each game has a definite goal (not just \"see how many points you can get, then try again!\")\n- Real endings. You can actually get the satisfaction of finishing the game before moving on to the next (no infinite levels or endless grinding in a \"challenge mode\")\n- Real direction. You learn how to play by being put in situations that let you discover each new mechanic (no big instructions to read upfront, and no annoying interruptions mid-game telling you to press a button to do something)\n\nGiven all that, I'd happily purchase a sequel that explored another half dozen game styles.\n\nAlso, there's a card game.\n\n\nCompleted or Quit: Completed", "timestamp_updated": 1505296516, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504125113, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34416583", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503387841, "steamid": "76561197994000906", "num_games_owned": 541, "num_reviews": 296, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Super Clew Land: The second-best metroidvania in this pack.\nEnd of Line: Original gameplay idea and neat use of storytelling. \nGAIAttack:  So uh what's the deal here why no checkpoints.
