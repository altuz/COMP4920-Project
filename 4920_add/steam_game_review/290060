I picked up the premise very quickly, made it through a handful of areas, and unlocked a few different categories of programming in about 30 minutes or so. And yet, the game's downfalls were jumping out at me.\n\nMost importantly, I think that Glitchspace didn't go through a proper QA (Quality Assurance) at all. Numerous times I had the game get me stuck if I hit an obstacle that made me respawn, because the game almost never respawns you in a safe place. For instance, there was a block that makes you fly forward off of a ledge. The game respawned me so that the block immediately threw me off again, and I was in an infinite loop of respawning.\n\nAnother example was where I was on a block and moved it a little too quickly in a direction so it hit a wall. The game made the block disappear and said that it went out of bounds and was reset. However, the game glitched me through the wall, so I was sitting on an invisible ledge on the other side, unable to move. And if I went to the menu and clicked \"Respawn,\" it simply respawned me at this invisible edge where I was stuck.\n\nThe last example I encountered in the first 30 minutes was when I tried to explore a little and jumped off of a tall block to an area down below, but couldn't get back up. Yet again, clicking \"Respawn\" simply respawned me where I was, leaving me there. So the \"Respawn\" button is almost useless in the menu as it usually respawns you where you are currently standing, or at a bad place the game code made you go.\n\nThe only way to actually get out of an area you are stuck in is to choose to return to the last portal you went through. Some portals are not exactly close together, so what this means is that you might have to redo a whole section of an area just because the game got you stuck somewhere. That got me angry really quickly.\n\nNext up is the actual mechanics. The game\u2019s concept is interesting, but the implementation is poor. Most of the puzzles I went through weren't puzzles. They were very repetitive and boring, and that was amplified by the interface used to program the blocks. What I really would have enjoyed would have been an interface where you choose a category, then it has drop-down menus and text fields to edit, instead of having a bunch of separate nodes for every single thing.\n\nFor instance, you can move a block along its X, Y, or Z axis. In order to do this, you must spawn a node that says \"Move Object,\" and you must spawn a node that explicitly says the axis you want, and then you must spawn a node that chooses a hard-coded value of the distance, and THEN you must connect all of them together to finally move the block. Further, if you accidentally choose something wrong, like say the distance, you must delete the node and re-create it to choose another value. You cannot edit the nodes directly to replace a value, but instead have to make a brand new one and re-connect.\n\nThat interface is so inefficient. In my suggestion above, it would have made more sense to simply have a single node that says \"Move Object,\" and the node pops up a little menu that says \"Axis\" with a drop-down menu saying X, Y, or Z, and with another drop-down menu allowing you to choose the distance. This would have made it quicker to program objects, and further it would have enabled you to actually edit a node because it could just pop the menu back up and let you change a field.\n\nBesides the above, there is obviously no story, and the graphics of the game are nothing special at all. Very monotone, really.\n\nWith the mechanics being so bad and seeing so many annoying glitches so quickly, I lost any desire to continue, and definitely don\u2019t think the game is worth much in its current state. The developers flew a great idea up high and then smashed it into the ground with their implementation.", "timestamp_updated": 1503988291, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503987814, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 111, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 31, "total_reviews": 142}}
