On paper it sounds great... Medievile survival sim. You can chose your own path..etc.. 1.

I decided to forage for food and materials so i can build a tiny shack in the forest. Turns out you'll need to make sure the ground is level before you can construct anything on it. leveling the ground is probablly the most tedious activity I've ever encountered. imagine  an endless grid of little asian boys that need haircuts. some of them need a little trimming, others needs full on haircuts and your job was to make sure they all had identical haircuts. That's gound leveling. You can hit the F3 key to expose the ground elevation. So lets say you have a  grid that shows tiles of land of varying heights. Well that info/guide dissapears when you go to place your shack in that area. You'll either need a very acurate photographic memory or you'll need to generously over shoot how much ground ground you'll level.

Everything is new and fresh! Great!\nBuild in tutorial is a big help.\nThen you are facing first problems.\nLeveling attributes? Months with normal ratings... Just boring. You have to spend huge time of grinding to just get standard abilities like bulding, mining,, woodcutting etc.\nSo I get back to the local game settings, busted up ratios and started again.\nLeveling up fixed.\nI tried to build few things, screwed few times and faced first big problem: building something which take more than one square of space.\nTo do that you have to level the terrain. This is slow as hell. Additionally you only know (as far as I am aware) when something is right leveled when you are trying to place some build. No big deal, right? Hella big deal. To place something you have to: point to the right square, click Q, from the context menu choose Construction, then build, then from the list select thing which you want to build, if you select wrong square you have to ajust the placing of the building. And this procedure is what you have to do, every freaking time when you are not sure if something is leveled right or not.\nThis is insane...\nAnother thing: logic of the skills unlock order.\nYou can cut down the tree, but if you want to do anything with the log, you have to level up another skill by gathering fiber. And not like \"oh 20 fiber and we are cool. More like \"you get 12415351234 fiber? You are half way through!\".\nAnother lack of logic. Building works like that: you are selecting where you want to build something (e.g. campfire) so you put a sign on the selected square, then bring required materials and build.\nUntil you level up the same skill with fiber gathering, you are able to place this sign, but you are not able to cancle that operation... Why? Because removing such sign is called \"deconstruction\" and is a skill from the Construction ability.\nFrom my whole 2 hours experience with this game I get frustrated around 10 times.\nReally bad for game which was released in 2015!!!\nAt least Steam refund works perfectly!", "timestamp_updated": 1507054479, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507054479, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "35069239", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1507171225, "steamid": "76561198007077030", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2273}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Consider that i've played this for 102 hrs. That said I think it's a remarkable game with great potential.  It's remarkable because it's terraforming system incorperates a \"quality\" system, has a diversity of trees,  potential for raiding and inner tribal warfare.  I saw potential because you can find servers with warmongers or hobbits.  The issues I have with the game are with the trees, water, and expensive construction system.  At the start the trees provide too little resources compared to the demands of the projects, particularly walls.  Deforestation is a significant issue on servers and even if trees are replanted they don't have suffcient quality to meet demand (ie 7 Q oak trees).    The lack of a sificticated water system is a big problem.  There should be springs or ponds at least scattered around the board, if not flowing water.  I appricaite them working with the claim system.  Sure people want to raid stuff and folks want to be able to build without getting all their stuff stolen, that's a delicate balance.
