That being said, I'm not going to be completely one-sided here; the fact is, it does have downfalls. \n\nPROS:\n- Nice graphics and interesting costumes\n- Classes and skill trees are quite diverse\n- GMs will hold mini events for some prizes\n- The forums are well updated\n- They have intoduced the level-up feature to help new players advance to lvl 70 quicker\n- If you care about the story, it's nicely thought out + the quest titles are puns which is great\n- The Summer event is the highlight of the year\n- Party dungeons have good boss mechanics\n\nCONS: \n- NA servers are really empty, but EU servers are doing well (especially Requiem)\n- A little bit of guild drama \n- It's difficult to get the gear to go to raids, a lot of grinding\n- Certain events impact the in-game economy massively making some items completely worthless in a matter of days\n- There are only 2 PvP battle grounds\n- Smart matching for older raids and dungeons is no longer available: you have to physically go there\n- The enhancement rate for jewels is ridiculous; if you want good jewels, be prepared to cash for it\n- The game can be monotonous until you actually get to level 70 and/or join a guild\n\nHowever, that all being said, season 3 is set to come out at some point this year. As with season 2 and 2.5, there was definitely an improvement with new skills, new equipment, raids, dungeons, events and an entirely new reqion to explore. I can only say that I hope season 3 will bring something new as I see a lot of players beginning to get impatient with the current features.

I was wronged, it was the SAME. EXACT. THING. It feels like World of Warcraft & Guild Wars mushed into one game. \n**PROS**\nFree To Play - This is and WAS the only reason why I played it, if this had a price tag on it i wouldn't even play this game, it's not worth it \nGraphics - They're okay, they look nice, the skills on the magi look nice and cool, melee classes look the same as every other mmorpg out there\n**CONS**\nPAY TO WIN BIG TIME!!!!!!! - This game is extremely pay to win, the shop in game offers you gear and other types of upgrades and gemstones for money in real life, No MMORPG should be a F2P P2W type of game, this feels like other games i've played numerous times. \nGender Locked Classes?? - I don't know if it's just me, but I'm a guy, And I like to play both female and male characters, and you're genderlocked if you are playing an archer, or a rogue, \nPvP - PvP is ass, literal ass. If you're playing a rogue you will win, rogue is the most BROKEN AND ABUSRD CLASS TO PLAY, If you want to level up faster PLAY PVP and PLAY A ROGUE, because you will NOT do anything else as any other class, if a rogue spots you as any other class you will get wrecked harder then you can mash your face on your keyboard, the rogue has 3 to 4 skills that are Crowd Control, why the ***k would you give a class 4 CC skills? And make every other class just absoulute garbage. \nLeveling up - If you thought World of Warcraft had a grind, be prepared for a grind 3 times longer then that, in WoW you at least get gear to give you 10% bonus EXP per kill and quest, up to a max of 70%, this game you don't get sh!t, you get nothing, the grind is horrendous and you must play PvP to level up the fastest, \nOver all, just steer clear of this money pit and give your money to guildwars 2 or Blizzard, this game sucks, hard as nuts.", "timestamp_updated": 1488320089, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488320089, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "30209444", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503381203, "steamid": "76561198148424750", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "good but i play sis long time ago", "timestamp_updated": 1488154354, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1488154354, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 7, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 10, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 10}}
