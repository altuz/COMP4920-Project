I just didn't enjoy it.  If I can't have fun with a game I can't recommend it.  It does have a lot of good points so many can enjoy the game.\n\nPros: \nLots of levels.  This is not an hour long puzzle game to finish.  It will take hours upon hours until you can completely finish it.  That's great when looking for price value in a game.  \n\nDifficult Level.  They aren't simple click and you're done puzzles.  It will take some work at moving things around to figure out each level.  While this could be a detractor to some, I think most will find the challenge to be enjoyable.\n\nUnlike some of those cheap little puzzlers you have options like windowed mode to allow for it to hang out while to you back and forth to it.\n\nCons:\nI just didn't really enjoy doing it.  It reminded me of Chip's Challenge without the fun skates.  The only reason I continued on and finished it was my own need to finish all my puzzle games to completion. \n\nI got it in a bundle and I loved most of the other games so I wasn't about to return it.  I might have if I got it solo.  Sadly, it just wasn't my niche.  But I experienced no trouble with the program and there were no annoying features that should be warned about.", "timestamp_updated": 1500164858, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1500164858, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34019091", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485849", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501863345, "steamid": "76561198006960163", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Yeah kinda fun.
