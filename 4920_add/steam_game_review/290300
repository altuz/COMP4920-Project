The transition between sublight and warp speeds is seamless, conveying a good sense of size to each solar system. There are some issues with scaling (small/medium craft with advanced weapons survive much better in the same scenarios than larger more expensive craft with the same armament and equipment), and the \"precise\" aiming mode for turrets is complete trash, swinging drunkenly past where you actually try to aim. Even the general \"manual\" aiming mode needs work, as it likes to lock on to whatever it feels like. There needs to be a key to quickly toggle between locking and true manual aiming.\n\nThe main plot is fun, if short. \n\nThis is a solid entry in the genre, and if there were a proper developer's kit I feel like it would attract a great mod community to take the game to the next level. It's been out for around two years and there has been no DLC and I've seen no rumor of a sequel, so that's a bit disappointing. As positive as all the reviews are, I hope sales were good and the developer can go on to produce more in the genre. There are too few space games out there, and few with such a shallow learning curve. It's very easy to pick up and play.", "timestamp_updated": 1505659725, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505659725, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35197483", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509400", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506363219, "steamid": "76561198061960277", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1318}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I'll keep it simple\n\nPros:\n-Nice visuals\n-Open world\n-Different ships to suit different playstyles\n-Aussies in space\n-Broadside naval-like combat\n\nCons:\n-90% of game is grinding slight variations of the same 3 missions to upgrade weapons/armor in order to not get reamed trying advance the story.\n-Larger ships have massive upgrade and repair costs mid to late game (1/8+ slot turrets costing nearly 2,000,000 credits)\n-Speed and positioning are huge factors in deciding fights, undermining any incentive to actually buy larger ships.\n-Even if you opt for long range weapons, the fastest way to take out most ships is to simply fly up close to them and spam LMB as fast as you can(Apparently the AI hasn't read the guides for this game on how to achieve maximum Dps)\n-Factions feel like they aren't fully fleshed out and \"rewards\" from helping said factions are lackluster at best.\n-Bounties(Other than lords) are seldom worth pursuing as the monetary rewards are usually a fraction of what a quest would give\n-Distress signals will often spawn behind you when you are in warp en-route to a mission causing you to have to come to a full stop and 180 and backtrack assuming you want to try to help.Best case scenario it's a trader who will give you a small amount of credits and not an ambush where you will gain ultimately nothing except for time wasted.With larger ships this process takes much longer due to turnspeed.\n-Escort missions have some of the worst A.I. I have seen in a game of this type.Often times when you pair warp, they'll fly straight into an asteroid field and sometimes if the escort goes on too long, the ship you are supposed to be escorting will just disappear(bug) causing you to fail the mission.\n-This game has a lack of immersion. You can destroy countless pirate lords and entire fleets and nobody seems to notice.Even as part of the main story quests, Npc's seem to have the attitude of \"Oh you're finally here\" and \"What took you so long?\" even though you are a single ship who just took out 10 dreadnoughts by yourself.Nothing you do feels like it actually has any real impact on the world (Universe?)\n\nDespite the flaws, I still had fun and would probably play a sequel.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1506321040, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506321040, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34779754", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506230", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504952790, "steamid": "76561197998876045", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Absolutely great game.

I saw this on steam and thought, 'Cool a space trading game!' Shortly after loaded it up and playing a while I realised that Rebel Galaxy could be fantastic, but feels kind of meh.\n\nGraphics are good, sound is too. I am very happy that I am able to choose MP3s of my own at specific times. I find hard techno a good sound for battle.\n\nPerhaps I suck at space battles, but I found that I needed to do a sh*tload of side missions to upgrade my ship enough to survive the story missions. It seems quite random. At times 'average' provided a challenge but was doable, and other times as soon as I get close to the target area my shields are gone and my hull is breached.\n\nPerhaps the most disappointing part of the game for me is the fact that the trading aspect is just so random. Not sure if it is explained in a tutorial but I figured out, buy red (low) and sell green (high). It didn't take long for me to get frustrated that no station in the system wanted the stuff in my hold. This leaves me with the feeling that the trading aspect almost seems tacked on.\n\nThe AI of mission NPCs is annoying, and many a time my escort mission or fighting companion gets taken out and I fail the mission without any warning.\n\nI like the idea of being able to mine in space. Rebel Galaxy makes this an annoying chore with little pay out. Without doing some internet searching, I seriously doubt the average gamer will be able to make enough money to warrant mining.\n\nIf you liked the mining and trading aspects of EVE online - don't buy this game. It will disappoint.\n\nI'd rate this 3/10.
