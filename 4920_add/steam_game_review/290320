However, the implementation is so poor that I couldn't enjoy the game and gave up after forcing myself into a few play sessions. \n\nThe controls are clumsy. This game would probably play easier if the camera were just looking from inside the eyes of the character, not from behind. In the first few minutes of the game the camera is even locked at fixed angle, you can't look around the room.\n\nThe constant interruptions by the tutorial text which freeze the game are very annoying. Also, it's the mouse click which closes them, but you don't see the cursor itself, which also feels strange. I'd expect clicking \"Next\" button or \"Close\". No voice-overs btw, which is, well, ok for a game which you get for a few euros. The text which appears word by word is annoying as well, it should appear just all at once.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, but you very soon notice that there is just a very limited set of models for environmental objects which they constantly re-use in every room. All rooms look the same because of that. In the end it feels more like a tech demo than a finished game, as if they bought some stub assets on the Internet. And the whole game feels generic and anonymous.\n\nNo environmental sound whatsoever! You walk around levels in complete silence. There are no footsteps, no buzz from the electronics around you etc. It feels like your sound card is broken or something - yet the music is playing. The music is good btw. The only sound I heard was the jump sound which is much like the Game Boy's Mario jump sound from the early 90s. Completely out of place.\n\nThe story is badly written. The very first message you get by pressing E on something in the first room is unintelligeble, and the rest even more, so I stopped reading them after the 3rd one.\n\nLike in most puzzle games, the actual puzzles are more a chore than fun to solve, with some rare exceptions. It's just that the set of actions the player can do is so small that not much interesting could be built around it, and the time-rewinding mechanics doesn't really save it. You step on buttons, run, jump, and carry keys. Then more of the same, and then some more, without any sense of progress or direction. They make a clumsy attempt to get you interested in solving the puzzles in a \"perfect\" way to earn stars (as if this were some casual game on iOS) but frankly I didn't bother at all. Stars feel too cheap for a 3D game where you control a character. At least in Portal it felt like a mix of FPS and puzzle, not just a puzzle.\n\nApparently there are some bugs with collisions, I got them every 15-20 minutes. Sometimes the character can collide into some object of the environment and get completely stuck (can't move/jump anymore). Once I got the character smashing into the edge of a cliff, stuck in the animation of running. If you jump on a rising platform, the feet sink in it. Camera frequently gets inside objects, including the character himself. \n\nHonestly, this product looks like a prototype for a game, not a real game on sale. It may be ok for the game's low price but cmon, the idea of time rewinds around which this game is designed deserves so much more!", "timestamp_updated": 1416849128, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1416805904, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "12061292", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525292", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1458825820, "steamid": "76561197970987565", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I spent 7.49 Euro on Project Temporality, and I'd honestly say it was worth it. The game is short, though. The game runs about as long as the original portal and has more than enough puzzles to be interesting, with some of them requiring very abstract thinking. It looks pretty good technically, though it's very samey, and I wouldn't with the story if I were you. But should you get it? Well...\n\nIf you like puzzle games, DEFINITELY buy this. It's one of the better puzzle games I've played in a while and - unlike the others - it doesn't look awful. The controls are loose and wobbly, but with essentially infinite-use time reversal, you can account for that. It's clever, it's creative and it gives you mechanics which seem familiar, but are fairly unique on their own. This will challenge your brain, but in a good way.\n\nHowever, Temporality is also a very slow-paced game. While you may beat most levels in under three minutes on the clock, keep in mind that the clock counts back when you reverse time. So while it may be an absolute 3 minutes, you'll actually be spending 15-20 minutes per level. The character jogs slowly, jumps awkwardly and the game requires a lot of repetition, minor adjustments to positioning and timing and a lot of staring at a puzzle to figure out what you to do. If you need action, this isn't the right game. And it also goes without saying that if you're awful at puzzle games, Temporality will frustrate you.\n\nFor me, though, it was a worthwhile buy at 7.49 Euro. I'm not entirely sure if I can recommend it at its full price of 15 Euro, though. I mean, it's cool and creative, but also VERY short. If you're a huge puzzle game fan I can kind of see paying full price, but for my pocket I don't know that I could go much higher than 10 Euro.

You are a person with the power of time manipulation (due to a prototype device) which you can use to turn back time and make a clone that does what you did before in order to solve puzzles and go to the next level. That means you can do two or things at the same time. Normally that would make things easier but not in this game. The complexity the numbber of time clones give to the puzzle only makes it harder.\n\nFrom what I played I can say with confidence that the execution of the premise is very good! Complex puzzles that require you to set your mind to ultra super problem solving mode while providing an aesthetically beautiful environment. This is one game that will put yout thinking skills to the test and provide you a fun experience! \n\nGraphics are very good for an indie game as well as generally for a game and truly for what this game is you don't need better.\n\nThis game is not for those who lack patience at puzzle solving but for those who really want a challenging puzzle solving experience or those who want to try a puzzle game (provided they have enough patience) this game is a must have (at least imo)!

Project Temporality puts the player on a futuristic space station and has you go through 14 chapters, each with its own set of puzzles that require you to use time clones to be solved. It might seem like a confusing mechanic at first, but don't let your first impressions deceive you. You perform a route that you'd want a clone to take, then you rewind back and create an alternate timeline. At this point, the action you've done already will be performed by a clone, whilst you can go on to perform another action.\n\nThe game lets you create up to 10 clones per chapter, and hence 11 timelines in total. Many of the puzzles require you to use more than 1 clone, creating a very smart and dynamic gameplay, which encourages you to think several moves in advance. It really reminded me of The Swapper (another good puzzle game), except in 3D rather than 2D and with more control over your clones. The puzzles themselves involve security doors, timers, keys, buttons, lasers, and moving platforms - things you'd expect in many puzzle games except executed with a lot of originality.\n\nSome of the latter puzzles start involving more complex mechanics such as temporality fields, which cause a door or a platform to remain where it was even if you reversed time. Regardless of complexity, solving each and every puzzle felt very rewarding. There was not a single puzzle in the game that frustrated me or made me turn to a walkthrough. \n\nThe game also gives you a star rating out of 3 for how well you did the chapter. Creating each timeline causes you to use up some energy, so the less energy you use overall, the higher your rating will be. This is pretty good for perfectionist type players, though from what I noticed, it is pretty hard to earn the perfect 3 stars on a level, or even 2 stars for that matter.\n\nThe visuals are very colourful and shiny, and do a good job showing a futuristic setting. The music is also really great and relaxing, perfect for when you need to concentrate on solving a puzzle. The game's story is mostly told by reading various data pads around each level as well as two characters communicating with you from time to time. The story is on the background mostly, so don't expect something akin to Portal 2 here. I think a lot of reviews, both critic and user alike, are very unfair for judging a puzzle game based on its story, when the main focus is on solving puzzles via time manipulation.\n\nThere were a few minor problems I came across, but they did not detract much from the overall experience. Like at times you could get stuck, mostly if a door closes the moment you walk through it, but all you need to do is to rewind time back a couple of seconds and you become unstuck. I did notice some big frame drops in some areas (with a lot of sunbeams), but this might not be the case for people with more powerful computers. I also found myself unable to complete chapter 13 the first time round, since I used up all the clones by the time I got to the very final puzzle in it and it was too late to rewind it. So the only way was to restart the chapter from the beginning. Gladly, once you know the solutions, you can blitz through the puzzles much faster. The devs were also kind enough to provide chapter selection, so you can play any chapter at any time, even if you haven't reached it yet.\n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed this game and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games or the concept of time manipulation.

What makes this game different from, say, Thinking With Time Machines?  The idea behind Project Temporality is this - what if you could wind time back and forth like an old VCR?  And what if you could, somehow, split off from that VCR - so as to have two movies playing at once?\n\nThis really is more intuitive than it sounds.

I think on my second playthrough, I'm going to copy said journals and try to piece them together... I was deliberately hunting for the journals.  I wanted to know more, about what happened on the space station, the development of time travel tech, and why on earth were there so many bloodstains on the testing track?

But every now and then you get to watch out the window and see...well, just watch the forementioned movies or play the game and you'll get it. The musical score and sound effect round the artwork off quite nicely.\n\nThe physics and modelling have proven a tad temperamental though. Buttons you're supposed to step on sometimes don't trigger because of the odd shape and the character(s) collision detection and lasers, which push you away, may push you into a wall and all sorts of freaky things start happening.\n\nThen there are certain puzzles that involve objects that are shielded from temporal tampering, and that's where the real gamebreak lies. These puzzles come with a checkpoint so you can still reset the puzzle and try again. The problem is that not all objects are properly reset when using these, resulting in bugged puzzles that simply cannot be solved, you cannot proceed and therefor have to play the entire level again, and again...and again...\n\nBut overall this really is a great addition for people that enjoy puzzles set in an FPS game with a SciFi undertone.", "timestamp_updated": 1442026964, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1442026964, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "16838499", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1435541287, "steamid": "76561198067926654", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Since I'm pretty enthused about this game I'll try not to be bias, and give an objective reviiew.\n\nPros:\n\n+The Game is highly entertaining and the puzzles are stellar.\n+Graphics are quite suffficent for a game of it's renown.\n+Puzzles are quite relaxing and exciting at times, never a dull moment.\n\nCons:\n\n-The \"Story\" is a little bit vague without the logs and they're completely optional and are actually not even hinted on how to read beyond the contextual icon. This seems like a poor development. \n-Continuing off the Story there appears to be no enemies/fighting, atleast as far in as I've gotten; This detracts from the idea of a 3rd person puzzle because at the very least you should have some crazed robot out to get you. This only has \"testing\" - and if I want \"testing\" - I can just play SE for hours on end. So Like I said the stories not so great.\n-As far as I can tell there's no \"real\" multiplayer - just you and your clones :(.\n\n\nAll in all would I recommend this game? Yes, to the right person. It's definitely not a GTA-styled game even though you may be lead to believe that by the screenshots. And to answer your question about open-world the \"tests\" are divided into levels - not exactly open-world to me...it is definitely a good game, not sure if I'd pay $15 for it again but what's done is done...", "timestamp_updated": 1435815007, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1435815007, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 14, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "review_score": 7, "num_reviews": 17, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 17}}
