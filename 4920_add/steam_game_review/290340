However, that was not long after getting Armello and before I put a great deal more time into the game.  I\u2019ve played more than 50 hours of Armello now and I feel that my views would help people decide about this game.\n\nMost of the reviews I have read here on Steam for Armello are from players with less than 10 hours of play.  Considering the tutorial takes an hour or so and then the matching up of internet games does take a while, you are forced to wonder how many actual full games of Armello these people have played.  True, first impressions are often interesting to read but I am seeing many sweeping comments made by people who have not had time to learn the truth.  I hope to correct that here.\n\nArmello is a digital board game with very strong and balanced mechanics.  You will see people claim this is broken or that doesn\u2019t work but the truth is they haven\u2019t played long enough to really understand the mechanics.   Armello is easy to get started on but has so many layers to it that strategy can become very complex indeed.  There is only a minor progression system so long time players are not heavily advantaged over new ones except in one regard: experience.  By this I mean that these players have seen more of the cards, skill combinations and tactics than other players usually because they have been the victim of them at some point.  You cannot play 100 hours of Armello and be so \u201cgeared up\u201d that you cannot be beaten.  However, if you learned a lot in that 100 hours, you can be a force to be reckoned with.  \n\nPeople will often tell you that the DLC characters are \u201cOP\u201d or \u201cpay to win\u201d.  This is simply not true.  I have played most of my hours with the base game only and I win regularly.  The disadvantage of not having the DLC is that you learn about the other characters and their abilities through contact with people that do have the DLC.  There is no other way to practice.  Anyone who declares the DLC as \u201cpay to win\u201d but has less than 10-20 hours game time has probably never faced the same character often enough to work out a counter strategy.  This is a bad player not a bad game.\n\nArmello is visually stunning.  The characters, game board, dice and cards set the scene and tone of the game perfectly.  There is a feature that you cannot view cards that you have never drawn/seen in a game.  This means to be fully familiar with the game you must play.  No sitting down and theory crafting before you even start.  It also means that you can be totally caught off guard by something you have never seen before.  While most characters are geared for two of the possible victory options out of the four, you need to be highly adaptable and realise when you need to change strategies.  The claim that all games end in a Prestige Victory is usually a result of players not fully comprehending the time limit on the game.  You cannot sit around.  The game has a limited number of turns.  You must press your agenda.  Messing with other characters should never be at the cost of your own progress.\n\nI would highly recommend playing Armello to anyone who enjoys deep strategy games.  However, I also recommend you put some time into it.  You are not going to be truly skilled at the game with less than 20-30 hours of game play.  Don\u2019t shy aware from facing experienced opponents either in multiplayer match ups.  When they beat you, they will be revealing their tricks and secrets to do it.  Snap up those morsels and trash the next guy with them.\n\nAs mentioned before, you can still be competitive with just the base game and no DLC.  You will just have to carefully study the new characters and their abilities when you see them.  You won\u2019t get to practice against them outside of multiplayer matches.\n\nI still rate Armello as one of the best digital board games I have ever played.  You will keep coming back to it and a game often takes less than 90 minutes to finish.  It can take up to four players but the AI is challenging enough that they won\u2019t ruin a game.", "timestamp_updated": 1505811801, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505811473, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34963724", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505084", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505453275, "steamid": "76561198004583352", "num_games_owned": 6935, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 2109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Still one of the best digital board games ever made.
