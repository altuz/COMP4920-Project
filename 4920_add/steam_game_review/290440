If an enemy gets too close or shoots, it hurts you...\n\n\nABOUT THOSE COMPLAINING MONSTERS DON'T DIE\nThey die from a single snipe with one of the head parts... a suck-in from some fins... waves correctly placed... basically anything done CORRECTLY works, really, yea, just one shot, now go and stretch that net.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1417311359, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417311359, "votes_down": 7}, {"recommendationid": "9909784", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515196", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1404456228, "steamid": "76561198096777347", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "When I first saw this game, I mistook it for a shooting game, in the sense that you run around dodging the enemy while you fire at them from afar (The problems of not reading and looking at the game carefully!)\n\n\nAt first, it kind of felt hard, it wasn't easy getting your bombs to detonate right in front of your enemies' faces when both sides are moving. Your bombs are affected by your surrounding, which are in turn, affected by your bombs, your movements, and the enemies' movements. This surrounding of yours is very important because it will affect everyone's movement. You can drop absorbtion bombs which will compress the surroundings, dragging everything, bombs, enemies (and you!) into it like a black hole. You can even absorb them to yourself, (be careful of letting them touch your head! Your hitbox is in your head) causing them to follow you in a line and crushing each other. Spin around in a circle, and your enemy will ball up and crush each other to death (or be crushed by the surroundings)\n\nIt's hard to explain. I found this game fun because there's a slight tactic to it. Simply placing bombs at the enemy's location might not work, and you would have exploit the enemy's patterns and your own abilities to be able to blow it up. You can also do the tactic above, carefully compressing the space in the surrounding and forcing the enemy to be squished by the web or by each other.\n\nWell, I liked this game and would recommend it for anyone who wants to try something new\n\nOh, and by the way\nGood luck on bullet hells.

With bigger groups it has a decent challenge but when the group is cut down to 3-5 individuals it takes to long to kill. You place the bombs on them directly, on the side or just spam them with bombs or carefully place a bomb on them and they wont die. Takes 3 to 5 trys to kill one in a small group. It kills the paceing of the game for an action game. And I swear they have some sort of short invincibility time after they get hit because of this.\nI dont like the fact that it advertises itself as a shoot em up as the only way to attack is to place bombs everywhere. It's interesting and the only problem I have with it is what I said as above and that placeing bombs dosnt count as a shootemup but you do get shot at. \nI wish this game came with a tutorial because as I said above, you can place bombs on enemys and it wont do a thing when theres a few left. Because of this I didnt know if I was playing it right or not.\nAlso with small groups not getting hurt the same thing applies to 2 bosses I have encountered but worse. They seem to be invincible at times not getting hurt at all only for you to do a small amount of damage. If theres an opening for when your supposed to hurt it I dont know what it is plus I wait 3 or 5 seconds before I spam it with bombs for a good 10 seconds\nNote: The bombs themselves dont kill them its the waves and ripples the bombs make. If you do get this game I find the minibombs to be the worse one to use. Still find it hard to kill them.\n\nGOOD:\nOne thing I do like about this game is the risk reward it has. The power orbs which play as money lay on the screen disappear when you get hit once and the power orbs can increase in value when they gather into one big orb. \nAnother thing I sorta like about this game is that you can make waves with the bombs to try and push them towards enemys,speed up or slow you down.\nThe designs of the player character and the bosses are cool but the main enemys look like cereal. \n\nIn the end if you love these kinds of games and have more patience with trying to kill a couple of enemys that wont die untill the 3rd bombing attempt youll find some enjoyment with this game. I dont really like it but I might play an hour of it per month or just try to see all the levels then be done with it. Not a bad game but not a good one also as I see it. In the end I have to give it a no that I dont like this game. What really kills it for me is that it takes forever to kill a single guy and that takes up to much time for an action game.

It has some mechanics from a shoot'em'up, but not shooting on the players side. Instead some \"ripple graviational deformation\" are created by bombs and \"inversion bombs\". The ripples are visualized with a dynamic grid.\n\nCheck the official webpage, as it contains some more explanation than the ingame help.\n\nThe initial \"ship\" is a bit weak. Nevertheless with some experience it is possible to beat at least everything up to boss number 4, even with this ship. Tipp: use both weapons quickly one after the other while rotating the ship, therefore positioning the bombs close together.\n\nOne main shump mechanic is the move or get killed one, which applies strongly here. But as there are no long range weapons (at least the first upgradeable ones are not), it is necessary to get close to moving enemies. This is what makes up a lot of the fun of the game.\n\nThe enemies (I played up to boss 4) are all  very nice, challenging, partly innovative. Graphics is ok, a bit generic, but practical, as it does not overfill with effects which are not directly linked to the game mecanics, as many other games have.\n\nIf you are not fixed to the standard move and shoot shoot'em'ups but want to try something a bit different, while still having some of the mechanics, I can highly recommed this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1477337903, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1477337455, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 9, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 19, "total_negative": 10, "total_reviews": 19}}
