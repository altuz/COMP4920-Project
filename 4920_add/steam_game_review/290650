I found it fascinating - an emotional canvas of delicate construction, cool and labyrinthine in its well considered tones. Much like the work of Jason Welge seems to be (ie. unconsciously.) There's lines in Pessoas's novel, about \"this indefinite lucid blue pallor of the aquatic evening\", which \"point up the irregularities of the unruly whole.\" The indistinct lackings and paltry failures of Time Ramesside seem to echo this. And the echoes travel deep into the soul, and I reflect them back for you to witness here, today.\n\nApologies to my fellow Players for this unfocused sensual rambling. Bizarre states of uncommon Play - those often symbolized by Permanent Early Access Crapolaware - make one dizzy with the poignant metaphysical alchemy of their luxurious, squirty inadequacies.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes - \"I recommend this game smartens up its #ing act, tout de suite.\" As for what This Game more actually is - an act of treason against modern functioning design, a Capitalist performance art without precedent, a total breakdown in dimensional hyperreality - ah, well that's another question for you to ponder, dear friends.\n\nThank you for playing this Unorthodox, yet hopefully Effective review.\n\nSincerely, Robert H.
