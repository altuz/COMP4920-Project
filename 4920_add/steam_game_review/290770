The voice acting made the story interesting, but other than that, it's hard to find good things to say about this. If you look around even positive reviewers aren't ignorant to the quirks this game has. Most notably the controls... I think I'd be best off using a pro/con list for once\n\nPros\n-Good story\n-Great Voice Over (on the Administrator AI, specifically)\n-Dank yet thought-provoking setting/atmosphere\n-Challenging Puzzles, some people like to play the guessing game\n\n\nCons\n-Controls, clunky and unorthodox to say the least. \n-Horrible combat\n-Minimalistic, cheap UI. |- - - - - - - - - -|  << literally that\n-Under-utilized potential. I was able to use the assassination mechanic maybe twice throughout the whole game\n-Puzzles can be convoluted and make almost no sense. You're gonna be using a guide for this one\n-Extremely short game. I beat this, and then beat it again for 100%, and have barely over 4 hours of playtime total...\n\n\nWhen the credits came up I felt like it was still somewhat incomplete, like the whole game was just cut short. Then it hit me when I saw the giant list of donors. It was a kickstarter that probably used less than half of the amount they raised. This game truly felt like it was laboured out of necessity- like they did as little as they could possibly get away with to fulfill what they promised to their backers. So, instead of giving the negative things a pass, like a lot of the other reviewers seem to be doing, I'm just gonna go ahead and be honest with myself and down thumb this one.\n\n\ntldr; Amazing plot, stunted execution", "timestamp_updated": 1502563740, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1499952716, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "34622512", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501311", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504140118, "steamid": "76561198093919303", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The Fall is about an AI struggling through rudimentary testing in an attempt to serve it's pilot. It's mostly a puzzle game, of the point and click sort where you pick up items and move them around, but there is a bit of combat as well. Completing this game took me 2 hours, but I also cheated, so it's probably worth a good 3.5 if you're really vigilant.\n\n\tI didn't really like it. I'm not a huge fan of this genre of game in the first place, and the atmospheric horror [spoiler]which never panned out; I was a bit freaked out at times but nothing ever got more dangerous than those security robots[/spoiler] didn't do it for me either. I will say that if you're a fan of the genre I described above, this one is probably going to entertain you.\n\n\tThe soundtrack was ok. Each \"level\" (literally, levels of the structure but more loosely grouped) had different music. Some were good, some weren't, but I'm not going to crucify a game for mediocre music. (5/10)\n\tThe story was probably the most compelling part of the game. It asked questions about purpose, truth, and the conflict between following the rules and deciding that the rules are stupid. (8/10) Major spoiler: [spoiler] Unfortunately, I really disliked that the caretaker ended up as the \"bad\" guy; it would have been cool if the mainfraim AI turned out to have been truly evil, instead of just surviving the obsessiveness of the caretaker. But the ending was also really neat: it instantly made me think that the whole thing was part of a test of ARID's cleverness or something, but we'll just have to wait and see what the sequel is like![/spoiler]\n\tThe mechanics weren't great. Although polished mechanics aren't [i]super[/i] important in a game like this one, it was still kind of annoying how the screen would \"flip\" back to looking behind me whenever I wanted to look at the ceiling for whatever reason. Essentially, the shooting and puzzle completion were fine, but the observation was a bit of a pain. (6/10)\n\tAnd finally, the art! It was actully a decent style. I will admit that The Fall lives up to it's \"atmospheric\" tag: the whole experience really felt dirty and gross, which is I'm sure what the designers were going for. The 3D modelling was good, if a bit lacking in polish, but overall things felt cohesive and made sense visually.(7/10)\n\n\tSo, overall, I give it a 6.5/10.

It has a fantastic aesthetic, interesting premise, and intuitively constructed puzzles. The dealbreaker for me, however, is the controls. It just feels absolutely terrible to play.\n\nSome key issues:\n- Aiming is quite off, to the point where my cursor has to be halfway across the screen from what I'm aiming at in order for the gun to make contact. Given the importance of precise timing to the combat, this is very frustrating.\n- Jumping feels floaty and unpredictable.\n- In order to interact with objects, they must be highlighted with the flashlight. Interactable objects are not visible otherwise. You literally have to be shining a flashlight on an elevator panel directly in front of your character in order to press it. This means the flashlight has to be out most of the time, which slows your movement, and suffers from the same awkward aiming difficulties as the firing does.\n\nPlaying this game is largely a question of betting on whether I can get through 10 minutes without quitting in frustration at the horrifyingly bad controls.\n\nIf you are someone who has a very high tolerance for control-based problems, and nothing I've listed above sounds like a big deal to you, then you might want to give it a try (for obvious reasons, I can't vouch for any late-game or ending content), but for the overwhelming majority of players, this is just going to make you miserably frustrated.", "timestamp_updated": 1501957900, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501957900, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "34492181", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499545", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503702675, "steamid": "76561197999057238", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "beautiful graphics, lovely soundtrack and engaging story all feel wasted when paired with the clunky and unintuitive UI. decisions made in the controls could have been worked with and overlooked had action sequences not appeared,requiring better control than feels possible in the game. combined with some frustrating puzzles too early in the game, the control scheme marrs this to the point of unpleasantness.", "timestamp_updated": 1503703353, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1503703353, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "33791843", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494290", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500755296, "steamid": "76561197992116894", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Unplayable due to broken controls, which is a very bad thing for a game like this.
