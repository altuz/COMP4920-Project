No, because I did not expect a complete game. I liked what the premise of the game was, so I backed the developer so they could further expand the game into what they wanted it to be. \n\nThat being said, the game still needs to have a little bit of work done. But as it is in Beta .3, I can forgive many of the faults I find in it. The music is ok. Not great, but not terrible. The only major complaint I have had thus far is the damn whistleing.

The storyline follows Ken and his men, through different missions as they undertake the battle and stop the march of the Han.\n\nVersions:\n[b]\n[*]0.31 June 2014\n[*]0.32 July 2014\n[*]0.371b October 2014 \n[*]0.40b November 2014\n[*]0.41b December 2014\n[*][url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/290870/discussions/0/619569608514524833/] View latest changelog[/url]\n[/b]\n\nThe graphics in Steam Squad are still being developed, they are similar to Men of War in it's current state. The artwork is interesting and fun, with of course a steampunk look. \n\nThe Gameplay is the typical turn based type, where you get to move your troops into position, fire at the enemy and then end the turn,waiting for the enemy to make their move. As always, placement of the troops is important, as the Han are very good shooters!\n\nSteam Squad will include tanks, artillery and other \"steam\" powered instuments of war ,which will be drivable. This increases the playability value - and turns this game from a typical strategy shooter. Destructable environments are currently not included, but will be at a later date.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=331276120\n\nThere is no ability to control the camera - other than panning (zoom is not enabled), and the camera does not focus on the enemy when they take their turn. I believe that some camera tweaks are being worked on and will be released in a later version. The camera view is dimetric. \n\n[b]**Update v 0.371** [/b] The camera now follows the actions of the player and npcs. It also includes the zoom function. These improvements have made a big difference to gameplay.\n\nThe UI looks great, but again, some work needs to be done on this to make it more polished and easier to use. Having said that, it does not stop you being able to have an enjoyable game.\n\n[b]**Update v 0.371** [/b]\nThere have been tweaks made to the UI, both in the main menu, mission selection, and gameplay screens.\n\n\nThe music is ok, the  background effects lack the atmosphere of explosions and gun fire. . more needs to be done with improving the audio emmersion.\n\nOverall, Steam Squad performs very well, and is not a walk in the park to play. It's an early beta, so expect that there are going to be things that are missing, don't work, or need improvement. The developer - Bretwalda Games - is constantly working on Steam Squad with an further update v 0.371 just released.\n\nI think that there is plenty of room for Great War era games such as this, in a overly populated Second World War gaming universe. \n\nI recommend Steam Squad, even in it's current Beta build, it shows great potential, and whilst Bretwalda Games are a relatively new company on the scene, the quality of their work, and commitment to ensuring that the comunity voice is heard equates to what I hope is a very successful game.\n\nDefinately a strategy title to add to the collection at under $10 doleros, if you don't mind putting up with a few annoyances along the beta journey, until release.

If to summarize its pros and contras, here they are:\nDifficult to accomplish missions if you do not play accurately and smart.

Feels like it is progressing fast to be finalized;\nCons: \nStill too few missions :-( and only one is so far with tanks and artillery; \nQuite many of the iconic symbols of Great War are missing - barbed wire, gas, cavalry attacks...or at least I did not see it yet - did not find info from developers if they plan to have it", "timestamp_updated": 1464364367, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1464364367, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "25059467", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498672", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1471831249, "steamid": "76561198052333663", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First Impression Video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yfzO2YVav7w\n\nSteam Squad is a fun turn-based strategy game set in an alternate history World War I. That being said, it does have its issues.\n\nSo, if you've ever played XCom you know the basis of Steam Squad. You have your squad, the enemy has theirs and it's a firefight from there on out. The controls are mostly run by the mouse with left click executing most commands and right click over-watching. It's pretty easy to pick up once you've done the tutorial and the first few missions are easy enough for you to get a hang of them.\n\nOverall the system works out pretty well, but I do have some gripes with the game. I'll just list them out here:\n\nCover - This is my biggest issue with the game. There is clearly cover mechanics in the game, but the game gives no indication to the player of whether or not you've actually gotten into cover, or what is actually considered cover. Low sandbag walls and trenches? Obviously those are cover. That stump out in the field? I can't be certain. Have you poked your unit so far around the corner that he's not in cover anymore? It's hard to tell. \n\nUnits - There are only three types of units: soldiers, machine gunners, and grenadiers. This is fine, they all have their position and I've never really pined for any other units (outside of maybe a sniper).\n\nAction Cams - As a lot of other players have stated, I don't like the action cams. There's not much to see and they just slow down the combat. Plus, when up close the units run really weirdly ( which, I'll admit, I quite enjoy watching them waddle around).\n\nDespite these things, the game is fun to play. It uses an action point system that allows for more variety than something like \"two actions per turn\" (aka the XCom system). The scenarios can be challenging while not being so brutal you want to throw your computer out of the window (or wherever you want to throw it, I won't judge), and the aesthetic is quite nice.\n\nOverall, this is a fun turn-based strategy. It seems mostly glitch free and is a game I will definitely play to completion in the future.

Ultimately, this is an extremely shallow game, granted I only made it to the third mission before having to quit forever, so maybe there's more content I haven't seen... but doubtful.\n\nFor starters, the first thing I noticed about this was the extremely amateur production.  And that's not in like a indy-dev boot-straps and moxy kind of way, it's a very unpolished game that shows very little thought was put into many of the design choices, even things that have been standard for years.  Interface is pretty lacking, common QoL shortcuts are none-existant, prepare for lots of needless clicks.  Mission briefs are full of useless nonsense and lacking in actual content, you'll read a few .jpg's sliding on the screen and wait for the animation of pages shuffling to see each useless one.  Random transitions during the intro cinematic were absolutely jarring really the first big red flag I noticed.  They quickly, often, and randomly changed from cartoony animated 3D, to 2D, to actual live footage, to still shots, and then back again.  Pick a style!  It's like all the content was salvaged from the free demo bin Baby's First Game Dev book.  It honestly feels like a lot of things in here were added to increase the game's run time and pad the clock.  Either to create and illusion of lots of content, or to get people past the Steam refund wall.\n\nBut, that's all kind of nit-picky stuff I realize most won't care about.  So actual gameplay.  It's shallow, real shallow.  In the first three missions I played through I was presented with the same 3 unit types.  Their differences end up being trivial ultimately to the mission at hand.  There is an inventory but it is clunky and I regret even noticing it because it was irrelevant to the game and just forced me to navigate more terrible menus.  The actual missions are dull just wait for them to rush into our overwatch areas, forced cinematics that are hardly what I would call 'animated' that add nothing but time to the mission.  At the end your well performing troops get experience and stats... but what that is good for I've yet to determine.  3 missions, you'd think you'd get a level up, or new gear, or new unit, or something.  But no, there is absolutely nothing new to incentivize good performance or even loading the next map... so I didn't.\n\nSo at the end of that, I think this game is really close to being something great but seems to have been pretty mismanaged for a while and is way off target for what would be expected of a modern game.
