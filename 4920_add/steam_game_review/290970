Well?  In the time of the California Gold Rush.  1849 can be played in both sandbox and campaign modes, with the latter involving building towns all around California to exploit natural resourses of the immediate area, and sell these resourses to other cities in California via trade routes. Once scenario objectives are complete, it's time to move onto the founding of the next city.  Trade routes are both ways, so if one city buys something your city has to offer, then you'll also be able to buy whatever it is that other city specializes in, and hopefully the item in question will be something your settlement needs.  But like many other management sims, it's much better to sell than it is to buy.\n\nGraphics and sound:\n\nThe graphics are what you can expect for the money, but that ASSumes the player bought 1849 when it was on sale.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137777463\n\nThere's nothing that stands out as particularly likable concerning the sounds of the game, but the period music does help with setting the mood.  I'll listen to the music if I really do need a mood-setter, but I don't particularly enjoy any song in the game's soundtrack more than the other, so I'll mute the sound on the game, and play my own brand of music the few times I play 1849.\n\nPositives:\n\n1849 is an original concept for management sims, and there's not a great deal of gold rush era games in the first place.  If you're fascinated by the Gold Rush era, you should enjoy this game more than me if you management sims are your thing.\n\nNegatives:\n\nThe difficulty curve in 1849 appears to have some randomness to it.  (Either that, or it gets extremely difficult very quickly!)  The first several missions in 1849 were pig simple, but fairly early on, you're still going to need to need playthrough videos or text walkthroughs to help beat one of the scenarios.  The way to complete one early scenario was one I never would have guessed on account of the scenario not requiring production or selling of the biggest money maker, which is your only means of completing this scenario.  Any management sim fan will tell you that there's nothing worse than a game that has only one exact way of completing a scenario, and while I can tolerate such a flaw in missions that are supposed to be extremely difficult at the end of a campaign, a player shouldn't have to go through it less than five scenarios into the game.\n\nThere's nothing interesting to speak of about the campaign.  There's no main character to speak of, nothing of interest comes up between scenarios except for a big ol' map of northern California, and the location of where you settle next.  In fact, the campaign just seems very boring in general.  It's been about twenty years since Railroad Tycoon 2 was released, and it featured very interesting insights to scenarios.  (Including it's expansion pack, which had interesting things to say about even it's far future scenarios.)\n\nRemember Imperium Romanum which had all sorts of interesting facts about the Roman Empire that were revealed as you played the game?  This feature is totally absent from 1849.  My only interest in California may be in the Punk bands from there, but it would have been nice to have gotten lessons from the game as to the relevance of things like olive oil and cotton to the Californian economy when you're pretty sure that gold mining was the be all, end all of what made settlers want to settle in a state plagued by mudslides, earthquakes, fires, and lots of people who think the sun shines out of their behinds.  Random fun facts about the Gold Rush would have been nice, but about the only thing you're going to learn from this game, is that the campaign can be difficult, and is really uninteresting.  (Players may, however, have fun building up a city in a sandbox game.)\n\nConclusion:\n\nListen to your friends on Steam:  They are your friends for a reason, and they mean what they say when they say not to purchase a game!  I thought one friend in particular was just being overly critical about 1849 (and lacking in key information), but you can take it from me to save your money on much more fascinating games, because I make a more solid effort to inform players (usually friends) about games.  I do intend on completing the campaign someday just for the sake of having bought this game. (Edit:  I changed my mind, and decided to request a refund.)  You might have fun playing sandbox games just for the sake of building settlements from the ground on up.  (A challenge I sometimes enjoy, but far less after having played Banished.)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137776534\n\nI cannot recommend 1849 in good faith to anyone.  There's far better games on Steam involving management for the same amount of money (even at 1849's sale price), and if you need the challenge of developing cities, just look for an established city building game to get your kicks.", "timestamp_updated": 1505687188, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505686569, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 70, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 39, "total_reviews": 109}}
