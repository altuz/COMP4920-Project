Winter Wolves has done a lot of great games, and while this is not as high up as most (It seems to be rough enough that maybe it is one of their earlier products), it still is satisfying. So, you split time between farming vegetables and fruits (berries are fruits, so are tomatoes) and trying to build a relationship with some available women... or even the one who dumped you before you got shipped off to this town.\n\nOh yeah, you were shipped off to Fairbrook because you are basically a good-for-nothing slacker and your overbearing dad wants you to shape up... so he sent you to the brother he doesn't like so much for a taste of rural life.\n\nNow you can end up alone, or with one of the girls. Supposedly there is a normal and a special ending for each girl, but I have only seen the normal ones... guess I'm too good with the crops... (apparently there is a cash limit you shouldn't go over... cumulatively).\n\nStill a fun little thing.", "timestamp_updated": 1492769266, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1492769266, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 20, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 14, "total_reviews": 34}}
