These devs bought some high quality discount assets from the Unity store and dropped them into the most atmospheric immersive enviorment that's almost life like with reflections, light shafts and tessellation on the slender like creature roaming around. If you thought the graphics of Silent Hill 1 and Resident Evil 1 on Playstation were amazing, guess what? This game puts them to shame, I feel as if I robbed the developers by getting the game for 49 cents. The optimizaton for the visuals is amazing too, it almost maxes out my high end graphics card at 1080p.", "timestamp_updated": 1504573211, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504573211, "votes_down": 6}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 561, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 326, "total_reviews": 887}}
