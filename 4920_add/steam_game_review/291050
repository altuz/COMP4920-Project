This did take a lot of time though.\n\nThe story seems to be OK, but filled with a bit too many stock plot \"twists\" to be really interesting. For a cheapish game, I can live with it. Dialogs are simple and rather... dull. You are presented with a block of text, follwed by another block of text and so on. Once the talking is done, you're presented with a few options (which you can repeat untill you hit the magic \"stop talking\" button). So far, I've found very few real dialog options.\n\nDialog does affect relationships from time to time, but just like too many other \"RPGs\" you often have no idea what the effects will be; when allowing my party to drink while gathering information, my relations with the super soldier party's alcohols is reduced.\n\nThe combat is typical for it's genre -- your party goes in order and get a few options to attack the enemy. The enemy then goes in order in the same style, untill either side is defeated. XP appears to rewarded on a kill basis -- when a party member finishes an enemy that person gets all the XP from the enemy.\n\nCombat difficulty appears to scale much faster than your characters do. So far, I've gotten 1 level on my main character (by manageing damage so he could get more kills). In the meantime the enemies have gone from doing about 5 damage per attack to about 20 damage per attack and hit points have gone from 40ish to 300ish.\n\nIf you want to have level your main character fast, go for scout -- accuracy is the most important thing when dealing damage and scouts, at equal skill level, will be significantly better at hitting enemies, while doing roughly equal damage (that is, more damage) than soldiers or guardians.\n\nOn top of the poor combat and the bad writing, the game's performance is appauling. On a 2.8 GHz CPU the UI is sluggish, animations choppy and picking dialog options have delays. Combat is equally slow. The only part of the game which does not have extremly bad perfomance is text rendering, which is a big help, since you'll be skipping most of it anyway.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game. The balance of the game is really poor and the story simply doesn't make up for the rubbish combat.", "timestamp_updated": 1412856099, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1412855754, "votes_down": 16}, {"recommendationid": "10331965", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519404", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1402015302, "steamid": "76561198046317580", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I tried to like this game I really did. It seems like there is a dynamic skill and character development at your first glance but it quickly wears off as you can save at literally any time during both conversations and battle. This means you cans save for random dice roll percentile skill checks (given like 22% chance of success) and you can bump each party member in 1 skill and since you have your entire huge party available for most tasks you always succed. Talking to your party hurts me physically as most of the other party members (soldiers) in the game have high school kid conversations. I ended up nearly maxxing charisma to only use it two or three times the entire game.  The game appears and plays to be a high class flash game from a website not so much a game worth $20.\n\nI am a big fan of games like Planescape Torment, Fallout, Shadowrun and Age of Decadence so story really matters to me, and with a game which has combat in which you can just click through you need meaningful conversations to happen. \n\nThe weak dialogue and character interactions really disappoint because the plot was quite interesting albeit extremely short but the immersion is too easily broken with your character stammering and getting embarrassed like a kid about to have sex for the first time all the while everyone praising your magnificent efforts.\n\nWorse part is I'm likely gonna finish the game just so my character can get laid by sexy female character with the last name \"Fox\".

Many of the criticisms on this store page are justified. The writing, as in Loren, and many other indie rpgs is ok at best. The fighting system is \"ok,\" though I don't think its any worse than the one is Loren. You have an open rpg system more like Fallout in this game, while Loren has skill trees. The noncombat skills let you avoid combat and still complete quests, so I thought that was quite nice, even if there are fewer active combat skills. I'd say you have enough combat options as it is with a variety of weapons you can get and each character having 3 attack and 8 psionic options. \nLike Loren, Planet Stronghold's cast of characters and romances aren't particularly memorable. The one area where Loren really outshines Stronghold, is that the Amazon princess herself is a very well defined and memorable character, and the conflicts within Amazon society are well drawn in her person. Planet Stronghold lacks such a figure. \nWhat Planet Stronghold does have which is almost totally lacking in Loren is much better exploration. Most areas of the map have quadrents which you can explore, with optional combat, and a few interesting optional encounters. \nWhat I also like about Planet:Stronghold is the science fiction setting and gameplay, since there are far fewer SF rpgs than fantasy ones.  \nIf you've played any other Winterwolf rpgs and like then, I think you might like Planet: Stronghold. If you haven't, don't expect a great game. Still its an entertaining, light 10 hour game,  which is over before you can get really bored with the mechanics.
