It's somewhat like a mix between Super Meat Boy and BIT TRIP. Runner. What makes this game unique though is the use of the color switch gimmick. It starts of quite easy (even at \"sassy\" difficulty) but gets much harder pretty fast.\n\nYou need to collect as much cubes as you can in each level and try not to lose too many lives in hopes of a score bonus, there is also a multiplier for going really fast and passing through a number of checkpoints without dying. Every level ends with a mini boss battle, which is usually even more tough than the level itself.\n\nOn top of the 12 levels that are included in the main game (don't worry, the game isn't as short as you'd think, it takes some mastering before you can reach the final boss), there are also 20 challenge maps which focus on platforming skills (those resemble Super Meat Boy the most).  It would probably also be a good idea to mention the leaderboards (which work really nicely) and the handful of unlocks for different achievements like beating a level without dying. \n\nWhen it comes to the downsides - I didn't quite enjoy the music. The soundtrack consists of slow electronical tunes which I found to be quite unfitting with the fast pace of the game. I'm sure a lot of people think differently (maybe even rightfully so) but I think a drum'n'bass soundtrack would be much better if done well. I also believe that not everyone may like memorising the boss patterns for example, but I think it's great myself to be honest.\n\nAll in all, I believe this is a great indie title and I'm hoping it gets the critical acclaim it deserves.

Seriously. I consider myself an above average skilled gamer, esp. with platformers, but this game got me on the mini boss fight in level THREE on EASY (there are 2 more difficulties). It gets frantic pretty quick, the levels are really long and save points are more or less fairly placed on the maps. You are constantly being chased by a purple beam of death, which adds to the frantic nature of the game. Double jumping, wall jumping, switching colors multiple times within 2 seconds while jumping and dodging spikes...yea...nope. Just cannot cope with that.\n\nUsually I wouldn't blame a game on my deficiencies, BUT the game's controls are horribly floaty. There is no precision here, but it is absolutely required.\n\nConclusion: If you want a really challenging game with an interesting mechanic, are not prone to suffering epileptical attacks and can cope with the dodgy controls, go for it when it's on sale.
