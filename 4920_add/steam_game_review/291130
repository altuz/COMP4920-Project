Audiovisually disappointing but half decent. Controls somewhat decently. Limited amount of levels. Uninspired level design. Special abilities limited in use. \n\nA bog standard experience in a saturated genre. Not recommendable but not so incompetent that you cannot get your fun out of it if you really wanted to. I tried a bunch of times to beat it but I always run out of motivation. When I come back I have to start at world 1-1. First few worlds with the slow platforms are annoying. The parchment activated superpowers are kind of cool but their consumable nature means you wont use them all that much. Level design feels uninspired mostly every level. Foes tank way too many hits, slowing the action down quite a bit. The wall grab mechanic, and movement in general felt great.", "timestamp_updated": 1506060842, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494155747, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "32877241", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478910", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1498447740, "steamid": "76561197993752769", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "its fun if u like platform 2d games", "timestamp_updated": 1498589861, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498589861, "votes_down": 10}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 92, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_negative": 59, "total_reviews": 151}}
