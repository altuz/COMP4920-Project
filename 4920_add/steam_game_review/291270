It seems like at later levels they stopped focusing on the puzzle aspect of the game, and started to focus on platforming and skill jumps instead. To me, once you understand how to beat a level in a puzzle game, it should take a couple of tries max to beat the level. This is best seen in Portal. Some of you probably think its not fair to compare the two games, but in reality they have very similar concepts. In Vitrum, however, I often found myself extremely frustrated at my inability to complete a level that I knew how to beat. Don't get me wrong, I like platforming just as much as the next guy, but this game takes it too far for my tastes. Almost every level includes some sort of difficult jump that made it difficult to beat. This is the type of stuff that I would liked to have known before buying it.

But i figured that just because it clones other games doesn't make it automaticaly bad, so i went ahead and bought vitrum anyway. \n\nI started up the game and was greeted by a really ugly, amateurish and lofi menu screen that just screamed college project. But i put my prejudices against its visuals aside and went ahead and started a level. \nThe framerate was terrible despite of running on a powerful machine so i had to search the forums for a fix. i found a couple of possible solutions, none of which worked. So i was just going to have to accept the shitty framerate and play it anyway.\n\nWhat i first noticed was that the sound effects were really tinny, But that the music was really great. (I would actually like to get my hands on the soundtrack) and then that the level design was pretty decent. with some relaxing puzzles with intresting powers involved. \nthen at about level 10-15 it started to go downhill, the levels became inconsistent and less clever, the game started to go for a more platformy approach. but this was fine with me however as i like platformers too. but let's just say that platforming design isn't vitrums strongest feature.\n\nAnd at about level 20 (i think) the game started to slowly become a hellish precision platformer with power crystals less and less frequent. And it wasn't the good kind of precision platformer in my opinion. as the amount of precision (and sometimes even luck) required was at ridiculous levels. the checkpoints weren't generous either. \nit kind of reminded me of counter strike's death run mod. in which victory is a sight rarely seen. i also found myself having no clue on where to go and what to do. but this may be my own fault however. \nI came to a point were the platforming became too frustrating for me to endure, so i stopped playing there.\n\nSo all in all i do not recommend this game, if i would describe it in one phrase it would be \"Student project\"", "timestamp_updated": 1413755257, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1413755257, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "10180337", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510789", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1400696858, "steamid": "76561198073444492", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "A bit laggy for me but the concept is cool.
