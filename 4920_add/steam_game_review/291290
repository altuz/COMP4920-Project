I just can't help myself, I feel inspired. Or, in Motte-speak: \"Help myself I can't, I feel inspire.\"\n\n   The first problem with this game is the apparent lack of anyone on the design team who can speak English. This I don't mind, but surely someone in their broader social circle could have offered to do a quick proof-read of the game before releasing it commercially to the world at large?  \n\n   Hell, they could've asked the average six year-old on the internet. Pretty sure THEY would've worked out by now that \"Maids are fight each other but suddenly stopped and tremble in the presence of Sarah\" isn't a proper sentence. You do get used to it, though; we've all seen the Star Wars films, after all. It's just a shame that Yoda-speak isn't exactly conducive to maintaining a mood of spooky unease. But this is hardly the game's biggest impediment to greatness.\n\n   The 2D, top-down perspective in a horror game is a brilliant idea. And when this game gets dark, and the flashlight comes out, it's definitely some eerie shit. But in broad daylight the character animations look, well, about as good as those in Hotline Miami.  \n\n   The only thing is, Hotline Miami was an incredibly fast-paced, splatter-happy ode to visual crudeness and uber-difficulty which seemed to know precisely what it was trying to achieve. Which WASN'T \"scaring\" you...which, granted, this game still does surprisingly well at times, mostly on account of the aforementioned flashlight effect and the frankly awesome soundtrack. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that the super-disturbing soundtrack pretty much SAVES this game at times.\n\n   What about the gameplay, you ask? Well, it's nice enough, especially if you're a fan of action-adventure orientated \"survival horror\" games of the Silent Hill / Resident Evil ilk, as I surely am. But there's a LOT of back-tracking, and after a while you get good enough at simply AVOIDING the endlessly-respawning nasties, and the combat is mostly a case of finding one good, accurate spot to stand and mashing the mouse buttons.\n\n    I even managed to kill the first Boss with a baseball bat, 'cause I haven't yet managed to pick up a gun despite all the bullets I'm now carrying. I mean, I keep killing bad guys carrying guns which they shoot at me, but for some reason my character seems uninterested in picking any of these pistols up. I assume I haven't missed an all-important gun placement elsewhere, but I'm not even sure it matters if I have, since I can apparently kick Boss butt well enough with a melee weapon. \n\n   Just in case it's sounding like I'm not digging this game, let me assure you that I actually am. And I'm assuming it's not gonna be the longest game in history, so I probably WILL see it through to its conclusion. \n\n   What am I gonna find there? Well, probably nothing too great story-wise, 'cause despite some early promise the story seems to be getting sillier by the hour. But it's got mood aplenty, despite the aforementioned problems, and the moth-y motifs and mysterious island setting certainly make for good horror fodder. \n\n   I think it might be overly generous to say that this gets three-quarters of the way to its potential, but let's be nice and say it gets two-thirds of the way. Hence the number below, slightly rounded up in the interests of encouraging future product from these admittedly promising designers. \n\n   Happy bug-swatting.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.", "timestamp_updated": 1498652135, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1397238927, "votes_down": 10}, {"recommendationid": "9875915", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511574", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1401486189, "steamid": "76561198001622086", "num_games_owned": 1235, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Awesomeness \"Hotline Miami meets Silent Hill\" it's beautiful, terrifying, never boring, fun, atmospheric.

It starts out vague and boring, but as it progresses there's some pick-up to the plot. It's interesting that they added a variety of enemies to the game. I played it through during the 'key error' phase where you couldn't access it through steam, so my time playing it wasn't recorded. It's about 3-5 hours, give or take. A map would've been a nice addition because Motte Island is fairly large, and can be fairly confusing if you can't recall where to go or if you have a hard time finding your way around in games. One of the things that really got to me was dialogue, the game caught my eye because of it's artistic detail, I expected it to be well-rounded, but the dialogue didn't provide that. A game like this should be rich in dialogue I believe, it shouldn't solely depend on it's other elements. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but the dialogue really didn't make me enjoy the entire experience the game had to offer. I enjoyed some of the other elements brought into it though, they could prove to be really fun at times.

Seriously, there aren\u2019t many 2-D games out there that can envelop you this well in a sense of actually existing within the game world.\n\nBut on the other hand there are some incredibly amateurish or downright broken parts as well. The enemy AI is faulty sometimes failing to recognize you OR alternatively being Elder Scrolls levels of telepathic, the combat while really unforgiving at first becomes really simple once you figure out the trick, and perhaps the biggest issue I hold with the game is a terrible translation. I can get over the other two as the games sense of immersion wins out, but this last one flies in the face of that immersion and is by far the biggest flaw. Much of the smaller bits of text are bearable having minor grammatical issues, but when you come across a large document or something trying to convey deeper meaning it\u2019s quite blatant the developer either used a half-working translator, or only have the passing minimum of English experience required for the project.\n\nThey manage to get the point across but it detracts terribly from your suspension of disbelief. If the game was cheaper or even free I\u2019d be willing to overlook this but at the price they\u2019re asking at current ($5) it seems like they should have sprung for someone to translate it properly. Considering the game had many fans waiting for it that would have happily applied, or the prevalence of relatively cheap translation services available online I can\u2019t really forgive this massive failing.\n\nStill the game manages to do more right than it does wrong, and if you\u2019re a serious horror fan then the depth of the games atmosphere will likely win you over. But for everyone else you should definitely wait till it\u2019s on sale. \n", "timestamp_updated": 1397236268, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1397236268, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "9960775", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495942", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1398800503, "steamid": "76561198058164023", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Please somebody help me!
