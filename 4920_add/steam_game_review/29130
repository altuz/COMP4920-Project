Tetris-like blocks contain bits of a musical score and are colored according to what instrument you'll hear when clicked upon. Fit them all together in the correct way to play famous songs. Out of all of them, there were only two I didn't know by heart. But even if you don't recognize a single one, a bar on the bottom of the screen will play the whole tune for you, as many times as you like. The catch is, you'll only hear each score from ONE instrument. That instrument normally plays the main tune so it's usually not too difficult to figure out what order those blocks go in. But then you have to place all the other instruments and make sure the blocks fit together correctly. For those who love both puzzles and music, Musaic Box is a real gem. My only gripe is that the game isn't long enough.

I do generally like these types of puzzles.  The game would benefit from a little less hand holding, a bit more difficulty in the hunt and click portion, and a few other minor issues.

The synth music they use is super cheesy, and clashes harshly with the antique music box feel they are trying to go for visually.  They really skimped on the number of instruments portrayed visually in the puzzle section.  They use the trombonist for virtually all the wind instrument parts.  Meh, it could be refined a lot, and using real instrument samples would make it much classier."}]}
