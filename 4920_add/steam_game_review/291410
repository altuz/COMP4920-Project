The way you earn cards is the same, the ranked system is the same, the mana system is the same and the way classes work is the same, complete with special power.\n\nHowever, there's a few very key differences between the two games that make Duelyst less random and, to me at least, more fun: The board on which you play as well as the ability to replace a card from your hand once per turn.\n\nThe board in combination with the various cards makes for some really deep and satisfying tactical play that allows you to bend the game to your favour with smart decisions. Every turn the board looks different as there's so much going on and every turn has a very large amount of decisions that you can make. I really enjoy this the most as a fervent tactical turn-based gamer. If you like the combat in XCOM and Age of Wonders 3, you will find lots to love here.\n\nOther plusses are the quick matchmaking, the active developers, the gorgeous pixel art and animations and the large amount of interesting lore.\n\nI am personally not a fan of random stuff (which is why I stopped playing Hearthstone) and to me Duelyst strikes the perfect balance between randomness and tactics.

The strategy needed due to the infinite possibilities between the game board, placement of \"cards\", and of course the kick @$$ pixel graphics!!  A very satisfying game that could easily be played and enjoyed without spending a penny of \"real money\".  The daily quests (and free card) can get you enough gold to buy spirit orbs (card packs), gauntlet tickets (arena/draft play) and bloodborn orbs (card packs with cards you DONT have!).  Yes, if you get a crate you need a key to open it which costs $4.99.. BUT they did recently implement a \"common crate\" key reward for 15 quests completed in a month (easy).  However, if you are worried that you will be missing out on items due to not wanting to buy crates they are mostly filled with cosmetic items with 1 card here and there so they are not required to complete your card collection. The last thing I want to touch on, which is one of my favorites, is the fact that each \"faction\" or class does not only have 1 type of general that has the same hero power no matter the skin or avatar.  There are multiple general (main hero/\"face\") options for each faction AND your general always has at least 2 attack and can  move around the board like a chess piece, the same as your minions, instead of just being your avatar with a set power that never moves or defends themself without a weapon equipped.\n\nTo get the FULL experience and really find out I suggest you JUST PLAY IT.  Nothing to lose since it is F2P, the system requirements are low, and if you want to get a free spirit orb (or just 100 gold) use my referral code \"gdaddanyt\" and friend me to play some matches!! :)", "timestamp_updated": 1487225555, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487225555, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "29797885", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524577", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506953958, "steamid": "76561197960288870", "num_games_owned": 7962, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 15883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 427}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I was looking for a turn by turn card game to replace magic duels, and duelyst conquered me.\nThe battlefield reminds me a bit of clash of heroes combined to hearthstone gameplay ...\n\nIt's really fun and addictive.", "timestamp_updated": 1503670829, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486632306, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "29934746", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512760", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506983041, "steamid": "76561198164760993", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 502}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "i like the art work and you can't complain about the gameplay really. sure there are some people with awesome cards or decks, but its all about the strategy. it makes you think and it doesnt get boring. if it does, you can always come back to it later and appreciate the workers who put effort into making this game awesome.", "timestamp_updated": 1487133089, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487133089, "votes_down": 4}, {"recommendationid": "29729515", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504701", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1486330280, "steamid": "76561198030421213", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Like most free to play games, this is fun until you hit the pay-to-win wall, at which point it gets frustrating and dumb.", "timestamp_updated": 1486330362, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486330362, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "30045331", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509593", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1501689682, "steamid": "76561197994972913", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 22459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Duelyst is one of the best-designed games that I've played, and definitely the best card game.  The mixture of tactical depth and near-perfect balance among cards and factions is so satisfying, and I'm comparing to beautifully balanced games like Starcraft and DOTA.\n\nPros:\n- The replace mechanic is amazing.  This is something that other card games are sorely lacking.  It gives you the option to replace one card in your hand each turn, which adds a lot to the skill ceiling and improves consistency of decks when players replace intelligently.\n\n- Game is on a grid so positioning matters.  I just hit S-rank for the first time (equivalent of \"Legend\" in Hearthstone) and I still feel like I make positioning errors in most games.  There is so much depth added from this; it is wonderful.\n\n- Counterplay Games is very proactive about balance.  If they feel that a card is too strong or weak, they change it quickly and re-evaluate.  This iterative approach is MUCH better than say, Hearthstone, where the devs refuse to change obviously broken cards for months until the screaming of anguished ladder players can be heard at Blizzard HQ.\n\n- The factions are unique and have interesting mechanics that reward good planning and decision making.  The asymmetric balance approach reminds me a lot of Starcraft, another beautiful strategy game (though obviously an RTS and not a card game).\n\n- The reward system (quests) are very generous (more than Hearthstone).  Epic/legendary drops are much more common even accounting for Duelyst allowing you to have 3x of each per deck.\n\n- Games are short and intense.\n\n- Client is well designed software-wise (netcode is good, very few crashes or surprise disconnections, client is highly responsive even on my $500 budget PC)\n\n- The tutorial system and solo challenges are great - my only complaint is that there aren't more challenges (I am spoiled)\n\n- They introduced weekly boss battles vs. AI which are lots of fun, and give a small free reward with an optional $5 larger paid reward.  This is Counterplay Games' way of covering continuing costs I believe; it's optional and you get to fight the boss either way, so I like the model.\n\nCons:\n- Some people don't like the pixel art (though I personally like it)\n\n- A large portion, though not all, of the top-tier decks require quite a few epic and legendary cards.  HOWEVER, I personally hit Diamond in the first season (month) with a budget deck, and S-rank in second season after spending only $60.  I would hardly call that experience \"pay to win\"; just be aware that you won't be able to play some of the top-tier netdecks in your first month or two unless you are willing to pay some money (and a couple specific decks are very expensive, though most expensive != best).  Personally I thought $60 for this game was reasonable.\n\n- The daily quests do take a decent chunk of time to complete (at least 45 minutes for me)\n\n- There are microtransactions for cosmetics and weekly value offers and stuff like that.  None of it is required at all, but the very concept makes some people angry, so beware if you are one of those people.", "timestamp_updated": 1487541330, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487540913, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "29918203", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503943", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1487069178, "steamid": "76561198030554225", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I played the game through the Duelyst Launcher since its inital release and there's two aspects that is important to note:\nThe GAME is possibly one of the best games I have ever played! But the developers, buisness model and new player experience is horrendous!\nI will state three things to back up this claim of mine:\n\n1. When Duelyst launched the game had a good deal where you paid like 7.50\u20ac for 15 packs or more or something like that and it was a good deal at the time but... a few months later they had an event in which you could get something like 20 free packs! Amazing right?\n\nWell... it was time based. And not that it was for a limited amount of time but if your account was older than a month I believe it was, then you weren't eligable for these packs. To summarize it in a very clear cut way: it was more economically viable for you to just ignore your old account if you didn't have many cards on it or had put it down for an extended period of time after you had bought the release-bundle or just didn't play much on the account and didn't have it. It made more sense to ignore your account and make a new one.\n\nThis alongside the absolutely insanely noob unfriendly quest system and that if you do well at a certain rank you can get locked to either Silver, Gold or Platinum rank and... Noobs belong in Bronze and Silver. Good players who have so called 'Battle Ribbons' that showcase they have won 100 ranked games with a faction show up in Gold. And usually you see people with 5-10 Ribbons if not even more at Gold. Where as you might see ONE Player with ONE Ribbon in Silver.\n\nYou can get locked to gold and have to battle with these players and to complete a quest you need to do the following:\na) Play a set number of minions\nb) Play a set number of cards (yes, these two are different)\nc) Play a set number of turns into the game (conceding or taking lethal damage does not lower this requirement)\n\nBasically this means that if you are a new player or someone who just simply is not good enough ... in order to build a collection you have to be willing to just get slugged and unrelentlessly beaten down by people that just JUMP in terms of skill by a SIGNIFICANT margin!\n\n(Also you get gold after every win and every 3 win you get more gold but once again, you need to win to get this or be prepared to be beaten into a pulp if you are trying to complete quests.)\n\n2. Duelyst makes good use of that its a digital cardgame when dealing with mechanics and in-game by allowing you to essentially conjure up cards by having interesting effects that just add cards to your hand.\n\nHowever... from the buisness side, it is NOT understanding of the digital implications of a modern video game because the pricing of the individual packs (not gold price but that's already horrendous to try to get any amount of as I pointed out already) is insanely high! Since you need a playset of 3 cards of basically most cards in the game, you need to get a HUGE amount of cards! And the prices in regards to paying with actual money as opposed to gold is insanely high when you consider how many packs of cards you need to get from the base set and the expansion!\n\nIf you are good at the Gauntlet you can mitigate some of these issues but... I will go into why this is not really the case because...\n\n3. The developers haven't made a casual mode or non-ranked place to play.\n\nIts either the Gauntlet or Ranked Ladder in regards to where you can play and complete quests. The gauntlet functions much like the same when compared to Hearthstone but ... the gold is once again, annoying beyond belief to get ANY amount of!\n\nAnd since there's no casual mode where non-competitive decks exists, you consistently have to try to complete the quests whilst playing against people with litterally thousands of games played, near complete if not complete collections of cards and since the playerbase is still relatively small for the game you basically ONLY encounter excellent-to-amazingly good players once you have gotten past Silver which can happen by mistake and you are now stuck in Gold.\n\n\nThe game itself is AMAZING! So if you can get past that the buisness model is that of a regular cardgame in a digital format, that the developers genuinely do try to scam their players' accounts and the most horrendous F2P-system bar that of something like Magic Duels. Its not a Mobile-Phone level of \"F2P\"-bollocks but it is certainly horrendous and really, REALLY annoying for folks that doesn't want to put in 40-50\u20ac into the game to even just get STARTED.\n\nI recommend the game if you are like me and have a cardgame-itch you need to scratch and you want another option than Hearthstone. But to anyone else who's basically not a cardgame-addict... AVOID THIS GAME!!!\n\n\n\nOh and a few more things since I am posting this review only here on Steam:\n1. The fanbase is rabidly trying to defend the game because they are no longer victims of the horrendous new-player experience this game offers.\n2. The Steam version doesn't seem to have a working Steam-Overlay system so what's even the point of having it on Steam I don't know.\n3. It got essentially CS:GO lootboxes in the game so... yah', it tries to scam you in that regard as well being a Gambling-Simulator.\n4. Both Steam and non-Steam versions of the game can crash or just freeze up if you try to look through your collection quickly if you play in Windowed mode.\n5. The best way to summarize the community when asking for help is \"I don't believe you\" if you are experiencing something other angelic song when playing the game (they don't deal well with neither reality NOR with critique).", "timestamp_updated": 1487069514, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1487069202, "votes_down": 24}, {"recommendationid": "29977800", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508175", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506575582, "steamid": "76561197989234087", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 14563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Diggin it so far.
