Its ideas and elements flow together, and I like that. \n\nIt has 40 levels, and while that does make the playtime substantial, I feel like there could've been more. Something that this game would do well with is steam workshop custom map support. That could make the game a lot more fun. \n\nThe physics engine works pretty well. There's only one thing that I struggle to get used to, and that is how the marbles decelerate when I stop moving. They come to a stop much quicker than I expect, as I'm used to something similar to how marbles slow down in real life, so that's just something that I need to get used to.\n\nOne thing about this game that sort of left me unsatisfied me was the death animations. I expected that if I rolled a paper ball into fire, it would burn, and if I ran a rubber ball over some spikes, that the ball would pop, but instead, the ball just disappears, and a ghost-like skull just floats above it, and that just kind of seems lazy.\n\nOther than that, the nature of the puzzles feels nice and smooth, and I do like hopping on and playing a quick permadeath on it, so I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a quick 3D puzzler.\n\nI rate this game:\nA nice little lego set/10", "timestamp_updated": 1504436313, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504436313, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 4, "review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 7}}
