After a discussion in the forums where the developer himself almost started a fight because he thought I should just try the game as it is already so cheap (???), my curiousness was bigger than my intelligence and I went on and bought the game.\n\nYeah, it was fun for about 1 hour... then it started to get repetitive. So it should cost around 0.99$. Yeah, there is SOOOO much you can do in the game, but it's mostly about semantics and limiting standard stuff. If you design a game where you can be a rogue, a warrior or a magician, but then make you select all your skills so that you can make a magician with rogue clothes, it's only semantics. Oh but wait, if we cut off one hand of a magician, then people will think he is different. No he is just less fun that way. That's almost what's happening in this game. Yes, you get a bigger ship if you work hard, and the game just changes all other things so that the gameplay stays the same. Yes, you can be a trader, a trader, a trader and a trader, and also a disabled trader (pirate).\n\nAnd on a side note: when I went looking if the DLC would improve the game for me, I discovered that the developer has again been fighting on the forum, banning people who do not agree. Not that that should change your opinion on the game, but do you really want to support such a developer?\n\nEdit: Almost all the comments and forum comments I talk about have been deleted, not by me. Beware...\n\nEdit: a copy of my reactions to sharvax's comments asking for proof:\nWhy link to something that has been removed? Sorry mate, I am a very nice guy with positive intentions who feels that he needs to speak up. You just look like a friend of the developer, and it's nice that you try to help him.\n\nAnd by the way, you are talking about one small side note of my review. The biggest part of the review is enough explanation why I don't like the game. That's actually what reviews are about, they are very personal and should help others decide whether it's a game for them or not. The side note can no longer be proven and it's up to everyone else in here to decide whether I am telling the truth or not.\n\nI am telling that comments have been removed, not by me, and that topics have been removed in the forum, again not by me. It looks like the review itself is safe, so for that reason, I will put this answer also into my review.\n\nAfter this answer, I will no longer get into discussions about this. My review stands and the side note (which was not that important, but worth the mention imo.) has become a bit bigger thanks to you, sharvax.", "timestamp_updated": 1432584619, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "7", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1414710487, "votes_down": 87}, {"recommendationid": "9793279", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 191, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681888", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504980364, "steamid": "76561197971987586", "num_games_owned": 537, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "It's a decent little game to pass the time, considering the price. While I wouldn't exactly call it an outstanding game by any stretch of the imagination, I would firmly place it in the category of: 'If you have 10 bucks to spare, some time to kill, and like strategy games with a sprinkling of story and RPG thrown in, why not?'.\n\nIt comes with a quick little tutorial to help you get started, which is nice. However I would still strongly recommend either reading or glancing through the simple manual as well, because there may be things that are of interest to you that you'd want to do and have no real idea about otherwise. Such as starting your own faction. That however is something that will take several hours and much dedication.\n\nThere are 4 factions that you can join and level up with, however if you don't join any you can go about doing what you want (minus missions) and still level up as a civilian. If you eventually join your ranking will carry over to your new faction, so at least you don't lose anything.\n\nIt's no surprise that virtually everything in the game revolves around money. The only things that don't are your own individual skills depending on which profession you choose - however note that it can take quite a while to level up and get new skills, so for some people the game might get a bit tedious, or even monotonous. You need to 'level up' 3 times before you get new skills - and some pretty big skills are on opposite ends of entire skill trees that require you to have prerequisites. So expect a lot of grinding.\n\nIf you're someone who likes games based upon their graphics - my suggestion is to move along. There won't be anything new or fancy here, and if you have a really high resolution you're going to be doing a fair amount of squinting. Otherwise you can make it full screen and squint again as everything gets stretched out. If you see something once in the game, you'll see it a thousand times.\n\nSame for the sounds. The music will tend to cut out at various random intervals, but strangely enough I really only noticed it when it suddenly stopped. Otherwise it was fairly forgettable. Much the same for the sound effects.\n\nThere are a few instances of flavor text missing, usually in the 'quotes' area stating that this is an early access version even though it isn't. Also, if you're the one who tends to shudder every time you come across misspelled words or bad grammar in a game, then prepare to shudder a few times. Thankfully most of it is fine, but you'll notice a few spots here and there - and plenty of walls of text. Though considering the resolution I'm not really surprised.\n\nAll-in-all it's a fun little game to pass the time, or if you have that space rpg urge. It's 'just one more turn!' addicting for the first hour or two until you get the routine down. You might get to switch it up when you learn a new skill or get a new ship, or get a battle with a random event - but otherwise nothing major happens for the first large chunk of the game.\n\nWith enough dedication you can eventually reach the higher ranks and unlock more activities, but you'll have to be able to slog through a fair bit of early grinding, -especially- if you choose the civilian route.\n\nMy final score for this is a fairly decent but not great 6.5/10. It will keep you entertained for a while and will be worth it to those who are willing to put the time into it - assuming you can put up with old-fashioned graphics and sounds for quite a few hours.\n\nFor the rest of you who can't do that, I'd recommend waiting to see if it goes on sale later. At 10 USD it's still an iffy buy, but if it ever goes to 7 or less, I'd say grab it.\n\n- Paradox Jast", "timestamp_updated": 1397281147, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "5", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1397281147, "votes_down": 41}, {"recommendationid": "15480819", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 92, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627103", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1429642077, "steamid": "76561197991024481", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 5, "review": "At first, the game seems incredibly complex. There are many ships, faction politics, a trade mechanic with a black market aspect, tons of skills and abilities, and a large map.\n\nAfter a couple hours of playing, you'll realize that everything that looked good is actually poorly executed.\n\nThe combat plays out pretty much the same every time regardless of your ship and skills (which are badly balanced). You have almost no control over the combat. Everything feels very random and there is no strategy apart from picking the best skill out of the random pile of them that the game gives you every turn. Not that any of this matters. There are a few mid-level ships that are undeniably better than everything else. After a little experimenting, you\u2019ll have a ship that can\u2019t lose unless the random number generator has something against you.\n\nThe faction politics are almost pointless. You only need to get friendly with the factions if you want amnesty for committing crimes. You won\u2019t be committing any crimes unless you have a combat oriented ship. If you have a tough ship, you generally don't need amnesty. It's a self-defeating cycle of uselessness.\n\nThe trade system could not be more boring. You go to a system that sells something cheap. Buy it, fly to somewhere where it is expensive, sell it, rinse, and repeat until you can afford a ship with a bigger cargo hull. Then you get the exciting experience of doing exactly what you were doing before but in larger quantities. The black market is the exact same, except you might have to a do a little more fighting.\n\nThe skill tree is incredibly frustrating as it forces you to buy a number of useless skills before you can get to the good ones. The useless skills will then fill up your queue during combat with abilities that you will likely never use and make your life harder. No, you can't disable abilities that you have already unlocked.\n\nApart from the differing commodity prices, there is no real difference between the systems. The factions constantly fight, pirates are everywhere except for the starting areas, and random piles of money float through space, making it far more profitable to aimlessly bounce around between planets than to actually play the game.\n\nThe most frustrating aspect of the game by far is the class system. At the start of a campaign, you have to choose a faction and a player class. The classes determine the skills that you can pick. Only certain classes can unlock the skill to buy a business while others can do things like invade systems. The class system only exists to force you into multiple playthroughs and extend playtime in order to see all of the content. The irony here is that there isn't much content to begin with.\n\nTL;DR: You\u2019ll have more fun with a free flash game.

Then you like to play trading games like I do. I picked this game up after spending a few minutes with the demo. Since I have played close to 12 hours. The majority of that was playing the free trader. What I have found is the trade system is extremely weak. Once you spend a while in your starting system. As a free trader you start off in a fighter craft unable to warp out of said system. Profit comes slowly and the first warp ready corvette cost over 100 thousand credits. During this stage of the game profit per unit is anywhere from single digits to a 100 credits. However after you get a corvette and explore for a little while. You will find that certain systems produce Antimatter, Diamonds, and Super Ore. These systems are where you spend most of your time after wards. Buying those items and running to the closes invaded system. Where you can sell Antimatter for 1000 to 2000 profit per unit 600 or more for diamonds, and 150-200 profit for super ore. This allows for extremely easy progression and quite easily shows what this game lacks. \n\nThe main thing the game truly lacks is an assortment of ships. There are 4 classes fighters, corvettes, destroyers, and cruisers. Besides a few faction or class based starting, capital ships there are 2 or 3 options per level. With one per level with a decent cargo hold, as a trader I would have hope for more options. At the highest level ship you will have around a 2000 thousand unit cargo hold. \n\nIt isn't to small if all you do is trade. However as you level up you get the option of owning companies. Sadly it is utterly simplistic to my knowledge there is only two branches. Synthetics factories which can be upgraded to produce robotics then engines. This requires super ore and is the only other factory branch that I know of. Super ore factories can be upgraded to produce diamonds and antimatter. This branch of industries require robotics. \n\nI would like to set up a production chain. Where I can produce super ore to ship to my robotic factories, then ship my robotics to an antimatter factory. There is no other way for you to ship your produced goods automatically. You are limited to automatic purchasing those required units in system or galaxy wide. This of course increases the cost of the factory. You can also automatically sell at a loss of 50 percent. You can of course ship the stuff to and from yourself. However this causes the final product antimatter to simply stock up while you resupply the other factories. After you stock them up enough to give you some time you will find you have already produced thousands of antimatter. Or in my case 10 thousand antimatter so as you can see a ship with cargo capacity of around 2k will make a killing with all that antimatter. However I have a stockpile of antimatter growing by the week. Once you tack on travel time to and from contested systems. Which can take months your stockpile has grown, and the robotics and super ore factories are in need of supervision. In the end it is just easier to automate the robotic and antimatter factories and closing the super ore one. They will operate making you a little profit unless the system is under attack. Where as if it had been flushed out and you could ship produced goods to and from systems automatically. And had access to capital sized freighters you could simply set around all day making billions.\n\nSo while the trading is fun it is short lived and the trader end game of companies is shallow at best.

I'm a sucker for space exploration games and I really like building up my ship as I progressed through the game. The interface is a bit of a mess however. Some buttons launch in game popups like you'd expect while others launch sperarate executables which overlay your game. It looks like they set out making a browser game, but at some point decided to do something different.\n\nI had quite a bit of fun early on in the game, but it didn't take long until I ran into a staggering lack of content. The big ships they talk about in the menus are actually not in the game. Carriers and other large ships which the game says you need to have your own fleet can't be bought as far as I can tell. So you get to a point where you can't really progress any further.\n\nThe starmap is very limited. I don't see why there couldn't be many, many more star systems and different types of planets. The amount of weapons and ship upgrades are also very limited and are mostly the same across all ships. There is virtually no point in trading past the first hour or so of the game. The combat system is ok, but gets extremely repetitive. There doesn't seem to be an endgame of any kind. There are even menu items not in use and place holder text which calls this an early access game. I could go on, but the point should be clear.\n\nWhat makes it even worse is that as you try to close the game the developer advertises an expansion for the game which can only be bought through their website. Which apparantly is a standalone game with a lot of the missing features this game looks like it was supposed to have. They even have additional DLC on top of that thing. I looked at their website and if you try to buy the game they add on all the previous games in the series without asking, try to push DLC and have some sort of \"download premium\" service which lets you download the game whenever you want for extra cash. These are practices I thought we had put behind us years ago.\n\nTo sum it up: Stay away from this one. It is an unfinished buggy mess and not the latest version of this game.

Well let me explain something to you.\n\nNow friends, in a simpler time of computing when games could fit on a floppy disk and still be entertaining... this still wouldn't be a stand-out game in any sense of the term.  But the type of game that this tries to be was a popular one, low graphical content, simplistic, tier-based strategy... done one turn at a time.  If you remember the old Windows turn based strategy that was known by many names, the most common of which was \"drug wars\" you'll fall into and understand the strategy of this game immediately.  If you liked that game you'll even find enjoyment in this game.  Better yet, it doesn't have words on the screen like \"Heroin\" and \"Crack\" so you can casually shrug it off to friends without explaining that you really don't need an intervention.

It's just like turn based X series, or Sid Meyer's Pirates! or Port Royale.

There are only few avialable ships and small choice of equipment, so to be effective (I checked mostly fighting and conquering stuff) you have to choose only one path.

Not yet really worth its full price unless you really can get out on all it has. It is very small simple to dowload and it is nothing to the computer, it runs smoothly. But yet it is cause it is so down in technological aspects. It aint special to look at and character selection for your own character is limited. The tutorial is nice and shows all the little stuff and not all of the greater stuff which takes a while to understand and learn about. The combat is unapealing for it is turned based, which aint bad just kinda with how it is presented. Just flying alone in a friendly star system that aint at war and you just started and then either a random enemy system's ship comes or pirate ship and you are lucjy if it your size, for  they usually are bigger than you. With weapons systems that hit with less then 50% chance just becomes annoying. you fire twice but miss and then so do the enemies and it gets long and annoying. Or the enemies cant hit but you can hit a little more but they can regen their health from all the damage elongating the battle. Then it is hard to read what is happening for there isnt a clear indication of some sort that tells you what is happening. Then out of that, I dont want to spending time there.When traveling you will take  days to get from place to place and traveling to different systems takes time for you gotta do it one at a time navigating to each specific wormhole to get to the next system and repeat till you get their. I know I am bashing on this game with a recomendment review but you gotta know what I am exactly recomending. Now there also... glitches that bother me greatly... only a couple I actually notice that seem like they should be easy to fix and hopefully will soon. One is,.. you can buy illegal goods (some of them kinda make me curious on backstory to the world of this game, for literature is illegal in all of the universe of human people, and something called a dreamdisc and then usual stuff, tobacco and rum) these illegal goods will get you in trouble if people catch your ship full of illegal goods. So you can have a storage and if you try to put them in there and leave it and then come back, they will be gone. so you cant horde up illegal goods yet. Then there is a part where you can own your own company of mining or manufacturing. They can make a profit on their  owwn and add it to their balance and withdraw that money on your own.. but when you do you dont get your money and it disapears into the void. Now this games sounds bad, but it isnt. There are many things to do in it like it says. Own companies and be an entrepenuer and havea monopoly and rack in the dough. Or be a pirate and a bounty hunter destroy ship and do stuff like own a well knowned pirate hideout and bribe pirates to influence the market. Help your alliance win wars by going all at it and destroying enemies and their starbases or do passive stuff and deliver massive amounts of supplies for the aid or escort people out of the system for safety. You can rule and marry. Go up in ranks in your society and be well knowned. Hire crew to better navigate the system or commaders and soldiers to aide your battle expertise and raid other ships. Buy a big mega ship and upgradde it to be the best. Hunt down bounties and gain rewards, find rewards, gather artifacts and find empty shoot of loot and gain money. So in the end there are bad sides and good sides. You just gotta have your mind ready for a little game like this. It is good to pass time quick for it comes on quicks and is fast to save and quit. It is good for passing  time with a little fun. Idk This is probably a bad review.
