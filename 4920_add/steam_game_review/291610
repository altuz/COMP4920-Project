The concept is lovely, and the character handles tightly, but having solid mechanics is not enough for me to recommend it.\n\nI try to only purchase games with aesthetics that really appeal me, so I have no idea why I thought Growing Pains was a good idea (heck, even the font is corny). The rudimentary graphics made me wonder why this isn't just a broswer Flash game. The \"particles\" from the lasers and glow sticks are really nice, which is quite incongruent with the lack of details everywhere else. I feel that the developers could make it work quite easily by adding touches here and there.\n\nThe game only contains nine levels, and that's so inadequate for a paid game! Though there are ten other user levels, the base game is simply not meaty enough.\n\nSimply put: there are many more platformers that deserve one's attention.", "timestamp_updated": 1479682805, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1479682805, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "24502174", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1441285537, "steamid": "76561198037586730", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 287, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The main concept is you start small, and need to finish the level before you grow too big and ge crushed. As a premise, this game executes that very well.
