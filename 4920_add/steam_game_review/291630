Some of them can't be obtained before gathering other items in other locations. And that's what you will do everytime: find objects, place some on the scene because they're missing, head to another location, repeat the same thing and solve one or two puzzles thrown at you.\n\nWhile this gameplay is interesting, I had a major problem: some items are so hard to find because they're partially hidden by the end of the screen or they're so well matched with the background that you don't see them. However, you have a visual indicating that it can be found as they're not in grey and as the game doesn't tell you that you're done with the location. And sometimes, some of the active areas aren't really highlighted, meaning that you don't know what to do in the scene. After a while, it's boring and frustrating.\n\nEven if the plot makes sense, I would have expected more background on the mirror or on the worlds you're travelling to. You end up running from the mansion with the kids, which is expected but you don't know nothing about the mirror.\n\nThe graphics are acceptable though I found them a little too... dead. I mean that I was under the impression that there was like a grey filter on nearly each location and I find that it was adding frustration to find items. The soundtrack and voice acting is ok, particularly the voice of the mirror.\n\nI know that Mirror Mysteries isn't a recent hidden object game, however, I feel like that there are better out there.
