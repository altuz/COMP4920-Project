The graphics are a bit better and the locations more interesting (for example the first world which I liked the most is nicely inspired by art deco and maybe even by the Bioshock). The story again revolves around the same bad character as the previous game but this time it's much better (but still nothing deep). The voice acting sounds more professional and the cheesiness from the first game is gone (that's a shame I liked it :D). There are also more and much better puzzles (but they're skippable if you don't want to solve them). Also the gameplay is slightly different this time. Besides the standard hidden object finding there are also some point'n'click adventure elements  blended in. So all in all if you like hidden objects finding you are on a good address.\n\nPros:\n-More interesting puzzles\n-Better story\n-Less cheaply hidden objects\n-Longer than the first game\n\nCons:\n-Sometimes it's hard to find where to put a completed object\n-Still a little bit short\n-Puzzles are too easy to solve", "timestamp_updated": 1408037284, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1408037284, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "22169659", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510733", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1459452607, "steamid": "76561198000608288", "num_games_owned": 1803, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I played the first one last weekend, so I figured I might as well wrap up the second while I'm here.\n\nApart from general bad temper, I'm not sure I get the vocal-minority hatred here for Mirror Mysteries 2: Forgotten Kingdoms. It's true that it commits the scarlet sin of not being exactly the same as the first game in the series, although it's actually pretty close. It's a short, easy, slightly silly excursion into a few realms in the lands the malevolent Magic Mirror, which once again has no sense of humor and intends to take over the world and destroy everyone muahaha. If that sounds a little like the original, well, yeah.\n\nThe first had an easier forward-pressing pace, which this one trades for vaguer goals set in more fantastical worlds. The core mechanic of assembling sets of hidden-object items to move from one location to the next is pretty much the same, as is the enraged mirror that taunts you through the settings. This time, instead of playing Tommy and Charlotte's hero mom, you're a detective sent by adult Charlotte to track her grown-up brother Tommy, who has disappeared after chasing down an unusual mirror, because he has dim memories of another mirror when he was a child, and so forth, la la la.\n\nArtwork here is more ambitious - I especially liked the future city in the clouds, which is a little bit steampunk, a little bit Rapture, and a little bit Syberia. Gameplay doesn't throw any unexpected curves, and once again I ran the game in two and a half hours, so mere mortals should get through it in around two. As you put together the pieces to resolve each environment you'll collect mirror shards along the way to get the next portal working, and these are pretty clearly indicated.\n\nVoicing is minimal and not quite as good as the first, but the art is much more interesting, though sometimes the goals aren't as clear as they could be. This time, playing as a detective and not a mother, there isn't any call to tidy up, sew, or do any of the household tasks that plagued the original: here it's all putting machines under power, making the train run, restoring water and flowers to the peaceful glade.

Even on sale, it's not worth buying this until the bugs are fixed.\n\nRevised Review:\nThe scenes are lovely and detailed. It is a pleasure to have a hidden object game that is not solely about horror. Although the game does not support wide screen resolution or larger resolutions well, it can be played in the windows 7 operating system with modified settings. (It still crashes at unexpected times. I missed a mirror shard quite deep into the game. As I followed the hints back to it, the game crashed predictably before I could get back to the shard. This made the game unplayable.) Please see other forum posts for details of Windows 7 bug fixes.\n\nHaving Started a new profile in order to play through from the beginning, and  perhaps not miss the mirror shard that caused the last game-ending crash, I find the angel-wing bug back.

Gone is the brave and pretty heroine from the first game, only to be replaced by her extremely annoying kid who has grown up and apparently gone insane while searching for the magical mirror his mother talked about. You play a private investigator who travels to the mirror worlds to find him. (Is that really necessary -- we can't just leave the little bugger to his fate?)\n\nSpeaking of the mirror, they completely ruined his personality. The original mirror wasn't exactly evil, he was just a curmudgeon who was annoyed at some unruly kids for breaking his mirrors. His sardonic commentary was very entertaining, and he actually helped the heroine in her quest. This new mirror has gone completely off the deep end into deranged villainy. The new voice actor plays him as a one-note bad guy, and there is nothing interesting or entertaining about him at all.\n\nOn top of all that, the hidden object scenes are much harder (but not in a good way), tbe puzzles are boring, and the mirror worlds are just derivative copies of worlds we've already seen a hundred times before in other, better games.\n\nUltimately I cannot recommend this game, even on sale.
