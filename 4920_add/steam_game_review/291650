I finished the game and enjoyed aspects of PoE, but when asking myself if I would ever play it again or remember much of anything about the story, my answer is \"No.\" For a RPG that is unforgivable, so ultimately it gets a thumbs down.\nI have to disagree with the top positive comment for this game: It absolutely suffers from lack of licensing. The story and world are probably the weakest aspects of the game. I don't want to make this review a Shadows of Amn vs. Pillars of Eternity comparison, but it's difficult not to draw parallels because they have such obvious analogs: enemies, lore, factions, quests, major parts of the story: Watcher's Keep vs. Caed Nua, Faction quests: Bodhi / Shadows Thieves vs. House Doemenel / Knights of the Crucible / The Dozens, Plight of the protagonist: Bhaalspawn vs. Watcher, etc...\n\nPositives:\nGraphical improvements and ability to zoom in / out\nVoice acting is top notch\nNPCs are well developed\nWeapon enchanting and crafting mechanics are handled well\nThe story's treatment of souls, Hollowborn, and animancers is the most interesting and original part of the story in my opinion\nUI improvements:\n-Inventory system is much improved\n-Being able to compare multiple items side-by-side\n-Command queing in combat makes perfect sense for this genre\n\nNegatives:\nLore is shallow compared to its contemporaries\n\"Reach out for Soul\" interactions are completely pointless. I got to about Gilded Vale until I stopped reading them altogether. Someone spent hours upon hours writing these for whatever reason rather than making the core story and game more interesting.\nQuests lack originality and are tedious. For example, most of them in Defiance Bay and Twin Elms are a matter of getting the quest, going to another area and killing someone / making some moral decision, returning to original district to complete.\nPathing is terrible, even moreso because the battles use a disengage mechanic\nBattles rely much more heavily on buffs / debuffs and out-casting your enemies. Fights are usually complete curb-stomps one way or another. If you die, you just reload, then cast the necessary invulnerability (domination, stun, confusion, etc...) for that enemy type and it's a cakewalk\nThere's just a lack of interesting stuff to break the monotony of battles. Examples from Shadows of Amn: Machine of Lum the Mad, Spellhold puzzles, class-specific quests, Planar Sphere quest....basically it just needs more interesting stuff to break the monotony of battles and text.\nEnding felt rushed, with little connection to the main character or the antagonist. After finishing the last battle, I said out loud, \"Oh, I guess it's over then.\" and immediately uninstalled the game.\nEnemies are almost 1:1 retread of Baldur's Gate series, except with notable exceptions of more interesting ones like Githyanki, Drow, Beholders, etc... \n-Kobold = Xaurip\n-Nymph = Pwgra\n-Vampire = Fampyr\n-Mind Flayer = Vithrack\n-Ghoul = Gul\n-Wyvern = Drake\n-Sword Spider = Spear Spider\netc...\n\nTL/DR: Good enough for a single playthrough with improved UI & mechanics over its contemporaries, but ultimately falling short in the areas that matter most: story / world, quests, and lack of originality.", "timestamp_updated": 1506187186, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "3", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506187021, "votes_down": 15}, {"recommendationid": "34787143", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512163", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505049231, "steamid": "76561198060734390", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 9477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "It's a modern classic. \n\nNot much else to say that others haven't, other than the time is ripe to try it with it's sequel looming on the horizon.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_updated": 1504753212, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504753212, "votes_down": 13}, {"recommendationid": "35027265", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501255", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505361655, "steamid": "76561197970934254", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 7635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Recommended, but I feel the ratings are quite high for an role playing game that I feel the story falls short on.

I never found any spot in the game where I thought it was boring (or at least no spot that was memorable for being boring). With that said, there are still a few things this game lacks. This will be a spoilers free review.\n\nPros:\n-Story is somewhat intestering and has a villian that poses a unique threat to the world.\n-The combat feels refreshing and does justice to it's father RPGs like BG and IWD (only in that the combat has the same tactical aspect as these two games, not the spell system).\n-The ability to make your own party from scratch or to use companions is nice.\n-The enchanting/crafting system is superb.\n-The conversation action that someone can take based off of stats/skill makes the game feel immersive.\n-Does an excellent job on taking a new perspective on good vs evil.\n\nCons\n-Lore is thrown at you really fast, but is easy to piece together by the time you are in a second play through.\n-Lots of reading from characters who have voice actors, would be nice to have all plot essential characters to always have voice acting. (this doesn't have a really large impact on the experience).\n-Some of the companions feel somewhat shallow (not making complex relationships with any of your companions like in Baldur's Gate II)\n-Too many NPCs that are made from short-stories from kick-starters. This isn't really a huge deal as some of them hold gear that you can kill them for.\n\nOverall the cons of this game have a minimal effect on the game and I would highly suggest you buy this game if you are a fan of the BG Saga or IWD or are just an RPG fanatic overall.", "timestamp_updated": 1505784538, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505784538, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "35093815", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500008", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505856523, "steamid": "76561198028440336", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Amazing game!

If you're like me and you never played baldurs gate or anything like that it is going to feel punishing.  You cant just roll in and kill everything, even on easy mode.  You have to use tactics, watch a few video's on youtube though and you will be fine.  The game isn't grindy, you should be able to defeat anything as long as your tactics don't suck.\n\nI also like how the choices in the game reflect well in the ending.  If you take the time to do all those little side quests and look around it pays off in the end.  Also, the game invests you in these stories and you start to care about the NPC's that you interact with more so than in most games.  So when decisions start to matter it actually means something to you.  \n\nI think there is something to be said for old school graphics.

To give a brief summary: This is not the second coming of Baldur's Gate. Pillars is decent, but not great - and in many ways not even good. It does as many things right as it does wrong. It tries to please too many people and that really shows. Also, don't bother with the dlc(s) unless they're on sale for <10 combined, unless you really fell in love with the game. I can not recommend it as an entry to the top-down style of RPG, but people who are looking for the old-school style will get a lot more out of this than of the ridiculous Divinity: Original Sin.\n\n\nStrengths\n\n+ Companion characters: They start off a little bit bland, and noone is set to develop a strong connection to the PC. But as the story unfolds, so do your companion's personalities. Each of them is well integrated into the plot, without sacrificing tonal or logical consistency for individual spotlights. The writing does not fall for the traps of grandieur and edgyness to create effect and emotion. Your party consists of slightly more than ordinary people thrown into extraordinary circumstances. I have no complaints about the voice acting, but, as with other Infinity Engine titles, some interactions are not voiced over. Their banters occur on the road without interrupting chat boxes. This makes for a very immersive experience, which is, unfortunately, also very easily forgotten afterwards.\n\n+ Setting: The world of Pillars features some interesting deviations from the standard formula. Instead of an High or Early Medieval background, it uses many Late period features, like gunpowder weapons. We also get to know some unique races and cultures, which are unique to the game, and they are actually well integrated in the plot through the companion NPCs. The gods are prominently featured throughout the entire plot, without intruding on it. In fact, I was well surprised about how well this rather generic pantheon is fleshed out. This is also the greatest strength of the White Marsh dlcs.\n\n+ Premise and plot: I don't want to spoil the story, so I only say that it's premis(es) are very interesting, competently presented and the integration of NPCs, macguffins and lore is excellent. Pillars even manages to create a mystery plot that makes the player just as ignorant about central issues as the PC and thus grants us the joy of discovery. \n\n\nWeaknesses\n\n- The introduction: The first chapter(s?) feel as if they were attached to the game half a week before release date, like an overdue paper from an intelligent, but stressed out grad student. Although its an okay play and craftily introduces the game's various mechanics, the opening chapter left me with with a lot of frustration and no connection to the world, aside from the central plot device. This guy sums up the experience pretty well, up to the point it gets utterly infuriating: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpDw1pJaApo (starting at 13:15, featuring a comparison with Shadowrun Returns, teeny tiny spoilers in the vid).\n\n- Cramming every shiny new rpg feature into an old school game: Just as Aesthetics as Narrative in other media, Mechanics as Narrative in games. Obsidian botched this part in a way that tells us that they don't understand it at all, which is very strange for an experienced dev studio. We get crafting for the sake of crafting, balance for the sake of balance (in a single player game, wtf!), skill-based interactions for, yes, the sake of it and a confusing number of impractical spells for the caster classes. Range, cating time and area of effect often render a spell useless or extremely circumstantial. Confusing and impractical, and generic, that's what this is. While the NPCs, lore and plot are integrated into eachother in a most praisworthy fashion, the mechanics are disconnected from the narrative, although they are sometimes used to \"unlock\" certain parts of it. When done right, the elements I criticise can add to a game (just look at how Planescape: Torment did spells!). Here, they are only ever in the way. There is some seriously bad art direction at work here, which leads directly to the next point...\n\n- Visual presentation: Yes, the direction, not the actual art itself is bad. Pillars can look very pretty at times, although the visual quality varies a lot (Defiance Bay is downright ugly). The soundtrack is decent and the voice actors do their job expertly. Where it breaks down is the *purpose* of the art. I encourage everyone to take a good look at a) the spell lists, b) the inventories and c) the character models of Planescape: Torment (a masterpiece in this regard), Baldur's Gate 2 (great work) and Pillars of Eternity (total trash). Pillar's attempt of updating this aspect of the game can only be considered to be a complete failure. It is, again, flashiness for the sake of flashiness and, again, disregards the idea of Aesthetics as Narrative. And AGAIN, the visual presentation is as confusing as the mechanics discussed above. It is absurdly difficult to remember the properties of a spell or weapon, as the vicual clues are mostly useless, obscured by blinky and shiny meaninglessness. The added detail to the character models actually makes them not only less beautiful (in my eyes certainly), but breaks harshly with the lo-fi, old-school, hand crafted environments and generally make a mess of every battle scene. Ironically, while the designs from Baldur's Gate (2) look plain in comparison, they let the individual characters stand out more, not less.\n\n- Immersion-breaking Kickstarter backer bullshit. The game features, aside from \"memorial stones\", which can be kinda okay, NPCs designed by backers of Obsidian's original Kickstarter campaign. These guys litter the start of the game and do nothing but destroy the magic circle. This is bad business pratice. It cheapens the experience for everyone in return for a few extra bucks. In the future, this will be a red flag for me.\n\n- Setting: Despite a strong core and some successful attempts at originality, the setting get very generic and stale where it is not directly relevant to the plot. This is the most forgiveable of all my listed criticisms, but I feel like a great opportunity has been wasted. What bugs me most is the inconsistency. The unique races of Aumaua and Godlike are thrown together with generic Dwarfs and Elves and for some reason Halflings have been replaced with \"Orlans\", who fill the same role, but look a bit funny. The same can be said about the various cultures of Eora, which are okay or even interesting individually, but do not form a believable, living setting.\n\n- The player character: Now from the smallest to the biggest problem. The player character is a non-entity, a plot device, the soulless wreck of an empty hull. It is infested with the disease of artificial and ultimately meaningless \"choice\" (again, I recommend a video to elaborate on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJJaGSV75y0). This illusion of \"choice\" is created, not by iterating on how different sets of characters would react to the same situation, but by utilizing a mechanical program that sorts dialogue options by reputation outcomes, like \"Aggressive\" or \"Stoic\". The idea is to not follow a number of personalities or alignments from which interaction choices naturally flow out, but give us a selection of independent personality traits, from which we can create our own Player Character. This may be an avenue worth exploring, but in Pillars the street is cluttered with cardboard facades, behind which no actual person could ever find shelter. You have to look to the NPCs and the world around you to fill the game with life and purpose, because you won't get that by neither being able to express yourself or experiencing the well-crafted story of someone else. You get a reputation ticker that unlocks or blocks inconsequantial dialogue options.", "timestamp_updated": 1506468867, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506464714, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34747049", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499797", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506307624, "steamid": "76561198048791724", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "+ A non-voiced protagonist\n+ Good rpg elements ( you can play as anything you want to play as, and there are many different dialogue options )\n+ Good character creation\n+ Good lore\n+ Good world building\n+ good Dialogue system\n+ Good story\n+ Good characters\n+ Good music\n+ Good dlc\n+ You can be a good guy or a bad guy or anything in-between\n+ There is a story mode ( for people who just want the story, and want the combat to be easy )\n+ There is a fast mode ( move around the world faster, and fight faster )\n+ There are many difficult morally grey choices\n+ There are many times you can talk your way out of situations rather than fight\n+ Stats and or your alignment/reputation matter in conversations and in the text adventures\n+ Text adventures and the things you can do in them\n+ The reputation system\n+ There is a large amount of good loot in the main quest and in the endless paths ( meaning you can skip the side quests if you want to )\n+ A decent amount of unique items and weapons\n\n- Weird start  \n- Combat is not for everyone\n- The game ends after the main quest, and it doesn't make sense to do the dlc and side content before the main quest\n- To many enemies to kill ( i wish there had been more ways of getting money and loot than just killing everything )\n- Mostly boring loot ( mostly because of the fact that there is too much loot in the game )", "timestamp_updated": 1506391124, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504572561, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35154711", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498678", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506998960, "steamid": "76561198080260978", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1346}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This might be hard to get into for people new to a party based rpg game.
