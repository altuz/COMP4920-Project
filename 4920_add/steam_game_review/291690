You roam a surreal world that has been abandoned and find items that provide glimpses into the memories (momentos) of its former inhabitants. \n\nPros:\nGreat graphics\nA mystery unfold as you play the game\nWell optimized\nThe developers are actively updating and answering questions\nA few puzzles\nVoice acting is good\n\nCons:\nA few overlapping textures (most notifiable in the cliff side settlement)\nThe narrator talks a little to much\nA fair amount of walking back and forth\n\nMy initial impression, at the start of the game, was the buildings seem to be floating in the clouds.  It reminded me a Columbia (Bioshock Infinite), except not quite as dreary and no one was shooting at me.  In fact, there are no people in this game, just the items they left behind for you to discover.  Most of this game involves exploring each area collecting items, momentos, and documents, then piecing everything together to form another part of the story.  Then you're off to find the next group.  Basically, this game is a walking simulator with a few puzzles thrown in for good measure.\n\nAll of the issues I had with this game where very minor.  For example, the narrator will chime in on something, which is okay except if you're trying to activate a momento, you'll have to wait until he's finished speaking before activating the next one, and sometimes there are three or four momentos in the same area.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is that the developers are actively involved with the game, answering questions, fixing bugs, and updating... unlike Ether One where the developers abandoned their game and left us with a broken mess.\n\nAt the time of this review, Empathy was selling for $19.99.  That price is just about right.  My first play through took me about 8 to 10 hours plus another 5 hours to obtain all of the achievements, so it's worth it.", "timestamp_updated": 1504736397, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504736397, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 10, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 3, "total_reviews": 13}}
