I love the story because it mixes the mystery of finding the lost crown with ghost hunting. The animations are a bit awkward at times and there are a few bugged achievements, but other than that the black and white art style and the voice acting are great. The puzzles were also doable, but I did not like the ending because it left many questions unanswered, but hopefully the next game will answer them.", "timestamp_updated": 1505292522, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505292522, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 68, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 79}}
