Not only is the development cycle of this game all over the place, so is the community.\n\nTo start, Pit People isn't a horrible game but it definitely isn't great. If you like turn based strategy or The Behemoth's typical humor you will most likely enjoy this game...at first. When stepping into Pit People you have this incredible feeling of exploration and a deep combat system with nearly infinite unlocks and collectables. However after a few hours the game is bare-boned and shallow as they come. \n\nFirstly, the classes of characters in this game are not developed and balanced enough. They don't feel unique enough and when putting them in raw combat to compare they all pretty much play out the same. There really isn't a strategy aspect to the game as it stands and I don't think it ever will. Your party will almost always be able to take on 2 encounters before having to heal or return back to the hub. If you're great or if you're terrible it always takes about 2 battles to make you need to retreat. This game gets incredibly stale after your 10th battle; they're all the same despite what enemies are present and how many there are. It is very clear The Behemoth is doing trial and error on this one as they go. The strategy aspect of this game is absent.\n\nSecondly, the map and it's exploration. This game has about 5-6 maps in which each time you load into a new world it picks a spawn point on one of those 6 maps. There's really no point to this aspect of the game. I was fine with it at first but after updates they removed the beacon back to the city. This makes trying to get back more annoying than difficult because time stops when you stop to open the map and try to guess where you are... Over the updates there was also a feature to make elite enemies stun immune, more aggressive, and inescapable. This is incredibly annoying because now special enemies on the world map just attack you out of nowhere and there's no way to stop them beyond out-driving them. The same missions spawn in all the same places each time there's really no point. They could have just gone with a really big static map and it wouldn't have changed anything...\n\nLastly the collectables. This aspect is just rushed. They had their artists pump in as many crazy things as they could but they're almost entirely cosmetic. The weapons in this game used to be all the same and they tried to change that by making some unique. As time went on, they did this more and more with wider differences. Now, a lot of these weapons are beyond useless and simply cant be used in a strategic sense. There's no easy way to get these collectables or direct means of getting them. If you could just pay for a random item in a gambling machine it would be fine. Currently, the only way to obtain items is catching an enemy (kill all the enemies first, and have a character with a net catch it) and by random loot drops from doing missions/beating enemies.\n\nEverything about this game just screams placeholder and subject to change on a balance level. The Behemoth is taking their sweet time with the game. (months between updates) Despite these huge time gaps between content they aren't changing much. The gameplay isn't getting anymore engaging, the main story isn't progressing, and most of each update is just more collectable dumps. The core of this game will never change. It's still the same casual flat \"strategy game\" through and through. After countless rebalances of how levels and stats work the game is still exactly the same as the first build, worse really. I wanted to give this game a good review, I really did but it's clear these are permanent problems lingering over the game.\n\nThe icing on the disaster cake is the community. Right off the bat, it's dead. Most people try to be helpful but its just a ghost town. \n\nI have personal problems with this community day in and day out. Back in the day I used to be extremely active, I would help people with any questions or problems. I would boast about having the most completion because I loved the game and played it religiously. However the downfall of the community was The Behemoth and their connection to said community. \n\nThey moved over to discord and the forums here were getting more and more silent by the day. So they decided to make a community manager, a fellow player. I don't want to seem jealous, but they made this guy a manager out of no where for no reason and he isn't an employee. He simply embraced a meme and became the center of attention by making his profile themed after Pit People. Sure, this is fine at first but he really isn't helpful or active like I was. He was basically made community mod to be a jester to liven up the place. (That worked really well right...?)\n\nThen just yesterday I go onto the forums after being disappearing after many months and updates. I come looking for help to get 100% completion or as close as I could. What do we have...? No one. The forums are empty for the most part. I stumble across a group of select people trying to make a full list of everything in the game. Turns out, they're close buddies who won't help out unless it's to help themselves. They just want Steam forum fame on an empty game. So I continue my search...\n\nI go to the Discord today asking around there. I find someone who's willing to help. To my surprise they had more items than me despite me 100%'ing the game a few updates ago. What do they do? Oh yeah, they scam me. Turns out this guy is also buds with the small group of completionists. Wow, great community huh? He accused me of cheating for having the max number of items when I played this game a lot longer before there was more content but okay...\n\nYeah, wah wah wah personal beefs right? Wrong.
