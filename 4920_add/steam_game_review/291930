And all of this time, I've been nothing but supportive and hopeful, waiting for this to occur. But now, I've finally thrown in the towel and decided it's time to call this donkey for what it is.\n\nAll you really have to do is go to the forums and you'll quickly see other peoples' reasons for dissatisfaction with this game. But speaking for myself, the worst aspect of the game is that has an economic model that creates orders/demand for you to start a business, then dries up those orders to ZERO unless you open other businesses (with different products) to develop the surrounding towns to create more demand for your original product. Sound ridiculous? It is. For example, you go from building a successful egg producing business to suddenly, zero demand (due to no one in the world eating eggs anymore because their town is too small, apparently). It takes all of the positive, enjoyable parts of the game, wads it up, lights it on fire, and throws it out the window. Have you ever heard of a business game \"on rails\"?\n\nI don't know if I've ever even written a negative review on Steam. But, my level of frustration and disappointment in this game has led me for this to be my first. Is this the worst game ever made? No, but it completely misses the mark of creating an enjoyable progression of building your business to be what you want it to be (which to me, is the point of game like this, Railroad Tycoon, etc...). This game is SUCH a missed opportunity and the developers seem to be oblivious and completely disengaged. Not a good way to run your uh...  business. So, save yourself the frustration and do not buy this game.", "timestamp_updated": 1433073938, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1433073938, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "11480995", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 97, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578619", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1406966537, "steamid": "76561197969376654", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Hours Played Disclaimer: I accidentally left the game idle overnight during the tutorial, so the hours played is inaccurate.\n\nI am writing this, and I am still very early game in freeplay mode. Keep in mind I have played city and business sims before. \n\nIE offers an extensive tutorial that will introduce you to its mechanics. This game seems to be very detailed and nuanced in terms of its gameplay mechanics. You not only make larger choices about where to place buildings, but you hand-pick the number and type of trucks needed to deliver your goods; different trucks transport different goods. You will also need to maintain your vehicles as time goes on. Also, you can actually determine the shape of the land you purchase for development, as well as the location of buildings within a given plot. \n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about, but they are serviceable and get the job done. So far, I haven't run into any bugs or problems of note. \n\nI'll update this impression once I get more gametime under my belt.\n\nUpdate: The various information panels available are acutually useful and helpful. As vets of the genre know, this is not always the case with this kind of game.\n\nYour primary source of income will be from fulfilling orders for various products. You will need to deliver the products on time in order to avoid a penalty for late delivery. The game ends if you run out of money. However, you can get a limited number of loans (six, I think) from the bank. \n\nIt looks like the game has two gameplay modes: freeplay and scenarios. At launch, there are six different scenarios for you to choose from, which place in charge of varying industries at different stages of development. While the scenarios seem somehwhat interesting, I think most gamers will want to go for freeplay option.  \n\nOverall, I recommend this game. I know there are concerns about the the developer's past releases, but I decided to take the plunge, and I am enjoying myself so far.\n\nUpdate 7/31:  Still enjoying the game overall. Pick-up and delivery of goods are made instantly once a truck arrives at a given destination. It looks like the early game is limited to farming, and you will gain access to diffirent techonologies and industries as the game progresses. The game can drag a bit at regular speed when waiting for production of various goods to hit a desired level, but you can speed-up time to compensate. \n\nOne minor issue I have run into is the awkwardness of knowing how big the next plot you're going to buy needs to be in order to accomodate a given building. Right now, you have to go into the Buildings menu select the building and look at it's footprint; then you have click on the Land menu and draw out the plot based on your memory of said footprint. This isn't so bad when you're placing one or two buildings, but it can become a bit of a challenge when you're doing more. It's not a dealbreaker, but it is annoying. \n\nIf you want to mine, you can order a geological survery that will tell you the size of given deposits in an area, and I wish there were something similar available for setting up water plants. There doesn't appear to to be a water table that tells you what areas of the map have more water than others, and this is a feature I really liked in the latest SimCity. Currently, it seems like you can just plop a water plant anywhere, and it will produce the same amount of water. \n\n\nWorkers become available instantly when you build residences and request a given number, so there's no gradual build-up of the population like in other games. This may not be realistic, but it does allow you get facilities up and running sooner since you don't have to wait for workers to become available once requested. Their travel to and from work is not simulated either.  \n\nI still haven't encountered any major bugs or crashes. I'll update these impressions again soon.\n\nUpdate 7/31 #2: Okay, after playing the game for a while on Freeplay, I would still recommend this title for fans of the genre. If you are trying to choose between IE and the latest Sim City, however, I would go for Sim City, as it's prettier and, perhaps, more streamlined and refined in some of its gameplay elements. Some folks have been reporting lag spikes and sluggish gameplay.  I really haven't had any problems in those regards. All of the game features I have tried have worked as one would expect. \n\nThe bottom line IMHO is that this is a competent entry into the city building genre, but it could use a facelift and some subtle improvements  to make  it even better. Perhaps the price tag should be a bit lower given these issues, but this is a generally robust simulation that seems to offer a solid foundation for some good fun.

You build industry around a map after buying land and produce in a 'unit per hour' style to then sell to cities which, depending on population, have needs. You build truck hubs to send out trucks to pick up goods and deliver all over the map. Even if you've found this style of gameplay fun, there are some significant drawbacks to this particular title.\n\nThe actual method of getting goods to market is not the smoothest method either. You'll find yourself doing extremely mundane tasks with a lot of clicking - and there is no simple 'deliver per month' that would make bringing things to market more automated and streamlined. This is only set up between your own factories.\n\nThe actual manner in which your vehicles take things to their orders is unsatisfying. Undetailed vehicles, no sense of loading and unsatisfying sound effects mean that the thing you'll do over and over seems to reap little reward. There's no ching or money or roar of engine, no sense of big loads or interesting vehicles. In this regard, it falls short of previous, older, non-3d titles.\n\nThe method of land purchase, itself, is a little obnoxious. If there were tools to help you fill in gaps or 'snap to road' and 'snap to non buyable land' options, it would be a little less so - but with large footprints, winding Freight Tycoon style roads and rigidly blocky buildings, you'll find yourself with an ugly landscape rather quickly. You point and click to form a shape. If you've ever played Cities XXL and built a farm - the manner is identical, but for the ability to snap to lines and fill in spaces. This, agan, is sorely missed, costs time and leaves gaps.\n\nFurthermore, there is little sense of border in some buildings. To make roads between them, you'll often be clicking on invisible (Indeed, also 3d) footprints as you select and build roads to create alleys and access roads. \n\nTo progress through the game you start with a few buildings, earn money and level up. This releases more buildings and products - that cities, too, will begin to pick up as they grow. To make a city grow you have to supply it with as much as you can. This means you'll be taking large numbers of orders.\n\n The different menus you have to go through to send a truck, the inability to rename vehicles or places to create senses of locales or purposes (Especially helpful as your plants specialize in products), you'll come to know them as 32, 44, 1 and 3. Not only unpersonal, but it continues to take away from an immersion of the game. A simple option to rename would have helped. You wont see the load capacities of trucks when you send them out - you have to actually select the logistics depot, go to purchase a new vehicle and determine it from there.\n\n A truck will then leave, 'touch' its source destination to instantaneously load, get stuck behind a vehicle going slowly (ala Freight Tycoon without the passing or upgrading of roads), and then 'touch' its destination to deliver it. The sound effects are ala Windows 95 System Sounds than an actual game, and the little details that make the sight and sounds of these games, the sense of a day to day operation, seem lost. \n\nI've tried playing this quite a bit, and it still suffers from a crash to desktop every couple of hours. More importantly, the more I play this, the more I not want to play this. I want to go back to other titles to get a sense of satisfaction that they, as a game, give. Though newer and in 3d, this game is both expensive and lacks a sense of basic heart, soul and effort that others have tried to give. I don't recommend it.\n\nAs a sidenote, the graphics are clean enough when zoomed in - but this is a view you will be rarely using.

I don\u2019t have a powerful graphics card, but the screens lead me to believe I\u2019d be ok (I can run many more visually appealing games on mid-low settings, like Anno 2070 and Sleeping Dogs). On the lowest settings the game still runs kinda low and the software cursor is often choppy.\n\nI did encounter a bug in the tutorial where one of the dialogues that didn\u2019t have any apparent requirements (no click here, etc) did not advance. I was able to skip it and complete the tutorial.\n\nThe game itself presents to be a  more complex SimCity (not that always online crap, I'll never play it so I can't compare), it looks very indepth and in many ways looks like it's trying to deliver exactly what I want.\n\nThe game requires lots of micromanagement, which isn\u2019t on its own a bad thing. I prefer games that give me lots of control over what needs to be done. There is a strange lack of automation however. For example, when I built a chicken coop, even after I assign workers to it, I have instruct it to start producing chickens, which is its only function. \n\nTransporting goods between buildings and to contracts is similar. This makes more sense and does allow you to program the route so it repeats. However, I was unable to find a way to queue tasks. I had one farm truck and contracts to two different cities. The game did not allow me to start both tasks as I had only one truck. Preferably, it would set the tasks in a queue and available, unassigned trucks would go.\n\nI entered Freeplay and balked at first at the lack of freedom (no industry buildings, no research options) until I learned that you level up through completing orders and your level is saved to your profile (so future freeplay games will start at a higher level). I played for a bit but became bored at how slow the progress was. \n\nI ended my play session when I realized one order that I had set up game days ago was never delivered. Nor were the other two contracts I had just set up for delivery. Supposedly there is a way to track a trucks motion, but when I was looking for it, the game began to run very slowly and I had reached my limit.\n\nPROs\n*Very complex looking game\n*Has a leveling system where your actions make your more efficient\n\nCONS\n*Poor graphical engine (this may be unique to people on lower powered systems)\n*Buggy and/or sometimes unintuitive\n*Lack of effective automation\n\nFinal thoughts: I guess it is less of a simulation game and more of a literal sandbox, meaning you are a kid in an actual sandbox playing with your Tonka truck, You have to find the sand, dig the sand, and put the sand in the truck, and push it in the direction you want it to go.

Economy simulators are not for everyone.  In fact, very few people will be able to dig their claws into them.\n\nWhen you go to the grocery store do you look at all of the products in front of you and immediately calculate in your head which is the best per gram/oz?  If not, you probably don't have the kind of mind made for these games.  Economy simulators are designed around people who can curb every nickle and every dime to maximize profits.  They make spreadsheets in their head and can figure out the exact figure of every single profit margin.\n\nIndustry Empire is an attempt to try and soften the genre for less hardcores by making things more manual and thus less complicated.\n\nIn a general economy simulator the purpose of creating product is for the use of the population.  They demand TVs and you get them TVs.  In this game there is no local demand, it is entirely export basis... kind of like Tropico.\n\nThe game tries to get a little deeper than Tropico by making this all manual.\n\nSo let's say you have begun producing Eggs.  You need to sell those eggs.  You go to an order sheet and pick which offers you'd like to accept.\n\nYou fulfill those orders by shipping product on trucks.  Trucks come in different types that have limitations on what kind of product they can ship and how much they can ship.  Min/maxing means only having as many trucks as you need to fulfill orders for each kind of product while having large enough trucks to fulfill the sizes of orders you need to fulfill.\n\nAs you continue to do business you level up and gain access to new products you can make.\n\nThe key to these kinds of games is the production chain.  So you start off with basic resources but as you level up you can make more complicated resources.  You might start off with cows.  Then you get a butcher to cut them into beef.  Then you might get a sausage factory to make beef hotdogs.  After this maybe you'll get a hotdog factory to make microwavable hotdogs.  Each step in production increases your costs but also increases your profitability.\n\nTo further promote selling more products the game limits you on how many orders you can fulfill.\n\nTo further incentive you to sell different products they also have achievements which will give you bonus points when leveling up.\n\nA secondary feature of leveling up is the Leveling Tree.  You will gain certain static points modifiers that will make life easier.  Your level stays for every single play so the game actually gets progressively easier as you continue to play it. It means good players will spend less time at the game, whereas bad players will spend more.\n\nWhat the game lacks is a lot of character to get you into the game. With Tropico, Anno, and SimCity you are given missions and goals that will continuously pop up throughout a game.  This game has nothing like this.  You are left to your own means with no real direction on what to do.\n\nAnother major weakness to the game is the lack of automation.  You can schedule deliveries to your own facilities to keep your own production going.  But there is no way to automatically sell product to the various towns.  You have to fulfill the orders which takes endless hours and may be just too tedious for the average player to stomach.\n\nOn top of that the game has some minor issues with crashing.  This would all be fine if you were getting a phenomenal game... but you're not.\n\nOverall the game lacks a lot of design that you would find in similar games.  Unfortunately there are just far better simulators out there that are older.  Anno 2070 which was released in 2011 is a far superior game to Industry Empire which was released in 2014.  The catch is that Anno is the exact same price (including all DLC). Stick with Anno... unless you've already played Anno to death and want to try something different... then pick up this game at a Steam sale.", "timestamp_updated": 1420576033, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1420576033, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "11560108", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503528", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1406987062, "steamid": "76561197986629379", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Do not buy the game.

A Really Really Really rich set of goods to process and sell\n 160 goods, beating a lot of games by light years, only came close by Capitalism, but has a lot more dynamics\n2. Decent production chain\n It becomes as complex as, if not more than TrainMaster\n3. Very well balanced\n you cannot sell one type of good forever, it will crash the market, you have to feed the cities the 160 goods in varity to let it grow and consume all you productions to make profit\n\nAll in all, a very different taste of flavour from many other business tycoon games, very rich economic simulation, with tiny bit of transportation simulation. This is a nearly unbeatable game logic.\n\nCons:\nAll that was of merit in the game logic, is comprimised by execution.\n1. Known Game crash at launch issue, with scarce information.\n saw a lot of forum post complaining about crash at launch, I had to reinstall a few times, then completely restart steam to get into game, definitely has to do with graphics, I got a prompt for some kind of factory graphic reset before first successful launch.\n2. Random crash in game, with scarce information.\n Game sometime just crashes for no apparent reason, when you are about 1 hour / 1year game time into the game. reload will sometime crash at same point, doing something different avoids the crash.\n3. too few maps\n From what I see, only 6 scenario and 3 maps (could be only 6 maps may be they reuse the map? Idk I am not interested in scenario I simulate, I only enjoy simulate)\n4. tedious micromanagement\n This is to many people a con, not that I frustrate a lot about, after all I see the reason behind it to be forcing player to pay attention to individual buildings. I think it is unfair to actually say the micromanagement is tedious, the production phase actually allows you to automate(with configurable time + volume option, never seen in other games), at the sacrifice of holding up one of your vehicle per operation; but the selling to market phase, there is no automation. Come on, after all sales is the most important part of Business! If all things can truely be automated, it will add a lot of satisfaction to the \"hands off\" experience, though might bring away some joy of micromanagement, you know we are all lazy.\n\nBought at steam sale, about 7USD, thats a deal.\nKnow what you are buying, you only enjoy this game if you are patient, and like to see things running, and love business simuation.", "timestamp_updated": 1473193480, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1467829767, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "29517955", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499435", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1491763874, "steamid": "76561198054953139", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "this is a really great game when it comes too wanting to have a industry aspect challenge but what it lacks is the compettion that would be great to have amoung other industry group!", "timestamp_updated": 1485511122, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": true, "timestamp_created": 1485511122, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 22, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "review_score": 4, "num_reviews": 20, "total_negative": 48, "total_reviews": 70}}
