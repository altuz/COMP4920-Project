It's the fourth in the series, yet its by far the most primitive. The music is non existent with the same few tracks playing over and over, the sound effects are so grating to the ears. You will hear that clang clang sound over and over as you mash search on every wall because you can't progress the game without finding some old guy whos in some wall. It's the same sound in battle, and the menus. YOU WILL NOT ESCAPE THAT SOUND. The dungeons are lifeless, everything looks the same. You will hear that door sound like hundreds of times, and not know where you are. Last, but not least, to top it all off the map system is like the genre devolved back to 1987, the big reason why no one bothers with this game past a couple of hours. Yeah, it gets better in that regard the more you play, but whatever, the game is bad.", "timestamp_updated": 1502486096, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502485748, "votes_down": 11}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 51, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 31, "total_reviews": 82}}
