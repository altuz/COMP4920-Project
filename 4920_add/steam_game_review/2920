Most features have already been mentioned in my review of 688(i) so I will try to tell only the difference between these two:\n\n- Higher resolution and better graphics\n- 3 plattforms to operate (688(i), Seawolf, Akula)\n- Single missions and campaigns which can be played as US or russian.\n- Use your voice to command your ship completely (navigation, firing at a certain contact etc.)\n\nThe most important part feature, which came afterwards for Sub Command, is the big SCX mod:\n\n\"What it is - SCX is a community-created mod for Sub Command. It adds new subs, ships, aircraft, weapons and sensors, as well as 'tweaking' the originals for added realism. SCU (Sub Changer Utility) is an add-on to SCX II that allows the player to control other sub classes in addition to the 'stock' Los Angeles, Seawolf and Akula subs.\" - http://subguru.com/\n\nSo if you are up for a slow and sensor-realistic modern submarine sim then go for it and remember to inform yourself on www.subsim.com to check whether it runs on modern systems or not. \n\nIf you want a faster action with more fancy graphics, please check out Cold Waters on steam! If that fit your needs then you possibly will like:\n\nJane's 688(i) Hunter/Killer (the prequel of Sub Command)\nSonarlysts - Dangerous Waters (sequel to Sub Command, 688(i), Seawolf, Akula, Kilo, Oliver Hazard Perry FFG, SH-60R Seahawk, P-3C Orion)\nSonarlysts - Fleet Command (from the strategical point of view)\nUbisofts Silent Hunter 5 - Battle of the Atlantic (World War II but not without Mods's!)\n\nPlease visit my channels if you are interested into military stuff, old and recent (still a startup project!)\nwww.twitch.tv/tertius_oculus\nwww.youtube.com/channel/UCtoN73hHYN0oTlqknOwxIUw\nwww.twitter.com/Tertius_Oculus"}]}
