Well this game might change your mind because for starters it is made by one of the former employees of LucasArts (Technically in the 80s & 90s) named David Fox a.k.a employee #3, David's influence for making this awesome game was Rube Goldberg's granddaughter Jennifer George, The puzzles feel original & fresh, The price is right & it is very educational to young or old so overall I highly suggest getting this game even though it only has 18 puzzles but keep your fingers crossed for the steam workshop so we can all make cool contraptions just like Rube did.

Slice a turkey, and all you have is a rooster, a penguin, a sand dispenser, a see-saw, a chicken salad, a bucket, a fan, and some string. Yes, that makes sense. Eventually. And not only is it immensely satisfying to figure out, it also makes me smile.\n\nSuch is the effect of the inspired work of Mr. Goldberg himself, some of whose contraptions are by now over 80 years old.

Not only made of just mundane physics things, but you also get to use animals and some other unusual things. 12 of puzzles are based on real drawings of Rube Goldberg, so if you are 0.01% of all people who studied his works, then congratulations, you spoiled yourself. For other 99.99% of people it will be new stuff. The other 6 puzzles are completely new, made for this game, designed in same fashion.\n\nAs said, puzzles are designed to be more of quest-style one. There is pretty much no such thing as having to place stuff accurately, most often it gets automatically placed into right spot, unlike Incredible Machine style games, where some puzzles were all about accurate placement. And yes, I am talking about 'accurate' placing, as in, few-pixels off.\nIt doesn't follow same logic of introducing every elements and then using them for whole game. Doesn't make players to figure how to make machine work based on already well-known \"bricks\".\nInstead the game is all about figuring out what \"bricks\" do. It often gives you different sets of items to use. It does reuse some assets once or twice, but it sometimes gives them a new use once again. In this way it heavily reminds me more of non-sense puzzles from classic adventure games, where you had to do something unexpected or never before explained to you. For example, find out that sword can be sticked to the firework rocket. Placement of some items are a bit obious (only one spot where they fit, for example), and you have to use them all anyway to get the maximum rating.\n\nAnd yes, you can use as little items as possible and do ridiculously lame shortcuts, you will get to the next puzzles anyway. I would not recommend beating the game this way, not challenging or satificatory at all.\nAchievements are quite easy and you will naturally get most of them while beating the game.\n\nThe art also looks quite neat for a such small game, things look quite lovely and cartoonish. The physics look wacky, an animal dropped somewhere will be rolling like a ball, doing flying animation and whining. But there is so much you can do and need to do with them in such small game, so who cares. The lgiht humor is in the game too, explaining what is going on in the contraption. Even descriping when things don't go in the right way (\"eggs don't hatch on fire, good thinking\"). The only thing is that there is only one music in whole game, used for menu. Gameplay itself will be followed only by ambient sound effects, wind or rain or such. But hey, at least you will not feel annoyed by some ever-repeating soundtrack.\n\nSo yes. It's kinda like Incredible Machines but different. Will make you think like in quest games. And it's fun enough. This small game will not occupy you for too long, doesn't provide much of progression, more like collection of same-level puzzles, doesn't have much of replayblity.
