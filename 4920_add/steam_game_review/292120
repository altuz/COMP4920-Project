After reading tons upon tons of not recommended reviews all I keep seeing is \"Oh, the levels are extreamly linear\" or \"The battle system sucks\". So maybe I can put a shroud upon those \"issues\" and make them seem like not such a bad thing; perhaps deceptisol or fortisol or something.\n\nSo firstly, the levels ARE linear mostly up until around near the end of the game but did you consider the storyline up until that point before pointing it out as an \"issue\"?... I don't think so. [spoiler] I hardly think going for a run around the wilderness whilst the army is on your trail is a bright idea lol and the storyline, up until its most pivotable point, has lightning trying to cause havoc and mayhem to the citizens on Cocoon. [/spoiler] So what I'm saying here is that each main protagonist has a single minded goal and the routes they take is obviously going to be the most direct one. Have a think, EACH character has their own seperate goal. For gamers who want to buy this game and play it for the first time try not to read the text above but don't listen to reviews stating that the level designs are an issue, their visuals are stunning and most of the time their linear-ness just blows over your head.\n\nAnd for the battle system, up until this point in Final Fantasy, combat has always been pressing a button or clicking a key to queue attacks and wait for you characters to execute them. Because this time Square Enix decided to add the element of real-time strategy rather than turn based, so it makes sense that you can only control a single character. They also added an Auto-Battle feature that kinda hand holds you through battles, however its not made to be abused. Many reviews have told the story of \"It makes the game boring because you can just abuse it\"... but isn't that the case with any feature on any game. The feature was made so that if you don't have a clue what ability to use, it will give you a somewhat idea of what to use, therefore you can queue up abilities to better target your enemies weaknesses. It's just silly to criticise a game for doing something a little different that adds a bit more variety into it.\n\nAll in all, they're the small minded reviews about this game that you should stay away from. I'm not saying this port is perfect, no way, but the game itself is wonderful. It's visuals are stunning, the soundtrack is amazing, the story is deep and you'll grow to appreciate the main protagonists as the game progresses. However persisting bugs, though not game breaking, are still awaiting a patch *cough cough Square Enix cough*.

I knew of it before I bought the game, thought it wouldn't be that bad, it turned out to be worse, but far worse than that it turns out to be not the game's actual problem. Yeah, this game players like you're walking through a tunnel all the time, your movements confined and forced in one single direction except the token sidepath which is guaranteed to give bonus loot. That's not what makes this game bad. One could argue that that is what makes this game story-driven, and near as I can tell the story's actually good.\n\nThe problem is that this isn't much of a game, and far more of a movie.\n\nStarting FFXIII, we're subjected to some of the main characters, most of which who portray stereotypical or archetypical figures from what we're used to from pop culture and/or previous Final Fantasy games. I could probably decently compare most of FFXIII's characters to previous FF games and draw clear parallels, which is okay, because that is part of a Final Fantasy game, right down to the airship captain named Cid. As the game progresses we find out, mostly through flashbacks, that all of these people are somehow related to the central story: the nature of the fal'Cie, a group of mystical beings that provide the functions humans need to survive in their artificial bubble-world called Cocoon, and the nature of their enforced servants, l'Cie, humans \"gifted\" with a brand that provides them both with magical powers and with the curse of turning into a monster if they do not complete their Focus in time, a task set to them by the fal'Cie that doesn't come with a proper set of instructions.\n\nIt is around the relationship between fal'Cie and humans, the bubble-world of Cocoon and the nature of the planet below the artificial Cocoon world, called Pulse, that the game revolves. Pitting polar positions against each other with human servants in the middle, the story appears beautifully crafted, as beautifully as the world(s) and enviroment you find yourself in while playing the game.\n\nThe real problem is that all of this doesn't really become apparent until you're 15-20 hours in. The time before that is spent by the game telling you what it wants from you: that it wants you to press buttons in the way it wants to and if you do that right, it'll entertain you with its story. It's like a sullen child. You give it cake, and it'll clean its room.\n\nI understand that a good tutorial, especially enmeshed properly in gameplay, is a good feature. Except that a tutorial should not take 15-20 gameplay hours. I will admit that I am not a seasoned Final Fantasy player, and that it could be done a lot faster if I knew what I was doing, but these are not merits by which to judge a game. I am not judging this game compared to other games of its kind, I am judging it on its merits alone, because I expect each game I buy to provide me entertainment value for its own sake. If after 10 hours of gameplay the game still needs to teach me basic functionality, if after 15 hours of gameplay I apparently still get to play with new characters, but more importantly than that STILL don't have the freedom to decide on my own party 'cause the game just HAS to tell the story this way... that's when I get annoyed, and that's primarly 'cause some of these characters play as comfortably as a brick car with square wooden wheels and a sharp metal spike for a seat.\n\nThis is where the story fails. These characters could be interesting, if I did not have to play with them. Two specifically, Snow and Sazh, are horrible to play with, especially when they're the \"main\" character of the group, and lo and behold a bit of googling reveals that they are the ones irrelevant to the \"meta\" of most useful characters. Similarly one of the best characters to play with, Fang, does not come under your control until 15 hours of playtime. However the game insists on putting me in scenarios where I have different characters with different roles/specializations in control, just so I can experience all possible combinations in a tutorial-esque way until I finally get the point where I probably have full customization.\n\nThe result is that I don't feel like I am playing a game, the game is playing me. It is a sullen, insecure movie disguised as a game, that demands that I press some obligatory buttons before it'll continue telling me its story.\n\nIt would help if combat was actually engaging or interesting, but it isn't. The biggest challenge of combat, is starting a fight with Preemptive Strikes, which is achieved by manipulating the amazingly stupid AI into turning its back on you so you can run into them undetected. The rest of combat is primarily playing with the Paradigm system, which defines the roles that your AI controlled characters use (while letting you perform token manual abilities with the \"main\" character), which barely keeps me engaged in the fight. Manipulating paradigms is crucial to succesful combat, especially in the case of the harder bossfights in the game... but it's not difficult, and it's not engaging.\n\nThe most difficult part of the game by far is dealing with its frequently occurring error: repetitive command lock. I understand that FFXIII is a console port, I don't mind that. However it's a console port that apparently (after googling the issue) doesn't like that you don't have a controller hooked up to your computer. Frequently and apparently randomly, the game will lock your controls into repeating the same button command over and over, effectively making the game unplayable by making your character behave as if you were pressing the same button over and over. Not even terminating the game function through Windows will fix this, when this error occurs you could open notepad and see it write the same letter over and over until you restart your computer.\n\n\nIn the end I tried hard to like this game for the sake of its story, which I truly believe could be good. The world is beatifully crafted. The characters eventually turn out to be intersting enough. The gameplay is pretty terrible but I could sludge through it if it at least proved to be reliable and consistent, but even if I were to ignore the frequently occuring error that causes me to restart my computer and ruin my progress, playing this game just feels like a chore. It reminds me of the Stanley Parable, where the protagonist's job is to press a button when queued to do so and work will continue. \n\nThat is all FFXIII is. Do combat sequence, before you get to continue with otherwise interesting story. It's not a game.
