This is the worst PC port ever, no exaggeration. Completely unplayable for anyone with a newer system. It keeps freezing on me, has framerate problems, and has completely crashed my system. I've tried every permutation of settings in both the application and graphic driver overwrites. Only way I got it to be SLIGHTLY playable was by downgrading my drivers and I refuse to stick with old drivers simply for a poor port. Avoid like the plague. Sorry SquareEnix...

However, when I played it I was at a constant 60 FPS and it didn't crash once. The ONLY issue I had with it was the rain, which for some reason got very milky white and intense in this version. There is a mod to fix it though, so it definitley wasn't game-breaking. Maybe those people were trying to play the game on a crappy computer? I'm unsure, but on my end, I didn't have any problems and it played flawlessly.\n\nOn a less technical note, this game is actually my favorite in the series. This is my second time playing it, having platted it once on the PS3, and I definitly wouldn't have bothered doing that (or playing it AGAIN, mind you) if it wasn't enjoyable. Yes, it's plot makes it obvious that they never planned for this sequel, but at least it ties in nicely with Lightning Returns. It's no longer linear (unlike it's predecessor pre-endgame), and the battle system brings everything good from the first game and allows you more customization in your battle teams with the addition of monsters (who can be infused with others for your own unique set up) as your third party member. I do miss having Lightning and the normal 'gang' around, but the addition of Caius, Yeul, and Noel, who are great characters in their own right, does make up for it. I think the only complaint I have about this game is the music - some of it, like the metal-esque sounding stuff - is a bit too much for me at times.\n\nJust give it a shot though. If it doesn't play on your computer then I suggest playing it on its original platform (or investing in a better machine), because overall it really is a good game.", "timestamp_updated": 1506312201, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506311917, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35382287", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506292667, "steamid": "76561198017720524", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1461}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have got to say after playing the first game with little to no problems i was very frustrated when i moved onto the second game and had constant crashing i mean it was literally every 2 minutes.\n\nAfter i turned off \"Steam cloud\" however and restarted the game i had absolutely no problems at all with crashing.\n\nThere were places like the Tower where my framerate did drop to around 30 despite me running with a GTX 1070 which was a little disappointing.\n\nHowever i enjoyed the story very much once the frustrating issue with crashing was solved. The little niggling problems with a couple FPS drops fell by the wayside.\n\nI highly recommend this game providing you turn off steam cloud before getting into it. The controller support works fine with the Xbox 360 controller providing you remember to change the options for on-screen prompts to controller and the combat and taming monsters systems kept me entertained.", "timestamp_updated": 1506865823, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506865683, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34796102", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481125", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1504792332, "steamid": "76561198098916941", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 11, "review": "Crashes harder than Princess Diana.", "timestamp_updated": 1504796752, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504796752, "votes_down": 12}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 659, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 4, "total_negative": 456, "total_reviews": 1115}}
