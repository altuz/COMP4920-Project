The game has terrible pacing and arbitrary difficulty, where you will see no new aliens or technology for months at a time as you easily roll over everything and then suddenly see a huge amount of new alien tech out of nowhere. Since your tech is immediately obseleted you're then extremely weak for the next few months until you can catch up, making all missions nearly impossible to do. The only thing to really do at this point is ignore all missions and just wait for your research and manufacturing to finish. The story is pretty neat though, I like it taking a twist on the typical X-COM story that these inspired games typically have.", "timestamp_updated": 1502917031, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502916780, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 24, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 35}}
