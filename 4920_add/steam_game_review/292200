A lot of good memories are evoked in this game: the dress style of the characters is a fantastical blend of classical 18th century stiff frocks to a 1930s flapper style, the music is scratchy like an old record and hovers just at the edge of your perception. And I really appreciate well-written characters, subtle storytelling and good voice work: every character was charming and unique to me, and helping them out advanced their one-sided story a little further.\n\nCons: The game is unforgiving if you burn all your money buying plants instead of breeding them, accepting orders you don't have the energy or money to fulfill, or buying upgrades too early in the game. The 'tutorial' day feels tedious, but it takes two minutes to speed-click through everything. It's also extremely short: a skilled gamer can chew this up in an hour, but the quick end (and super-low price - I bought this at 4 CAD) prevents the game from feeling tedious and worth the money.\n\nAlso, I'd shoot the marketer who said \"crazy\" was a good descriptor for this game. \n\n* Edited after completing the game.", "timestamp_updated": 1407200759, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1407175698, "votes_down": 6}, {"recommendationid": "11624927", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 38, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563691", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1407651584, "steamid": "76561197977594570", "num_games_owned": 1844, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Crazy Plant Shop actually reminds me a little of Cook Serve Delicious in that \"just one more day\" sort of addictive way, except it's about efficiency rather than speed.

It's a fun little casual game that is challenging enough to keep you coming back for more, but not terribly difficult or stressful.\n\nThe game uses scientific concepts and terminology, and features the use of Punnett square diagrams to determine the traits of the plants you are breeding to fill customer requests.

The voice acting is limited and at times cringe-worthy. There is only one game mode- a 13 day challenge to obtain all the plant types. There is no way to buy extra plant slots. Waiting on your character to walk around for everything and for the plant breeding machine to go ding takes up far too much time, which is pointless because the days are not on a timer. There is no penalty for rejecting customers or failing customers' orders that you accepted.\n\nUltimately, there is just very little to this game. It's good, but there needs to be MORE. I can find good little games all day for free, and most of them have more depth and keep me entertained longer than Crazy Plant Shop could ever hope to.\n\nAs a warning, note that there is no cross-breeding plants to create new, strange species.
