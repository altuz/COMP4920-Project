I cant bear to play it which really bums me out.\n\n\nThe controls are nice but the ship you ride in is slower than a turtle.\nYou basically try to get to the end continously filling up your fuel from these humongous nearly missable Spy Corp fuel tanks.\nThis game is a Mess. I should have figured it out after the main vehicle you drive in was called the M.E.S.S.\nThe story is just wierd.\nThis gorrila doesn't like that everyone uses Ketchup so he sends out some Robot Monkeys to crush all the tomatos.

The plot is about a mustard company CEO named King Konglomo(yes he is a parody to King Kong) who is fed up that cosumers are preferring ketchup over mustard. So he crafts a crazy plan to rid of the world's supply of tomatoes so that way consumers will have no choice but to choose mustard for their burgers, hot dogs, pretzels, etc. Word of the scheme is notified to Spy Fox who is aided by Quack & Monkeypenny to stop King Konglomo's insane plan. By piloting a hoverpod called the M.E.S.S., Spy Fox must go on a global quest to destroy all of King Konglomo's robot probes that are stealing all of the tomatoes. Like the Cheese Chase game, it's an arcade style game except instead of it being a rail shooter it's a free roaming style game. In each level you control the M.E.S.S. and must destroy as many robot probes as possible in order to proceed to the next level. Most levels are challenging when the number of robot probes becomes overwhelming. While certain levels are easy when the objective is not to destroy the robots but instead destroy a control center that is controlling them. There are various power up items that can help you out for a limited time. If you played the Cheese Chase game, then you'll know what to expect with this game. The game play is very fun, and highly recommended for anyone who likes Spy fox or the Humongous games in general.", "timestamp_updated": 1460314497, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1460314497, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34385150", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1503275273, "steamid": "76561198024587790", "num_games_owned": 498, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is not like the other games, it's like cheese chase in that it sucks.
