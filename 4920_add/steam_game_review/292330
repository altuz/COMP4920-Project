However, its currently really hard to play as you have to wait at least 5 minutes to load and has mini freezes while ingame. Also tends to crash alot currently (11/09/17)\n\nRecomending this because if you can play it, its a really good, unique game that doesnt have any competition (that i can find).\n\ngoodluck devs.", "timestamp_updated": 1505076112, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505076112, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34898842", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498566", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505218209, "steamid": "76561198030306560", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Beware, this game is in alpha state and I can totally understand if people want to keep their fingers off it. You will have to deal with crashes, bugs, restarts, a lot of saving and tons of frustration. Apparently lots of people are not aware of that, although the game is clearly stated to be in early development, and thereby give negative ratings. But it is an alpha and thereby you have to deal with problems, as simple as that.\n\nShort version:\nIf you like optimising and fiddling with designs, as well as the space and tycoon-genres, this is for you. If you're impatient with alpha based bugs and problems, which you will most surely encounter, keep your hands off and look for something else. Come back later though, as work is going on continuously and updates are released regularly.\n\nPros:\n- Design blueprints of your space ship in an always unique way, fullfilling requirements by customers most efficiently\n- Interact with solar systems on a galaxy map\n- Star systems develop, depending on trade and other exterior influences\n- Tycoon aspect is not simple or easy\n- Massive research branches: take some time to unlock new modules for your ship\n- Several fuselages, that you can build your design on\n- Maintain several shipyards to have access to more contracts\n- Maintain your own fleet for trade, military, mining or exploration\n\nCons:\n- Early state of the game\n- Lots of bugs and crashes\n- Tutorial is not really functional at the moment and lead several times to crashes so you'll have to learn by yourself\n- Too early to tell if the concept will be boring at one point or economy might be too easy\n\n\n\nDespite a lot of bugs and problems, it is possible to play this game and have some progress as well. I got an insight for nearly 4 hours now (designed and built 3 ships by now) and I have to say, the idea behind the game is just brilliant. Designing space ships in large scale context with business simulation, research and some more aspects in for example mining and warfare is just fabulous.\n\nThe main focus of this game lies on designing the interior of space ships and you have to decide where to put things, how to arrange them in an efficient way and how to fullfill the requirements of your customer, which will be the military or police, trading companies, miners, space explorers and so on. This design aspect ends up very quickly in something comparable to Tetris and is not simple at all. You have to take care that a bridge is in place, as well as a board computer, life support for air and water treatment. Additionally, the vessel needs an engine with fuel tanks of course, as well as a generator for electric power. All the cableing has to be done for electicity, cooling, fuel, air and water and then, when everything is set and running, you have to test the ship in some sort of minigames, simulating standard operations and emergencies, such as hostile boarding parties, asteriod impacts, alien infestations and so on. After several minutes, if not hours, your first ship is finished and it is a great feeling, when you finally can assign it to your shipyard and deliver it to the customer, knowing it will be sailing around the galaxies for (hopefully!) years to come. This concept of gameplay has captured me as it is a mixture of Aurora 4X and space engineers, where you have to optimise things as well until everything is running smoothely, which to be honest, will never happen. Otherwise you would be finished with those games very quickly. And as yet, I am not bored or finished with this at all.\n\nAt this point I don't really regret buying the game since I was aware what I was buying and it might help the developer making some progress boosting this game to a high level - where it definitely deserves to be.", "timestamp_updated": 1505214110, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505214110, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "34924895", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499591", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505839010, "steamid": "76561197977838212", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The Concept is nice, it just needs some fine tuning.\nThe Game itself has too many Bugs.
