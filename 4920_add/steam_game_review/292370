I happen to like the RPG Maker genre.\n\nDarkEnd is among the very best RPG Maker games that I have played.\nI spend more than 100+ hours playing this game, and enjoyed it tremendously, and that is why I decide to write a review of DarkEnd to share my experiences.\n\nIn DarkEnd you can play as one of 4 different Primary Characters, and each of these 4 character has a very unique and intriguing storyline. You can also select a Secondary Character from the remaining 3 characters. The storyline is quite complex and convoluted and you normally would not know who is good or bad until the very end. Each of the character has their own unique reasons to go into the DarkEnd, and the outcome is also different and unique. Playing this game is like reading a detective novel for me, and each stage of the game give me a better glimpse of the story.\n\nThere is also a lot of replayability because when you finished the game, you can play NG+ and select a different starting character. All the items and gold get carried forward to the next game, but all the quests resets. I like this system very much. There are also lots of optional side quests, and optional dungeons that spawn randomly too.\n\nOn the negative side, there are some minor gramatical and syntactic errors. However, I personally not mind these errors, and did overlook them because I like the stories, the plot twists and the interesting game play.\n\nI had a good time playing DarkEnd and for me, its worth the money spent. I love this game and would highly recommend it.", "timestamp_updated": 1443688398, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "2", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1443688398, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "15896868", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528447", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1432022359, "steamid": "76561198105431159", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "For about 4 dollars I'd say it was worth it, there was times when it was a challenge (in a good way) and times when it was just 'I'm bored, I should play pokemon this is so bad'. The side quests were hard to do due to the low drop chances (or my horrible luck) and the random generating was so random i found the fairy 10 times and the cave once before giving up.\n\nI'll give the story a 6 out of ten, but i played as griselda and was confused until I hit the end of the dark dimension. I like some curious plot twists but I got a little lost there. In the description even it said something about a love story. I didn't see it at all besides the weird flash backs about someone who wasn't even my MC.\n\nFor 4 bucks if your bored enough to waste 7 some odd hours like I did, I recommend it (Kinda).

Overall a solid RPG. Recommend it for people who like to enjoy the challenging turnbased RPGs.\n\nDarkEnd is somewhat similar to the instant-classic Etarian Odyssey series. Light on story but rather focused on gameplay. The battles are really harsh for unprepared party and could get wiped easily by simple blunder. \n\nWhat I really like about this game is the boss battles. Most RPG maker RPGs I have played have rather simple boss battles. The bosses are only just stronger. All you need to do is use your strongest skills and heal when it is needed. It is not so simple in DarkEnd. Each and every boss, except the first one, has a catch and require special tactic to beat them. Since every spell and skill have cooldown and warm up timer, you have to think carefully which skill to be used at which moment. Spamming the strongest spell/skill without any strategy will only get yourself killed in DarkEnd.\nOptional bosses are also very challenging. Since you cannot save in the dungeon, it can be a really tensed situation when you try to challenge a rare optional boss in the randomly appeared sub-level.  I wish the developers should give the game some achievements to make challenging boss battles even more worthwhile.\n\nThe story is nothing revolutionary. There are some interesting plot twists and lore which will be revealed late in game, but the story itself is pretty simple. The characters are well developed, especially Griselda and Lucion. However, the localization is a real let down in this game. Even as a second language user myself, I found some dialogues in game very cheesy and ridden with awkward grammar.\n \nGraphically, the game exactly of what you can expect of RPG maker games out there. I noticed the game used the stocked RTP materials mixed with some custom work. The pixel sprites are neat and colorful and some scenes in game are simple beautiful.  The characters\u2019 portrait arts are nice too.\n\nVerdict : Have you ever played any of Etarian Series?  Do you like them? Do you like very challenging RPG? If your answer is a \u201cYes\u201d, buy this (at least at the discount period) and you will enjoy this difficult but very rewarding RPG experience. A solid 7/10 game.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1423647432, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1423647432, "votes_down": 9}, {"recommendationid": "27584119", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502322", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1480126594, "steamid": "76561198061606765", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "After playing this game on/off for a few weeks, I gotta say, forget it. Play something else. \n\nThe Good: The character selection and choices for upgrading is a nice touch. The world seems well thought out.\n\nThe Bad: Errors in skill descriptions, way too much RNG. When a skill says it removes EVERY status aliment, that better mean every single aliment in the game. Afraid it doesn't remove blind, which made one boss a nightmare.\n\nThe Ugly: The RNG. The desciprtion says this game is about strategy, but its really more about pray to the RNG goddess and hope. You only have a party of 2, so it only takes one unlucky turn to get a TPK in most battles (especially dungeons 6 and 7). Afraid this developer needs to research the old dungeon crawlers more and what people liked about them, as I can tell it was NOT the RNG that people liked (trust me, no one finds it fun to have your entire party paralyzed or frozen and then unable to move). Look at Eterian Odyessy and see how they did it, and take ideas from that.
