In the end, I tried to power through, but it just feels like a slog. I think the problem is that I found it hard to empathize with any of the characters, the ones you play as well as the NPC's. Dozens of characters are introduced, you play half a dozen characters yourself (Only one character multiple times), then they are discarded quickly, with all of their stories. I tried this game because the curator \"Choice and Consequence\" recommended it, but while you make a lot of choices, I couldn't make out any consequences of those choices. The only difference your dialogue choices made were bars for friendliness, respect, and fear of NPC's towards your character slightly going up or down. Also, repeatedly acting in a certain way gave your character a trait icon (For example, \"diplomatic\"). Both of these things had no apparent effect on any stories, neither the overarching \"Unrest\" story, not the stories of individual characters.\n\nSome people wrote that the statement of the game is that normal people only have a neglicent power to change difficult circumstances. If this was really the intention, it would be a truism, and I'm pretty sure it could have been told in a more interesting way.", "timestamp_updated": 1501436952, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1501436815, "votes_down": 1}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 47, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 28, "total_reviews": 75}}
