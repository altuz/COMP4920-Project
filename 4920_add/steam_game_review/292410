Ive never played this when it came out for the ps2 and xbox days but damm i have missed out. The game is very much like NFSU2. It doesnt have drift mode, drag mode, only circuit and sprint. The world is an open world and you do get to race random street cars. The customization is fair. As fast as cosmetic, you can only change the wing and rims. The full bodykits are a one piece add on that but u can change the wing atleast. The game does have variations of cars which makes the game unique. There are your standard GT celica with 140hp and your 180HP GTS2. RX7 and the Supra have pretty good variations as well. For 99 cents, its worth it if you are trying to find something more like NFS2 days. The cool thing about this game is there is no catch-up system. NFSU2 has this catch up system where no matter how well you mod your car, NPC will always be behind you which makes a feel of backwards progression knowing your upgrade did nothing.\n\nFrom a guy car, this is my ratings:\nGameplay: 8/10 (The game has a functionl clutch button which gives it the uniqueness compared to current games today where clutch is still factored out)\nGfx: 8/10 (Not that bad tbh. I have it on high everything and it looks pretty good for a 2008 and under game)\nreplay value: 6/10 (can get repetive doing circuit and point to point thought i dont mind)\n99cents: Buy it!", "timestamp_updated": 1505351840, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505351840, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35126782", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502356", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506082925, "steamid": "76561198082888112", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Shit handling physics.\n\n90% of all the cars in the game are the exact same fucking cars with a slightly different names.\n\nOnly 1 bodykit per car and almost no sticker designs.\n\nUprading your speed and handling is confusing becuase it just gives you brands and hardly tells you what the better parts are.\n\nthe game will randomly lock you out of championships that were open 5 mins ago.\n\nLong story short. These devs were on crack. They must have been. at least 80% of the games content is lazy re-edits of existing items. For example the game has like 6 R34 GTRS. but no R33 or R32, same with the 350z. You got 350Z coupe, then Championship 350z then track 350z. Guess what the differences are between the cars actually are. A different name and it costs more. No difference in power at all and yes i have compared them, the devs claimed around 60+ cars are in the game. Yet they are all just copy and pasted piles of lazy shit.
