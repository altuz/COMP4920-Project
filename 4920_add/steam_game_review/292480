I bought the game for me and my buddys and we had a blast. With that said, [b]i can only recommend this game if you have somebody to play with.[/b]\nOther than that, pretty fun game, the camera can be a pain in the a$$ and takes time to get use to, the single-player content you get is nothing out of space, it can be completed in 3-5 hours. Combat system is pretty simple and easy to learn, i do hope you have a controller, because let me tell you, it's hell if you try to play this with keyboard.\nAgain, [b]only recommend if you have people to play with.[/b]", "timestamp_updated": 1502950996, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502865497, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 62, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 20, "total_reviews": 82}}
