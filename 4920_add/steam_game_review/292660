It seems to be aimed at girls age 5-7 or something like that. Most of the puzzles are overly simple, and some are even more illogical than you'd expect from this type of game, like \"let's make a potion to cure this room!\". Erm, no thanks. Also, I completed it in less than 2 hours despite getting stuck for a good while because I missed a room and couldn't figure out how to move on as only rooms you've been in are marked on the map.\n\nThe one good thing this game does is marking a room as clear once you've found everything in it. Unless you enjoy searching for pixels everywhere when you get stuck, I suppose.\n\nBut yeah, there's so many better hidden object games for a similar price.

The game was developed by Gogii Games in 2009, and its age does little to worn out the naive beauty of the setting and the unconventional gameplay. It still is a very good purchase.\n\nCrown princess Isabella returns to Castle Greystone for his marriage to Prince Adam, only to find the castle in ruins, all rooms cursed and the royal family trapped in mirrors! She is quickly joined by her fairy companion to investigate the matter, while collecting pieces of mirrors to save royal family and undo the curse if possible. All witnesses speak of a vile witch visiting the castle and putting a curse over the land, yet torn pages from our mother's diary indicate another forgotten secret to be uncovered. As being a trained magician herself, Isabella travels within the castle, solving puzzles, collecting mirror fragments and lifting curses over rooms. Will you be able to face the witch and save your family in the end?\n\nPlot explanation aside, this game is a classic for the HOG genre. Art works and character designs are a beauty, even though they've been aged in the digital era. Voice acting is more than decent, bringing a vivid side to the whole setting. The storyline is actually curious, with a nice plot twist by the end. Sadly, the Steam overlay doesn't work, and the game has no achievements or such due to its age.\n\nGameplay is basic HOG; collecting items and solving puzzles. Neither HOG scenes nor puzzles are actually challenging, but there is a logic presented in all HOG scenes - which was new at the time. We use most of the items we collect through HOG scenes, either for puzzles, or concocting potions to lift curses. The ending scene is unique in the HOG genre, by presenting a boss battle - a timed HOG challenge between you and the AI - which was never used in any other game aside the series in the genre. Map has a teleport function and you are declared when you complete all there is to do in a room, marking it as cleared. By the end, the game presents you 2-3 hours of clean cut fun.\n\nPrincess Isabella - aside being a bit fluffy on the tone - is a good purchase for all casual gamers and a must have for all HOG lovers. The last game of the series, [i]Princess Isabella: The Rise of an Heir[/i] has just been remastered by Artifex Mundi, possibly upping the quality of gameplay a couple notches. I strongly recommend the series as a whole.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_updated": 1463178339, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "4", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1463130845, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "18968146", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484424", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1449685071, "steamid": "76561198042831386", "num_games_owned": 443, "num_reviews": 442, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[h1]Short version: 87%[/h1]\nDespite its age, Princess Isabella is still one of the most enjoyable hidden object games, memorable for the quality of its voice acting, and the rather easy, but still fun mechanics.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nPrincess Isabella: A Witch\u2019s Curse, with its original 2009 release date, was one of the earliest hidden object games that left behind the old timed scavenger hunt mechanics to turn this genre into the lightweight point \u2018n\u2019 click adventure format we know it as now.\n\nFor an early pioneer, it aged remarkably well. Many of its features like the map system are still used with almost no change in the original formula. If it ever received an update on the old low-resolution graphics and the photo cut-out hidden object items, it could be a fresh new hit even with today\u2019s saturated HOG market.\n\nThe storyline too is in line with most HOGs: we play as the titular princess, who arrives home to a desolate castle, where she has to solve a series of puzzles and challenges to lift a curse and save the residents. She has a fairy helper to act as a hint system and to keep company: her presence is a welcomed addition, as she is far from annoying, and she adds some life to the otherwise empty castle rooms.\nThere is even a boss battle, believe it or not: the last challenge is a hidden object duel against the computer\u2013 a fun minigame  that surprisingly no other HOGs (except the sequels) copied.", "timestamp_updated": 1447061147, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1447060952, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "17908273", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515720", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1441442347, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "num_games_owned": 2214, "num_reviews": 352, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Princess Isabella tells the tale of a princess named Isabella in case it wasn't explicit enough.

Perfect for perhaps playing with kids. Some of the puzzles are surprisingly difficult considering the age of the market that the game seems to be aimed at and younger players will need assistance in places. \nOverall, the game is nicely presented with strong voiceovers, sound effects and music. The graphics fit the setting and my one gripe is that the HO scenes seem to be lower definition that the rest of the game, making finding some objects more difficult than need be, due to low detailing.\nHaving said that, if you can deal with the \"Disney Princess\" theme and story, it's a solid HOG, even for more experienced players.", "timestamp_updated": 1462648998, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1462648998, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "9833842", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503313", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1397625791, "steamid": "76561198068166433", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Pretty decent little puzzle game to kill time with.
