Coming out from Gogii games as its predecessor, the game narrates another chapter in the titular princess' life and her lifelong enmity with a witch.\n\nYears after princess' adventure and commotion with the witch, the curse returns to her land. It's been several years now that she's been happily living with her husband, and baby daughter Bella; but dark shadows summoned by the witch infiltrate the castle and abduct Bella. They had an unfinished business after all. Isabella takes on a journey throughout her kingdom this time, facing witch's forces, aiding townsfolk cursed by the said witch and searching for her beloved daughter. Will she prevail and return Bella to safety?\n\nThe game is a loveable continuation to the series, with beautiful background art, hand drawn characters and fairytale design. Game being old, you shouldn't expect a miracle about resolutions though. In tone, it is somewhat childish and carries the nativity of the first game. This time, we are also capable of observing the realm of Isabella a bit more closely, weaved from countless European fairytale references. Our fairy companion - who is also happened to be Bella's godmother - is also present to accompany our quest just like old days, alongside a dragon hatchling named Nessie who joins us just recently. They both have different abilities and interaction options to aid you in your quest.\n\nHOG scenes are quite basic and items are distinguishable despite the age of our graphics. Puzzles are various and a bit more of a challenge compared to the previous game, but item collection is all over the place. Due to your companions' various abilities getting unlocked in a timely manner, you'll keep revisiting different locations over and over again to harvest previously unreachable items. The HOG show down with the AI is still our preferred end game boss battle. Oh, and the ending isn't your usually happily ever after; rather a plot hook for the third game to come.\n\nIn the end, I'd recommend the game if you've played the first one and curious about what is to happen to Isabella. It's not a marvelous HOG, but a pretty little casual adventure game with an enjoyable story outline that would present you 2 hours of game time.

The map is helpful and you can teleport to any area, as well as see which areas you have cleared. \n\nI encountered no bugs whatsoever and the game was very enjoyable.

It also has two modes. Normal mode caters for players that are more casual.  The mode provides many hints, and important areas are always highlighted. Advanced mode on the other hand gives  the player almost no hints.\n\nThere has been some improvement over the first Princess Isabella game, particularly in the art and design of backgrounds.  The game\u2019s areas are more varied than its predecessors were.  And it\u2019s very nice that this time around the witch decided to curse more than just a castle with similarly styled rooms!  The ever-changing scenery also seems to have allowed this instalment to have more quirky characters than its predecessor does.  Although I\u2019m pretty sure those dwarves are living in a hobbit hole!\n\nThe only issue that arose for me when playing this game, as that I came to a puzzle that did not seem to let me manipulate the parts needed to complete it.  Going back to title menu did not fix this.  However, I found that changing the game between screen modes (Fullscreen, Widescreen and Windowed), seemed to allow the game to work out better where the mouse cursor was placed.  So, there is an easy fix if you are to run into this issue.\nI would recommend this game to people who enjoy these types of games.
