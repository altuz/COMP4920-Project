Not for the faint of heart! But if you are a hardcore gamer, and willing to put some time on it, you will be rewarded by the best strategic/tactical games out there. If you are a student of military history, you will get totally addicted to Ageod games. I barely play anything else. Also by far the best gamers community out there. Friendly, polite, and very welcoming to new unexperienced players. What can I say? If you want to experience what decisions a commander had to take back then, my suggestion is to give these games a go. Totally addicted to this company's games. I started with Alea Jacta Est, then Rise of prussia, then Revolution under siege and American Civil War II and never looked back. AGEOD in my opinion makes the best military games out there. Can be a bit daunting to start with (first time I got AJE I couln't figure out what the hell was going on) but if you are willing to put some time into it (the AGEOD forums are absolutely amazing for beginners tips!) you will be rewarded by the absolutely best PG wargame experience out there. I especially recommend Narwhal and Loki's AAR as well as the excellent Charles Cummings and Gilmer youtube tutorials. Totally addicted to this games, as a passionate student of history, I can't play anything else these days!", "timestamp_updated": 1497829175, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1497829175, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 6, "review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 6}}
