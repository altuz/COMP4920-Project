Full of wit, wackiness and wonder, the Pajama Sam series (apart from Atari's infamous fourth game) oozes with character from every pore. Being a Humongous adventure game, it's part point-and-click and part Living Book, with tons of animations even adults will enjoy wasting their time with.\n\nThese games aren't just too good for children. They're too good for adults. They are too pure for this wretched world. Atari tried to taint them with Life is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff and they failed. You don't deserve these games.

After playing the games I can only say - what a shame that I didn't have them as a kid! I'm positive I would fall in love with them, because they have everything you want from a kids' game - a good message, funny and memorable characters (especially Sam who's just the cutest kid ever), an environment you can interact with, minigames and, surprisingly, very smart sense of humour. If you have children, I stongly recommend that you play Pajama Sam series with them, and if not - just try it yourself, it may very well return you to your own childhood.
