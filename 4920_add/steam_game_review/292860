In this game, Sam has to clean up his room so he imagines finding all of his stuff by going through various worlds he has visited in the first two games along with some new worlds exclusive for this game. Otto the Boat & King the Mine Cart from the first game return along with the Forklift from the second game. While the only new characters are Rosie the sled and Trigger the wagon. So the game has a bit of old and new concepts mixed together for this spin-off. Its an arcade style game containing 100 levels of a slide scrolling level where you collect points, power ups, and items while avoiding obstacles. There's even bonus items to collect in order to do a choice of three different bonus levels for additional points. The only flaw I have with this game is that sometimes its hard to know how far you need to jump over an obstacle. But its a flaw I can look past while playing this game. The best way to beat this game is either writing done the codes for each level or the option to skip levels you feel is too hard to trek through.

After arriving under his bed, they were suddenly in a river. Sam leapt onto a boat, and then a wonderful German voice greeted me. After this point, my 32-core, 50 TB computer with 24 GTX 780 Ti's with Liquid Nitrogen cooling seemed to be having a panic. Weird sounds began to spew out, and then... BANG.
