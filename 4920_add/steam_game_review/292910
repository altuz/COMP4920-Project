Deponia is must play for anyone who likes classic puzzle adventures. \nMain character Rufus is very chatty and chaotic, and if you dont like him from start its alright. But his lazy, self-centered, and stupid personality will probably grow on you, and you will be curious what next catastrophe he will bring on others and himself. And he definitely has a bit of a good heart, that allows you to like him, or at least pity him. But you will probably pity everyone around him, so there will be nothing left for Rufus.\nPuzzles tend to be hard from beggining and easier later, maybe depending on how you get used to games logic, but almost always they make some sense. So you need to use walkthrough very rarely. Of course you need to think hard and use your imagination and association capabilities to maximum, and you will be stuck sometimes, but I think its worth of feeling your own success.\nStory is pretty straightforward in its core, but with a lot of complications and sidetracks along the way. So brace yourself for a short (50 hours), but very eventful ride, that will feel like a weeks in the end. I would like to be more specific, sadly I fear of spoiling something even in general sense, so I will restrain myself from that. It is a well-thoughtout, humorous story, with good ideas, and some surprises, easy to remember characters and funny interactions between them. I noticed some people didnt like the ending, but I believe it was decent, and the sequel \"Deponia Doomsday\" addressed it very well.\nI definitely can recommend this game.\n\nOh, and I want to give a shout out to artists on this project, because game looks visually amazing, with a lot of details, consistent theme and functional composition. It was pleasure to look at all the work they have done.", "timestamp_updated": 1506509077, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506509077, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35135501", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503927", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506817516, "steamid": "76561198207750853", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Deponia is a great Point and Click Story game by Daedalic which is actually from germany.\nThe protagonist alone is absolutely priceless.Rufus is a lazy bastard who doesn't fit in the role he's in.\nRufus is going through a lot of hilarious scenarios through out the four games.There's romance,action,comedy everything you need to make a good story.And that's what i became in the end : A great movie that you play through,laugh at and maybe even cry a bit which is a appropriate reaction in some parts in this game(and no im not gonna spoil you).\nDeponia is a perfect example for a good point and click adventure and i recommend it to everyone who likes story based games and likes to puzzle around a bit.\n\n(Deponia Doomsday which is the fourth installment of Deponia doesn't follows the exact storyline of the first three games which isn't a bad thing.It's still pretty good and was also a little reliever for the community XD)", "timestamp_updated": 1506107636, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506107636, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35173140", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1506399561, "steamid": "76561198004330418", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 138}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very catchy and monty pythonesque game", "timestamp_updated": 1506240537, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506237217, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "35037533", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463834", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1505674431, "steamid": "76561198132142450", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I only played like an hour so I guess I can't really talk much, but I just kinda went \"meh.\" It didn't give me a good enough reason to continue and I know i didn't play long enough to form a good review, but I was not drawn into within the first hour, and so I felt a little underwhelmed.", "timestamp_updated": 1505702745, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505702745, "votes_down": 20}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 493, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "review_score": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "total_negative": 94, "total_reviews": 587}}
