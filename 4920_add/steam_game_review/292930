A lot of it is \"hidden object\" type of gaming and the objects are sometimes unfairly hidden IMHO. But something about the old style of this game makes it even more creepy, possibly more than the next two in some ways.\n\nBM II and III were produced around the same time and are more modernized, with better graphics. They are a bit more fair and a walkthrough is not quite as necessary as with the first. The protagonist can be somewhat unlikeable if you don't like happy-go-lucky drifter kids with Boston accents. There's an option in BM II and III where you can show all clickable areas on the screen.\n\nOverall good stories and puzzles, and a bit of a sense of humor. But mostly these are mysterious games where you are constantly looking for something, or someone. The endings of BM I and II are  very good, the ending for BM III is of course more final but also somehow less satisfying than you would expect (given we are dealing with dark magic stuff it feels pretty made-up.)", "timestamp_updated": 1505568283, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505568283, "votes_down": 0}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 98, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "review_score": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 38, "total_reviews": 136}}
