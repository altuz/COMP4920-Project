What I can't overlook, however, is being 11+ hours in and having my saves corrupted for no apparent reason. I see this has happened to other users as well. I can't imagine I've just been lucky all these years and it's never happened before playing any other PC games, until AntharioN. I was willing to trudge through the mundane gameplay to the very end. But this? No way. I have two save files, both junk, both completely \"blacked out\" as other reviewers have mentioned. No chance of a refund now either for this \"broken\" game. It's becoming increasingly more difficult to support small indie teams with the dumpster fire that is Steam Greenlight, early-access promises that are never fulfilled, and abandoned games like this.
