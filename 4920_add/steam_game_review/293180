It's concept and style is one I really like, and I think it had potential. However, it's issues were that it's gunplay was awful as aiming was perfetic with nothing but a slight zoom to increase it. It's story (espcially towards the end) was just senseless and didn't feel like it really cared for itself. The game has an insane amount of blur and film grain, that it is sometimes impossible to see anything. Animations sometimes literally don't happen! And most importantly, it is SO DAMN HARD. Trying to hit anything often fails and reloading is a long pain. The enemies are way to overpowered and kill you in one hit, and they often come in large numbers at high speeds. You'll often be replaying these levels, learning the enemy's attack patterns and spawn areas to get an advantage, which just becomes repetitive.\n\nNot to mention, the jumpscares aren't appreciated.\n\nHowever, the game did do somethings right. For example, it's enviroment and artstyle is beautiful. Never have I seen a game create such a vivid and dark world. It's music is very fitting for the story it's telling and it's sounds are outright creepy and well costructed. Level design isn't bad, although not knowing where to go next was a common thing to happen. The game creates a great atmosphere and becomes immensly creepy when it wants to, unfortunately, this is often followed by a terrible, cheap jumpscare. In fact, this game has possibly the worst jumpscares I have ever to experienced. They're just a loud noise with a bright light without warning, and it's scary, yes, but not appreciated. At least  jumpscares from a game like Outlast were well done.\n\nSo why could I possibly be recommending this game? Well, if you can overlook it's flaws, and yes, that'll be harder than the bloody game itself, but if you can, it is a scary horror game with good pacing, and a brilliant atmosphere. For such a cheap price, I can only recommend this just so you can make your opinion on wether you thought this game was worth 79p.\n\nIt tries, and does what it can to impress you. It may not be a masterpiece of horror, but it's well worth the GB of hard drive space and your hard-earned 79p.", "timestamp_updated": 1502230427, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502230427, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "34172647", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1437230237, "steamid": "76561197990702256", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "''I Think this is the best soundtrack in a game especially for a indie and horror game'' \nThe game pretty good and is spooky.", "timestamp_updated": 1502470929, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1502470929, "votes_down": 0}, {"recommendationid": "33795953", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498003", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1449234602, "steamid": "76561198059232899", "num_games_owned": 981, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "This is my favourite game, it makes me happy, it makes me sad, it makes me scared!
