But it's still fun, challenging, and forgiving at the same time.\n\nHere's a quick look I did of the game. Feel free to skip around to get a general idea of the game and what you'll be getting into. Or you can simply read my summary below.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/UCpTb8dBmkg\n\nI'll start off by saying it's got a good atmosphere to go along with what it is. The basic premise is that you're an anti-virus program defending off viruses, and the visuals and music that accompany it fit their their roles well to put you into that world.\n\nThe basic gameplay is simple. You have lanes of creeps that mindlessly run into your core. The bare bones of all TD games. However, the game isn't as simple as plopping down a tower and forgetting about it. You have to allocate a limited pool of power to to each tower, and the more you give it, the stronger it is. So you're always frantically shifting your defenses around as the waves progress. That means you aren't staring at the screen and letting the game play itself, which is always a good thing. You also have to click little cubes and diamonds for ressources to upgrade and build your stuff, so you always have to be on the lookout for those. The game even grants you a free limited-time tower to help clean up some of the creeps that make it through, which is also nice. Nobody likes banging your head against the keyboard as the final creep runs into the core with only a sliver of health, ruining your perfect run.\n\nThe music is also good, if repetitive, but that's kind of what techno is all about. I also really enjoy the fact that the music changes as you add power to different towers, and that when the tower themselves fire, they also add to the beat. It's almost as if you're remixing the song yourself.\n\nBut now let's talk about some of the negatives. While the game does give you a good tutorial to get you started, it doesn't do a good job explaining the newer things you get later on down the line. It's all about trail and error. You also have no idea how much of a difference you're making when you upgrade a tower or give it power. You get a visual cue that the range has increased, but not about how much extra power you're giving it. A percentage or something would be nice to have. Also, the game kept on sending in new enemies at me that I had no idea how to deal with properly. The first being a big cube that only slows down when you constantly hit it with something. But the only thing that constantly fires is the free tower that's on a long cooldown. You also have to control it manually, so you can't allocate resources or build new things until you've finished dealing with the threat. Then the game snowballs into something you can't recover from, so you have to start over. \n\nThen there's the problem of not knowing how effective a certain tower is against a certain enemy type. I got a tower that was supposed to be effective against shielded enemies, but when they came, even at full power it wasn't that great. And when you start throwing other normal minions into the mix, you're never sure what tower you should prioritze over another as they enemies bum-rush you from all directions. And not only that, it's extremely frustrating when the tower that's effective against certain types chooses to fire at another enemy, and the one it's supposed to kill struts by unscathed. There needs to be some sort of target priority.\n\nBut yeah, all of that is only a problem if you're OCD like me and want a perfect score. There's plenty of lives you can leak before you get a game over and have to retry.\n\nSo in summary, this is a solid TD game at $3. The game offers good content, a variety of enemy types, keeps you engaged constantly in what's going on, interesting setting and music (if you like techno), and is genreally just a good time waster. Get it now, or even wait for a sale when this game won't cost more than a dollar.
