Best of all, it's free, and its microtransactions aren't necessary to win the game.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nIf [i]Dungeons & Dragons[/i] were played as a board game with decks of cards to resolve combat, the result would be [i]Card Hunter[/i]. The gear that your characters equip determine what cards go in their deck. At the start of each encounter, your party of characters and their enemies are deployed on the board, and each of them is given a hand of cards from their deck. The player and the Game Master alternate playing a card from their hands to move across the board, execute a melee attack, or cast spells. When both of them pass without playing any card, the turn ends. If there are any hands with more than two cards, these must be discarded down to two, and two new cards are drawn from their respective decks to form a new set of hands. Play continues until the player or the Game Master attains their victory condition.\n\nThere is no perma-death in this game, so even if your entire party gets killed, you can always start over with the same party if you want to.\n\n[b]My Evaluation[/b]\nUsing cards instead of dice to resolve actions is nothing short of brilliant. This game mechanic adds a level of planning that would not be possible with dice alone. If you enjoy turn-based tactical combat in a D&D-like setting, [i]Card Hunter[/i] may be for you. This game doesn't come with an emotionally engaging story (not that you should expect one), but you may appreciate the geek humor that this game has in spades.\n\nNote that [i]Card Hunter[/i] has microtransactions, but they really aren't necessary to win.
