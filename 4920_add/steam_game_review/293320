Boring. Full of padding. Abandonned episodic. \n\nNon stop lore-dump while going through boring corridors. As if they only had a few ideas for locations and they just cut down your walking speed and expanded the corridors. Additionally they reduced on-screen visibility and there is a short distance draw. Along with the constant re-use of assets this makes the game absolutely disorienting, very easy to get turned around and go in circles forever. Game ends very aprutly as the story just starts getting established. There is no real connection between the level design and the narration of the lore. Gameplay just involves shifting levers and going down correct doors. Might be a few jumpscares here and there but those are rather rare and not very scary. Game obviously hints at more content so either this game is unfinished or it is abandonned episodic format but aside from the concept for the game the execution itself was no fun and I am removing it for declutter.", "timestamp_updated": 1504055097, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1504055082, "votes_down": 2}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 93, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "review_score": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_negative": 109, "total_reviews": 202}}
