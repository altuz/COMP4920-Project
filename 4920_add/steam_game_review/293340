However in reality, the game is so shallow that these descriptions are bordering on false advertising and misrepresentation. I'll briefly explain how the description provided is just barely met by the reality of what the game actually gives you.\n\nDo you build a commercial empire? Well, you do have a box that pops up occasionally to allow you to buy property. But that is the end of it, no further interaction from the player. I wouldn't call it management at all since you cannot even set a charge for renting these properties or influence them at all. What these do is function as bonus cash after you taxi clients from port to port. This brings me nicely onto the boating business aspect. \n\nWhen someone says the game is about running a business, there are some key elements required for that to really apply. Budgets, marketing, customer relations and employee relations are the core things which come to mind.  Well, The Good Life does require you work to a budget but everything else is absent. You apparently have employees because boats you own, but don't personally use, generate income like your other investments. But again, you don't actually influence any of that. Essentially your 'empire' consists of you personally picking up customers and taking them from A to B. Now this wouldn't really be too bad since games like Crazy Taxi actually made this kind of thing enjoyable but sailing empty waters in largely straight lines gets dull very fast and the highlight of the journey is the challenge of docking the boat without damaging it. One of the biggest mistakes the developers made is to give you the slowest boat in the game at the start and not explain that they can instantly buy a speed-boat instead. The developers should have simply provided the speed boat right away to avoid frustrating players.\n\nThe description also says that this has exploration, treasure hunting and other activities. Well, since you cannot ever leave your boat the exploration is limited to looking at islands from the coast and while the diving sections do allow you to very slowly move around freely, there is only 1 small map which is used for every diving mini-game. There is fishing, but it is a mini-game that just generates some more cash and isn't profitable or serve any purpose in the larger scope of the game. There isn't any complexity to fishing other than pushing the up and down arrows keys to reel the line in or loosen it to stop the line from breaking. There are other trivial events which happen at random as well. Such as tossing life-preservers to rescue people in the water, the occasional pirate speed-boat for you to avoid and the laughable 'tornadoes' which appear from time to time. But none of these are very interesting.\n\nI can honestly say that while The Good Life sounds good on paper; what it gives you is a shadow of what it promises. Paying money for this game would be a big mistake even if it was on sale due to the limited entertainment value and what basically boils down to as leveling system where you invest time and energy to just see your bank balance grow. It lacks personality, a sense of progression or achievement and it just barely manages to even qualify as a game at all, due to how shallow the content is.", "timestamp_updated": 1417283553, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1417283553, "votes_down": 29}, {"recommendationid": "13069593", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 110, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607327", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1416876995, "steamid": "76561198025901680", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 16, "review": "I really wanted to like this game.

It looks like they are shooting yellow nerf balls at you.  They are terrible shots and it dosen't even affect the strategy of the game much.

You spend most your time transporting people from island to island (for a fee), while acquiring the money to help build your tourist industry empire (via bidding on properties that pay rent). There are also missions that have you skin diving to collect treasure and find downed vintage helicopters, etc... You also have the opportunity to fish (which I have yet to get the full hang of). As you gain money and property, you also gain reputation. And yes, you can buy different boats and so on as you increase your funds (and it is all fairly open ended). The game apparently ends when (you go broke or) you drive all of your competitors out of business. Haven't got to that point yet...  :)\n\nThe game takes a little getting used to as far as the controls, but its smooth sailing (sorry) once you do. There are some minor issues that the developer is on top of and he has already released a patch addressing some of them and adding improvements (literally acknowledging the individual players who suggested them). He is very engaged on the \"discussions\" board and obviously, is very open to those of us who have made suggestions. THIS is the kind of communication that you hope for from a developer! \n\nI'm really excited about the possibilities that might be included and the tweaks that will be made.

I do have a very nice boat now, wouldn't want to lose it or get the green paint scratched.\n\nIt is in the sale, (should that be sail ;-) ) at the moment; buy it now!", "timestamp_updated": 1431687047, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": "1", "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1431687047, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "13073770", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499357", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1417558257, "steamid": "76561197976032241", "num_games_owned": 785, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I really wanted to like this game. It's a budget title so I went in with what I think are fair expectations. The problems are fixable so I'll start with the good, end with the bad. Maybe they'll get fixed! Edit: The developers have noted that they're working on some of the negatives in my reveiw. This game is NOT shovelware, it's just rough. It's November now, if you're reading this review a few months from now, check the forums to see if my concerns have been fixed. Edit2: Pirate issues have been addressed. I can safely give this game a thumbs up. It's ROUGH, but still good if you like this kind of game.\n\nThe graphics are a mixed bag, the models for people are so bad, but it's not really a big deal because the game is about boats, water and scenery. I think they did a pretty good job on that although there is definitely some improvement with weather effects.\n\nI really liked the physics for waves. You can't just point your boat in a direction and go, you've got to be active on the helm like in a real boat.\n\nThe controls for everything except steering your boat are awful. Trying to aim when throwing life rings is nauseating. Trying to use the diving controls is a nightmare, fishing is confusing and unfun even once you know what you're supposed to do.\n\nThe random event generator is unbalanced, a random Hurricane is awesome. Two in a row is dumb.\nPirates, at least early in the game are a death sentence. I got two pirate events in a row before giving up on this game.\n\nEdit!!: Boat Damage has been addressed and fixed---\nBoat damage is economically crippling. A trip taking about 10 minutes might pay for 10% of your ship's damage. A single crash can cause that much, pirates might cause 50% damage. Damage also slows you down so good luck earning your way back to 100% health after a pirate hits you.\n\nEdited on 25 Nov 2014: Made a note that the developer has acknowledged some of these problems.\nEdit: 26 Nov 2014: Repair damage has been rebalanced and pirate areas are now marked. This was the thing that made me feel like the game was unplayable.

You are a water taxi transporting wealthy folk between a archipelago of islands. With money earned you can buy more boats and various property oppotunities that go up for sale during taxi missions. There is always things going on and happening during taxi missions which stops the game from getting boring and keeps it interesting, from pirates (which are right nasty bastards) to throwing life rings to drowning souls. The game can also be enhanced by playing the game with an erection. Its not perfect though, but has a nice balance. I like how the big boats which earn more are more difficult mooring than the small ones. All boats are available to buy at the start of the game, instead of incermentally so you can buy the best boats early on in the game whereas I would have liked to have worked on increasing my rank to get better boats. The AI players also start with a large amount of property and it will take some time on increaing your own portfolio before you are able to buy large amounts of property meaning the AI players will purchase it. The pre-set camera angles can also be awkward, but using my third hand I played this with an Xbox 360 Controller, mouse and keyboard at the same time. Even better as of writing the Dev is listening to players feedback to make improvements and releasing patches to improve the game.
