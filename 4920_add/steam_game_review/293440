The two things I didn't like both reminded me of games from my childhood in a bad way, but aren't really issues with the game itself...\n\nFirst, only the d-pad on my [pc] Xbox 360 controller works. This makes it feel like I am holding a tiny NES gamepad in my adult hands that want to be holding something comfortably after being used to earn wages all night. Obviously this also has something to do with my controller, but I was not pleased about d-pad movement.\n(The game has since been rebuilt, so the d-pad issue has ostensibly been fixed)\n\nSecond, getting stuck in an area and needing to start a new game after playing for a few hours because I happened to go there before getting the fireball spell. To the credit of the game, it did not take nearly as long to recover and it was pretty fun after getting used to the d-pad...if a bit tedious, which still caused me to not take the game back up.\n\nNow that the game has been tightened up with a rebuild, I'll definitely revisit it and recommend it to anyone who enjoys retro-style metroidvanias.\n", "timestamp_updated": 1494267239, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1494267239, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "31721230", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504904", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1497102322, "steamid": "76561198029294992", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "So im playing the game after the full remake, and i can absolutely say this game is fantastic, the Zelda 2 vibes are very strong but with much better mechanics.

In fact, some of the music is so similar I'm surprised they weren't sued by Nintendo. \n\nThe good: Really nice pixel art by Luis Zuno. I highly recommend checking out his youtube channel. The game also has very nice, tight controls.\n\nThe bad: The game is difficult. And not in a fun way. It starts off at a really enjoyable and rewarding level of challenge, but about halfway through it abruptly switches to overpowered enemies and constant instadeaths. The story also blows. Normally I wouldn't really comment on that, because no one plays a game like this for the story. But this game makes you constantly sit through a bunch of boring cut scenes and read droll, emo rubbish.\n\nNot the worst game I've ever played by any means, but it really feels like a beta that needs a lot more work and refinement.", "timestamp_updated": 1495301370, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1495301370, "votes_down": 5}, {"recommendationid": "31649507", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481132", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1494266562, "steamid": "76561197983353237", "num_games_owned": 1284, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 4419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of the most under appreciated platformers/metroidvanias.
