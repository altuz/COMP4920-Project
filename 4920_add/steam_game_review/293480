So why am I recommending it?\n\nEssentially, I just really respect what the developer was trying to do here. He made the sort of ambitious game that, in an age of nostalgia-bait 2D platformers and terrible Unity FPS games, is utterly refreshing. Its the sort of game every developer wants to make, but none have the drive to do. Its big, its beautiful even despite the game breaking glitches, and while I'll never be able to experience any of this game, somehow or another I can't bear to uninstall it, and am wishing to try again as I type this. It reminds me of the days of the days of games like Braid, Fez and Dust, games made by a small team with a lot of ambition.\n\nTL;DR this game is a broken, unplayable mess, but it makes me nostalgic and somehow or another I have faith in the developer.\n\nRating: if you have 15 bucks its worth a look, I think", "timestamp_updated": 1493174816, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1493174762, "votes_down": 1}, {"recommendationid": "32857416", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499482", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1450028720, "steamid": "76561197993329462", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a broken hot mess that will never be fixed or finished, avoid like the plague.", "timestamp_updated": 1498574376, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498574376, "votes_down": 14}, {"recommendationid": "33062532", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498765", "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1500868041, "steamid": "76561198043574296", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've been following this game for years and love the main dev on it as he is trying to make an outstanding game mainly by himself.  I give him serious props for that.  Yes, the game is probably in too early of stages to be on Steam (like how I strugged to figure out how my inventory worked), but it still works just as well.  At the moment, it is mainly a walking simulator, but has awesome graphics (aside from the character models) and has so much potential.  I will be continuing to support this game and am super excited to see what the dev comes up with next.  Just give it a chance.  If you expect a polished game, then put it on your wishlist and buy later, otherwise, I strongly recommend it.", "timestamp_updated": 1498870427, "written_during_early_access": true, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1498870427, "votes_down": 3}, {"recommendationid": "33150006", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475591", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1437048472, "steamid": "76561197984600843", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Will probably never be released as a \"finished\" game.
