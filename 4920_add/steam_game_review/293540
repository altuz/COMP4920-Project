It's because it's dead.\nI saw this game on launch, but since I had a toaster at the time, I didn't play it. Once I finally got a little more than a toaster, I was looking at the F2P section and saw this. Because I never got to play it before, I decided to give it a go, even though the reviews weren't the best. What I found was a solid game. Obviously not finished, but solid nonetheless. It was really fun, until I realised that the grand total of people on at that time was: 23. Sadly, yes, that was the truth. I found out because I was wondering why I was fighting the same people over and over. Even though the servers are up, it's going down the road that many other F2P multiplayer games on Steam have gone; inevitable extinction. So yes, this game was good, and still is, but no one is playing it anymore. Rest in pieces  to another indie game by and obscure company, falling into the abyss of forgotten games.\n\nTL;DR I can't recommend this game since it's sadly dead.", "timestamp_updated": 1487055929, "written_during_early_access": false, "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1486879907, "votes_down": 2}, {"recommendationid": "29415721", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_up": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500618", "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "author": {"last_played": 1482732390, "steamid": "76561198158770502", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Even though the game is free, I honestly don't see wasting your time in playing a dead game.
